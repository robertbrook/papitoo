that the noble Baroness has produced. They are indeed horrendous. I
willingly pay tribute to Michael Brown. I hope that the actions the
Home Secretary has taken today are a worthy tribute to the suffering
that Clare Wood endured. I pay tribute to the noble Baroness’s
commitment to this issue and share her interest in ensuring that these
projects are a success. The Government have ring-fenced £40
million of funding over the lifetime of this Parliament to help
front-line organisations tackle violence against women and girls. We

that we are taking part in a study, which this morning had a meeting in
the House of Commons and heard from many witnesses? In particular, I
mention Professor Liz Kelly, who has written a paper on this very
important subject. It brought out that one of the worst situations is
coercive control, which is the type of thing we have had with the
slavery issue recently. Apparently the most dangerous point with
coercive control is when the person who has been intimidated or
brainwashed—all sorts of possible things have been
used—says that she is going to go. That is apparently when the
police record quite a number of deaths. Will my noble friend ensure
that Professor Liz Kelly’s paper is taken into consideration in

assurance. Indeed, I look forward to hearing more from her on this

in a society where people should be free to enter into emotional

never be used to enforce a

probably know that there are multi-agency risk assessment conferences
at which these matters are discussed at grassroots implementation
level. We are well aware that a broad spread of people has an interest
in making sure that these policies are effectively delivered on the
ground. The Government are ensuring that all those involved are
properly informed of the most effective way of dealing with this. So
much of this has lain undercover—almost under the carpet. What
we in this Government—and indeed, I think, in this

there has been a call for a much wider look at the issue, particularly
at how the police and state agencies respond, coming both from Refuge
and Women’s Aid—organisations which know a lot about the
subject. I have heard today comments in response to the announcement
that welcome the putting of responsibility on to the abused person.
That is a very dangerous attitude. I am sure that the Minister will
agree that it is unrealistic to create the expectation that somebody
should check on a partner’s background. Control and abuse may
grow very

will recognise that much of Clare’s law is about authorities
being open with a perpetrator’s possible history of abuse.
Alongside this, HMIC also has a role in setting up a special group to
check on capacity at police level to make sure that the police, who are
key to a lot of this, operate effectively in this

Naseby:</Member></B> My noble friend is right to remind the House of
what the Government have done so far. Nevertheless, is she not aware
that the broader high street, often owned by individuals or families,
has faced the most difficult four years certainly in this century and
probably since the last war? Is she further aware that the one element
that does not seem to change is the business rates, which each year go
up and up and are now well above rentals, which is the first time in
history that that has happened? Will she therefore look at some
short-term action, perhaps freezing the business rate for the year
2014-15, otherwise I fear that shops, particularly in the north and the
Midlands, will shut up shop? If action is taken, that will probably
mean more investment, more recruitment into the retail trade and will
probably be

businesses are the driving force behind future jobs and growth. As the
noble Lord, Lord Naseby, said, we know that many small business owners
face a cost of living crisis as high streets struggle, and that many
are under the pressures of rising business rates and energy bills.
There are some 40,000 empty shops in the UK and more than one in 10
small businesses say they spend the same or more on business rates as
on rents. While it is right that the UK has a competitive corporation
tax rate, does the Minister not accept that the priority now is to
direct more help to small and medium-sized businesses, as Ed Miliband
proposed, by cutting the 2015 business rate on 1.5 million
properties below the value of £50,000 and freezing it for 2016?
This would be paid for by not cutting further in 2015 corporation tax
for 80,000 larger companies and

robbing Peter to pay Paul because all businesses benefit from a
reduction in corporation tax. It is also worth reminding the noble Lord
that this Government have given local authorities powers to grant their
own business rate discounts. The local government sector now retains
50% of the business rates that are collected. If local authorities

Thornton (Lab):</Member></B> I thank the noble Lord for that Answer. I
have to say that it does not coincide with the information that I have,
which was produced by the House of Commons Library. Its analysis tells
us that, of the £14.4 billion George Osborne has raised through
additional net direct tax and benefit changes, about £11.4
billion—79%—is coming from women. This includes low-paid
new mums, who have lost nearly £3,000 in support during their
pregnancy and their baby’s first year; couples with children,
who have lost 9.7% of their disposable income; and single mothers, who
have lost the most—15.6%? Does the noble Lord think that that is

respects significantly misleading. For example, 98% of all child
benefit goes to women, but it is the whole household that benefits. The
single biggest improvement in the position of women under this
Government has come from the fact that there are 450,000 women now in
work who were not in work in 2010. This is as a result of the

already said, this Government are committed to preventing these
appalling crimes. Earlier this year we published, and we continue to
deliver, a cross-government strategy called Ending Violence Against
Women and Girls, and a supporting action plan that goes with it. This
includes our successful national campaigns particularly targeted at
teenagers to prevent rapes and abuse, which we will be rebuilding with
a relaunch early next month.</hs_para>

Minister for that reply. I refer specifically to the rape crisis
centres that I know the Government have given some support and funding
to, which of course is appreciated. However, the money which has been
given is short-term money. What plans do the Government have, and what
is in their strategy, to guarantee that they will give the funding to
ensure that these rape crisis centres can continue—not least
because local commissioning has changed, which has put them in
jeopardy? The Government really have to take some responsibility for
ensuring that these rape crisis centres can stay open. Alongside that,
are they giving any support for the training of the specialists who
provide support services within the rape crisis
centres?</hs_para>

Baroness’s interests and to the way in which she is pursuing
these matters. It is true to say that the Government want to improve
victims’ experience of the criminal justice system wherever they
interface with it, and to assure victims of these terrible crimes that
they will get the support that they need. That is why the Government
are currently providing £4 million for 77 rape crisis centres
across England and Wales. We hope that we are helping to build the
support which the noble Baroness seeks for the victims of sexual
assault and
rape.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T15:09:59"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para>

I mean that we should educate young men and boys not to use violence
against women and to learn how to honour and respect women. Could not

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> A lot can be done in schools and, of
course, a lot can be done outside schools by those people fortunate to
live in parental custody, and by parents themselves treating each other
with mutual respect. The Home Office has had—and I alluded to it
earlier—a very successful national teenage rape prevention
campaign, which was extended into a teenage relationship abuse
campaign, because it was recognised that rape was only one aspect of
the abuse that young females might suffer from young men. The figures
and responses show that these campaigns have struck home and have had a
real impact on young people’s relationships. That is why we are
intending to relaunch the campaign on, I think, 5 December. We feel
that that is the right way in which to go about
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T15:11:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Howarth of Breckland (CB):</Member></B> Would the Minister not
acknowledge that, while we have campaigns, they are not a replacement
for education? This is a cultural problem. We hear on the radio that
women cyclists are being harassed by men, not only for being cyclists
but for being women. We know that young men, brought up in difficult
households, are more likely to see domestic abuse, and that those who
see domestic abuse are, according to the research programme from Arnon
Bentovim, more likely to be engaged in rape and the harm of women.
Surely it goes back to the noble Baroness’s point that, unless
we tackle this in the school curriculum at the educational level, no
amount of campaigns will make any
difference<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T15:12:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112512000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0001.htm#13112512000048"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Taylor of Holbeach" PimsId="5065" UID="13112512000337" xid="1920" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0001.htm#13112512000337">Lord

it if is paid within a shorter period; I imagine that it is anticipated
that that would be seven days. It seems to me that 14 days is a very
short period. I am not in this amendment seeking to argue the merits or

<?notus-xml column=1189?>otherwise of either of the orders but we do not want them to come into
disrepute through there being difficulties in their application. Some
people go away on holidays, not realising that a notice may have become
payable, because they might not actually have been handed it. There are
a number of reasons why 14 days for payment is in many areas regarded
as on the short
side<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T15:18:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

amendment relates to the amount of time that an individual issued with
a fixed penalty notice should be given to pay. Where breach of a
community protection notice or of a condition of a public spaces
protection order has occurred, the offender could be issued with a
fixed penalty notice. Payment of this penalty notice discharges the
perpetrator from any other proceedings for that breach and so they are,
quite rightly, given a period of grace in which to pay the amount
specified. Different fixed penalty notice schemes have different
periods during which recipients are expected to pay the penalty; for
example, littering is set at 14 days whereas others have a longer time.
In this case we believe that 14 days is sufficient time for a
perpetrator to pay that amount and that it provides the right balance
between giving the offender enough time to pay the fine and ensuring
that the process for collecting such money is both timely and
efficient.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112512000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0001.htm#13112512000060">In
terms of Amendment 22QV, I have listened to the case made by my noble

language used in the Bill is, of course, commonly used elsewhere on the

Environmental Protection Act 1990 in relation to fixed penalty notices
under that Act. In effect it avoids the chief finance officer having to
come to court to give evidence personally that he or she had signed the
certificate. Despite that provision, it remains a matter for the court
to decide what weight to place upon the document as evidence, although
in practice it is highly unlikely that the issue of whether the
document is genuine will ever be an issue. I have heard the case that
my noble friend has made, but the Government feel that on balance the
14 days and, as has been stated, the signature of the chief finance

such as the Localism Bill and the Growth and Infrastructure Bill, now
Acts of Parliament, felt that they were plagued with powers under which
the Secretary of State could tell local authorities in great detail

Specifically, Amendment 22QX probes the question of whether a parish

carry out some of these functions. I should make it clear that if the
amendment were agreed it would be entirely permissive and would require
the agreement of both the district and the town or parish council.
However, town councils and some parish councils already do a huge
amount of work on tackling local issues such as litter. It seems

the curve on this. I tried to contact the National Association of Local
Councils without success earlier today, so he has stolen a march on me.

his point that the issue is probably more specific to the next chapter

doubts about the capacity of parish and town councils to undertake
certain things and about whether that is an appropriate level at which
to deal with the issue. Whether the Minister feels that it is

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord Taylor of
Holbeach) (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, these amendments raise a number
of interesting points. Amendments 22QW and 22QY relate to the
provisions in the Bill which would allow local authorities to designate
others with the ability to use the new community protection notice. The
aim behind this provision is to ensure that the burden of dealing with
certain types of anti-social behaviour does not fall on just one
agency.</hs_para>

important that we strike a balance between the new flexibility and the
fact that this new notice incurs a criminal sanction on breach. While
subsection (1)(c) allows for the local authority to designate the
power, as a safeguard subsection (4) allows the Secretary of State to
say who this may include. As we have made clear over the past few
years, we believe that social landlords should have a role in dealing
with this type of anti-social behaviour. At present, they are the only
group that would be included in the order. With regard to who else is
going to be on the Home Secretary’s list, at present social
landlords are the only category of person but, over time, other groups
or bodies may express an interest and we will consider them on a
case-by-case
basis<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T15:39:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

makes clear the importance of partnership working, and ultimately the
local authority will be able to set the ground rules if it decides to
give a social landlord access to the new power. However, as many of
those landlords are already dealing with these issues and making
judgment calls daily on what is 
<?notus-xml column=1194?>reasonable or not, it seems sensible to give them a formal role in their
own communities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T15:39:41"></hs_TimeCode>.

to the new notice and for the safeguards and reasoning behind those
safeguards to have been included. I hope that my noble friend will not

22QX would add parish councils and Welsh community councils to the list
of bodies that can be designated by the relevant local authority to
issue CPNs. CPNs are a powerful tool and, as such, there needs to be
some control over the number of organisations that can issue them in
order to maintain consistency. As I said, a breach of a CPN is a
criminal offence and one needs experienced practitioners in their use.
We believe that local authorities, as defined in Clause 53, are the
right bodies to undertake this role. As with public spaces protection
orders, we do not believe that parish councils should be able to hear
them. However, I have been interested in the debate that has gone on
between the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, and my noble friend Lord Greaves
on this issue. If we are to extend the role to include parish councils,
we need evidence to effect such a change, and we would need to be
absolutely certain that it was in the best interests of making
effective use of these new

22QYA would allow the local authority to restrict the use of community
protection notices where it designates the power to another person or

possible as the provisions are drafted, and we shall seek further to
clarify that in the guidance. We would expect that, in designating the
power to social landlords, local authorities would use a memorandum of
understanding to agree boundaries on the use of the notice and local

raised by my noble friend on Amendments 22QYB and 22QYC relating to the
level of training that those issuing the notice will receive, including
police community support officers. I have made it clear that this is a
highly responsible activity and that training is important. I assure my
noble friend that the kind of judgment calls being made here, and being
made daily by social landlords, PCSOs, council staff and police
officers, are a feature of current implementation of anti-social
behaviour measures. What is unreasonable is how behaviour affects
victims and communities and when it is right to go down the formal
intervention route. However, we would expect there to be training on
the new powers and the impact assessments that we have published
include the cost of training. That covers the police, including all
PCSOs, social landlords and local authority staff. It is not for
Ministers in Whitehall—this is a theme going through the whole
Bill—to mandate what levels of training are required to deal
with local issues. As such I cannot guarantee exactly what training
officers will receive, but I expect that police forces, social
landlords and local authorities will see the benefits of the effective
use of this new power and train their staff accordingly. I hope that I

the reactor, or transfer fuel or heavy water to the reactor site, or

agreement means that the elements of Iran’s nuclear programme
that are thought to present the greatest risk cannot make progress
during the six-month 
<?notus-xml column=1198?>period of the interim agreement. In other words, if Iran implements the
deal in good faith, as it has undertaken to do, it cannot use these
routes to move closer to obtaining a nuclear weapons capability.
Moreover, some of the most dangerous elements of Iran’s
programme are not only frozen but actually rolled back; for instance,
the agreement involves the eradication of around 200
kilograms of 20% enriched uranium in UF6 form that Iran has been
building up and stockpiling for several years.</hs_para>

these commitments Iran will receive proportionate, limited sanctions
relief from the United States and the European Union. For its part, the
United States will pause efforts to reduce crude oil sales to
Iran’s oil customers, repatriate to Iran some of its oil revenue
held abroad, suspend sanctions on the Iranian auto industry, allow the
licensing of safety-related repairs and inspections for certain Iranian
airlines, and establish a financial channel to facilitate humanitarian
and legitimate trade, including for payments to international
organisations and for Iranians studying
abroad.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112512000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0001.htm#13112512000107">It is
proposed that the EU and US together will suspend sanctions on
oil-related insurance and transport costs, which will allow the
provision of such services to third states for the import of Iranian
oil. We will also suspend the prohibition of the import, purchase or
transport of Iranian petrochemical products, and suspend sanctions on
Iranian imports of gold and precious metals. But core sanctions on
Iranian oil and gas will remain in place. It is intended that the EU
will also increase by an agreed amount the authorisation thresholds for
financial transactions for humanitarian and non-sanctioned trade with
Iran. The Council of Ministers of the European Union will be asked to
adopt legislation necessary to amend these sanctions, and the new
provisions would then apply to all EU member
states.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112512000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0001.htm#13112512000108">The
total value of the sanctions relief is estimated at $7 billion over the
six-month period. There will be no new nuclear-related sanctions
adopted by the UN, EU and US during this six-month period. However, the
bulk of international sanctions on Iran will remain in place. This
includes the EU and US oil embargo which restricts globally oil
purchases from Iran, and sanctions on nuclear, military or ballistic
missile-related goods and technology. It includes all frozen revenue
and foreign exchange reserves held in accounts outside Iran and
sanctions on many Iranian banks, such as the Central Bank of Iran,
which means that all Iranian assets in the US and EU remain frozen
apart from the limited repatriation of revenue under this agreement.
Iranian leaders and key individuals and entities will still have their
assets in the EU and US frozen and be banned from travelling to the EU
and US, and tough financial measures, including a ban from using
financial messaging services and transactions with European and US
banks, also remain in place. These sanctions will not be lifted until a
comprehensive settlement is reached, and we will enforce them robustly.
This ensures that Iran still has a powerful incentive to continue to
negotiate to reach a comprehensive settlement—which is the third
aspect of the agreement on which I wish to update the House
today.</hs_para>

the elements of a comprehensive solution which we would aim to conclude
within one year. These elements include Iran’s rights and
obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and IAEA
safeguards; the full resolution of concerns related to the heavy water

the additional protocol; and co-operation on Iran’s civilian
nuclear programme. In return for full confidence on the part of the
international community that Iran’s programme is solely
peaceful, the plan of action envisages a mutually defined enrichment
programme with agreed parameters and limits, but only as part of a
comprehensive agreement where nothing is agreed until everything is
agreed. This comprehensive solution, if and when agreed, would lead to
the lifting of all UN Security Council sanctions as well as
multilateral and national sanctions related to Iran’s nuclear

this interim agreement was a difficult and painstaking process, and
there is a huge amount of work to be done to implement it.
Implementation will begin following technical discussions with Iran and
the IAEA and EU preparations to suspend the relevant sanctions, which
we hope will all be concluded by the end of January 2014. A joint
commission of the E3+3 and Iran will be established to monitor the
implementation of these first-step measures, and it will work with the

the fact that we have achieved for the first time in nearly a decade an
agreement that halts and rolls back Iran’s nuclear programme
should give us heart that this work can be done and that a
comprehensive agreement can be attained. On an issue of such
complexity, and given the fact that to make any diplomatic agreement
worth while to both sides has to involve compromises, such an agreement
is bound to have its critics and opponents. But we are right to test to
the full Iran’s readiness to act in good faith to work with the
rest of the international community and to enter into international
agreements. If<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T16:03:22"></hs_TimeCode>
it does not abide by its commitments, it will bear a heavy
responsibility, but if we did not take the opportunity to attempt such
an agreement, then we ourselves would have been guilty of a grave
error. It is true that if we did not have this agreement, the pressure
of sanctions on Iran would not be alleviated at all. But it is also
true that there would be no restraint on advances to its programme, no
check on its enrichment activity and stockpiles, no block on its
addition of centrifuges, no barrier to prevent it bringing into
operation its heavy water research reactor at Arak and no limitation on
the many actions which could take it closer to a nuclear weapons
capability.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112512000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0001.htm#13112512000112">The
bringing together of this agreement with all five permanent members of
the United Nations Security Council united behind it in itself sends a
powerful signal. While it is only a beginning, there is no doubt that
this is an important, necessary and completely justified step which,
through its restrictions on Iran’s nuclear programme, gives us
the time to negotiate a comprehensive settlement. I pay tribute to the
noble Baroness, Lady Ashton, to my Foreign Ministerial colleagues and
to our Foreign Office staff, who have played an indispensable role. We
will apply the same rigour and determination we have shown in these 
<?notus-xml column=1200?>negotiations to the implementation of the agreement and to the search
for a comprehensive settlement. At the same time we will continue to be
open to improvements in our bilateral relationship on a step-by-step

Triesman (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord
Wallace, for repeating the Statement made earlier in another place. I
believe that the agreement between Iran and the western powers,
increasing the likelihood that Iran will not build a nuclear weapon in
the near future, is of genuine significance. The next six months are,
then, of the utmost
importance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112512000116" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0001.htm#13112512000116">We
congratulate those who have been closely involved, especially Secretary
of State John Kerry, on what appear to have been months of discreet
diplomacy even before the events of this last few days, and my noble
friend Lady Ashton on her remarkable lead role in negotiations. She is
entitled to the warm thanks of this Parliament and this nation. Her
Majesty’s Government have plainly played a substantive
part—a part which I straightforwardly acknowledge, including the
role of the Foreign Secretary. I also join him in congratulating
officials in the FCO, of whom I have great memories, and my right
honourable friend Jack Straw, whose role in initiating some of these
steps was so
important.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112512000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0001.htm#13112512000117">It
is clear that what we have here are steps along a road. The whole
journey is very far from complete, and there is no guarantee that the
journey will be completed. None the less, the political momentum to
secure this interim deal is extremely important. I echo the Foreign
Secretary’s words about how we should approach the next part of
the
process—that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13112512000257" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0001.htm#13112512000257">“nothing

agreement has manifest limits. It results from a co-ordinated approach,
including the use of sanctions if real progress is not made for any
reason. Should we find that progress is not made, we must conclude that
those arrangements should continue—co-ordination, sustained
negotiation and sanctions would have to be deployed
again.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13112512000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0001.htm#13112512000118">The
agreement places constraints on Iran’s nuclear programme, in
return for which we ease financial sanctions. It sets limits on nuclear
aspirations and 
<?notus-xml column=1201?>makes provision for serious inspections. It does not halt the nuclear
programme, and although the inspectors are obviously to be more
intrusive, their rights to intrusion are not exhaustive. It does not
dismantle Iran’s nuclear capability. It cannot therefore
guarantee to bridle all future developments. I know that many will
argue that it should not, but I can see the basis of the anxieties in
Israel and the Gulf about this. It is important for us to encourage
them to give this process a chance, whatever those anxieties might
be.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112512000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0001.htm#13112512000119">To give it
a chance, it is essential to keep up pressure for a full, comprehensive
agreement. John Kerry’s sense of urgency in the last couple of
days is well placed: momentum in this is vital. Next, the ground rules
for the next steps need to be expressed. The Iranian nuclear ambitions
must be capped. The international community must have total,
unrestricted confidence in verification. No part of the programme can
remain hidden. There can be no “inalienable rights” to
enrich. These issues must form the bedrock of the work to come. To
achieve these bases, it would be helpful if Her Majesty’s
Government could answer some questions that I think may be of genuine
significance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112512000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0001.htm#13112512000120">Although
the agreement concedes daily access for the IAEA inspectors at Natanz

reservation, which was quite rightly included in his
Statement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T16:10:05"></hs_TimeCode>. What
steps will be taken to dismantle Fordo? That is not specifically
covered by the agreement, but is likely to prove vital if the world,
and in particular the region, is to feel confident about the most
deeply buried facility and the one that potentially offers the most
unrestrained danger. Does the agreement achieve IAEA inspector access
to Parchin, where it is generally thought that tests have been
conducted on the detonation mechanisms of a nuclear weapon?</hs_para>

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, my understanding is that
under a UN Security Council resolution, the noble Baroness was
designated as the co-ordinator for these negotiations. This has been an
EU exercise with the three largest Governments within the European
Union, in effect, representing the EU. The noble Baroness has to some
extent represented the interests of the other 25 member states and I

Williams of Crosby (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I add my thanks to the
Minister for repeating the Statement and, if I may say so, for his own
contribution to the work of the Foreign Office team, for the
outstanding work of the Foreign Secretary and Mr Kerry and, not least,
for the really great steps taken—one has to add this—by
the Iranian Foreign Secretary in trying to bring about an agreement,
with what was perhaps the significant support of the supreme ruler in
Iran. It is the outbreak of common-sense discussion, real wisdom and a
real desire to avoid war which has driven this remarkable agreement. I
say to my noble friend that this is a remarkable moment in history. Of
course, it is not the end but the beginning of a crucial set of steps
towards bringing Iran back into the comity of nations and enabling us
to produce a new structure that will give both the IAEA and the
protection from nuclear proliferation an extremely important new
impetus.</hs_para>

other word, which is that I hope that the naysayers of this
world—those who are likely to oppose this agreement—will
recognise that the alternatives are terrible ones. They are in either
military action or going back to absolute chaos in the Middle East. At
a time when many of us are grieving over the terrible cost of the
invasion of Iraq and, for that matter, the long war in Afghanistan,
this is a moment when we should recognise the achievement of diplomacy
and sensible discussion, as distinct from attempts to threaten other
countries.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13112512000139" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0001.htm#13112512000139">I

<?notus-xml column=1204?>out of this agreement that would so massively strengthen the battle
against proliferation of nuclear weapons. I ask my noble friend whether
the addition of the concept of enhanced monitoring that has come out of
this agreement is one that, in his own view, could be extended more
readily throughout the whole nuclear proliferation issue, along with
the remarkable steps taken by the IAEA towards a much more powerful
regime, including in effect the additional protocol, which up till now
Iran has not been willing to

second question is whether the creation of the so-called committee of
the E3 plus 3 with Iran might enable us to begin to build the first of
new relationships with this isolated but intensely important country,
which will enable it to make a serious contribution to the Syrian civil
war. In that context, there are cultural, religious and economic links
that could be made with Iran that would help to bring it in from the
cold and build on the hopeful measures towards a more open and
democratic Iran, as we have seen in the past few

prove to have been a remarkable moment in history, but we do not yet

they were biting in Iran have played a major part in shifting opinions
in the Iranian regime in all its complexity, and certainly among the

response to the noble Baroness’s questions, of course we would

discussions on this matter. That is one of the things that could grow
out of these negotiations. The joint commission will, of course, be
concerned with implementing the agreement. The first visit of the

counterproductive and, in fact, against Israel’s long-term

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, we are all conscious of
nervousness in a number of other states in the Middle East about this

The alternative, which might have led to a military attack on Iran,

We have said that to our Israeli friends. The Prime Minister spoke to
Mr Netanyahu in the middle of the previous round of negotiations on 9
November and will no doubt be talking to him again. We have been saying
the same to our friends in Saudi Arabia and the various Gulf states. We
have many active diplomats and friends in Washington who will be saying

Reid of Cardowan (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I add my congratulations
to everyone involved and echo the sentiments that have been expressed
about the role played by my noble friend Lady Ashton. She has been
subjected to what I consider to be much unwarranted criticism despite
the fact that she has, unheralded and unsung, had some singular
successes, not least in Kosovo. This is an occasion on which the
feelings of this House should be sent to our

First, while we approach this with a degree of elation—it is
only a step, but it is a significant first step—we can
nevertheless understand why such an apparently sudden turn of events
should have perhaps caused some confusion and worry among some of our
traditional allies such as Israel and Saudi Arabia. What steps are
being taken to reassure and persuade them, if necessary, that the
normalisation of relationships with Iran is in everyone’s
interest, not least that of the region itself?</hs_para>

while we are right to temper our feelings of elation with a degree of
caution, will the Minister bear in mind that each step that is taken,
however singular it might be, opens up other opportunities? I am
persuaded that some of the decisions to proceed as we did on Syria,
rather than taking the alternative route, opened—as some in this
House including the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, predicted—a
gateway to further compromise and discussion with Iran. Similarly,
although there is a long way to go on this, I urge the Minister to seek
to use this gateway for further exploration of work in the area,
including in Syria, involving Iran as the great nation it has been
historically. It will surely return to the realms of the United Nations
and international influence if it proceeds along the path it is taking

are going around, I remark that I have been immensely 
<?notus-xml column=1206?>impressed, as a Liberal Democrat, in working with William Hague over the

extensively on this. His relationship with his Russian counterpart has
been quite a significant factor in building trust and co-operation

a great country with a long history, and that it has a complicated

try to suggest otherwise. Will the Minister say to the nay-sayers that
to refuse to make this step would mean that there would be no steps?
You have to make a first step. If you always say, “Well, it
might go wrong”, nothing will ever go right. To hear some
people, they are condemning us to a situation in which no one will ever
try to do anything. That has to be the message to Mr

Turnberg (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, add my congratulations
to all who have been involved in this development. I will ask two short
questions. First, is there a mismatch between the time at which
sanctions may be partially released on the one hand and the nuclear
inspections on the other? Is there a problem with starting this
programme only in January, which would give time for the Iranians
perhaps to do more mischief in the interim period? On the question of
the percentage at which enrichment is to be allowed, I have heard
figures of 5% and 20%. Can the noble Lord clarify which of these is
correct<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T16:31:56"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112512000154" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0001.htm#13112512000154"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Wallace of Saltaire" PimsId="4501" UID="13112512000383" xid="1482" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0001.htm#13112512000383">Lord
Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, the timing of sanctions
release is very carefully calibrated. The sanctions that will be lifted
are extremely limited—the majority  
<?notus-xml column=1207?>of them will remain in place. Incidentally, I asked the briefing team
how far humanitarian sanctions would include some relief of the
controls on medicines and medical supplies for Iran. I know that that
is one of the things that has hit Iran particularly hard. I,
personally, welcome the provision of repairs and spare parts for
Iranian airlines, because it has become increasingly unsafe to fly
within Iran, as the noble Lord will know. On the gap between
now and January, we cannot put that immediately into operation.
However, the sanctions relief does not go into immediate operation
either. We need to work through the details. On 5%
and 20%, the latter is the point at which it becomes
dangerous and relatively easy to carry through the further enrichment
to weapons-grade uranium. Therefore the Iranians have agreed to dilute
half of their current, rather large stockpile of 20% uranium back down
to 5%, which is the point at which it is useful for civil nuclear power
but not for very much else, and to convert the other half into uranium
oxide, which also makes it useful for civil nuclear power but not for
weapons<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T16:33:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112512000155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0001.htm#13112512000155"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Tugendhat" PimsId="4350" UID="13112512000384" xid="1472" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0001.htm#13112512000384">Lord

strongly with the words of my noble friend Lord Deben about the
contribution made by the European Union and by the noble Baroness, Lady
Ashton. I also associate myself with the words of the noble Baroness,
Lady Williams, who praised the Iranian negotiators. It is often
forgotten, when one looks at the position of Iran on these matters,
that it is one of the countries that have been on the receiving end of
weapons of mass destruction, namely from Iraq. When a country has been
on the receiving end of such weapons, that makes it very sensitive to
its own ability to protect itself against all eventualities. When one
looks at the Iranian nuclear programme, it is important to bear that in
mind. Therefore, the concessions that the Iranians have made and the
apparent good will with which they have entered into these negotiations
must have required a very considerable effort on their part. We should
certainly pay tribute to them and we hope very much that they, with the
West, will be able to bring this to a
conclusion.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112512000156" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0001.htm#13112512000156"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T16:34:40"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Wallace of Saltaire" PimsId="4501" UID="13112512000385" xid="1482" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0001.htm#13112512000385">Lord

uranium enrichment has not been carried out at a nuclear level but has

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, a great many officials have
worked long hours and have spent a long time on planes going back and
forth. It so happens that the State Department official I know best has
led the State Department delegation at official level.
According to everything I have heard, she has done extremely well.
However, there is still a great deal of work to be done. On the
underground facilities at Fordo, the exact details of the
inspection regime remain to be negotiated and agreed, and then
enforced, between now and the end of January. However, it is clear that
we expect to have access to all these facilities. Of course, there are
Saudi and Gulf state concerns, as there are concerns in Israel, and we
are in active dialogue with the Saudis and others about them. It would
be disastrous for the Middle East if this were to descend into a
sectarian Sunni/Shia conflict. Let us hope that one of the outcomes of
the agreement will be to reverse what some of us feared might be taking
us in that
direction.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-25?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_25_PT_1/581D1EF9155CB452DEB50227670E5A4E94F7D5CA" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 25 November 2013">Monday,

is a simple and, I hope, uncontroversial concept. The other House
introduced legislation to deal with the twin issues of enabling access
for those who wish to protest or state their case to the Houses of
Parliament, but in a way that does not inconvenience unduly the work of
the Houses of Parliament and, indeed, other people who wish to use
Parliament Square. Parliament took some time to get the right balance.
I think it would be true to say that to start with we did not have
proper protection; we then moved to a position in which many felt that
there was not enough freedom for people to demonstrate; and then to the
present arrangement, which I think now has all-party support, which
states that people can properly demonstrate but that they must have
permission to use equipment that amplifies the words they say. That is
a not unreasonable request, and that is the balance that has been
reached<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T16:40:11"></hs_TimeCode>.

that if there were movement in any other direction, the police would be
happy to take action. However, without blaming anyone, it seems that

problem that arises is that this means that on an increasing number of
occasions, part of this House is almost impossible to work in. I came
to terms with this when I was trying to have a detailed discussion with
one of the officers of the House and we had to move out of his office
into the corridor because we could not have a conversation, so loud was
the noise from outside. It also did not help that one could not hear
what the noise outside was about, because the trouble with much of the
amplification used is that it obscures the sense while increasing the
noise. I fear that this is one aspect of human life today in any case,

merely geographical. The law at the moment stops before you get to the

concern of the public, in the area immediately in front of the House of
Commons. All my amendment therefore does is increase the geographical
area by the minimum necessary to provide the House of Lords with the

is an additional reason about which the House should know. On Sunday,
for example, when the House of Lords was not sitting, a large
collection of people gathered outside the House of Lords to address us.
Of course, the only people whom they addressed were those attempting to
worship in 
<?notus-xml column=1210?>Westminster Abbey and St Margaret’s, Westminster. I received no
direct complaint about that, but there is no doubt that the noise made
the worshippers’ activities, which were perfectly proper for a

than usually entirely on the side of freedom. I have a long history of
doing that and I do not want to restrict anyone from protesting.
Indeed, I can think of few happier occasions than when many of us went
out to join those who had come to celebrate the passing of the Marriage
(Same Sex Couples) Act. It was a happy and cheerful activity, and not
something that one would have wanted in any way to stop. However, what
has to be stopped is the kind of behaviour that made it impossible for
the House of Commons to continue and that caused it to pass legislation

hope that we will be able to have this protection. The convenience of

Colin Barrow of Westminster City Council. When the Police Reform and
Social Responsibility Bill was going through Parliament, he wrote to
the department expressing concern about how it would operate. This was
at a time when, as the noble Lord may recall, the square was
inhabited—if I may use that term—by a lot of protesters

simply driving past and not being able to read the signs or hear what

Martin of Springburn (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, the loud-hailing
which took place in Parliament Square was a disgrace. Most of us who
have fought elections at council and parliamentary level have used
loud-hailing equipment. When that equipment goes above a certain noise
level, it becomes a breach of the peace. It is not the first time. When

that.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13112512000176" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0001.htm#13112512000176">That
strange character sat in Parliament Square for 10 years, and all sorts
of organisations tried to help: the Greater London Council, Westminster
Council, the police, Parliament and even the Home Office. Legislation
went through both Houses, but it was not strong enough, and the judges
said, “No. The chap who is there”—I forget his
name—“can use the pavement because it is not really a
pavement in the proper sense of the word”. All I can say is that
if somebody were sitting outside their house, they would find good
legal cause to get rid of him after 10
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112512000177" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0001.htm#13112512000177">The
other place found arrangements to prevent loud-hailing at that end, but
it cannot speak for this autonomous body. That is why the demonstrators
have moved up. However, if anyone uses a loud-hailer that gets above a
certain level, they are being a nuisance. Even the media agreed with
that. The people who had been aggravated most by the person who was on
the loud-hailer all day and every day, the character who stood there
for 10 years, were those in the Press Gallery. When Parliament went
into Recess, people from the Press Gallery went out and told the person
concerned in no uncertain terms, “Please stop”.</hs_para>

the difficulty that Westminster Council had was that its only way of
stopping the noise was if the sound level went above a certain decibel
level. It had to come along with its testing equipment, and it could
have been that the wind was in a different direction or whatever. I
know that this amendment is tight. The noble Lord, Lord
Campbell-Savours, suggested we should have a stall where people could
come and demonstrate. No one is stopping demonstrations, but this is my
understanding of a demonstration: the first time I had a demonstration

from every point of view. We were all strongly in favour of having
protests, but not permanent protests. I am not absolutely clear where
the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, is suggesting his hut should be.

am sure that many other noble Lords besides those who have spoken will
have strong views on the noise generated by the demonstrations that

course, been here before. As noble Lords have pointed out, legislation
to deal with such demonstrations was first passed in the Serious
Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. We should not forget just how
contentious that legislation was, which is why it was repealed and
replaced with more proportionate measures in the Police Reform and

demonstrations. The proximity to the working offices of the House of

those problems have been displaced, particularly to the small area
around the George V Memorial and the surrounding lawns and paving, as

<?notus-xml column=1216?>The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T17:08:05"></hs_TimeCode> 2011 Act

particular by including a power to seize items used in connection with
the contravention of a by-law. Westminster City Council and the Royal
Parks authority updated their by-laws immediately after the relevant
provisions of the 2011 Act were brought into force. The by-laws include
measures to deal with tents, structures and excess

Council by-laws and the Royal Parks by-laws contain strict noise
control provisions covering Old Palace Yard and surrounding areas such

allow to be caused any noise which is so loud or so continuous as to
give reasonable cause for annoyance to others in the area. But here is
the rub: the enforcement of by-laws is a matter for Westminster City
Council and, ultimately, the police. Suspected breach of a by-law could
lead to arrest and prosecution. In taking any enforcement decisions,
the authorised officers or the police would take into account the need
to allow a right to protest outside Parliament. Achieving a balance
seems to be part of the difficulty. Perhaps the noble Lord, Lord
Campbell-Savours, has suggested an idea that recognises this to try to
avoid the gross disruption experienced currently. I do not know. Some

remind him—the trouble is, he was not particularly involved in

Parliament Square, which brought such discredit to the whole area and
did not add to the credit of Parliament. I had a Private
Member’s Bill on this and the argument that was always used was,
“Oh, there are lots of powers”, and they quoted quite a
number of the Acts of Parliament that my noble friend has just been
quoting. It did not work. It was much too complicated for the
individual authorities—whether it was the Met, Westminster City
Council or the health and safety people—to do anything about it.
The Act which was introduced to deal with Parliament Square appears to
have been very successful. I suggest to the Minister that, much better
than trying to play around with existing legislation which might be
relevant to dealing with the problem, let us build on what has dealt

Deben:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend for the
consideration with which he approached my amendment. The truth is that
the laws and by-laws to which he referred exist but are not enforced.
He made that point. That was precisely what happened in Parliament
Square. Parliament and the House of Commons decided that the square
would need a special arrangement because that was the only way to make
sure it was enforced. It has now been enforced in the new, much more
elegant form brought in by the 2011 Act, about which I have
heard no complaints, even from the most extreme of campaigners. They
see that the balance is roughly there. It seems odd that what is sauce
for the elected goose should not be sauce for the unelected, but
happily continuing, gander. I have difficulty in understanding why
there should be a difficulty, if I may put it as elegantly as
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112512000212" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0001.htm#13112512000212">I am

failed to regulate the matters in Parliament Square before the law was
changed, I suspect that we will want to come back to this House and
propose again the simple concept of moving what is now limited to
Parliament Square further along the road. Of course, I undertake that,
in those discussions, the actual boundaries will be looked at again in
case we have not quite got

other measures we have been discussing so far, such as IPNAs, criminal
behaviour orders and community protection notices, which are all about
the control of individuals, of people acting either individually or in
a group. Public spaces protection orders are different because they are
about public spaces and controls over those spaces—in other
words, controls on land and what people can do on that land—so
they affect everyone, or everyone in a category of persons. That has
civil liberties implications, because clearly they will capture
innocent people who may then be penalised and, if they breach the
order, could end up facing criminal
charges<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T17:25:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

not against public spaces protection orders. I think that they will be
extremely useful devices for local authorities, as long as they are
used sensibly and proportionately. The amendments in this group and
some of my other amendments are not, therefore, against PSPOs; they are
probing how they will work, what safeguards are already in the Bill and
what further safeguards may be
needed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T17:26:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112512000219" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0001.htm#13112512000219">There
are three main concerns about PSPOs. The first is the one that I have
already raised: they may remove liberties of the citizen in public
spaces from the vast majority of people who have done nothing wrong and
do not intend to do anything wrong, or at least nothing significant.
The Bill states that the orders can be levied for up to three
years—the assumption is that that will be standard—and
then prolonged for another three years ad infinitum. In effect, they
could become permanent restrictions on what people can do in public
places and, in extremis, whether they can go there or
not<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T17:27:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112512000220" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0001.htm#13112512000220">The
second concern relates to the possibility that public spaces protection
orders could be used to keep people out of an area, not just to control
what they can and cannot do within that area. For some types of land
designated precisely for access and informal recreation, public spaces
protection orders will in effect nullify and negate the very purpose of
the designation of that land. That part of the proposals has caused
considerable alarm among organisations such as the Ramblers and the
Open Spaces Society, to which the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, referred.
The threat, as it is seen, is that some or all the rights under
existing legislation specifically for those types of land could be
removed, and that when proposals are made to remove them under the new
legislation, all the existing safeguards to ensure that such rights are
not removed unless absolutely necessary will be swept away in a pretty
easy, arbitrary
manner<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T17:28:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112512000221" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0001.htm#13112512000221">The
third concern, which I think we can deal with now, is that as the Bill
has gone through its parliamentary process, PSPOs have not been much
scrutinised—certainly not adequately, in my view. The
pre-legislative consideration of the Bill by the Home Affairs Committee
dealt with PSPOs in a fairly cursory way; they got some discussion, but
not a lot, as the Bill went through the House of Commons. We must
scrutinise this part of the Bill carefully to see whether we can
persuade the Government to make changes to prevent some local
authorities taking the provision to the limit so that it goes further
than is
reasonable.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-25?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_25_PT_1/04EFFD2CD919FBAC4B311762872A850902E65FBB" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 25 November 2013">Monday,

having to go through all the amendments in detail, I submitted a list
of the questions they cover to the Minister, who kindly agreed to look
at them. The basic questions are, first: will the orders have to be
based on evidence—in other words, past and present activities on
the land—as well as a concern that they will happen or continue,
or can they be based solely on a concern or belief that activities will
occur in the future? Secondly, can a PSPO be made only on the area
where evidence exists or could problems in one area be used as a reason
for a much bigger area, or even a different area, being made subject to
one?</hs_para>

arisen since I had discussions with the Minister, which is whether the
conditions that can be put on a PSPO can apply only to activities and
the detrimental effect identified before people say,
“Let’s have a PSPO”. Is it only those activities
and the detrimental effect which have been identified and defined under
the first condition, in Clause 55(2)(a), or could anything be put on
once those are considered? Should the criteria for making an order not
take account of the downsides of making it, rather than merely
considering the benefits of doing so—in other words, should the
legislation have a test of balance of judgment introduced into it?
Should the prohibitions and requirements not be necessary rather than
just reasonable? To what extent is discrimination acceptable between
different types or groups of people, or differently aged people, in
setting the prohibitions and requirements in the order? This is an
important part of the Bill and I hope that we will scrutinise it
carefully. I beg to move Amendment

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> My Lords, this is a large group of
amendments which essentially comes down to the purpose of these orders.

Clause 55(3)(c), so there is a requirement for balance in the creation
of a public spaces protection order within the Bill. It is certainly

close off areas without proper consideration of the legal and proper
activity being conducted in those areas.</hs_parafo>

noble friend’s amendments is that he is suggesting that the
lives of people in the locality would already have to have been
affected for some time before the council could act. We are
anticipating that there will be circumstances in which, because of
other activities, the council may wish to create a public spaces
protection order in advance of, let us say, a new development. For
example, if a council wanted to open a new children’s play area,
it may wish to place restrictions on that area either to prohibit dogs
from entering or to allow them only if they are kept on a lead. If my
noble friend’s amendments were accepted, the council would have
to wait until irresponsible dog ownership turned up as a feature before
it could address that. We dealt in a previous debate with the problems
that can come through displaced activities, so I hope that my noble

exercise judgment on these matters.</hs_para>

that are linked to a detrimental activity can be applied. Any additions
to that list would be treated as a variation under Clause 57 and be
subject to the same tests and consultation. Having got a public spaces
protection order, it can be varied only by starting the consultative
process again. I hope that my noble friend is reassured by that; if he
is not, I can tell him that any variation of an order could be
challenged in the High Court. Where orders are deemed 
<?notus-xml column=1222?>to be unnecessary or disproportionate, there is still the ability for
those affected to challenge it in court. The council will be mindful of
this when judging whether the test has been
met.</hs_para>

my noble friend is making these points. In the draft guidance published
last month we have included guidelines on the aspects and impacts that
should be considered before an order is used. We will, of course,
continue to develop the guidance to try and cover the point raised by
my noble friend, but I fear that including it in the Bill would make it
hard for a council to act quickly and deal effectively with anti-social
behaviour.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13112512000229" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0001.htm#13112512000229">I
think that I have covered the issue of the future impacts. Regarding
Amendment 32, I would like to be clear that the aim behind this
amendment is to allow councils to design solutions around local needs.
Clause 55(6) will result in the closure of rights of way
being less likely under a new regime. It will allow specific problems
to be dealt with without the recourse to completely closing a public
space, as I have said.</hs_para>

flexibility in these orders that will suit both those who wish to go
about exercising their legitimate rights and those who wish to make
sure that anti-social behaviour can be tackled. I agree with my noble
friend that these orders have to be used proportionately. The benefit
to the community in tackling detrimental activities must be balanced
against the impact of any prohibitions or requirements. I believe that
local councils are capable of making such assessments and coming to the
right decisions, having consulted the local community. If they get it
wrong, or are perceived to have got it wrong, an order can be
challenged in the courts. Given the safeguards that we have built into
the legislation, which are reinforced by the draft guidance we have

Greaves:</Member></B> My Lords, that takes us into some very useful
discussion and I am grateful to my noble friend for his careful
response. What he said about play areas and the ability of councils to
put a public spaces protection order on a new play area to keep dogs
out, for example, or perhaps because they wish to have areas under a
PSPO where dogs would have to be kept on a lead, indicates that what is
being proposed is not a minor thing. It is a very powerful new proposal
with a strong power. Some might think that it is far-reaching
and<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T17:39:59"></hs_TimeCode> draconian
but, if councils behave properly, it may be valuable.</hs_para>

a local councillor, I have to say that I am very attracted by the idea
of being able to make public spaces protection orders. I can think of
all sorts of places where suitable orders might be introduced—so
I am not against them at all. What I am concerned about is whether
there are sufficient safeguards. My noble friend refers to the right of
appeal to the High Court but, in terms of closing footpaths, the right
of appeal on closing a right of way is to the magistrates’
court. Most people concerned about such a matter can undertake an
appeal to the magistrates’ court. They would not want to go to
the High Court to appeal against an order. There is a real concern here
that the powers being given to local authorities are very strong, 
<?notus-xml column=1223?>potentially very beneficial but also powers that could be misused. Being
able to go only to the High Court is a
problem<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T17:40:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112521000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0001.htm#13112521000004">Finally,
the Minister referred to the draft guidance that has been produced,
which is very helpful and useful. Like my noble friend Lady Hamwee on
guidance, earlier today I said that it was a good thing that in this
Bill that there was not much provision for the Secretary of State to
make orders and regulations. In practice, what is going to happen is
that the Secretary of State will issue guidance, which in effect will
be instructions to local authorities. It will be a very brave local
authority that does not follow the guidance. I am not sure that
non-statutory guidance in that sense is any better than statutory
orders and regulations, which at least potentially can have some
parliamentary
scrutiny<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T17:41:32"></hs_TimeCode>.

Greaves:</Member></B> My Lords, perhaps we should have discussed this
amendment along with the last amendment but one about goings-on around
this building. This amendment tests to what extent public spaces
protection orders can remove rights of peaceful assembly
in<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T17:42:35"></hs_TimeCode> public
places. In practice, public spaces protection orders are not a suitable
way of limiting freedom of speech, assembly or campaigning. We have
just discussed a very extreme example. There may be occasions when
these rights have to be curtailed or regulated and controlled for the
benefit of people in general, people in the locality and even people in
your Lordships’ House. But in most cases, when public protest
gets out of hand, it is possible to deal with it through existing
public order legislation. In some cases, it requires local by-laws but,
by and large, it is dealt with fairly well. People ask whether we
should not be able to ban those such as the English Defence League from
having a demonstration in the middle of Bradford, but there is
legislation to deal with that. If existing legislation is insufficient,
it is in the area of public order legislation or local legislation that
people should look.</hs_para>

protest and debates in public places and freedom of

problems should be dealt with in a one-off manner on the basis of
existing law. If there are very special places, such as outside this
building, where people think that there ought to be more control, it
should be dealt with on that basis. If there is a need to improve the
law, it should not be done on the basis of orders that are easy to make
and can last for three years—and in practice, by extending them,
can last for ever. The rights of assembly, free speech and peaceful
campaigning are too important to be dealt with in this rather arbitrary
manner. I beg to

is an important criterion on which, I believe, the noble Lord is
seeking reassurance from the Government. People have a democratic and
legitimate right to protest in public places, and we would really not
want to see these powers misused, if people are campaigning or lobbying
for a particular cause or issue, although I do not think that that is
the Government’s intention. It would be helpful to have some
comment from the Minister. Can he give reassurance that there are no
circumstances in which this provision would be allowed to curtail
legitimate debate, campaigning or protest? As the noble Lord, Lord
Greaves, said, there are other ways in which such issues should be
dealt with. We all know of cases where laws have been used for purposes
other than those intended by Governments. As the Minister will
appreciate, it creates huge suspicion when provisions seem open-ended.
I hope that he can give reassurance and be very clear on that, perhaps
stating specifically in guidance that the intention would not be to
limit in any way the democratic responsibilities of the
citizen<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T17:47:13"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T17:47:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112521000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0001.htm#13112521000009"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Hamwee" PimsId="3737" UID="13112521000081" xid="1741" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0001.htm#13112521000081">Baroness

would not be enough. Unless we can have hard examples of where the
provision might be properly used to restrict assembly where there is no
other provision to deal with any of the problems, it would not be
adequate for guidance to say something like, “The Government
would not expect this to be used in such and such a situation”.

Ahmad of Wimbledon (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I can be brief with
this group of government amendments which implement the recommendations
made by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee in respect
of certain of the delegated powers in Parts 1, 4 and 5 of
the Bill. The amendments to Clauses 55, 56 and 57 are worthy of
particular comment. The Delegated Powers Committee argued that, in
relation to the public spaces protection orders, the current provisions
in the Bill requiring a local authority to consult with the chief
officer of police and community representatives was too narrow given
the potential impact of such orders. The committee further argued that
there should be a general duty to publicise the intention to make a
notice. We are happy to accept the point made by the committee. The
amendments to Clause 55 therefore require a local authority to
publicise its intention to make an order so as to allow persons
affected to make representations. In the normal way, a local authority
would be bound to consider any such representations before making an
order. This process is also replicated where the local authority plans
to extend, vary or discharge an existing order by the amendments to
Clauses 56 and 57 respectively. I beg to

done simply by putting a tiny advert in an obscure part of a

first six amendments are about making public spaces protection orders.
The remainder, apart from the last one, raise the same questions in
relation to extensions, variations and removals of orders—what
the legislation calls “discharges”. As far as
consultations are concerned, Amendment 35 says that the owner of the
land must be consulted. The Minister may tell us, “Of course the
owner of the land will be told what is going on”, but it does
not say so in the Bill. Whether the owner of a particular piece of land
is a community representative may be a question of doubt. The owner may
live in Wellington, New Zealand, in Vladivostok, or anywhere. However,
if orders will be made that restrict the activities that members of the
public can undertake on a particular piece of land, the owner of the
land should be consulted about that before the order is

36 probes what is meant by “community representatives”.
Will the guidance tell us? The amendment would take that out, but only
in order to probe what it means. Amendment 37 says that the county
council—the highways authority in two-tier areas—should
be consulted as one of the main local authorities. The county will
think that it is the major local authority. The district may disagree,
but nevertheless, the county council clearly should be consulted,
particularly if the public spaces protection order affects a highway.
The county is the highways authority—it is responsible for that
highway—and it may well have a view as to whether activities
should be restricted or whether people should be banned from going on
that highway, if it is a right of way. The amendment also says that
parish councils should be consulted.</hs_para>

experience of them. I know that the Minister has huge experience of
parish councils, because he lives in a part of the world in
Lincolnshire that is rife with them, and quite rightly so. People may
say, “Some parish councils are rubbish”, but some are
brilliant. When it comes to dealing with things such as local
environmental crime on a small but irritating level, or with
anti-social behaviour, parish councils have an essential role to play.

Amendment 56ZC covers a rather different area. It is an amendment which
probes what the term “community representative” means,
and whether it can mean a regional or national body that is perhaps
called in by local people for some expertise. Again, I think, for
example, of the Ramblers or the Open Spaces Society, which might be
brought in if there is a proposal to close a right of way by a public
spaces protection order. If the normal procedures for closing rights of
way were to be carried through, through the highways legislation or the
Wildlife and Countryside Act, that would happen
automatically.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112521000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0002.htm#13112521000041">The
danger is that this legislation may provide a shortcut that local
authorities will find very attractive. I am not sure that
“shortcut” is the right word; it should aim to close a
shortcut which may be highly controversial. One ought to be able to
bring in experts in the field. Nowadays, it is not difficult to consult
organisations. In the old days, you had to print off another copy of a
letter, put it in an envelope, put a stamp on it and post it off.
Nowadays, you do not do that; you just have an easy distribution list
on your computer and you send it off to everybody, so there is no
excuse for limiting and restricting the number of people who should be
consulted and should be able to make representations. I sit on a local
committee which deals with rights of way questions. Usually, the people
who make representations to us are local people. If it is the Ramblers
Association, it is a local branch of that association. However,
sometimes the issue is more controversial and difficult, and national
organisations get involved. These national organisations may be
heritage organisations or amenity organisations. All sorts of
organisations get involved on behalf of local people who have asked
them to do so. Excluding them, which is what this section of the Bill
seems to do, is ridiculous. I look forward to the Minister’s

Redesdale (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I support my noble friend,
especially on Amendments 38 and 56ZC. I raise the vexed issue of dogs
and am happy that my first interjection on the Bill concerns that
issue—indeed, I have been looking forward to it—in the
context of public spaces protection orders. I think that many local
authorities will consider introducing such orders to ban bull breeds of
dogs from green spaces. Many people may support such a measure but an
animal welfare issue is involved. If local authorities decide to ban a
specific breed of dog, who will enforce it and where will those dogs be
walked? Making such orders would be popular and therefore many local
communities may suggest that they be implemented across the whole of
their area, which would cause an animal 
<?notus-xml column=1231?>welfare issue, especially for those responsible dog owners who look
after their pets. Indeed, evidence shows that Staffordshire bull
terriers are safe dogs if handled properly. However, many of the
problems associated with status dogs arise because people do not
understand how to look after them and do not train them properly.
Blanket orders banning such dogs from green spaces could be very
popular but would cause many problems. Many animal welfare charities
are overrun with bull breeds of dogs that have been abandoned and the
measure we are discussing would exacerbate that
problem<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T18:13:27"></hs_TimeCode>. The
amendment would ensure consultation around such enforcement. I think
that enforcement of breed-specific measures would be a mistake. The
Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 was drawn up in haste and tried to ban pit bull
terriers. However, there are now more pit bull terriers in the country
than when the Act was introduced, so it did not work. In addition, it
is a very difficult law to
enforce<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T18:14:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112521000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0002.htm#13112521000043">I
understand that muzzling or keeping dogs on leads at certain times
could be a solution to this problem in certain areas but a blanket ban

representations on behalf of these dog breeds? Amendment 38 refers to
representations. I hope that national bodies will be consulted in areas
where dog wardens do not exist following financial cuts. I very much
hope that the Minister will advise that blanket bans cannot be imposed

Harris of Haringey:</Member></B> My Lords, I want to interrupt this
string of Liberal Democrat speakers to correct the noble Lord, Lord
Greaves. He implied that the reason why parish councils were not
referred to more explicitly in the Bill is that so many officials live
in London and London does not have parish councils. However, London has
the power to create parish councils. Indeed, last year a parish council
was created in Queen’s Park following a referendum of local
residents who voted for it by two to one, with about 1,000 residents
voting in favour and about 500 voting against. Therefore, it is
possible to create parishes in London and many local authorities have
looked at this as a way of ensuring adequate local community and
neighbourhood representation. Where such parishes or adequate community
and neighbourhood structures exist, you would expect them to be
consulted on the orders about which the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, is
concerned<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T18:16:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112521000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0002.htm#13112521000045"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Taylor of Holbeach" PimsId="5065" UID="13112521000095" xid="1920" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0002.htm#13112521000095">Lord

35, 45 and 50 would see the landowner consulted, if this is not the

landowner—before a public spaces protection order is made. I
accept that it is entirely appropriate that the council should take
reasonable steps to consult either the landowner or occupier of any
land to be covered by a public spaces protection 
<?notus-xml column=1232?>order. It is conceivable that this could be done through a relevant
community representative under Clause 55(7)(b), but I
acknowledge that the owner or occupier is in rather a different
position and should be consulted directly where they can be identified.
Likewise, Amendments 37, 47 and 52 would add parish councils, county
councils and community councils to the list of bodies to be consulted
where appropriate. Again, I accept that there is a case for having
these bodies on the face of the legislation for the avoidance of doubt,
and I would like to consider this matter further between now and
Report. The viability of parish councils can vary enormously. I come
from one of the largest parishes in England. Holbeach has a population

to the sentiment behind Amendments 39 and 40, which relate to

that when an order is publicised this should include putting it on the

the regulations light touch to ensure maximum flexibility at a local
level. However, I suggest that in order to future-proof the legislation
we avoid referencing websites specifically in the Bill so that if more
appropriate media are developed in 10 years we do not require primary
legislation. But

Redesdale opened up a tricky issue in an almost pre-emptive strike on
our debates on dogs, if I may say so. However, quite a number of
aspects of this matter are covered in the draft Home Office guidance on
controlling the presence of dogs. When deciding whether to make
requirements or restrictions on dogs and their owners, local councils
will need to consider whether there are suitable alternatives for dogs
to be exercised without restrictions. Under the Animal Welfare Act
2006, dog owners are required to provide for the welfare needs of their
animals. This includes providing the necessary amount of exercise each
day. Councils should be aware of the publicly accessible parks and
other public places in their area that dog walkers can use to exercise
their dogs without restrictions. I therefore hope that my noble friend
is reassured about that, although he should also understand that we
need to keep the public safe from dogs that are out of control. We will
no doubt be discussing that delicate balance when we reach the dog

about the types of land where rights of access are provided by
legislation, often with an actual or implied right to take part in
formal recreation while accessing the land. There are two kinds of such
land. The first is areas of land that include commons, village and town
greens, and access land under the Countryside and Rights of Way
Act 2000, which includes the new coastal access routes and
the spreading room between those routes and the sea. I remember that
the person who led on the CROW Bill for the Liberal Democrats was my
noble friend Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer. Some of the amendments
she moved attempted to place an obligation on councils to publicise
areas of access land on their websites. We were told by the Government
of the day that that was inappropriate because websites were new and
unknown, most councils might not have them, and that they were
therefore inappropriate. Now we are told by the current Minister that
websites may not be around for very long and are therefore ephemeral.
Such is the passage of time. The second type of land is highways,
routes, rights of way and other important recreational routes. Some of

and greens are special places, the rights of access to which are
contained in historic law, some of it common law, and in the CROW Act
and Commons Act 2006. The CROW Act provides a right to roam on all
commons. Village greens and town greens are specifically designated as
areas where informal recreation has taken place without permission or
hindrance for at least 20 years, and in some cases for centuries. The
right to informal recreation on greens is basic to their existence.
Restricting such access and activities by the relatively easy
administrative process under public spaces protection orders is,
frankly, not acceptable. It is possible to have restrictions on greens
but such restrictions are carefully worked out and laid down, and
difficult to achieve. Commons are also historic and the right of public
access is entrenched in the Acts. Often access to and the presence of a
common are common law rights, by which I mean common law, not the
Commons Act. Again, it is quite unacceptable that these ancient rights

something quite different. It is about rights of common, although I do

A common typically has an owner, which may be a public authority or a

and they have rights of common. Nowadays, it is mainly a grazing right,
but there may be ancient rights such as pannage and turbary, which
noble Lords can look up in the dictionary. These rights of common
belong to the commoners and are quite separate from the rights of
ownership of the owner of the common. It would be absurd if these

which are of real concern here are the rights of way on a definitive
map. Several of these amendments are not consistent with each other
because they put forward alternative ways of providing safeguards or
simply take them out of the legislation altogether. I hope that the
Government will start looking at the safeguards. These rights of way as
defined under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 are public
footpaths, bridleways, the slightly more esoteric restricted byways,
and BOATs—byways open to all traffic.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T18:31:47"></hs_TimeCode> legislative
regime is clear. It has been in place for a long time under the
Highways Acts and, now, under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. It
is possible to close or divert rights of way. Closures and diversions
happen all the time, but doing so is complex and the procedures are
quite long, and that is deliberate because these are ancient historic
rights that ought not to be able to be taken away easily and quickly.
As I said earlier, I am on a committee that deals with them. You can
appeal if a right of way is closed or diverted and the local 
<?notus-xml column=1236?>authority has not achieved an adequate consensus, and the appeal is made

cases where they have been brought in. Some 1,700 gating orders have

highway—usually a local back street—so that people cannot

been uncontroversial. They provide an improvement to community safety
and the local environment. They stop people going down the backs of
houses when they can perfectly easily go down the front, so no
inconvenience is caused. They typically relate to back streets, alleys,
snickets or ginnels, depending on where you live. However, some have
been very controversial where local authorities have used them in
inappropriate circumstances to close down footpaths linking one place
to another and there are no satisfactory alternatives. Examples are
where routes within urban areas link a main road and a school, a
housing estate and playing fields, or routes to shopping centres and so
on. There have also been one or two examples where the gating of a
local highway in a town has blocked access to the rights of way network
in the countryside, and that has clearly been undesirable.</hs_para>

am not arguing against being able to use public spaces protection
orders for gating purposes because that is how the Government now want
to proceed. I am asking the Minister whether we can have some really
good, genuine safeguards to ensure that they will be used only for
those very local circumstances where the purpose is to keep people away
from residential property and not to stop people using linking
routes—usually footpaths—which are of value to the

stands on rights of way, the Bill removes the basic safeguards in the

easy closure of a right of way for three years, then for it to be
extended three years at a time, and eventually for ever. Real problems
are involved in conflating gating orders with all rights of way. I am

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to my noble
friends Lord Greaves and Lady Hamwee for explaining their amendments.
Before I start on my notes, I should draw my noble friends’
attention to the underlying conditions that local authorities need to
reflect on before they make orders. I think that they condition the
whole approach and, to some extent, satisfy some of the anxieties that
my noble friends have
expressed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T18:38:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

friend Lord Greaves that, like him, I fervently believe that public
spaces are there for everyone to enjoy, but they should not be ruined
by a careless and irresponsible minority. These new orders are designed
to allow maximum flexibility for the council, meaning that restrictions
on access to, or use of, any land should be considered only as a last
resort. However, where restrictions on access are necessary, the option
should be available to protect victims and communities from anti-social
behaviour. That is what we are about and it is what the Bill is
about.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1311263000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0002.htm#1311263000013">On
Amendment 41, I accept that the categories of land listed are important
and, indeed, worthy of the further debate they have received today.
This is exactly why many of them are covered explicitly in the draft
guidance. However, making this amendment would stop the local council
protecting those spaces more generally from issues that might deter
usage. It is important that we do not inhibit the flexibility provided
by these new
orders.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311263000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0002.htm#1311263000014">Perhaps
I may illustrate the point. Many of the categories of land listed here
are commonly used by dog walkers as well as children. Given the risk to
children of diseases spread by dog faeces, it is only right that a
council has the ability to introduce measures to ensure that dog owners
clean up after their animal. In addition, where some of these areas of
land have become a focal point for people to congregate and drink
alcohol, making usage by others unpleasant or even impossible, the
council should be able to prohibit the drinking of alcohol to free the
space for the majority who want to use it responsibly. The amendment as
drafted would preclude the council providing these protections or any
others that were necessary on the categories of land listed.</hs_para>

specific and is designed to protect any rights of common, such as the
right to graze animals, enjoyed by individuals or groups on common
land. This amendment is, I believe, unnecessary. A public spaces
protection order would not be used to stop a commoner exercising his
right of common. In the case of rights of common, it is hard to imagine
a situation where a right exercised by a commoner could result in
anti-social behaviour, unless it were being done in a particular way.
The new flexibility afforded to councils with the public spaces
protection order means they can address the problem element of the
behaviour while protecting the wider rights.</hs_para>

ensure that certain categories of land could not have access
restricted. First, let me say that I accept the importance of
maintaining access to footpaths, bridleways and byways so that they are
available for the enjoyment of all. However, the list in Clause 61
relates to those highways that are of strategic value. This means that,
in all probability, restricting access would have a significant impact
on the community, if not the region or the country, that far outweighs
the impact of any problem behaviours. I do not feel that the same can
be said for all public rights of way. However, I agree that they
deserve special consideration and I am happy to see how this can be
made clearer in the guidance, but where the anti-social
behaviour—and it is the anti-social behaviour that we are
dealing with, not access—of those using these routes has reached
a stage where the community is suffering, the council should have the
ability to restrict access either in part or in
totality.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311263000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0002.htm#1311263000017">I
would like to make one more point which I hope my noble friend will
appreciate. Due to the way in which the current orders in this area are
framed, in many cases a gating order, and indeed the complete closure
of a right of way, is the only option available to councils. The new
order seeks to change this. Problem behaviours and anti-social
individuals and groups can be dealt with more effectively under the new
power, ensuring that the restriction of access is necessary only as a
last resort. We have made this clear in the guidance, but I am content
to work with interested groups such as the Open Spaces Society and the
Ramblers, to see whether it can be made any more explicit.</hs_para>

noble friend Lord Greaves has in this group relate to restrictions on
rights of way over a highway and appropriate safeguards. Amendment 53B
seeks to provide further safeguards on the list of things that need to
be considered before the right of way over a highway is restricted. I
believe that as currently worded Clause 60 provides those assurances.
However, we can consider how to go into more detail in the accompanying
guidance to ensure that my noble friend’s concerns are
addressed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311263000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0002.htm#1311263000019">Amendment
53D would mean that all those affected would have to be notified in
writing. In most cases, I think this would probably be correct.
However, it may be that for some orders another medium would be more
appropriate, such as speaking individually to those affected if there
is only a small number. As such, I do not believe we should tie the
hands of councils in this way in the Bill.</hs_para>

sympathetic to the intention behind Amendment 53E. When restricting
access to a highway, the council will have to publicise it properly. It
seems sensible that a sign at either end of the footpath would be the
way in which this is done. Likewise, as we have already discussed, many
councils will advertise these restrictions on their websites and
through a number of different channels. However, I believe this is
something that we can cover more effectively in the guidance and I do
not believe it should be in the Bill as it could place an unnecessary
burden on councils where those channels are not
appropriate.</hs_para>

I agree with the intention behind Amendment 53F, which I
believe would be best practice anyway. Taxpayers would expect their
local agencies, as public bodies, to be working together to address

further clarify this in

hope I can also provide some assurances on Amendment 53FA, tabled by my
noble friend Lady Hamwee. The legislation makes clear that when a
public right of way is restricted over a highway, those who occupy
premises on that highway cannot be precluded from accessing it. This is
perfectly right, but my noble friend suggests that
“users” of those premises should be included. I
sympathise with the sentiment, but I fear that such a definition could
open the exception out too far and make it difficult for local
authorities to protect communities. However, I would remind my noble
friend that, as I said at the beginning, in order to make a public
spaces protection order the local authority has reasonably to believe
that the behaviour justifies the restrictions. Restricting access to a
highway is a significant step and, as such, the conduct it is weighed
up against is also likely to be more serious. I believe that councils
will use the most restrictive elements of this power only when the
behaviour is such that it warrants the restrictions. We are back to the
principles which are enshrined in Clause
55.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311263000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0002.htm#1311263000023">In
conclusion, we will look at how we can take account in our guidance of

Greaves:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful for some of that, I
think. I am less overwhelmed than I was on the previous group of
amendments, but there are some issues there to latch on to and have
further discussions and debates about. The Minister has several times
today made the point that public spaces protection orders are more
flexible than, for example, gating orders or some of the other things
they may replace, and it is a good point. Local authorities will find
useful the ability to place sensible rules on the use of a right of way
that might, for example, go near houses. From that point of view, the
flexibility in the orders is a good thing. The problem is that the
bottom line is that access can be stopped by quick, quite easy
administrative procedures which can be appealed in 
<?notus-xml column=1240?>the High Court only. That drives a coach and horses—that is the
wrong image for footpaths—through the existing Highways Act
legislation, which provides the opportunity to close a public footpath,
but makes it much more difficult. There are many more hoops to go
through. Those hoops are therefore very good reasons. Perhaps the
Minister might consider a two-stage process for public protection
orders, making it clear to local authorities that they cannot just go
straight to closing access if they have not tried these other more
flexible means
instead<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T18:50:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

practice, once you have banned people from going on a village green,
you have lost. Whoever is doing it, they have lost. If there is
anti-social behaviour on a village green, it must be tackled as
anti-social behaviour to stop it. It is not a sensible answer to it to
say that nobody can go on to a village or town green or access land
because a minority are ruining it by “careless and irresponsible
activity”, to quote the Minister. We all agree that careless and
irresponsible activity has to be stopped when it is causing a nuisance,
but the problem is the knock-on effect of preventing everybody else
using historic facilities. They are not being careless but are being
perfectly responsible. Keeping them off because a minority are
hooligans is the wrong approach. If there is a minority of hooligans,
we have to tackle that

Amendments 44A, 44B, 49A and 55A. The amendments take us to Clause 56,
dealing with the duration of public spaces protection orders. I
entirely take the point that Clause 55 is targeted at activities, but I
also take my noble friend’s point that such an order affects
everyone. After all, the title of the order is about protecting space,
even though the language of the Bill is about the quality of life of
the people who may be

orders may last for up to three years with, I understand, an unlimited
number of extensions. The Minister said that he shares the view that
public space should be for everyone to enjoy. I take a more urban view
than that of my noble friend Lord Greaves. Where space is very scarce
in an urban environment it is important not to restrict it. I am aware
that one can argue this both ways: one can also say that it is
important to ensure that activities do not take place that mean that it
is not enjoyable for everyone. It is not just an urban or even suburban

amendments would provide for the duration to be no more than a year
with a single extension, and for there to be no new order dealing with
substantially the same space until the expiry of a year—a sort
of anti-avoidance provision. For all the reasons already discussed, I
would be very concerned about having something that becomes permanent
or semi-permanent, but I have a more practical concern as
well—it is in part philosophical. My practical concern is: if
the order is to stop undesirable activities, whatever they may be,
taking place on a particular space, how does one assess that the threat
has passed? If the order goes on and on, the culture, local habits and
so on of the area may have changed necessarily, and we will never know
whether we have been successful, as we should have been in that we have
prohibited an activity, or whether we have actually changed

55A—a pretty ropey amendment, I am afraid, but it would allow

Harris of Haringey:</Member></B> My Lords, I understand the nature of
the amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and the noble
Lord, Lord Greaves, in terms of restricting the length of time of a
public spaces protection order, but I believe that the proposals go in
the wrong direction. I wonder why there is an automatic process of the
orders essentially expiring after a period of three years. The power to
make orders sets a whole series of conditions for how the process is to
be done. It requires extensive consultation, the nature of which we
have discussed already. I am 
<?notus-xml column=1242?>assuming that the orders are made in the context of consensus having
been reached in a community that that is the way forward. If such a
consensus has been reached, why do we have to go through this process
regularly? It would be on an annual basis if the amendment moved by the
noble Baroness is passed. Surely the point of the Government’s
proposal is that a local authority will apply for the orders on the
basis of having consulted widely, including with the chief officer of
police and all the others specified in the order. That would include
consultation with the local community. If the noble Lord, Lord Greaves,
had his way, there would be explicit reference to the importance of
parish councils, and I would certainly not object to
that.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T18:59:36"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T18:59:36"></hs_TimeCode>

then a process of extension and, essentially, as I understand it, the

be delighted if that is the case. However, it would therefore mean that
a process would have to be gone through every three years and, if the

may be that the Minister will say that opinions may change and things

elected on a cycle, usually every four years—or refreshed every

communities, that will be reflected in the nature of the local
councillors for the area and it will therefore be up to the local

Hope of Craighead (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I share the puzzlement
of the noble Lord, Lord Harris, about the provision in Clause 56,
particularly as all the flexibility needed is covered in Clause 57.
There is a power to discharge, which would no doubt be exercised when
the local community is satisfied that the order is no longer needed,
and there is a valuable power to vary the order so that it could be
extended to more people or its scope reduced if that is shown to be
necessary. Flexibility is key and I would have thought that one could
get by perfectly well with Clause 57 without having Clause 56 there at
all<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T19:02:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311263000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0002.htm#1311263000039"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Faulks" PimsId="5823" UID="1311263000398" xid="2086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0002.htm#1311263000398">Lord
Faulks (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I respectfully agree with what the
noble and learned Lord has just said. The only way in which Clause 56
might be amended to 
<?notus-xml column=1243?>satisfy the anxiety is to make it a relatively simple procedure. At the
moment, subsection (5) requires that the local authority must consult
various people. If the local authority was given an opportunity so that
it “may” consult rather than “must”
consult, it would make the extension a relatively informal procedure.
Otherwise, I entirely accept what the noble and learned Lord says:

Greaves:</Member></B> My Lords, there are two problems here. The noble
Lord, Lord Harris, is partly right and partly wrong because
it depends on what kind of public spaces protection order is
being made. If the public spaces protection order is made to prevent
dogs going into a children’s play area—the
example given earlier by the Minister—there is no reason why
that should require a formal procedure to consult and so on every three
years because once dogs are banned from a children’s area they
will be banned for ever. It may be controversial at first but, once it
has been done, no one will complain about it afterwards. If,
on the other hand, you are using it as a quick, easy
procedure to close a right of way instead of going through the proper
closure procedure under the Highways Act, it certainly
should be reviewed. My noble friend and I are saying that it should be
reviewed within a year or within six months if it concerns a right of
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T19:04:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

nature of the right that you are taking away from people who are not
guilty of any offences. You are reducing the liberties of perfectly
innocent citizens, and the nature of that reduction ought to be subject
to reconsideration. How can you differentiate in the Bill between the
routine orders that no one is going to complain about—orders
that would otherwise be in the local playground by-laws or other rules
and regulations—and serious orders that take away
people’s historic rights of access to particular areas? I would
be happy with a provision that the prevention of access would have to
be reviewed if the public spaces protection order involved the removal
of people’s rights to access land that they would otherwise have
access to. This would apply to any access, whether or not it was to a
common or a green or whatever. That is fairly fundamental and would

the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, draws between disruption of an historic
right of way and preventing dogs fouling a children’s play area,
but I am not sure how you would get around the problem that,
essentially, you are saying to a dog owner, “You do not have
access to this area”, or, “You do not have access to the
area if you are with your dog”. That is also a restriction on
rights of access to a particular area—in that case, a

Hope of Craighead:</Member></B> My Lords, I will just add a supplement
to my addendum to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Harris, on the
flexibility that lies within the clauses as they stand. Clause 55(8)(c)
creates a power to specify the period; so, with great respect to the
noble Baroness, it is not a fixture that it will always be three years.
If one takes that flexibility along with the point that I made earlier
about Clause 57, a lot of flexibility is built into this. It is a very
sensitive and well designed measure, subject to the point about whether
Clause 56 should be there at

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My Lords, first, I thank all noble
Lords who have participated in this debate. In doing so I make the
general point that sometimes in 
<?notus-xml column=1247?>debates such as this you hear some noble Lords saying that the period is
too long and others saying that it is too short, and so going down the
middle is normally the solution. The noble Baroness talked about
perfection. Dare I say that, perhaps on this clause, we are as near to
that as we can be? I will address the amendments and the questions as
far as I can but I hope, as I always do with the noble Baroness
opposite, that she will gain some reassurance from what I
say<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T19:18:39"></hs_TimeCode>, if not from

amendments relate to the process of reviewing and extending public
spaces protection orders, as we have heard. As noble Lords are aware,
there is currently no statutory review point for the orders we are
replacing and they can run indefinitely. The argument has been made
about where we are today. Putting in a limit is a positive way forward,
otherwise—to quote the noble Baroness’s words back at
her—these orders run on and on. It is important to look at how
they should be reviewed. I believe that there should be a formal review
point, which we have decided to set at three
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T19:19:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311263000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0002.htm#1311263000062">The
effect of Amendments 41B and 44A, which stand in my noble
friend’s name, would of course be to limit this to 12 months. I
have listened to the arguments that she put forward. As we have made
clear in the guidance, orders do not have to last for three
years—a point just made by the noble and learned Lord. There is
flexibility within this, according to the circumstance and the
situation and at the discretion of the issuing authority, including the
local authority, as to what is appropriate. If appropriate, these can
be reviewed or discharged before three years have elapsed. My view is
more qualified and endorsed after listening to the debate and I believe
that three years is a proportionate balance between the needs of users
and the protection of the community, especially given the everlasting
orders that we are seeking to
replace.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311263000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0002.htm#1311263000063">Amendments
44B and 49A—which I take to be an alternative to Amendments 41B
and 44A—would ensure that orders could not be extended more than
once. The noble Lord, Lord Harris, raised the specific point that the
legislation allows only for renewal. I am sure that he has reflected on
Clause 56; there are provisions specifically to allow for the
recurrence of a renewal of an order. He is nodding so I am sure that he
agrees with the point I am

course, there are situations in which longer-term restrictions could be
necessary; for example, as I am sure my noble friend is aware, these
orders will replace, among other things, dog control orders, as the
noble Baroness, Lady Smith, said. This means that a public spaces
protection order will be required, as a dog control order is now, to
ensure that the fouling of public land is dealt with. I am sure that my
noble friend will agree that this is not a problem that can be fixed in
three or indeed six years and an ongoing restriction is therefore
required. As such, preventing the further renewal of orders would mean
communities having to put up with dog mess as well as other potentially
anti-social behaviours, such as public drinking.</hs_para>

my noble friend will be aware that the orders being replaced by the
public spaces protection order do not include a formal review and, as
such, can last indefinitely. In reforming the 
<?notus-xml column=1248?>powers, we believed that it was only right that a statutory timeframe
was built in, and I am sure that my noble friend will welcome that in
principle. As the legislation states, the review should be conducted

course, I understand the concerns raised by my noble friend about the
potential impact of a three-year restriction if applied to all orders
but, as I have already said, the legislation is clear that councils can
limit the duration of an order to a period of less than three years.
Indeed, as the draft guidance suggests, in a situation where a public
right of way is being closed for the first time to try to deal with a
specific issue, the council may well prefer to review this after a
shorter period of
time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311263000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0002.htm#1311263000067">To make
this amendment would mean that all orders covering rights of way would

already mentioned, welcome restrictions to deal with dog fouling and
the consumption of alcohol. This would turn the new power into a
bureaucratic nightmare that resulted in councils that decided to use it
living in a loop of constant consultation and review. As I have said
before, in my own experience as a local councillor for 10 years,
consultations were regularly part and parcel of our decision-making,

is saying. That is why I believe that, as the clauses are drafted,
there is flexibility with regard to the circumstances, the situation
and indeed the tenure appropriate to the offence that is being
perceived. I have already flagged up that in this instance, if an issue
arose for the first time, the local authority may well be minded to
apply an order of smaller duration to allow for exactly the kind of
review and assessment that my noble friend is suggesting. I understand
the point my noble friend makes and, as I have said, it probably refers
more to the restricting of access than anything else. I have listened
and we will consider how to make the guidance more specific in this
regard.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311263000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0002.htm#1311263000070">Finally,
Amendment 55A relates to appeals against public spaces protection
orders. My noble friend has asked for clarification of whether there is
a right of appeal against the extension of an order. That is a fair
point. The amendment would provide an additional opportunity to
challenge an order every time it was extended. This could result in
additional appeals, even if the circumstances had not otherwise
changed. That said, my noble friend has raised an important point and I
will take it away and reflect further on
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311263000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0002.htm#1311263000071">The noble

renewals. Crystal balls are hard to come by and the important thing we
are seeking to do here is to ensure that the orders are 
<?notus-xml column=1249?>specific, time-limited and can be reviewed. Again, if the behaviour has
been corrected, the order does not need to stay in place for ever. That
is an important point to bear in mind. How often are we expecting the
orders to be renewed? That is very much up to the local authorities to
decide. One order can cover more than one behaviour with a shorter
consultation process, so there is less paperwork, less bureaucracy and
less delay. Reviews can be quite light-touch, so one review may be more
intensive than another. It would be almost impossible to give a cost

Minister for giving way, but if the desire is to give all this freedom
to local authorities, I am still not clear why Clause 56 is needed at
all. As has been pointed out, Clause 55(8)(c) states, “must
… specify the period”, so you cannot just say,
“We’ll just whack it in and see what happens”, and
Clause 57 allows for variation. While I am on my feet and so as not to
interrupt later, in case the Minister does not have the answer in his
notes, I would be interested in his response to the question asked by
the noble Lord, Lord Faulks, as to the objection to changing
“must” to “may” in Clause 56(5), so that

link through from Clause 55 to Clause 57 and sets out quite
specifically the details behind the order. I therefore commend the

Hamwee:</Member></B> My Lords, having started as one who
believes—I hope that I still do—very considerably in
local democracy, I suppose that I have fallen into the trap over the
years of viewing whatever comes to us on green paper as restricting it;
it is the cynical view that too much legislation has somehow
engendered. Like others, I do not see this debate as being
two-dimensional in the way that the Minister has just described; that
is, “Is it too long or too short? Well, it is in the middle so
that must be okay”. It is a three-dimensional debate and the
points that have been made about the expression of local democracy are
important and serious. The Committee has challenged the structure of
the provisions in a way that will bear a good deal of further
consideration. The distinction made by my noble friend Lord Greaves
between the different types of content of the orders—access on
the one hand and particular activities on the other—may also get
us to a better
point.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311263000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0002.htm#1311263000081">On

have broadband but the elderly, the disabled, their carers and members
of their families. While some might be able to go online, very many are
not able to and, in any case, they want to hold a piece of paper in
their hands showing what they have left, what debts have been paid and
what might be owing. They are caused great distress by not being
allowed to do so. They are the obvious victims. On access to broadband,

call the priority areas, can go online but do not always want to do so.
They want to pay their bills with cheques or postal orders, and

hardship to many people. There are a lot of people out there who have

cuts by requiring online communications. While they are entitled to
take that approach, they should also consider their customers, who
cannot afford, are not able or do not choose to use these online

of any sort. There are those who are incapable of doing these things
online. There are those who are capable but, for one reason or another,
do not always want to do so and do not want to be penalised as a

this debate, I hope that my noble friend will accept that there is a
real and urgent need as we move forward to protect consumers’
choice in this matter and to preserve their existing right to exercise
it. If we do not do that, more and more problems are likely to arise in
the areas that are most vulnerable and more and more annoyance will be
caused with companies that are not in any way co-operative. Above all,

ring the secretary of one of our foremost doctors. She said,
“Well, I have got it on the computer but must print it out

enough having to pay bills; it is worse having to pay for the bills you
have to pay. Yet that is increasingly the situation with
Britain’s rapacious utility companies. The mini-scandal we are
debating this evening first came to my attention when a letter arrived
in our post saying that, from July 2013, we would have to pay
£1.50 for each paper bill BT sent to us—that is,
£6 a year. That seemed—and still seems—wrong, so I
complained to Ofcom. In her reply to me of 19 June, Colette Bowe,
Ofcom’s chair,
said:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="1311263000315" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0002.htm#1311263000315">“We

that stage, my heart started beating faster with excitement. Then she
cited the main group that this applied to: the blind and visually

not make it

wrong with Ofcom’s supine stance? It is simply this: yes, it is
right that the transformative culture of IT has advanced, should
advance and will continue to advance. That is altogether a good thing.
Those who support the position of the noble Baroness, Lady
Oppenheim-Barnes, tonight are not in any sense technological Luddites.
However, it is an essential precondition of such technical advance that
those who cannot benefit from it for one reason or another should be
protected from it to the maximum extent possible, and are not penalised
simply because they were not lucky enough to grow up, as our children
have, in an age where being online was completely natural to them. New
technology will be more successful if it is adopted by people as a free
choice, not forced down their
throat.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311263000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0002.htm#1311263000096">I will
illustrate my point by quoting some figures from the ONS about daily
computer use among adults. It is rising, yes, but in 2013 it still
stood at 70%. That means 30% of the population not accessing a computer
daily, either because they cannot, or do not have a computer. They may
not have a computer because they cannot afford one. They do not have
the good fortune that we rightly have as Members of this House in
having one provided. They must buy it themselves and that is not an
easy thing for everybody to
do.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311263000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0002.htm#1311263000097">Not
surprisingly, the figures for old people are very much lower. For those
over 65, daily computer use is about half that of the population
generally: only 37% of people over 65 access their computer once a day.

bill by computer.</hs_para>

screwed out of pensioners, 
<?notus-xml column=1255?>fully franked by Ofcom; money that alone would pay the £5 million

would have thought that Ofcom might have had some regard to public
opinion. Eighty-four per cent of people think that they should have a
choice of how they get their bills, according to an Opinium Research
poll for the campaign Keep Me Posted, to which the noble Baroness
referred. Forty-one per cent fear that they might miss a payment
without such bills. If we think particularly of older pensioners, those
are the kind of things that make them worried sick. They do not think,
“Oh dear, I might have forgotten to pay”; they think that
their telephone might be cut off so that they could not ring the doctor
or the hospital if they have a fall. Those things matter to them.

appearing in front of a difficult tribunal, I had sleepless nights,
too. On those occasions, I used to lull myself to sleep. I would find
myself fantasising about scoring 100 in a test match at Lord’s
against Australia, before lunch, against Lillee and Thomson without a
helmet on. That was an amazing way of relaxing before a difficult day
in court. I never got more than 50, because I did not need to; I had

against New Zealand down in New Zealand. Then I started batting again
in another test match, this time against the West Indies with Roberts,

deal with the bureaucracy that goes with them. I did a little research,
as we are required to do when new Members come in. I understand that

that is certainly the case for me. I am also much quicker on
paper—I have my notes for this speech on paper because of that.
I may not be entirely rational about this but I have a terrible fear of
having my identity stolen. I think it was listening to some programmes
on the radio about it that set this off. It is mainly because I cannot

between myself and my mother there is a wide spectrum of others who

more for their fuel. They are often living in some of the least

Hayter of Kentish Town (Lab):</Member></B> We must all thank the noble
Baroness, Lady Oppenheim-Barnes, for getting this debate in front of
the House tonight. I thank also those who have rallied to her cause and
who, as my noble friend Lord Lipsey said, are not Luddites. It is a
particular delight that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Judge, has
chosen this debate in which to break his silence in this House. He may
feel that he is needed in Australia at the moment but as he introduced
the noble and learned Lord, Lord Thomas, today, who is from Wales,
perhaps he should take up rugby instead. We are rather more successful
at that.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1311263000116" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0002.htm#1311263000116">The
case that has been made out by the noble Baroness is quite clear. The
service exists, after all, for consumers who pay for it and make the
providers’ profits. Those consumers should therefore have a free
choice of whether to have a paper or an electronic bill, with no price
tag attached to either. This is part of a broader issue of defending
consumer rights, especially where consumers cannot shop around to get a
better service. We are all fed up of being charged when we want to book
our theatre tickets, for example. After all, you cannot go to the
theatre without a ticket so it is not an add-on to what is being
provided; it is an essential part of it. One cannot shop around for
which theatre to go to, as the play is on in only one place. 
<?notus-xml column=1259?>Even budget airlines are beginning to realise that the allocation of a
seat and the purchase of a ticket are an essential part of the
journey—as opposed to a cup of coffee, which may be an add-on.
So, surely, it ought to be in the areas of energy and the
telephone.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311263000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0002.htm#1311263000117">It
is impossible for people to shop around if all the providers are
charging for bills, especially when they do not say at the outset what
the cost will be or, according to the noble Baroness, Lady
Oppenheim-Barnes, when they write it in such a small typeface that none
of us can read it. Even if one shops around for a supplier, the issue
of billing will hardly be uppermost in one’s mind as one makes
that choice. Effectively, these suppliers are adding a fee over which
we cannot negotiate. Yet a bill is an essential component of the
contract of service, not an optional
extra.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311263000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0002.htm#1311263000118">These<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T20:06:58"></hs_TimeCode>
charges are not just the price of a stamp. Talk Talk charges
£1.90 a month, and T-Mobile £18 a year. Given the
weakness of the negotiating position of individual customers, it must
be for the Government, an ombudsman or a regulator to stand in the
consumer’s shoes and sort out the problem, as my noble friend
Lord Lipsey suggested. Of course, had the Government not abolished
Consumer Focus, there would be such a body. But have this Government
any interest in consumers, like the noble Baroness, Lady
Oppenheim-Barnes, former Minister and consumer champion?

paper statements will disadvantage the elderly, as we have heard; only
one-third of over-75s have browsed the internet. However, it is not
just the elderly—7 million adults have never used the internet.
One in seven does not have the internet at home and does not intend to
get it, a quarter on grounds of cost. Some 16 million consumers over 15
do not have basic online skills. Even young people are not immune. One
in 10 of those not in employment, education or training feels out of
their depth using a computer. E-mails, even for those who are fairly
familiar with them, are not always reliable. In fact, if your e-mail
gets caught by a spam filter, it may never reach you, making payments
easy to miss. Furthermore, online billing requires you to notify a
change in e-mail address; it is sometimes easy to forget to do
so—and there is no redirection facility, as with our

issue, raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, is the risk

institutions do not accept printed copies of online statements; indeed,
the European Parliament will not even accept a photocopy—it has

some other questions, clearly did not strike a chord in this House. I
recognise this and have had a few weeks to reflect on the subject
further.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1311263000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0002.htm#1311263000127">In
replying, I congratulate the noble and learned Lord, Lord Judge on his

I fully recognise and understand that there are those in this House and
elsewhere in the country who, as individuals or for business purposes,
may wish to continue to receive statements, bills and other documents
through the post. I also recognise that some people may never wish to
go online, nor indeed even use a computer, let alone other modern
gadgets such as iPads or smartphones. The noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, and
the noble Baroness, Lady Hayter, both made the good point that some
people cannot afford a computer. Again, I respect this. However, noble
Lords cannot fail to notice that, whether we like it or not, the
movement towards a fast-paced and rapidly changing digital age is
inexorable; indeed, my noble friend Lady Oppenheim-Barnes alluded to
this very fact. For example, some 60% of the UK population now have a
smartphone, and we are responding to the huge demand for a
comprehensive rollout of broadband.</hs_para>

debate is therefore rather complex. The pace of change is fast. If we
press the rewind button—if I may be allowed to use that
term—e-mail only really became widespread during the late 1990s.
Some noble Lords may recall the first cordless phones, as big as a
brick and almost as heavy. Now we manage our lives using mobile phones,
and even more, from having health gadgets on our wrists to writing
e-mails using voice recognition. Doing all sorts of things on the move,
be it checking on the weather or traffic, paying bills, even finding
places and locating friends using satellite tracking, is becoming the
norm. I hasten to add that I need to be brought up to date with all
these gadgets myself.</hs_para>

focus of the debate today is on how we help those facing difficulties
or charges when wishing to retain the option of receiving traditional
bills and statements through the post. I am the first to say that I
have some sympathy with the traditional approach, but if I tried to
hold back the tide of change I could on the other hand be accused of
being a latter-day King Canute. The sons, daughters and grandchildren
of many noble Lords here today do not feel the same need for paper. In
exactly one month’s time, many will be sending Christmas e-cards
to friends and relatives. Some people lack the space or inclination to
store reams of bills. They want information at their digital
fingertips, not buried somewhere in a pile on the coffee table. I
recognise some of the statistics that have been adduced this evening
about people being less efficient if they receive bills
online.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1311263000131" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0002.htm#1311263000131">The
challenge to service providers is therefore to cater for the full
spectrum of their customers, providing options and reassurance on
billing and prices for the digital and non-digitally minded alike. The
questions before us are, first, whether there should be an ongoing,
default right to receive documentation through the post by request;
secondly, if so, who should foot the cost; and, finally, how it might
be underpinned by legislation. I reassure noble Lords that there are
already several protections in place for the vulnerable, including the
elderly. The Equality and Human Rights Act ensures that the rights of
those physically unable to access material online are protected. More
generally, the Consumer Rights (Payment Surcharges) Regulations 2012
prohibit excessive charges being applied to specific 
<?notus-xml column=1262?>ways of paying, such as paying over the counter at the Post Office.
Regulators such as Ofwat and Ofcom ensure that protections are in
place, in their sectors, for the most vulnerable. As was mentioned by
the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, blind or visually impaired people can get
their bills in an accessible format such as Braille. In the energy
sector, for example, suppliers are not able to levy an additional
charge for sending paper bills, but they may still offer a discount to
those paying online. In so doing, I make it clear that they are not
penalising the paper bill recipient but sharing genuine cost savings
with the online customer.</hs_para>

For example, special tariffs for telephones, such as BT Basic, are
available to those on low incomes, providing paper bills at no
additional charge. In banking, thanks to the Parliamentary Commission
on Banking Standards, access to transactional accounts is being
broadened so that more people can use electronic
payments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311263000133" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0002.htm#1311263000133">I
hope that this provides some reassurance but, as I said before, the
digital age is moving rapidly upon us and much of it is driven by
demand for efficiency and savings. According to the <I>Digital
Efficiency Report</I> in 2011, the cost of an online transaction is 20
times lower than a phone one, and 30 times lower than a postal one.
Companies cannot ignore such figures and the Government also need to
consider savings.</hs_para>

drivers for change facing all of us that I might also mention. I
mentioned earlier that it was a complex picture. Banks, councils and
utilities, and the Government too, know that there is an increasing
demand from their customers or citizens to go green and cut paper.
People want to receive bills, receipts and statements online, reducing
their impact on the use of natural resources. One can understand why. I
might ask how many of your Lordships—I might ask myself this
question—spend the weekend sorting through the post and seeking
the right recycling bin to throw out those statements, receipts and
circulars which you judge you will never read again. While doing so,
you may ‘well also wonder at the number of trees cut down to
create all that paper. As a result, the specific question for us here
is whether government should focus its efforts on controlling how
business responds to customers—reflecting nominal and
justifiable charges to certain bills—or on making markets more
competitive to the benefit of all customers. Our stance remains to
leave operational decisions to companies to act within the commercial
spirit while putting in place the appropriate regime to ensure
competition and protect the most vulnerable in our
society<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T20:20:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311263000135" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0002.htm#1311263000135">It
may be that in 20 years’ time, when I am approaching my
eighties, this will be a largely paperless world. However, as the
Government have committed, those not online will not be left behind.
The Government’s approach to assisted digital exemplifies best
practice in helping people access digital services and the benefits
that going online can bring. Business should be looking to provide
similar assistance. This House may recognise that, with advancing
technology, the number of people feeling disfranchised by online
billing is likely to diminish over time. That does not mean that we
ignore the needs of the older generation. Options are there for

Oppenheim-Barnes raised the issue of some companies not being up front

sector regulations are in place that prescribe that such charges must
be set out in a clear, comprehensive and easily accessible form so that
consumers can make informed decisions. The consumer rights directive
will mean that suppliers should obtain consumers’ express
consent to any extra charges and that they should not use a tick-box
approach that requires consumers to un-tick boxes in order to avoid
charges. The directive must come into force by June
2014<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T20:23:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

The noble Baroness also raised the issue of payment by cheques. There
may be a legitimate charge for paying by cheques rather than paying
electronically, but this charge is not levied as a norm. Any such
charge would need to have been justified by relation to the additional
cost. That is underpinned by the Consumer Rights (Payment Surcharges)

noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, raised the issue of the response that he
received from Ofcom about his question regarding a charge from a bill

consumers have choice and can move to a different provider. On the role
of regulators, more widely, the Government have announced a number of
reviews 
<?notus-xml column=1264?>that look at competition and consumer issues. That may help to address
the comments raised earlier by the noble Baroness, Lady Hayter. For
example, the PM has asked the regulators to instigate an annual review
of the state of competition in the energy market. Ofcom published
telecoms proposals in the summer and the Government have called on the

in this part of the Bill may mean that protection is not afforded to
the types of council covered in the amendment. As such, it could result
in the parish council not being able to sell alcohol at its annual
fête because of a wider controlled drinking zone implemented by
the district council. I have listened very carefully to my noble
friend’s comments and have reflected on the amendment. If he
will agree to withdraw it, we will certainly consider any further and
wider implications of the change suggested and return to this on

is slightly more complicated. It applies yet again to the
sort of area in which I live where there are county councils
and district councils in a two-tier system. The district council will
be responsible for making public spaces protection orders. The county
council is the highways authority, which is responsible by law for
maintaining public rights of way to an acceptable standard
so as to ensure that people can walk on footpaths and ride
horses along bridleways, for example. County councils do not always
carry out those duties to a great extent, but nevertheless they are
responsible in law for maintaining these rights of way. It seems wrong
that the district council does not consult the county. The Minister has
already said that the Government will look favourably at making sure
that county councils, as highways authorities, are consulted. The
question is this: what if the highways authority objects to closing one
of its highways? Does it have a veto or not? I am suggesting that it

already discussed, additional consultation requirements associated with
public rights of way above and beyond those
expected more generally for a public spaces protection order. Those

Amendment 53H, I understand the issue here relates to areas where there

Lord lives in such an area, so do I. In the situation described in the

the county council is likely to act as the highway authority.
Therefore, in line with the consultation requirements I have just
described, before restricting access the district council should
consult the county council about the terms. However, I do not believe
that this should come with a right of veto. In the majority of cases
the evidence presented will be sufficient for both bodies, acting in

misreading this particular clause. I assumed that it was evidence of
the phenomenon where you have both a district council and a county

course, that the highway lies in two local authority areas, and that by
restricting it to one local authority, an adjacent local authority that
shares the

uncertainty about the meaning of this and that I am quite prepared to
write to noble Lords with all the detail. This is based on current
gating order legislation, which has been used for many years by
councils to deal with anti-social behaviour, so we might see a similar
clause there. Clause 60 needs to be read with Clause 61, in particular
subsection (1), which describes which public highways cannot be

exclude national and regional organisations that regularly represent
people who use rights of way, people who walk on access land, or people

group of organisations: perhaps the Ramblers, the British
Mountaineering Council and the Open Spaces Society and others. Why
should they not be able to bring a case to the High Court on behalf of
their members or of people who have appealed to them? Let us remember
that the Ramblers have rather more members than all the political
parties put together and is a representative organisation which is used
to taking such cases from time to time. Why is it excluded in this
case? Why is the right suddenly being closed down so that it can be
exercised only by people

resources to go to the High Court—perhaps they would have the

Faulks (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, this clause comes under the
heading “validity of orders”. From the way in which it is
framed it seems very much as though it is in the form of a judicial
review of an administrative order. What is interesting about the way in
which the whole scheme of the legislation is formed is that there is
the power to make, vary or discharge orders under Clause 57, so that
local people who are affected by the orders and are discontent with
them can vary or discharge them relatively simply. Yet here we have
this clause, which provides for a high-level challenge by way of
judicial
review<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T21:08:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

described in the Explanatory Notes as an appeal route for either an
order or variation of an order, but it contains the sort of
restrictions that you would expect in judicial review, in particular

locus standi—in other words, have you got the standing to
challenge this? I respectfully disagree with my noble friend that there
should be no restriction at all on who should be able to challenge the
orders. There is always a restriction; there has to be a proper
connection with the subject matter. Where we are concerned with a local
order covering a specific area, it seems only appropriate that those
given the opportunity to review it should be those with a close
connection with it, rather than somebody who simply has a general view
about the

I am slightly concerned about Clause 62(7), which appears to
say that this is the only way in which such an order can be challenged,
thereby ousting the jurisdiction of the court to carry out judicial
review. That is quite a radical step for a Government to take. If there
was no Clause 62, it seems to me that it would be perfectly open to
somebody affected and who had the appropriate standing to challenge
this order by way of judicial review on the grounds that it was
unlawful, just in the way that is set out within the body of Clause 62.
I wonder how necessary Clause 62 is at all. There is judicial review,
which I would suggest is very much a last resort, and then there are
the powers to vary or discharge it. Do we really need this rather
curiously described appeal that is really a judicial

read it properly, but this seems to be about a mechanism for
challenging process. It is not an appeals process so it does not do
what is says on the tin or in the Explanatory Notes. This is solely
about the validity of orders. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, is
concerned about the Ramblers’ Association acting on behalf of
ramblers who use a path. The association would only be able to
challenge an order on the basis that the local authority did not have
the power to make that order, or the particular variations, or that it
had not complied with the process described elsewhere in this clause. I
rather assumed that an appeal would be for somebody to look again at
the principles going into that decision, not whether the process was
followed correctly. This is not the clause described in the Explanatory

not understand why we have this one, given that all those cases would

would be helpful if the Minister told us if this clause is meant to

“unreasonable” was adequate protection, but each local
authority will interpret those words as it sees fit. How regularly does
an activity have to be carried out to be persistent or continuing? Can
that issue be taken to the High Court in challenging the validity of an

have the power to make a public spaces protection order or to include
particular prohibitions or requirements imposed by the order? Would
that include a challenge that the two conditions referred to in Clause
55(1) and (2) had not been met? If so, why does the Bill not set that
out clearly in Clause 62(2), or does a local authority not having the
power simply mean that the challenge can be only on the basis that the

it would help if I explain briefly how Clause 62 provides a process by
which a public spaces protection order can be challenged. The heading
is “Challenging the validity of orders” and that is what
the clause seeks to achieve. Within six weeks of an order being made or
varied, any interested person can appeal to the High Court to challenge
its validity. It is only right that those with an interest in the area
should be able to do this and, as such, this route is not open to those
who do not live in, regularly work in or regularly visit the

challenge can be made on two grounds. The first is that the local
authority did not have the power to make the order. The noble Lord,
Lord Rosser, is quite right to draw the attention of the Committee to
Clause 55, which stipulates the power that the order is
designed to provide for. For instance, this could be in cases where the
person challenging the order believes that the test for making an order
had not been met. The second ground is if the requirement in this part
of the Bill was not met; for example, if local community
representatives were not consulted as required by Clause
55(7)(b).</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1311263000206" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0003.htm#1311263000206">The
court has the power to quash the order, uphold it or quash any of the
individual elements, including its time and duration. The court can
decide to suspend the public spaces protection order in full or in part

an appeal does not necessarily mean that restrictions are lifted. But
this appeal mechanism acts as a valuable safeguard to ensure that local

those who live in, regularly visit or work in the area. I believe that
in doing so we have given the right people an appropriate safeguard.

an appeal to the High Court. The noble Lord, Lord Rosser, asked when
the restriction could be challenged when conduct does not justify the
proposed restriction—so, in other words, there is improper
balance. That is in Clause 55(3)(c). The noble Lord also asked why no
one need agree to an order for it to be made. The council will have to
consult the police and any community representatives they think
appropriate. They may not reach agreement on the
order<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T21:26:38"></hs_TimeCode> but, none

also asked how quickly a
PSPO<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T21:28:43"></hs_TimeCode> could be
made; each one must be made following the requirements of the Bill,
especially the consultation requirement. This will take different times

assessment of the need for immediate and urgent action if this is the

Greaves:</Member></B> I am most grateful, as I am sure other noble
Lords are. I have two quick points. For all this talk of whether it is
the High Court or judicial review, they are both way above the
abilities of ordinary people. If I go on a local footpath anywhere in
this country and I find that it is blocked and complain to 
<?notus-xml column=1279?>the highways authority, and the highways authority does nothing about
it, I can go to the court to make the highways authority do something
about it. That court is the magistrates’ court. However, if I
then find signs up saying that the local authority has just issued a
public spaces protection order to stop me walking on it, there is no
way on God’s earth that I will go to the High Court, because
ordinary folk do not do that kind of thing. There may well be Members
of this Committee and your Lordships’ House who spend half their
time in the High Court, but most of us do not; and after the one or two
occasions on which we have ever been there, we may never want to go
back

decisions like this, which affect basic, historic rights to walk on
paths and land, there needs to be a proper appeals mechanism just as
there is under the Highways Act. If a local authority closes a footpath
under the Highways Act and you do not like it, you can appeal to the
magistrates’ court. That is the sort of level at which ordinary
people can function. Are the Government saying that ordinary people are
not able to get help and support from organisations that can operate at
a higher level, such as the Ramblers or perhaps the CLA, but are on
their own? Sorry, but they are individuals, and it clearly states here
that it is about an individual, not even a local business, as the noble

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> My Lords, I understand that these are
probing amendments relating to the circumstances in which someone may
commit an offence when a public spaces protection order is breached. I
can see the reasoning behind Amendment 56ZA. Clearly, it is hard to see
how using a public right of way in an appropriate and responsible
manner, or mere presence on common land, a town or village green, or on
access land, could constitute an offence. However, in the extreme
circumstances where the council, in consultation with the relevant
bodies, has decided to place restrictions on access to the land that
apply to everyone, there must be a penalty for
breach.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311263000232" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0003.htm#1311263000232">Similarly,
Amendment 56ZB seeks to provide that it is not an offence to breach the
conditions of a public spaces protection order if the local authority
has not publicised it in a certain way. As I have said before, I do not
believe it is for primary legislation to state how restrictions will be
publicised; not least there may be situations where it is not necessary
or appropriate to do so in the entirely sensible way my noble friend
suggests. The place for this is in regulations or
guidance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311263000233" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0003.htm#1311263000233">However,
on the more important point of a defence of reasonable excuse, I would
like to assure my noble friend that a person commits an offence only if
they breach a condition without reasonable excuse. The courts carefully
consider whether there is a “reasonable 
<?notus-xml column=1281?>excuse” to breach an order if the local authority has not
publicised it appropriately. As such, regardless of what is in the
legislation, or indeed the guidance, it is in the best interests of the
local authority to make sure that people using the public space know
what is expected of them; otherwise, it becomes unenforceable. Earlier
this evening we discussed unenforceable legislation in connection with

that it criminalises trespass in certain circumstances where people not

problems that arise in the public open spaces for which the City is
responsible are no different in kind from those encountered in those
which local authorities manage. The case for public spaces protection
orders provided for by Chapter 2 of Part 4 of the Bill is therefore the
same. The control of dogs is a particular feature of the City’s
open spaces around London, but no doubt that feature is shared by many.
The Bill recognises this commonality by making the power to make orders
generally applicable to public spaces at the suit of the local
authority for the area, including those governed by private Acts by
agreement with those responsible for them. However, unlike the Clean
Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005, which introduced a similar,
more limited, regime to the one that we are considering, and is
applicable to the control of dogs, there is no provision in the Bill to
enable the custodians of public spaces governed by private Acts to make
such
orders<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T21:45:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

reasons why the principle applied in the 2005 Act is appropriate for
public spaces protection orders. Those responsible for public open
spaces under private Acts of Parliament also have responsibility for
enforcing the by-laws made under those Acts; the open spaces may cross
local authority boundaries—many of those for which the City is
responsible do so—and it makes practical sense to have an order
covering the open space as a whole rather than a patchwork with
different enforcing authorities and the practical evidential problems
of demarcation near
boundaries<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T21:46:21"></hs_TimeCode>; and
in relation to the 
<?notus-xml column=1283?>open spaces managed by the City, such an order will relieve public

seeks essentially to apply the same regime for public spaces protection
orders as set out in Chapter 2 of Part 4 of the Bill. The application
depends on a designation being made by the Secretary of State under
subsection (1) of the new clause. The new clause does not affect the
entitlement of the local authority for the area in which the open space
is located to make its own public spaces protection order. If the local
authority does so, any order made by the custodian of the open space
ceases to have effect under subsection (6). In other words, the local
authority has precedence if it wishes to regulate the open space
itself, although, as I have said, that eventuality would not seem to be
a particularly attractive practical
option<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T21:47:24"></hs_TimeCode>. Any
custodian of a public space—“statutory custodian”
in the terminology of the proposed new clause—wishing to make a
public spaces protection order must undertake the same consultation
procedure as is applied generally by the Bill to others seeking to make
an order. In addition, subsection (5) requires the custodian to consult
the local authority for the area in which the open space is
located.</hs_para>

it will unnecessarily restrain—perhaps “contain”

have an explanation of that. I raised it previously but did not get an

notices. My amendments are about closure notices, temporary notices and
extensions to closure notices. They insert a reference to
proportionality at every point. I anticipate that the Government will
say that we need not worry because the mechanism that has been designed
involves a local authority or a senior police officer, and they would
not apply for a closure notice and the court would not grant a notice

significant step. Closure has to be necessary but, as I read the
provisions, the behaviour itself need not be serious enough to justify
an order. For instance, one might want to close premises to preclude
offensive behaviour—that is one of the types of behaviour in
question—but what if the offensiveness is not of such an extreme
to justify closure? There are other types of behaviour that could lead
to closure notices being applied for and granted—for instance,
criminal behaviour, which surely could be dealt with through other
mechanisms.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1311263000253" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0003.htm#1311263000253">I
anticipate that we may be told that this is a matter for guidance, but
closing premises is a serious matter and the legislation must be very
clear so that we do not have to rely on guidance. Indeed, because it is
a serious matter, one ought to have in mind that in any notice applied
for or decision made the process should allow for challenge and
possibly even a subsequent claim. Therefore proportionality ought to be
integral to the power. I beg to

Smith of Basildon:</Member></B> My Lords, again, the reason for moving
a clause stand part debate is that it is a more satisfactory way of
addressing a number of different questions than tabling lots of
individual amendments. Noble Lords will recall that I raised this
matter briefly under the issue of corporate ASBOs, 
<?notus-xml column=1286?>which is one of the things that strikes me about closure notices. We
support the need to close premises, particularly if they are likely to
be a nuisance to members of the public or there could be disorder, but
this goes straight to closure. The point of the corporate ASBO proposal
that I put forward in our previous sitting was that prevention would be
better than cure, and it would be good to have a stage prior to closure
to try to get organisations, companies or premises facing disorder to
get their act together and prevent a nuisance taking
place<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T22:00:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311263000256" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0003.htm#1311263000256">I
have a few questions to raise with the Minister. Is it possible to have
some further clarification on what the “reasonable
grounds” would be? We do not want any confusion over the
slightly vague wording. I know that there are examples in other
legislation of reasonable grounds, but it would be helpful to have more
explanation of what the Government consider to be reasonable grounds
here. Another issue concerns the consultation in subsection (7). As the
Bill stands, a police officer or a local authority can issue closure
proceedings but they do not have to consult each other on this. There
is no requirement for the police to talk to the local authority or for
the local authority to talk to the police. In Committee in the other
place, Damian Green said that he thought the police and local
authorities would probably consult each other before issuing orders. It
does not seem a very satisfactory way to legislate to say that they
probably will. If it is appropriate that they do so, it should be
formalised in the legislation. The other question is: who should they
consult? The way in which the clause is drafted at present, a police
officer or local authority can consult who they think appropriate, but
that might not be each other. I cannot think of anyone more appropriate
to consult than the police and the local
authority<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T22:01:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1311263000257" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-0003.htm#1311263000257">It
would also be helpful to have the Government’s view on whether
they think it would be appropriate to publish the names of those who
have been consulted. Those who have been aggrieved by a closure perhaps
would understand the reasons more easily and be less likely to appeal
or try to stop the proposal if they understood who had been consulted
and the process was more transparent. If there had been widespread
consultation in an area, it would be understood that there was a
serious problem, but they might be more aggrieved if they found that
only one or perhaps two organisations had been consulted. That might in
turn give grounds for challenges to the closure. Subsection (7)

whether licensed or unlicensed. The notice allows for immediate action
while the longer-term order is put in place if it is required. This

noble Lords will agree that such a power requires safeguards. Of
course, local agencies already work informally with individuals and
businesses to mitigate the risks of crime and anti-social behaviour
before resorting to formal powers. This will continue to be the case.
Most businesses want to protect their customers and premises. Where
there is information that premises may be the location for or
contribute to crime and anti-social behaviour, they can be invited to
take action to tackle it, and many do.</hs_para>

information that she was seeking. The court has to be satisfied that
there is likely to be serious nuisance or disorderly, offensive or
criminal behaviour. The second element is that it is necessary to
prevent the nuisance or disorder from continuing, recurring or
occurring. In practice, we expect that in most cases informal measures
would be the right starting point.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-25T22:07:48"></hs_TimeCode> draft

It is a matter of evidence, usually comprising of witness statements

asked why we do not require the police and local authority to make
information about the closure of the premises more publicly available,
such as in a paper or some other way. The closure powers are flexible
in that they can be used for residential, business, licensed and
non-licensed premises. There may be circumstances where a short-term
closure of the premises is needed to resolve a problem, such as closing
a residential premises for 24 hours to prevent a Facebook party. That
would not be of interest to the wider public in that area, and
requiring the police or local authority to make a public announcement
of all closures would add an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy. That is
why we require the police and local authority to consult anyone they
think appropriate as well as the owner and occupier of the premises.
Clause 72 requires them, where possible, to fix a copy of the notice to
the

comment I will make is that of course the right of judicial review must
remain and human rights must

means that we should allow legislation which is insufficiently clear or

Government are trying to reduce the use of judicial review, so the
argument that that remedy is still available is not one which
particularly appeals to me. However, I imagine

intention to roll out nationally both Domestic Violence Protection
Orders (DVPOs) and the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme (DVDS)
across England and Wales from March 2014. This follows the successful
conclusion of two pilots to test these provisions. Tackling domestic
violence and abuse is one of my key priorities. I am determined to see
reductions in domestic violence and abuse and the Government’s
updated Violence against Women and Girls (VAWG) Action Plan sets out
our approach for achieving that. The Government is committed to
ensuring that the police and other agencies have the tools necessary to
tackle domestic violence, to bring offenders to justice, and ensure
victims have the support they need to rebuild their lives.</hs_para>

Protection Orders are a new power introduced by the Crime and Security
Act 2010, and enable the police to put in place protection for the
victim in the immediate aftermath of a domestic violence incident.
Under DVPOs, the perpetrator can be prevented from returning to a
residence and from having contact with the victim for up to 28 days,
allowing the victim a level of breathing space to consider their
options, with the help of a support agency. This provides the victim
with immediate protection. If appropriate, the process can be run in
tandem with criminal proceedings.</hs_para>

Disclosure Scheme introduces a framework with recognised and consistent
processes to enable the police to disclose to the public information
about previous violent offending by a new or existing partner where
this may help protect them from further violent offending. The DVDS
introduces two types of process for disclosing this information. The
first is triggered by a request by a member of the public
(“right to ask”). The second is triggered by the police
where they make a proactive decision to disclose the information in
order to protect a potential victim (“right to know”).
Both processes can be implemented within existing legal
powers.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Statement"><hs_DebateHeading UID="1311252000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125-wms0001.htm#1311252000107">EU:

upholding decisions on asylum and other case types are calculated using
a case information database which records data that includes the
outcomes of appeal hearings and the name of the officer who presented
the case. This data is used on a monthly basis by managers as part of
the overall assessment of performance, and provides the percentage of
cases, in respect of each Presenting Officer, in which he or she was
the successful party. One of the ways in which we aim to improve the
efficiency of the appeals system, and our customer service, is to
ensure as far as we can that only appropriate cases proceed to
an appeal at court. For this reason we endeavour to review all
appeal cases in advance of any appeal hearing, and therefore, the win
rate targets for Presenting Officers apply to cases that have already
been assessed and judged to be arguable. This is supported by an
‘Appeals Quality Assessment’ process by which managers
regularly observe, assess, and provide feedback, to Presenting Officers
having regard to the quality and effectiveness of their advocacy at
court.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13112513000149" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131125w0001.htm#13112513000149">Presenting

Wallace of Saltaire (LD):</Member> The issue of forfeiture is a
separate issue from the conviction for an offence.  Information
about pension entitlement is confidential personal information. 
The small number of forfeiture cases each year means that disclosure
would make it possible to identify individual Civil Service pension
scheme members who have forfeited, in whole or in part, their pensions
following their conviction of an offence in connection with their
employment that brought the Civil Service into disrepute. As there are
Statutory obligations not to disclose personal information there has
been no formal assessment of the deterrent value. It is for individual
Civil Service employers to decide whether an offence is of sufficient

continues to suffer from a range of governance problems which adversely
