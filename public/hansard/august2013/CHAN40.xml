am deeply mindful of the lessons of previous conflicts and, in
particular, of the deep concerns in the country that were caused by
what went wrong with the Iraq conflict in 2003. However, this situation
is not like Iraq. What we are seeing in Syria is fundamentally
different. We are not invading a country. We are not searching for
chemical or biological weapons. The case for ultimately supporting
action—I say “ultimately” because there would have
to be another vote in this House—is not based on a specific
piece or pieces of intelligence. The fact that the Syrian Government
have, and have used, chemical weapons is beyond doubt. The fact that
the most recent attack took place is not seriously doubted. The Syrian
Government have said it took place. Even the Iranian President said
that it took place. The evidence that the Syrian regime has used these
weapons, in the early hours of 21 August, is right in front of our
eyes. We have multiple eye-witness accounts of chemical-filled rockets
being used against opposition-controlled areas. We have thousands of
social media reports and at least 95 different videos—horrific
videos—documenting the evidence.</hs_Para>

Europe was divided over what should be done; now, Europe is united in
the view that we should not let this chemical weapons use stand. Then,
NATO was divided; today, NATO has made a very clear statement that
those who are responsible should be held accountable. Back in 2003, the
Arab League was opposed to action; now, it is calling for it. It has

President of the United States, Barack Obama, is a man who opposed the
action in Iraq. No one could in any way describe him as a President who
wants to involve America in more wars in the middle east, but he
profoundly believes that an important red line has been crossed in an
appalling way, and that is why he supports action in this case. When I
spoke to President Obama last weekend I said we shared his view about
the despicable nature of this use of chemical weapons and that we must
not stand aside, but I also explained to him that, because of the
damage done to public confidence by Iraq, we would have to follow a
series of incremental steps, including at the United Nations, to build
public confidence and ensure the maximum possible legitimacy for any

us—as a Government, as a House of Commons, as a world—is
that there is the

reprehensible, so do we want to try to maintain that law? Put simply,
is it in Britain’s national interest to maintain an

drawing up that vital protocol—which, incidentally, Syria

finds the greatest difficulty—ascribing motives. Lots of motives
have been ascribed. For my part, I think the most likely possibility is
that Assad has been testing the boundaries. At least 14 uses and no
response—he wants to know whether the world will respond to the
use of these weapons, which I suspect, tragically and repulsively, are
proving quite effective on the battlefield. But in the end we cannot
know the mind of this brutal dictator; all we can do is make a judgment
about whether it is better to act or not to act and whether he is

disagreements there are over the complex situation in Syria, I believe
that there should be no disagreement that the use of chemical weapons
is wrong. As I said, almost a century ago the world came together to
agree the 1925 treaty and to outlaw the use of chemical weapons, and
international law since that time has reflected a determination that
the events of that war should never be repeated. It put a line in the
sand; it said that, whatever happens, these weapons must not be used.
President Assad has, in my view, crossed that line and there should now
be consequences. This was the first significant use of chemical weapons
this century and, taken together with the previous 14 small-scale
attacks, it is the only instance of the regular and indiscriminate use
of chemical weapons by a state against its own people for at least 100
years.</hs_Para>

in another country’s affairs should not be undertaken except in
the most exceptional circumstances. There must be, as my hon. Friend
has just said, a humanitarian catastrophe, and the action must be a
last resort. By any standards, this is a humanitarian catastrophe and
if there are no consequences for it, there will be nothing to stop
Assad and other dictators using these weapons again and again. As I
have said, doing nothing is a choice—it is a choice with
consequences. These consequences would not just be about President
Assad and his future use of chemical weapons; decades of painstaking
work to construct an international system 
<?notus-xml column=1435?>of rules and checks to prevent the use of chemical weapons and to
destroy stockpiles will be undone. The global consensus against the use
of chemical weapons will be fatally unravelled. A 100-year taboo will
be breached. People ask about the British national interest. Is it not
in the British national interest that rules about chemical weapons are
upheld? In my view, of course it is, and that is why I believe we
should not stand idly

I have said, I have consulted the Attorney-General and he has confirmed
that the use of chemical weapons in Syria constitutes both a war crime
and a crime against humanity. I want to be very clear about the process
that we follow—the motion is clear about that. The weapons
investigators in Damascus must complete their work. They should brief
the United Nations Security Council. A genuine attempt should be made
at a condemnatory chapter VII resolution, backing all necessary
measures. Then, and only then, could we have another vote of this House
and British involvement in direct military action. I have explained,
again, the legal position and I do not need to repeat it, but I urge
colleagues to read this legal advice, which I have put in the Library

Dempsey letter was addressing the point that if we wanted entirely to
dismantle, or to attempt to dismantle, Syria’s weapons arsenal,
that would be an enormous undertaking which would involve ground troops
and all sorts of things, but that is not what is being proposed; the
proposal, were we to take part, would be to attempt to deter and
degrade the future use of chemical weapons. That is very different. I
do not want to set out at the Dispatch Box a list of targets, but it is
perfectly simple and straightforward to think of actions that we could
take relating to the command and control of the use of chemical
weapons, and the people and buildings involved, that would indeed deter
and degrade.

have those weapons or delivery systems and that the attack took place

attributing it precisely to President Assad and in calling for

me answer a final question that has been put in the debate over recent

people here in Britain. This is a vital question, and it is one that
was not asked enough in 2003. This question was asked at the National
Security Council yesterday, and we have received considered analysis
from our counter-terrorism experts. Their assessment is that, while as
ever there is no room for complacency, the legal, proportionate and
focused actions that would be proposed will not be a significant new
cause of radicalisation and extremism. I would make this point: young
Muslims in the region and here in Britain are looking at the pictures
of Muslims suffering in Syria, seeing the most horrific deaths from
chemical weapons and many of them may be asking whether the world is
going to step up and respond, and I believe that the right message to

situation and the actions that we take are so very different. We must
ensure that any action, if it is to be taken, is proportionate, legal
and specifically designed to deter the use of chemical weapons. We must
ensure that any action supports and is accompanied by a renewed effort
to forge a political solution and relieve humanitarian suffering in
Syria. But at the same time, we must not let the spectre of previous
mistakes paralyse our ability to stand up for what is right. We must

start by joining the Prime Minister in expressing revulsion at the

attack. I can assure hon. Members that the divide that exists does not
exist over the condemnation of the use of chemical weapons and the fact
that it breaches international law; nor does it lie in the willingness
to condemn the regime of President Assad.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T15:19:18"></hs_TimeCode> question

is right to say at the beginning of my remarks that the Prime Minister
said a couple of times in his speech words to the effect that,
“We are not going to get further involved in that conflict. This
does not change our stance our Syria.” I have got to say to the
Prime Minister, with the greatest respect, that that is simply not the
case. For me that does not rule out military intervention—I want
to be clear about this—but I do not think anybody in this House
or in the country should be under any illusions about the effect on our
relationship to the conflict in Syria if we were to intervene
militarily. As I say, and as I shall develop in my remarks, that does
not, for me, rule out intervention, but we need to be clear-eyed about
the impact that this would have.</hs_Para>

me also say that this is one of the most solemn duties that this House

upholding international law and legitimacy, how can me make the lives
of the Syrian people better? We should also have in our minds—it
is right to remember it on this occasion—the duty we owe to the
exceptional men and women of our armed forces and their families, who

basis on which we make this decision is of fundamental importance,

moral authority of any action that we undertake. That is why our

decision on this issue—a set of steps that will enable us to
judge any recommended international action. I want to develop the

thing for the House to support today.</hs_Para>

of all, if we follow this road map, it can assure the country and the

any decision we make. This is fundamental to the principles of Britain:
a belief in the rule of law and a belief that any military action we
take must be justified in terms of the cause and also the potential

are in the midst of their work and will be reporting in the coming
days. That is why today could not have been the day on which the House
was asked to decide on military action. It is surely a basic point for
this House that evidence should precede decision, not decision precede
evidence. I am glad that, on reflection, the Prime Minister accepted
this
yesterday.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1308298000135" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/debtext/130829-0001.htm#1308298000135"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T15:23:14"></hs_TimeCode>Now
it is true—some have already raised this issue—that the
weapons inspectors cannot reach a judgment on the attribution of blame.
That is beyond their mandate. Some might think that that makes their
work essentially irrelevant. I disagree. If the UN weapons inspectors
conclude that chemical weapons have been used, in the eyes of this
country and of the world that will confer legitimacy on the finding
beyond the view of any individual country or any intelligence agency.
What is more, it is possible that what the weapons inspectors discover
could give the world greater confidence in identifying the perpetrators
of this horrific
attack.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1308298000136" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/debtext/130829-0001.htm#1308298000136"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T15:23:45"></hs_TimeCode>The
second step in our road map makes it clear that there must be
compelling evidence that the Syrian regime was responsible for the

Intelligence Committee today, and I note the Arab League’s view
of President Assad’s culpability. Of course, as the Prime
Minister said, in conflict there is always reason for doubt, but the
greater the weight of evidence the better. On Tuesday we were promised
the release of American intelligence to prove the regime’s
culpability. We await publication of that evidence, which I gather will
be later today. That evidence, too, will be important in building up

because there will be those who argue that in the event of Russia and
China vetoing a Security Council resolution, any military action would
necessarily not be legitimate. I understand that view but I do not
agree with it. I believe that if a proper case is made, there is scope
in international law—our fourth condition—for action to
be taken even without a chapter VII Security Council resolution. Kosovo
in 1999 is the precedent cited in the Prime Minister’s speech

consequences of the military action envisaged are very unquantifiable,
because the objectives are, frankly, pretty soft in terms of degrading

Malcolm Rifkind:</Member></B> Let us use another occasion, if we may,
to debate these important allegations. The issue is that the Syrian
Government themselves do not deny that they have massive stocks of
chemical weapons, and therefore the issue is whether there is any
credible argument that on this particular occasion, in a district
controlled by the opposition, the opposition somehow had both the
capability and the will, and indeed did carry out this
attack<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T15:46:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1308298000204" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/debtext/130829-0001.htm#1308298000204">The
inspectors’ reports will be helpful in two respects, I hope.
First, they will give confirmation of the scale of this chemical
attack. If only three or four people die, it could be argued that
somebody could have been carrying around a bag of chemical agent and
dispersed it, as happened in the Tokyo underground a good number of
years ago. But when there are not just 300 people dying, but more than
3,000 people treated by Médecins Sans Frontières, clearly
this was a massive chemical weapons attack which required rockets and a
capability which, as we have heard, no one else in Syria has now or is
likely to have in the short to medium
term<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T15:47:22"></hs_TimeCode>. Against

question then becomes, what is the purpose if military action is taken?
It is not only going to be limited, as the Prime Minister has rightly
said, but it has one overwhelming purpose, which has to be to deter
further acts of the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime. Let me
be emphatic about this—I hope  
<?notus-xml column=1450?>no one would argue otherwise—that at this very moment, the Assad
regime in Damascus are watching very carefully to see whether they will
get away with what they have done. If they get away with it, if there
is no international response of a significant kind, we can be
absolutely certain that the forces within Damascus will be successful
in saying, “We must continue to use these whenever there is a
military rationale for doing
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T15:48:15"></hs_TimeCode>.”
There is no guarantee that a military strike against military targets
will work, but there is every certainty that if we do not make that
effort to punish and deter, these actions will indeed
continue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T15:48:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1308298000206" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/debtext/130829-0001.htm#1308298000206">The
other point that must concentrate all our minds very comprehensively is
that a failure to act is not in itself an absence of a decision. It has
profound other consequences, not just the ones I have mentioned, and
most profound for the United Nations itself. The League of Nations
effectively collapsed in the 1930s when Germany and Italy effectively
prevented any sanctions or other action being taken against Italy for
the invasion of Abyssinia. That, together with other similar acts of
aggression which the League could not handle because of the absence of
unanimity, created a chaos which led to the second world war. So if we
can take action that has the support of Arab states and of the bulk of
the international community, far from suffering, the United Nations and
the concept of international institutions and the international
community acting to deal with such acts of aggression will be boosted
in a way that would not happen through any other course of

support there, either. We cannot allow a situation whereby the
international community’s ability to implement international law

was a member of the Cabinet that decided in good faith that this
country should join the invasion of Iraq, and I know how heavy the
burden is on those who are charged with such a decision. I also agree
that, in many cases, doing nothing is as much a decision as doing
something and that the present catastrophe in Syria demands a decision
of us. As has been said, the use of chemical weapons is prohibited by
customary international law and binding conventions. Short of the use
of nuclear weapons, it is the most heinous crime a country can commit,
made even more dreadful when chemical weapons are used in civil war on
its own people.</hs_Para>

am therefore unhesitatingly in favour of taking the step that will deal
as effectively as we can with Assad. But what is that step? What is our
locus? How can we be effective, and at what cost? I want to deal with
the last question first. The cost in human suffering and human life is

is obviously deeply frustrating that Russia and China have formed a
blocking minority in the Security Council, and I know that Members will
want to reinforce the importance of diplomatic initiatives to seek to
engage Russia, in particular, in negotiation with the Syrian
Government. However, it is also clear that to go to war with
Assad—that is what it would be—without the sanction of a
UN Security Council resolution would set a terrible precedent. After
the mission creep of the Libyan operation, it would amount to nothing
less than a clear statement by the US and its allies that we were the
arbiters of international right and wrong when we felt that right was
on our side. What could we do or say if, at some point, the Russians or
Chinese adopted a similar argument? What could we say if they attacked
a country without a UN resolution because they claimed it was right and
cited our action as a precedent?

in Syria in the past months and years of the brutal conflict
there—in particular following the recent apparent chemical
weapons attacks on civilians. There is absolute unanimity, here and
internationally, that the use of those indiscriminate weapons is
unacceptable and the United Nations is right to be investigating the
circumstances of the
attacks.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1308298000254" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/debtext/130829-0001.htm#1308298000254">If
we are serious about our support for the United Nations, the inspectors
must be able to complete their work and report back to the world
community before any course of new action is undertaken. If, as we
expect, it is confirmed that chemical weapons were used, one of the
first things that should be made clear is that whoever ordered and
carried out those attacks will, in time, face the full force of the
law. Regardless of what may otherwise happen in the short term, the
perpetrators of such a crime should understand that they face
indictment by the International Criminal Court or by a specially
convened war crimes
tribunal.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1308298000255" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/debtext/130829-0001.htm#1308298000255">Today,

that we should vote for a blank cheque that would have allowed UK
military action before UN weapons inspectors concluded their
investigations and before their detailed evidence was provided to the
United Nations—or, indeed, Members of this House. Following our
having been misled on the reasons for war in Iraq, the least the UK

appeal to Government Members to look closely at the amendment and ask
themselves what is wrong with the safeguard it proposes. Surely the UN
weapons inspectors must be able to conclude their mission and have the 
<?notus-xml column=1458?>necessary opportunity to report to the Security Council on the evidence
and their findings on whether chemical weapons were used in Syria.
Surely we must have definitive evidence that the Syrian regime or
opposition was responsible for the use of these weapons—with the
greatest respect, that means not just two pages of A4 paper. Surely the
UN Security Council must consider and vote on this matter in the light
of the reports of the weapons inspectors and the evidence submitted.
Surely there must be a clear legal basis in international law for
taking collective military action to protect the Syrian people on
humanitarian grounds. And surely the aims, objectives and consequences
of any intervention must be made clear and must not run the risk of
escalating the conflict, causing further deaths and worsening the
humanitarian situation. The safeguards in the amendment are absolutely
clear and will bring the issue back for a parliamentary vote before any
UK military intervention is possible. Should these safeguards not be

Ottaway</B> (Croydon South) (Con):</Member> There are four key
questions we have to address. Is there a moral case? Does the
intelligence stack up? Is this lawful? What is the objective? The moral
case is something each individual MP will have to decide, based on his
own character, morality and attitude to world affairs. Many colleagues
and friends are, in principle, non-interventionists, whereas others
have a strong interventionist streak. Others say, “If that
criterion is met, or this, maybe.” We all wrestle with the
conflict between head and heart. Some say that the murder of hundreds
of innocent citizens by chemical weapons is nothing to do with us and
that it is easier not to get involved, but I ask them to examine their
conscience.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1308298000267" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/debtext/130829-0001.htm#1308298000267">Syria
is a signatory to the Geneva protocol of 1925 prohibiting the use of
chemical weapons. It was a protocol drawn up in the aftermath of the
first world war, when the world said, “Never again.” Do
we now say, “Well, never mind, let’s just sit on our
hands and ignore the atrocities taking place”? This is not just
any ordinary convention; it is a convention on genocide and the abuse
of basic morality. Some say, “What’s the difference
between being killed by an artillery shell or by sarin gas?”
With everything in life there is a red line—a straw that breaks
the camel’s back—and, to me, this is it. In my judgment,
faced with the mass murder of innocent civilians, doing nothing is not
an option.</hs_Para>

huge diplomatic clout, but with the benefits come responsibilities, and
this is just the moment when we must ask ourselves what those

lessons from Iraq, and I want to refer to three. First, there is no
automatic approval of, or even trust in, a prime ministerial judgment
on an issue such as this involving the country in military action
without overwhelming justification, evidence and thorough debate. The
evidence before us from the JIC today says that there is “some
evidence” to suggest regime culpability in the gas attack and
that it is “highly likely” that the Syrian regime is
responsible. I have to say that “highly likely” and
“some evidence” are not good enough to risk further
lives, to risk counter attack, to inflame the whole region, to risk
dragging other states into this war and, at the same time, to increase
the risk of terrorism on British streets.</hs_Para>

lesson of Iraq is based upon the principles of humanitarian
intervention. It must be objectively clear that there is no practical
alternative to the use of force if lives are to be saved. I do not
believe that it has been demonstrated that all practical alternatives
have been exhausted. In particular, discussions around the permanent
stationing of UN weapons inspectors in Syria to prevent the use of
these weapons have not been exhausted. That, linked to an insistence on
the participation of all sides in a UN peace conference, has not been
exhausted.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1308298000283" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/debtext/130829-0001.htm#1308298000283"><Member ContinuationText="Jeremy Corbyn" PimsId="2717" UID="1308298000504" xid="133" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/debtext/130829-0001.htm#1308298000504"><B>Jeremy

McDonnell:</Member></B> That leads to my third lesson from Iraq, and
from Afghanistan. It is to ensure that any intervention does not cost
lives and does not make matters worse; it is the “do no
harm” principle. No matter how surgical the strike that is
planned by the 
<?notus-xml column=1462?>Americans or by us, lives will be lost and lives will be put at risk. A
negotiated peace is the only long-term solution for Syria; that is what
has been expressed by members of all parties in the House. Military
intervention is more likely to undermine the potential for peace talks.
Hawks within the Assad regime will be even more intransigent and
defiant. The opposition—the so-called rebels—will have no
incentive, because they will believe that the US and, yes, the UK and
others will be on their side and that they can achieve a military
victory. Military intervention would also alienate Iran and the
Russians—the very people we look to now to bring Assad to the
negotiating table.</hs_Para>

learned anything from Iraq and Afghanistan, it is this: military
intervention does not just cost lives; it undermines the credibility of
the international institutions that we look to to secure peace in the
world and, in the long run, it undermines peace settlements across the
globe. Therefore, I believe that we should focus on conflict prevention
and conflict resolution and not support military aggression. That is
why I will not support any motion that, in principle, supports military
intervention in Syria, which can only do more harm than
good.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="1308298000347" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/debtext/130829-0001.htm#1308298000347"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T16:34:59"></hs_TimeCode>4.34

found it very difficult to find any country that can make a non-stick

first supporting the movements rising against the Mubarak regime in
favour of democracy, and then siding with the army when it carried out
a coup and overthrew a democratically elected Government. Gaddafi was
condemned for Lockerbie, then lauded for opposing al-Qaeda, then
condemned again swiftly when the situation turned in Libya. In the

Minister pointed out, poison gas was extensively used in battle in the
first world war. That led to a revulsion that was formulated by the
1925 Geneva gas protocol, which banned the use of poison gases but did
not prevent a country from possessing a stockpile so that it could
threaten retaliation if attacked by such gases. That protocol had
nothing to do with the fact that poison gas was not used in the second
world war—what prevented Hitler from using it was the threat of
overwhelming retaliation. Indeed, sarin and tabun were nerve gases that
Nazi scientists invented in the 1930s and 1940s. Hitler proposed to use
tabun in 1943 but was deterred from doing so by the mistaken belief
that the allies had discovered it too, although they had not.
Similarly, Churchill thought of using poison gas against the V-weapons
in 1944, and decided not to do so on military advice. The gas protocol

that there is intercept evidence that somebody who was unauthorised was
responsible and that there was a telephone conversation in which
somebody said, “Why on earth did you do this?” and a
panicked reaction to the unauthorised release of poison gas. The point
is that it is very far from certain that the evidence stacks up. The

been killed in the civil war, most of whom were civilians. Death by
dismemberment, burning, being crushed under falling buildings, gangrene
or all the other outcomes of the use of conventional weapons is no
better than death by nerve gas—these are monstrosities, however
they are delivered. In moral, as against legal, terms many people will
rightly, as they have in this debate, ask: why intervene now?</hs_Para>

case, the Government and American Government, now supported by the JIC,
have asserted, in effect, that the gassing of a large number of Syrian
civilians could have been carried out only by the Assad regime.
Perhaps<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>. There
are three possibilities. The first, and probably the most likely, is
that nerve gas was deployed by Assad, but even the JIC says that this
is an irrational and incomprehensible act.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for New Forest East (Dr Lewis) pinned that perfectly.
Another possibility is that it could have been done by a rogue or
panicky military unit in the Syrian army without Assad’s
knowledge—that may be the most likely explanation—or it
could have been done by the Syrian rebels with the direct aim of
dragging the west into the war. These are the only people
who have a clear motive that fits the crime. The JIC discounted that
last possibility, but there are many reasons for us to worry
about this concern. We do not want to be conned into a war, in effect,

I do not believe that there is any military solution to the wider
situation in Syria. There needs to be a far greater effort to force the
parties into a negotiating structure. Above all, that means that there
must be much greater engagement by Russia and the United States. I
understand the reticence of the United States in such matters, but it
has been very late to give this crisis its full attention. Secretary
Kerry’s recent involvement in the middle east is much to be
welcomed. The UK’s less chilly relationship with Putin and
Russia can help. The situation is made worse by the lack of
international reaction to the earlier chemical attacks in June. At some
point this logjam at the United Nations will be broken, and every sinew
must be stretched to achieve that. Britain’s immensely strong
and effective diplomatic abilities give us a hugely important part to
play in that around the

visited the Zaatari camp on the

children who entered it were shot at by the Syrian army as they went
over the border. That camp has been strongly supported and funded by
Britain and is now, in effect, the fourth biggest city in Jordan. There
are now more than 2 million refugees. This is the largest movement of
civilians across borders since the genocide in Rwanda in 1994.

with many of those present and to say that, in my opinion, we are all
united in our disbelief and deep sense of grief and revulsion at the
tragedy that is  
<?notus-xml column=1475?>unfolding in Syria. All of us in this House know that this conflict has
gone on in its current phase for two years and has ripped the heart out
of that country and its long-suffering people. However, my colleagues

about any prospect of military action, the bombing—whether it be

this course appears to have been embarked
on.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13082911000002" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/debtext/130829-0002.htm#13082911000002">Our<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T16:14:16"></hs_TimeCode>

level, we believe that any military activity will be counter-productive
and will not save lives but in fact cost them. As was

wish also to pose the question of how the sight of a British and US-led
attack is likely to be perceived across the middle east, not just in
Syria, especially if it is carried out without credible UN backing or
on the basis of uncertain or confused intelligence. That would risk
handing the Syrian regime a major propaganda victory at a pivotal
point, which its supporters could rally around. The impact on the wider
region is even more uncertain and potentially volatile. Even if such
action could ever be morally justified, which I and my colleagues do
not accept, there surely needs to be a serious prospect of an endgame

what success might look like or how it would be measured. We are told
that this action might persuade Assad to consider not using chemical
weapons in the future, but I have little faith that such a course of
action will not make his position better rather than worse. There is a
clear risk that even more lives will be lost and even more harm done
than we are trying to prevent. I can only see that cruise missile
attacks will take lives—hundreds, if not thousands, of
lives—of combatants and civilians alike. There is little

forces alone cannot do. I am not against all intervention. Of course,
when we had to liberate Kuwait or the Falkland Islands, they were noble
aims. Our armed forces performed with great skill and bravery, and the
British public were behind them. We must be very careful, however, not
to inject them into a civil war where we do not know the languages,

third thing I welcome is that the Government are not trying to
influence the conflict. That is an important new development, although
I am not sure how it marries with possible military intervention. If
military intervention is planned, I presume that it will be against
Assad and his forces and that, of course, would have some impact on the
conflict. That impact might be in the direction that the Government and
others wish to go, but they need to accept that there is a possible
contradiction or ambiguity between their wish not to have an impact on
the balance of forces in Syria and their wish to intervene over the
issue of chemical weapons.</hs_Para>

atrocities and horrors enough without chemical weapons—those

the understandable wish to respond to the use of horror weapons, we
need to ask whether the Government could undertake, or assist others to
undertake, a military intervention that would fulfil the purpose. That
should be the only question. Of course I understand that the Government
cannot come to the House and debate a  
<?notus-xml column=1478?>series of targets with us in advance—that would be folly.

right questions of their advisers about whether there is any type of

worse.</hs_Para>

experts to whom I have talked say that the last thing we want to do is
shower down bombs or cruise missiles on stocks of chemical weapons;
that would degrade them, but could let them out as well. It would be a
dreadful tragedy if, in an attempt to stop, by destruction, the use of
chemical weapons, we infected people in the surrounding areas. That

bombing the stocks of chemical

the idea to bomb the soldiers and their commanders who might use the

Government how many soldiers and officers we would need to kill to
guarantee more or less that Assad would not use the weapons again. I

they wish to persuade the British people, who are mightily sceptical
about our ability to find the right military response to stop Assad and

Assad murdering his own people, nobody will be happier than me.
Everyone in the House would be extremely happy. But the Government have
to understand the scepticism of the British people. Assad is mad and
bad and it will not be easy to stop him. I fear that we will not be

have no doubt that we are all united in complete condemnation of the
deplorable chemical attacks on civilians in Damascus. The gut-wrenching
images of those attacks are etched on all our minds as we sit here
tonight. All of us seek an outcome that will bring peace and stability
to the region. That much we can agree. It is also the case that this
motion is less damaging than the one we were originally led to believe
we would be debating. That is a tribute to the fact that Back-Bench and
Opposition MPs can make a difference. To that extent, this is a good
day for Parliament and for public pressure. It is clear to me that
those things have helped to force the Government to think twice about
their way forward on Syria.</hs_Para>

welcome the fact that this motion recognises that to have proceeded
with a military attack as the UN weapons inspectors were still visiting
the sites of the alleged chemical weapons assault would have been
preposterous. It beggared belief that, once again, we could have been
about to embark on military engagement, without apparently having
learned any of the lessons from Iraq and Afghanistan. By seeking to
pre-empt the outcome of the inspectors’ work, we would also have
increased the likelihood that further requests for access by weapons
inspectors would be denied; they would be regarded simply as a ploy for
subsequent military action, regardless of the findings. As Hans Blix
pointed out earlier this week:</hs_Para>

the aim is to stop the breach of international law and to keep the lid

I am pleased that the Government’s motion now accepts that we
must wait for the inspectors’ reports, I am deeply concerned at
their cavalier treatment of international law and I completely reject
their drive towards military action. On the legal question, both the US
and our Government are indicating that they are prepared to act against
Syria without a UN mandate. For all that the Government’s motion
talks of making “every effort” to ensure a Security
Council resolution, the bottom line appears to be that they are happy
to proceed without one.</hs_Para>

are told that intervention could be legally justified without a
Security Council resolution under the UN’s responsibility to
protect, but the 2005 UN world summit outcome document, in which the
Heads of State unanimously approved the new international norm of the
responsibility to protect, subsequently approved by UN Security Council
resolution 1674, states clearly that it is still subject to UN Security
Council agreement. Former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who
co-chaired a working group on the responsibility to protect, again
stressed that it is to be implemented in accordance with the UN
charter. That means that the central decision-making authority is the
UN Security Council. The conclusion from all this is clearly, if
inconveniently for the Government, that military action against a
sovereign state, other than in self-defence, 
<?notus-xml column=1480?>without the authority of the Security Council cannot be justified under
the responsibility to protect. On that issue the Labour amendment is
also, unfortunately, very weak; it regards international law as an
inconvenience. That makes it all the more important that our

for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood) just said. I have yet to hear what the
strategy would be for Syria and the wider region in the event of an

an attack, but when he was asked what we would do in the face of such
an escalation, answer came there none. I remain concerned as well about

strain every sinew to get all relevant parties around the table for

others involved as well. We also absolutely need to redouble our
efforts to support refugees. We are hearing from many of the
development agencies, including Oxfam, that the situation facing those
refugees, both in Syria and the wider region, is appalling. More than 8
million people are now in desperate need of supplies. That is why
people who say, “If we don’t have military action, it is
equivalent to doing nothing”, are so misguided. There is much we
can do on refugees and a political

Apart from the fact that we cannot ensure that there will not be
collateral damage, there is the added problem that if it does not take
out the regime, the regime and its allies will still have some capacity
to act and might act in ways that escalate the situation.</hs_Para>

the point of the UN process and the point at which it would be

“That is the end of the matter” and that no action

has to be a legal framework that does not paralyse the UN because one

does my reluctance spring from doubts about the legality of action to
deter or prevent the further use of chemical weapons, even without a UN
resolution, but I am puzzled why the United States, the United Kingdom
and France stepped forward with alacrity to take on this unpopular
task. France, from which I have just returned, is the country whose
willingness to do so can most easily be explained. The decline in
President Hollande’s support was checked only by his successful
intervention in Mali, with boots on the ground. More importantly,
France has always believed that it has a special involvement in Syria.
However, President Hollande, and indeed anyone else who is thinking of
serious involvement on the ground in Syria, should read a report of the
last time that France was involved in Syria, written by President
Hollande’s predecessor, de Gaulle, when he was still a
commandant in 1931, describing how it took six years and nearly 10,000
French dead to restore peace in Syria after the first world war. We all
do well to remember just how difficult that country is to

chemical weapons but about the duty to protect people lead us to be

declaring war on his own people. When it was alleged that chemical

UN weapons inspectors were to go to the site. However, I was very

the awful responsibility of our leaders who find themselves as chief
executives in these circumstances. The witnessing of an appalling crime
on television, played out endlessly on YouTube and other internet
sites, showed that something utterly dreadful had happened. The
President of the United States, the Prime Minister of the United
Kingdom or the President of France, who all command armed forces that
could do something about it, then faced many pressures. The shadow
Health Secretary spoke emotionally about wanting to address this
appalling crime when he appeared on television last Sunday, but I think
the shadow Foreign Secretary was probably not wildly enthusiastic about
the implications of what his right hon. Friend said when he gave vent
to his feelings. It then falls to this Parliament coldly to consider
the effect of taking action when it is felt that something must done,

directed this particular use of weapons on this occasion, although I
can see that such weapons could be used where the responsibility has
been delegated to field commanders to help them out when they are in
desperate situations. The Joint Intelligence Committee information
seems to suggest that that might have happened on this occasion. As the
JIC suggests, there has been low-level use, and I would agree that the

Government have been dancing on the head of a pin, making the case that
this is absolutely and only about the use of chemical
weapons—because nothing else in international law would justify
the sort of intervention that is being proposed if agreement at the UN
Security Council cannot be reached. If we get to that grave position, I
think we have to be pretty certain about the effectiveness of the
military action before we take it. Are we going actively to degrade
chemical weapons? There are hideous practical problems in attempting
that, with the potential of awful collateral damage. If we go after the
command and control structure in a way that is sufficiently active to
degrade it, that plainly means going after Assad himself, thus actively
intervening on one side in the conduct of the war.</hs_Para>

Hendrick</B> (Preston) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> Syria’s use of
chemical weapons is either a huge mistake or, in my view, a calculated
attempt to test the resolve of the west, post Iraq and post
Afghanistan. If we look at the possibility that it was a mistake, it
could have been an official or a general who gave orders to the
relevant Government department for the use of chemical weapons without
the direct instruction of Assad; that scenario has been put forward by
reports appearing in <I>Foreign Affairs</I> magazine. Alternatively, it
could be a test to see whether Syria could get away with the use of
weapons of mass destruction, and whether the west would not have the
stomach for a challenge. Chemical weapons have been used in Syria
earlier, and until the recent red line from Obama the west did not
react, other than to threaten a red
line<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13082917000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/debtext/130829-0002.htm#13082917000028">The
weapons inspectors said that they needed another four days to finish
their investigations, plus, I am sure, a short time after that for
their report to be collated. Many of us believe that the regime is
responsible for the attacks, and those attacks are probably authorised
from a very senior level—probably Assad himself. But the
inspectors need to report back to the UNSC purely and simply to
establish due process—something that did not happen through the
Iraq conflict and the Iraq war that followed. I was a relatively new
MP, sat on the Bench just behind the Prime Minister, in 2003 when we
took the decision. We thought we had good intelligence, and that
intelligence was later found to be false. One of the lessons of the

finished, because powers elsewhere have decided to go ahead before the
Security Council has determined whether the evidence from the
inspectors is sufficient to meet the burden of proof required. It is
clear that without that Security Council resolution, any military

using those weapons, Syria has crossed the red lines set by Obama. Iran
is watching, helping to arm the regime and sending its own forces to
the regime. The Russians are arming the Syrians to the hilt and
wondering whether the west will act against the use of WMD. Iran knows
that if Syria can get away with using WMD, its own WMD, as well as its
development of nuclear weapons, could well be ignored, and Iran could
go on to produce more WMD and nuclear weapons without the intervention
or involvement of the west. That may provoke a response, if that were
to be allowed, from the Israelis. The Israelis will be looking, at some
point short of Iran’s having developed nuclear weapons, to
possibly take matters into their own hands. Indeed, if the situation
kicks off with the western intervention in Syria, and Iran responds,
and if Syria responds with an attack on Israel, that could be the
perfect excuse for the Israelis to try and deal, not only with the WMD
question and Syria, but also the nuclear question and Iran. We need to
take these things into consideration before we decide, as a result of
any UNSC deliberations and a UNSC decision, what action we

British military involvement might end. Since the second world war,
Britain has mostly fought what might be called wars of choice, but if
we initiate hostilities in the eastern Mediterranean, will what follows
continue to be fought on our terms and in the way we choose?

However, the autocrats fought back in Egypt and Syria as they once did

us look at what has been proposed today. What are we going to do?
Apparently we are going to send in a few Tomahawk land attack missiles

That is nonsense and a ridiculous proposition that will lead us to the
position that a lot of people have already begun to explain. We cannot
write Assad a letter and say, “By the way, the TLAM missile was
only to give you a spanking over chemical weapons. It didn’t
mean that we were interfering in your conflict in any way, shape or
form.” Frankly, that is nonsense.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T18:36:32"></hs_TimeCode> cannot
compartmentalise such activities in the way suggested, and there will
be an effect. What will that effect be? Well, there is lots of
information about why we are trying to do this. “He has used
chemical weapons.” Who has used chemical weapons? The hon.
Member for New Forest East (Dr Lewis) dealt with that point earlier in
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T18:36:25"></hs_TimeCode>a powerful

I agree. These people must be held to account for their actions at some
point. We do not now have an immediate almost knee-jerk
reaction—it was going to be knee-jerk but it is a week late
now—to the situation. The strike is apparently
“targeted”, but I do not know what that means. It is
targeted in the sense that we know where we will throw the missile, but
it is hardly a surgical, contained or compartmentalised activity. Will
we do that, or will we have a broader constituency of people who can

towards resolving the problem for the Syrian people unless and until we
grapple differently 
<?notus-xml column=1495?>with the question of those terribly difficult Chinese people and them
nasty Russkies. We must incentivise the Russians to be involved in a
process that caters for some of their needs. Libya has been mentioned
several times, and it has often been said that they are smarting from
what happened in Libya. Well, I do not know where we will be on
Monday—according to certain reports, we might be here on
Sunday—and things might have happened that are out of our
control. The Americans might have done something. However, unless and
until we can say to the Russians, “Okay. We understand some of
your concerns,” and incentivise them to be in the plan, we will
not resolve the situation. Any American activity now will not resolve
the situation. Later, the UN could agree and we might have to take
military action. The idea of sending half a dozen aeroplanes to

subjective—there are no hard and fast rules, but the best we
have is the UN. Is such action legal? Many have suggested that we
should look to the concept of the responsibility to protect, which was
introduced in 2005, but that is not linked to chemical weapons. R2P
could have been invoked 100,000 lives ago. Therefore, the idea that it
becomes relevant because chemical weapons have been used is a
non-starter.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13082919000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/debtext/130829-0002.htm#13082919000015">We
must also ask questions about the military objectives—there are
many questions on, for example, the scope of the operation and the
potential for mission creep. What happens if Assad uses chemical
weapons again or if the rebels use them? There are very few answers,
and we need more. The decision to commit to military intervention and
potentially to commit soldiers

saying, “You believe that nothing should be done. You’re
in that camp that says, ‘We should wash our hands of it and let

done on the humanitarian front. The refugee camps are desperately short
of basic amenities. Britain has a good record—we have done a lot
of the heavy lifting—but we could do a lot more, as could the
international community. Tens of thousands of women and children are
living in extremely poor conditions, and yet the west is saying,
“There’s very little more we can do to help the
humanitarian situation,” which is utter

west could also do a lot more on the diplomatic front. It makes no
sense whatever to exclude Iran from the forthcoming peace talks, but
that is what we currently intend to do. Iran is a key regional player
and a participant in this conflict. Excluding Iran from the talks is
utter nonsense. We need to go that extra diplomatic mile. This is a
cliché, but it is true: you make peace with your enemies, not
with your friends. We need to talk to the Iranians if we hope for a
diplomatic solution. A political and diplomatic solution, and not a
military one, is the only long-term solution to this vicious civil war.

suggestions. I do not think we have worked through the United Nations
mechanism. It may not be a brilliant organisation and we may all have
criticisms of it, but there is a lot more that could be done. We should
be putting much more diplomatic pressure on Russia. We should call in
the Russian ambassador and say, “We are going to expel you from
this country if you do not change Russia’s attitude.”
There are a number of things that we could do. Military action is the
very last option. I do not believe that we should go down that

military action will, as I said, lead to a completely different
attitude among many of our Muslim communities in this country. It will
be the catalyst for the build-up of all sorts of extremism. I know that
it is an extraordinarily difficult decision for Governments in these
situations and for the Opposition, but in such cases we must always
reflect on what is in our national interest. I do not believe that our
national interest will be served by military intervention in Syria or
that that is the way forward for this Parliament. We may return to the
issue in a few days, just because America is calling the shots. What
will the Prime Minister say if, over the weekend, America decides to go
it alone? How much influence will we have had? It is quite wrong that
we are being pushed by America. We should take our time, reflect and

Hitchens wrote recently, in support of the Assad regime, that the
Syrian Government were not lying and that it made “more
sense” for the opposition to poison and kill more than 1,000 of
their own people. If that is the case, however absurd, why, if they had
nothing to hide, did the Syrian Government and their chief sponsor on
the Security Council, Russia, block the United Nations chemical weapons
inspectors from going to the site when they were only 15 minutes away?
Instead, they continued to bombard the area and to degrade the evidence
as much as possible. I find it astounding how this kind of double-think
has become common currency among many of those who oppose the war. That
includes some Opposition Members who have been retweeting articles
along those lines from the Voice of Russia. Frankly, I would rather

President Assad.</hs_Para>

all? My answer is yes. Just because Tony Blair and Alastair Campbell
were economical 
<?notus-xml column=1504?>with the truth about the intelligence that they used to get us into
Iraq—through what has become known as the “dodgy

the middle east. The region is riven by conflicts between the
Shi’a and Sunni factions, and any action that we take against
Syria will have an impact. We can control the manner of our
intervention, but we have learned from our experiences in Iraq and
Libya that we cannot control the outcome of any intervention.</hs_Para>

Government’s motion that is causing us concern. The Government
talk about voices in the Arab world being raised in support of
intervention, but that does not mean that any such intervention would
not have consequences for the stability of the wider region. If we
intervene, where does it begin and end? I accept what the Government
say about intervention being focused on removing or diminishing the
capacity to use chemical weapons. That is a noble objective, but I am
concerned about the outcome of such an intervention. That is why I am

we all have a responsibility not to blindly follow party lines, but to

George Howarth</B> (Knowsley) (Lab):</Member> Like
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T19:31:27"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Watford (Richard Harrington), I begin by citing an e-mail I
received from a constituent who was opposed to any intervention and who
described himself as an ex-member of the armed services. Having listed
some cogent reasons why military intervention was not in his view
acceptable or sensible, he said at the end of his e-mail that, of
course, we run the risk of washing our hands of the fate of the people
of Syria, who are likely to be gassed in the future. He summed up
neatly the dilemma we all face today. I would not use the phrase,
“Damned if you do, damned if you don’t,” but there
is a fine line involved in deciding between one course of action and
another<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T19:32:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13082928000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/debtext/130829-0003.htm#13082928000026">I
want to address two points raised by the Prime Minister, but I will not
do so in a spirit of party political contention, because I want the
debate to progress in such a way that by the time we get to episode two
we can all understand more fully the Government’s intentions,
the action that might be taken and under what
circumstances<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T19:32:56"></hs_TimeCode>.
It would be helpful if the Deputy Prime Minister could address my
points
later<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T19:33:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13082928000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/debtext/130829-0003.htm#13082928000027">First,
the Prime Minister made it clear that any action taken would have the
primary if not sole objective of either deterring or degrading
Syria’s chemical weapons capability. There is a strong argument
in favour of taking such action, but unfortunately, when pressed by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T19:33:35"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mr Straw), the Prime
Minister was not able to give enough information—or certainly
was not able to put it clearly enough—to convince me that his
proposed course of action would achieve that end. That case needs to be
put more clearly. A stronger narrative about how it might work would be
a big help, not just to Members of this House, but to the wider public,
who have serious concerns about what is being
proposed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T19:34:07"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T19:34:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13082928000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/debtext/130829-0003.htm#13082928000028">Secondly,
the Prime Minister said that, in the end, this comes down to judgment.
Each of us has to form a judgment about what is the right course of
action. I accept that all such difficult decisions inevitably come 
<?notus-xml column=1509?>down to forming a judgment. In order to help me and others form that
judgment we need to discuss two things over the next few days, and
perhaps longer. First, what is the intelligence that exists: what do we
know about it, what does it prove and show, and what can we be certain
of? I accept that it is not always possible to share intelligence with
the public or even with Members of this House. In his very good speech,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T19:35:01"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for New Forest East (Dr Lewis) made the point that the intelligence
could at least be made available to the Intelligence and Security
Committee, which I sit on, so that at least a few more
people—nine of us, to be exact—would know exactly what is
at stake. I do not want to over-claim anything. If the intelligence
cannot be shared nationally, I am not sure that simply sharing it with
the ISC would necessarily resolve that
problem<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T19:35:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13082928000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/debtext/130829-0003.htm#13082928000029"><Member ContinuationText="Fiona Mactaggart" PimsId="1635" UID="13082928001486" xid="400" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/debtext/130829-0003.htm#13082928001486"><B>Fiona
Mactaggart</B> (Slough) (Lab):</Member> My right hon. Friend is talking
about sharing information. I listened carefully to the Prime
Minister’s speech, and he said that he had convincing evidence
that young Muslims in Britain would not be alienated by this, and
indeed that they were calling for military action to protect people in
Syria. Would it not be a good thing if the whole House could see that
evidence, because that is not what I am hearing from my
constituents<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T19:36:02"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13082928000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/debtext/130829-0003.htm#13082928000030"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr George Howarth" PimsId="1031" UID="13082928001487" xid="290" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/debtext/130829-0003.htm#13082928001487">Mr
Howarth:</Member></B> It would be a good thing if as much information
as possible could be put before not only the House but the wider
public. I have already made that

second point that needs to be addressed is: where is the weight of
world opinion? It seems to me that whenever there is a crisis of this
kind—I have no qualms about saying this—the United
Nations fails to live up to its promise. What tends to happen is that
the United Nations Security Council will pass resolutions—I
think it passed 14 on Iraq and weapons of mass destruction before any
action was taken—but in the end, whatever the UN does, it tends
to fall on the shoulders of coalitions of the willing to enforce its
will<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T19:37:06"></hs_TimeCode>. I am not
condemning the United Nations—it is all we have—but we
need to have a better way of doing these things in the future. We need
to think very carefully as a country about where we fit into each of
the coalitions, particularly the one under

Howarth:</Member></B> That is the point I am making. I do not think
that the machinery of the United Nations is able to enforce decisions,
and this is an obvious example. I accept that probably the overwhelming
balance of evidence is that it is the regime that is carrying out these
attacks, rather than the rebel forces, which probably do not have the
capability<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T19:38:13"></hs_TimeCode>.
There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T19:38:26"></hs_TimeCode> is a
further argument that a rogue commander might be carrying out these
attacks without the knowledge or consent of the leadership and the
President. If that is the case it is even more worrying if the regime
works in such a way that random commanders can decide to do such things
almost at will rather than be directed from the
centre<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T19:38:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

into the Chamber today I looked at the archway through which we walk
and the broken stones that were left there when the Chamber was rebuilt
to remind us that we have the power of life and death over our
citizens. I think that today’s debate is a prime example of the
decisions we all have to make which could result in life or death not
just for our citizens, but for others. However, having listened to the
debate carefully all day, I still do not feel that I have enough
accurate or verifiable information to support direct UK military action
in Syria. At the same time, I want to send a message that we will not
stand idly by while others use chemical weapons to destroy their
population<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T19:40:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13082928000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/debtext/130829-0003.htm#13082928000037">The
Prime Minister did absolutely the right thing by recalling Parliament
and bringing us back here to debate the situation. I believe that he
also recalled us because there was a real possibility that intervention
could be almost immediate. I hope that that possibility may have
diminished a little with the developments that have occurred over the
past two days, and I certainly praise the Prime Minister for moving his
position and meeting the concerns of many of my colleagues in the
House. It is a wise Prime Minister who listens and reacts to what
Members of Parliament have to say on such issues. Of course, as he
acknowledged in his opening speech, many of us are reluctant about
matters involving peace and war because we previously sat here and
listened to a Prime Minister tell us from the Dispatch Box what I now
believe to have been a fabric of lies. I cannot sit here and be duped
again by any Prime Minister, whether of my party or the Labour
party<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T19:41:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13082928000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/debtext/130829-0003.htm#13082928000038">My
constituents’ instinct is also against any direct UK military
action. Like, I am sure, all my colleagues throughout the House, I have
received not just form e-mails sent by some lobbying organisation but
individually composed e-mails showing the strength of feeling and fear
that lie in the British population. Having said that, and despite
feeling strongly that my constituents’ instincts and my own
should be followed, what I have seen on the television and experienced
through reports of what has gone on in Syria has struck at the very
fabric of my being. However, I am unclear about our response and our
objectives. What are punitive strikes? Will they send a message to
Assad to use it or lose it when it comes to chemical weapons? What will
be the reactions of other countries? What are the capabilities of the
people who may be deployed in support of Syria? There are still many

under any circumstances. The Opposition amendment is stronger and
clearer, but whereas the

hon. Gentleman—I do not know what they are either. I do not
think that they are identifiable. I do not think that they are
achievable. My objection, as I was saying a moment ago, is that there
is not an exit strategy or an end game. There have been many
contributions to the debate in which colleagues have said, “If
we do this, that will happen. If we do not do that, this will
happen.” Only one thing is absolutely guaranteed: nobody knows
what will happen if we go down the road of military action. We have
seen that too often in recent decades. The difficulty I have is the
fact that we do not have an exit
strategy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13082928000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/debtext/130829-0003.htm#13082928000060"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T19:52:04"></hs_TimeCode>In
conclusion, and for the hon. Gentleman’s information, I have
problems with both the Government motion and the Opposition amendment.

honourable ends that both sides of the House want. I am opposed to
military intervention in Syria full stop. To be honest and consistent
on both questions, I will vote in the No Lobby against the Government
motion and against the Opposition amendment.</hs_Para>

usage and evidence, many have made the case that there is widespread

in the past couple of years, certainly in excess of a dozen times. All
participants admit the usage on 21 August, when 300-plus were killed
and 3,000-plus were maimed. If there is a delay, we hope that the UN
can assist, but what do we do if 98% of the UN wish to pass a
resolution but a country such as Russia blocks us? That has been the
reality for some time and I suspect that that will be the reality in
the future. One has to pose the question that if an incident like the
holocaust were to happen tomorrow and one of the Security Council
objected, what would the rest of the world do? We have to ask whether
we are prepared to allow Russia to be the sole determinant of which
part of international law is to be observed. Exact parallels can be

further use of such weapons. Before any further specific action is
taken, the House will have a second debate and will be provided, I
hope, with an understanding of our objectives and strategy, the upsides
of action or inaction, and an exit policy. I welcome and support the
revised motion on those
grounds.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13082928001446" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/debtext/130829-0003.htm#13082928001446">8

Diane Abbott</B> (Hackney North and Stoke Newington) (Lab):</Member> I
am glad to have this opportunity to take part in this important debate.
It seems that tonight Parliament has stepped back from the brink of
giving the Prime Minister carte blanche to involve British forces in
the bombing of Syria this weekend. I believe that the British public,
whatever political party they support, will be glad that we have done
so. We know—the polls tell us—that the public are
overwhelmingly against such a military strike. The British public do
not want to be drawn into yet another war in the middle east. They have
seen that movie and know how it
ends.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13082928000074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/debtext/130829-0003.htm#13082928000074">For
the avoidance of doubt, I should say that had I been pressed by my own
party to vote on a motion that authorised the bombing of Syria, in the
current state of knowledge, I was always going to vote
no—whatever the pressures and consequences. It would not have
been a party political gesture, which some Government Members have
mentioned. I was one of the Labour MPs who voted against their own
Government on Iraq. I say to Government Members who may be wondering
what to do tonight that I have never had reason to regret that
vote.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13082928000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/debtext/130829-0003.htm#13082928000075">It
seems that the Prime Minister may be coming back to the House of
Commons to authorise his war, and it may be helpful for me to set out
my reservations as matters stand. The first question is about the
facts. Have chemical weapons been used and who has deployed them? I
heard what the Prime Minister said about the 
<?notus-xml column=1516?>Joint Intelligence Committee and I know the opinion of Vice-President
Biden. It is clear that the balance of probability is that Assad used
chemical weapons. However, whatever the Americans say and the Joint
Intelligence Committee conjectures, I do not believe that it is wise
entirely to rule out the possibility that the chemical weapons were
wielded by Assad’s opponents.</hs_Para>

circumstances, we always have to ask, “Cui
bono?”—“Who benefits?” Assad’s
opponents know that only chemical weapons would trigger a reluctant
President Obama to authorise a military intervention. Whatever the
Prime Minister says, a military strike would inevitably tilt the scales
of the civil war in favour of Assad’s opponents. Earlier, we
heard that the UN investigator Carla Del Ponte said in
May:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13082928001427" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/debtext/130829-0003.htm#13082928001427">“according

other point is about legality. I have heard a lot about Kosovo and how
in some sense it sets a precedent for this Syrian war. At the time of
the Kosovan war, I was a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. We
carried out a major inquiry into Kosovo, taking a great deal of
evidence about its legality. We took oral evidence from Professor
Christopher Greenwood QC, Mark Littman QC and Professor Vaughan Lowe,
among others, and there was a whole host of written evidence from
others. What the all-party Select Committee concluded was that the

let me say this. In the run-up to the Iraq war, Colin Powell cited the
Pottery Barn rule—Pottery Barn is a string of American china
shops. The rule is, “You break it? You own it.” The
notion that we can make a military intervention on the narrow point of
chemical weapons is disingenuous to say the least. Were we to intervene
militarily in Syria, we would take ownership of the outcome of the
civil war. I see no endgame, no idea of what victory would look like in
those circumstances.</hs_Para>

more on the maintenance of international humanitarian law and on our
alarm at the use of chemical weapons next to a NATO ally, Israel, which
we have a unique duty to protect. The debate might also have focused a

instance, most people agree that the full likelihood is that President
Assad has bombed his own people. We are asked to draw lessons from the
experience of 2003 as we come to a conclusion on this matter. One of
the principal lessons is that we should expect our leaders to act with
transparency, conviction, consistency and principle and to accommodate
colleagues who have doubts and be responsive to their concerns. I do
not think that President Obama, President Hollande or our own Prime

Munn</B> (Sheffield, Heeley) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> The situation in
Syria and the surrounding area is catastrophic—at least 100,000
people have been killed and 2 million have been forced to flee the
country, with the refugee camp at Zaatari alone containing an estimated
130,000 people, half of whom are under 18. It is difficult to ensure
that aid reaches those still inside Syria—in some areas, it is
impossible—or even to know their situation. Over
the  
<?notus-xml column=1518?>past two years, the international community has stood on the sidelines.
Some countries, including the United Kingdom, have provided funds and
resources for the refugees in the surrounding countries, but the
numbers leaving Syria get larger by the day, as we have seen recently
with the thousands crossing into the Kurdistan region of
Iraq.</hs_Para>

countries say that the situation in Syria is difficult and that
intervention from outside would make it worse, and we have heard that
argument time and time again today. However, the situation has got
progressively worse without intervention. Are there any signs that it
will get better? It is beyond question that everyone here would prefer
a negotiated diplomatic solution to the crisis, but despite the
considerable efforts of many, including the Foreign Secretary, all
attempts at obtaining a United Nations Security Council resolution to
try to secure that have proved impossible. It is clear that any moves
at the UN would be vetoed by Moscow and Beijing. Russian and Chinese
support for Assad means that there is little incentive for him to make
meaningful concessions or even to discuss a ceasefire. But now the use
of chemical weapons has escalated the crisis. The Joint Intelligence
Committee has confirmed today that the Syrian regime has used lethal
chemical weapons on 14 occasions since 2012, and the world has done
nothing. However, last week’s large attack has led to
international condemnation and, I believe, a determination to do
something.</hs_Para>

the balance of probability, there is little plausible explanation for
the chemical attack other than that it was carried out either by a
rogue commander or under the instruction of the Assad
regime—that is almost certain. However, I still do not believe

has been a lot of speculation about the consequences of taking such
action. If we say that Assad has behaved irrationally in using chemical
weapons in the first place, the risk is that the proposed military
intervention will mean he is likely to become even more irrational. The
situation may escalate into war and may involve other countries
stepping in. We do not know which direction this is going. No one has
persuaded me this afternoon either that such action will quell the
situation or that it will not make it worse. We also need to consider
the risk of mission creep. We may be saying that a war crime has been
committed, but war crimes have been going on in Syria and in other
civil wars in the past 10 years over which the international community
has failed to take any action. In Syria alone, innocent children and

return to what I was saying a moment ago. What is the difference
between an innocent child—a non-combatant—being killed by
a conventional weapon and that child being killed with a chemical
weapon? It does not much matter to them or their family, because it is
still a horrendous death of an innocent. We therefore need to ask
whether we are being consistent in saying that this is the red line and
it is appropriate for us to take this action. The key point, and the
reason I am saying it is not just about the words on the page but what
is between the lines, the context and having had Parliament recalled
for this debate, is that it sends out a message to others that we are
already on this slippery slope—the context is already there.
What happens if in the next few days the intelligence suggests that the
chemical weapons are being moved around the country? This Parliament
cannot be called back, but other nations, such as the US and France,
may see this debate and the vote we have this evening as sufficient
sanction—perhaps an amber light or even a green one—to
their taking military action in
Syria.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-08-29?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_08_29_PT_1/B36A355075229F408B9DEB78A14BD32951F3EF50" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="29 August 2013">Thursday

his U-turn yesterday on taking action this weekend, I wondered what we
would be debating today. I congratulate my right hon. Friend the Leader
of the Opposition and the shadow Foreign Secretary on forcing the Prime
Minister to do a handbrake turn over the action we were clearly called
back to vote on today. The Prime Minister may have changed the text of
the motion, but he certainly made the same hawkish speech today. I do
not accept that wanting to exhaust all the avenues with the United
Nations is somehow an argument for doing nothing.</hs_Para>

heard the Deputy Prime Minister being interviewed this morning on the
“Today” programme, and it was not his finest hour. He
said that this was an atrocity that could not be ignored, which I
accept, and that he did not want ours to be remembered as the
generation that sat idly by, but our motion does not suggest doing
that. He then said that the Government were seeking a mandate for a
limited response. There we have it. That is why we are here today; the
Government are seeking a mandate for a limited response, which is why
our amendment is necessary and needs to be supported. Their intention
was not to wait for the UN process to be exhausted, but to take
precipitate action.</hs_Para>

“precision strikes”, “selective strikes”,
“technical strikes” and the intention to
“degrade”. We even have civilian deaths described as
“collateral damage”. These are all terms used to convince
us that we should vote in favour of a strike, but how do we contain a
missile attack on a chemical weapons dump or manufacturing centre? How
do we ensure that no civilians die? Would those deaths be acceptable?

listened to his Back Benchers. We made it perfectly clear to our Whips
yesterday afternoon that we were not prepared to vote for any motion
that justified war, and so the Prime Minister has offered us another
motion. This is not a motion for war. I will not vote for war. I would
never vote for war against Syria. If there is a second vote, I will
definitely vote against, but I do not believe there ever will be a
second vote, because I do not believe that the parliamentary arithmetic
stacks up. It does not stack up because MPs are doing their job and
listening to what the public want, and the voice of the public is
completely clear: they do not want war. They are scarred by what went

schools or hospitals. It is our job to think about problems here. If I

Mediterranean? In reality, we would simply be hanging on to the coat
tails of President Obama. He was foolish enough to issue a red line.

Edward Leigh:</Member></B> Absolutely. We have heard very little about
what is happening on the ground in Syria. How many of those who have
spoken with such moral certainty have actually visited Syria? I must
confess I have only been there once, but as far as I could see, the
minorities were protected. The 2 million Christians are protected by
Assad. What will be their fate when Assad falls? What will be the fate
of the 2 million Alawites? What will be the fate of the 22 other
minorities? How much does the House know about what is actually
happening in Syria? Yet we believe that we, who know so little about
the complexities of the situation, have the moral right to commit
execution on people. That is what we are talking about. We cannot send
cruise missiles into a country without killing people. That is what we
would be doing. What right has the House to say with any certainty that
we know what went on that day? What right have we to say that we can
sort out the situation? No, there is a better way—the way of
peace and diplomacy, not of war. I cannot, therefore, support the
motion tonight. I give some credit to the Prime Minister, but I will
not vote for the motion.</hs_Para>

Blackman</B> (Harrow East) (Con):</Member> I have listened carefully to
the debate all afternoon, and for me there are two occasions where
military action can be justified. The first is where British interests
are imminently threatened, and clearly that is not the case in this
particular debate. The other is as part of a UN-sponsored humanitarian
mission to prevent dictators from causing damage to their own people. I
am not convinced that the Government have made that case this evening.
The reality is this; there is an evil dictator, but the opposition to
that evil dictator is even worse. These are people who will oppose the
west at all costs and will cause damage to their own people. They are
barbaric and inhuman and we should not support them in any shape or
form. I would not support any regime change, or attempted regime
change.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13082928000126" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/debtext/130829-0003.htm#13082928000126">I am
delighted that the Prime Minister and the Government have moved
substantially over the past few days on the motion and on the rhetoric
behind it. I will make clear my personal position: I will not support
any military intervention at all. Should there be a second vote in this
Chamber, I will oppose military intervention, because I think that it
is wrong in principle. I say that for several reasons.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13082928000127" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/debtext/130829-0003.htm#13082928000127">First, we are
talking about a country involved in a civil war at the moment, and we
intervene at our cost. Also, Syria is adjacent to Lebanon and Israel.
The border between Syria and Israel has been peaceful for about 40
years. If we escalate the violence, do we not think that the Syrians
and the Russians will react? We then escalate the problem of the middle
east conflict. At the moment, this House has endorsed the principle of
direct peace talks between the Palestinians and the Israeli Government.
What do we think the reaction would be if we acted against Syria and
then Syria reacted against Britain and potentially other countries in
the region? That would destabilise those talks and probably end the
chances of peace in the middle east for ever. That is the key
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T20:34:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13082928000128" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/debtext/130829-0003.htm#13082928000128">The
other thing that we must consider is that Syria is a satellite state of
Russia. Do we think that the Russian Government will sit idly by and
allow the US and Britain to bomb one of their satellite states? They
will react in some way, shape or form. So we should be clear that, if
we embark on military action, there will be direct military
consequences for the whole region and for this country. We should send
a message to President Assad, if we are convinced that he and his
regime are responsible for the chemical attacks, to say,
“Identify those who are responsible. Make them come before the
criminal courts,” so that they can be punished in the best way
possible, through due process of
law<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T20:35:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13082928001454" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/debtext/130829-0003.htm#13082928001454">8.35

Michael Meacher</B> (Oldham West and Royton) (Lab):</Member> We are
asked by the Government tonight to approve a so-called strong
humanitarian response, with the implication of using force in principle
and a second vote after the UN inspectors have reported, but there is
no case in international law for this military attack—neither
with a UN Security Council resolution authorising it, 
<?notus-xml column=1525?>nor under article 51 of the UN charter, which permits a right of
self-defence, but that clearly does not apply to a chemical gas attack
in eastern Damascus, as that is obviously not an attack on another
state<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T20:35:59"></hs_TimeCode>. That is
why the Prime Minister switched today to quoting long-standing
international conventions that prohibit the use of chemical weapons.
However, nothing in those conventions inherently allows other nations
to take military action against such a state just because it has used
chemical weapons—certainly not without wider international
sanctions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T20:36:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13082928000130" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/debtext/130829-0003.htm#13082928000130">There
is a second argument: what exactly—I have listened all
day—is the aim of the military strike? Will it realistically
succeed in achieving those goals? The stated aim is to hit
Assad’s military targets, but not the chemical weapons,
obviously, for fear of releasing poison gas into the atmosphere.
Whatever else, this will certainly not be a short, surgical strike. I
remind the House that it took 78 days of continuous bombing of Serbia
before the Milosevic regime could be shifted from Kosovo, and only then
when the US and UK threatened a land invasion. Even leaving that aside,
no one has answered the question what will happen if the attack is made
and Assad retaliates by using chemical weapon attacks on perhaps a
greater scale, as his sites are all over
Syria.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T20:37:27"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13082928000131" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/debtext/130829-0003.htm#13082928000131">Let
us not forget that Syria is no Libya. It is far stronger than Libya,
with far more disciplined and larger armed forces, and it is still
powerfully backed and reinforced by Russia. At worst, there is a very
real danger of the west being sucked into a long-term war that it
cannot win and that will only expose its impotence, as has happened
already in the wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T20:37:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13082928000132" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/debtext/130829-0003.htm#13082928000132">None
of that is to say that we should do nothing. We should press to have
Assad arraigned before the International Criminal Court. We should
freeze Syrian assets throughout the west. We should impose travel bans
on all members of the Syrian leadership deemed responsible for the
atrocities. Above all, we should press much harder for a regional peace
conference, to achieve a settlement involving all the relevant parties,
including the Russians. That is the only way to settle this
conflict<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T20:38:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13082928001455" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/debtext/130829-0003.htm#13082928001455">8.38

I thank you, Mr Speaker, and the Prime Minister for recalling
Parliament? Today’s debate was absolutely necessary. It has been
a very good debate. Party politics have not been involved. Hon. Members

have been under no pressure from my Whip to vote one way or the other.
That is a really good sign. Hon. Members are wrestling today with a
very difficult issue. I find these occasions, when we have to decide
what is morally right and whether or not we will kill people and
whether, by killing them, we save other people in the long run,
immensely difficult. I have made it clear to the Prime Minister that I
have not made up my mind tonight, and that my decision will rely
entirely on the summing up by the Deputy Prime
Minister—<I>[Interruption.] </I>I would like to thank the Deputy
Prime Minister for spending much of the afternoon listening to the

we have a British parliamentary democracy. We MPs can come here and
influence the decision of the Executive. Everybody knows that MPs from
both sides of the House have influenced the Prime Minister to change

begging the President to let them debate the issue. We are so much

response to what
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T20:40:00"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Oldham West and Royton said, the question is indeed what we
should do to solve this exceptionally difficult problem, because just
bombing will not solve it. There needs to be a disproportionate
response. What I think President Obama has done is to have got out
“The West Wing” series and looked at what President
Bartlet would have done under the circumstances. There is exactly that
episode: “If we bomb Damascus airport, we are going to kill
thousands of people, but they will never do it again.” Of
course, the expert then says, “If you do that, the whole world
will be against you.” The President asks “Well, what do
we do?” and the reply is, “You just bomb a few buildings,
which have been emptied because everybody knows which buildings are
going to be bombed.” The President says, “That will have
no effect,” but the experts say, “Yes, but that is
actually what you have to do. You have to have a
response<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T20:41:10"></hs_TimeCode>.”
That may be how it works in America, but it does not work like that
here.</hs_Para>

am very interested in one point that I hope the Deputy Prime Minister
will help us with tonight. If we vote against the motion and both

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T20:41:40"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for York Central (Hugh Bayley) posed that question to the

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T20:41:58"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for New Forest East (Dr Lewis), who I see in his place. I also think it
important for the Security and Intelligence Committee or an appropriate
group of parliamentary colleagues to be apprised of some of the
intelligence information. It is hugely important that we understand
where the weapons are, whether they are mobile and what volumes we are
talking about. We appreciate that a lot of people are working on
that.</hs_Para>

we hear the advice coming from such an august body of colleagues, I
believe that we will conclude that the guidance in the

will be unachievable. The problem we must face—the House must be
mature about it—is that if we are to achieve either the goals
set out in the Government’s motion or the programme of events
set out in the Opposition amendment, that will almost inevitably mean
putting boots on the ground. Now everyone is saying that we are not in
favour of that, and I am certain that that is the view across the
country<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T20:43:19"></hs_TimeCode>. Before
we get to a debate next week, it is hugely important that the analysis

do not believe for a moment that it is possible to take out the
chemical weapons capacity remotely. Does that mean it is special forces

the categoric statement by the Prime Minister that it is not the
Government’s intention to get involved in the wider Syrian civil

that it would send a message to others in possession of chemical

revolting weapons. There are extremely difficult issues here. However,
we need to ask ourselves some questions. If it is the
Government’s position that there is a narrowly defined

We do not wish to get involved in the wider civil war, but we wish to

inadequate gesture politics that we seem to have coming from across the
Atlantic, it will be a disaster and will inflame the people in the
region. I believe, however, that non-involvement and non-intervention
also has consequences, the most serious of which is that simply saying
we will deter the future use of chemical weapons assumes that only the
Assad regime will possess such weapons. What happens when areas of the
country where chemical weapons are stored are overrun by elements of
the jihadist-linked opposition who get them and pass them to al-Qaeda?

them get into the hands of the opposition, Assad gives them to his

Israel or elsewhere?</hs_Para>

civilians from conventional weapons, which have of course killed far
more of the 100,000 dead so far in this civil war? In effect, such a

said that war is the continuation of politics by other means. He was
absolutely wrong, because war is qualitatively different from
diplomatic action, from humanitarian relief, and from the kind of
action we have taken hitherto on the crisis in Syria. It is
qualitatively different because, by taking military action, we become
involved in the conflict morally and in international law, and because
we require young British servicemen and women to fight and risk their
lives. I do not believe that we should shoulder the first burden, and
nor should we ask our military personnel to shoulder the second

Today, large swathes of Sunni Iraq have all the characteristics of a

objective is to protect civilians and to preserve the international
taboo on the use of terror weapons. In the age of total war, there are
virtually no moral limits on what a state might do in pursuit of its
military objectives. Where such limits do exist, they must be upheld by
responsible members of the international community. The Kurds of Iraq
know that only too well. When Saddam bombed Halabja with mustard gas in
1988, the world looked on in horror but did nothing. Our inertia did
not prevent further conflict; it made it more likely. With Saddam
emboldened, the gassing of Halabja was followed by the invasion of
Kuwait. From Munich to Srebrenica, the lesson of history is that one
violation of international law leads to another.</hs_Para>

the question of limits, our model for intervention should be not Iraq
in 2003 but the no-fly zone established over northern Iraq by the Major
Government after the first Gulf war. In 1991, our objective was clear.
It was to prevent Saddam’s final attempt to massacre the Kurds
and the Shi’a. Crucially, however, the terms of the mission
strictly limited our involvement. We were not trying to fix
Iraq’s fractured politics; nor did we manage to do so. Let us
remember that, with Saddam at bay, the Kurdish factions turned on each
other and fought a bloody civil war.

Arab League has supported the principle of UN-backed intervention, but

seriously suggesting that no nation in the Arab League is capable of
delivering that warning? Is Saudi Arabia not capable of that? If not,
what on earth are we doing arming all these nations to the teeth? It is
time for the Arab League to step up to the plate and for western

burns as it oxidises, it burns right down to the bone. If that is not a
chemical weapon, what is? Why is the world’s policeman allowing
the USA to sell cluster bombs to Saudi Arabia? The point about cluster
bombs is that they continue to kill and maim children long after the
combatants have left the field. We need to be very clear. Why is the
world’s policeman not calling a coup a coup in Egypt? These are
the kinds of issues that cause burning resentment across the middle

to rule. Our contribution to Iraq was great in terms of the heroism,
professionalism and sacrifice of our soldiers—there were 179
victims—but Tony Blair was told by Bush that he was not needed.
Tony Blair was invited to pull out. When we get the long-awaited report
of the Chilcot inquiry we will know that it was as a result of Tony
Blair’s refusal to pull us out of that war and to stop deceiving
the House that 179 British lives were lost. That is a terrible price to
pay for the vanity of one man. He has appeared again in this

peacekeeping. We did a splendid job in Kosovo and Sierra Leone, but the
investment we made in blood and treasure in Afghanistan and Iraq was
dreadful. We went into Helmand with the hope that not a single bullet
would be fired and that we would be there for three years and then

me start on the common ground. This House stands united in its
revulsion at the reports of the use of chemical weapons being deployed
against innocent men, women and children in Syria. The use of chemical
weapons is not just deplorable; it is both immoral and illegal. Since
the Geneva protocol of 1925, the use of such weapons has been
prohibited. Hon. Members are therefore right to be horrified and
revulsed by reports of their use, and to be deeply concerned as to how
to protect the international prohibition of their use that has been in
place for decades.</hs_Para>

is also common ground across the House in recognising the suffering and
the scale of the slaughter in Syria. In the past two years, more than
100,000 people have been killed and more than 6 million people are in
need of humanitarian assistance. Already 2 million refugees have fled
Syria, 1 million of whom are children. All of us should be proud of the
humanitarian aid that the British Government and British
non-governmental organisations have provided to help alleviate the
suffering of the people of Syria and the wider region. Now, however, as
the crisis deepens and the pressures on Syria’s neighbours grow,
the international community is right to intensify the diplomatic and
humanitarian efforts to help relieve the suffering and prevent further
bloodshed. 
<?notus-xml column=1540?>Ultimately, a way will have to be found back to talks. We all recognise

me turn to the substance of the amendment for which we will be voting
this evening. We believe that the House deserves and the country
expects more clarity than is set out in the wording of the Government
motion. Specifically, our amendment sets out a road map for decision,
with clear steps that would need to be taken and conditions that would
need to be met before the use of force could be
authorised.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13082928000233" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/debtext/130829-0003.htm#13082928000233">Let
me address directly a point made by the right hon. and learned Member
for North East Fife (Sir Menzies Campbell), a man for whom I
have great respect. I want to talk about the differences between the
Opposition amendment and the Government motion, and why they matter.
The test set by our amendment for the Syrian regime’s
responsibility for the use of chemical weapons is “compelling
evidence”. That test is absent from the wording of the
Government motion. I do not believe, not least because of past
mistakes, that satisfying ourselves that evidence of Assad’s
responsibility is compelling is too high a hurdle to
expect—indeed, I suggest that the public would expect nothing
less ahead of any UK military action in Syria. That threshold should be
explicitly stated in the
motion.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13082928000234" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/debtext/130829-0003.htm#13082928000234">Secondly,
our amendment explicitly states that the United Nations Security
Council would need to have considered and voted on the evidence
presented by the UN weapons inspectors. No such commitment to a
Security Council vote is contained in the Government’s motion.
Indeed, the Prime Minister’s remarks earlier today did not once
make explicit a reference to a vote of the UN Security Council on a
resolution in relation to Syria. That matters because surely to
exhaust, and be seen to exhaust, the processes of the United Nations
would be crucial to seeking the broadest possible support for any
subsequent military action on an alternative  
<?notus-xml column=1541?>legal base. Such a vote—and, let us freely acknowledge, quite
probably a veto—in the Security Council of the United Nations
would also make clear where each member of the Security Council
stood.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13082928000235" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/debtext/130829-0003.htm#13082928000235">Thirdly,
our amendment states that in making a decision to commit force, regard
must be had to the potential consequences in the region. The region is
experiencing unprecedented turmoil. Syria as a nation state is
dissolving before us. That disintegration has already exacerbated
sectarian tensions across the region, destabilised neighbours and
caused horrific refugee and humanitarian crises. It is surely
reasonable for the impact of any military action to be explicitly
considered in that context, and that consideration should appear on the
face of the
motion.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13082928000236" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/debtext/130829-0003.htm#13082928000236">Fourthly,
our amendment specifies that any decision to authorise force would be
time limited. Given the deep anxiety in the House and across the nation
about the risk of deepening and ever longer engagement in Syria, that
would mean that the House would not give the Government authority for
an open-ended military commitment. These are material issues. I urge
Members on both sides of the House to reflect on those differences and
support our amendment.</hs_Para>

Members can also understand that the need for such a clear and
considered road map to decision is made all the more crucial given that
in recent days there have been real and growing concerns in the country
that we are being pushed too quickly towards military action on a
timetable set elsewhere, without due process being followed and the
necessary steps being taken. Indeed, the case for action is not helped
by the suggestion from some of our allies that the objective has more
to do with punishment than with protection. Let me be very clear with
this House: punitive action—action motivated by a desire to
punish—would have no basis in international law. To be legal,
the objective of any such mission would need to be to protect the
people of Syria, not to punish the rulers of
Syria<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T21:40:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13082928000238" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/debtext/130829-0003.htm#13082928000238"><B><Member ContinuationText="Guy Opperman" PimsId="5666" UID="13082928001569" xid="1230" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/debtext/130829-0003.htm#13082928001569">Guy

us be candid as to why we are gathered here this
evening—<I>[Interruption.]</I> I will take interventions, but
let me develop the point. Once the Government accepted our case, late
yesterday, that there needed to be a further vote of the House of
Commons when the evidence is available to us, today’s debate
truly became a parliamentary recall in search of a public rationale.
This morning, it was then reported on the BBC that the House was being
asked by the Government motion to agree tonight to the principle of
British military action in Syria, without a vote having taken place at
the UN Security Council or that body, or indeed this House, having yet
had sight of the UN weapons inspectors’ report. Although it
would be wrong to rule out the use of force before the evidence is
before us, it would also be wrong to rule force in before the evidence
is before us. That is why Labour has tabled an amendment, why we will
be voting for our amendment, and why we will be urging Members from all
parts of this House to support it.</hs_Para>

one can legitimately worry about escalation of any action being taken,
one should equally, if not more so, worry about escalation flowing from
inaction. Inaction is not a choice without consequences; it is a
conscious choice that says to those who wish to deploy chemical weapons
against their own people that they are more likely, and will operate in
a more permissive environment, to do so on a larger scale in

Mr Speaker. I do not wish to detain the House for long, but I wish to
raise a point of order on a separate matter from the one we have
discussed this afternoon. While the eyes of the world have
understandably been focused on the atrocities in Syria, I am saddened
to say that the Government of Colombia have taken the opportunity to
escalate the oppression, and even murder, of their own citizens. Huber
Ballesteros, a prominent leader, has been imprisoned on trumped-up
charges, and Juan Camilo Acosta has been shot dead for taking part in
peaceful strike action. Have you, Mr Speaker, had any indication that
Foreign Office Ministers intend to make a statement about the continued
appalling murderous and oppressive situation in
Colombia?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13082928001419" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/debtext/130829-0004.htm#13082928001419"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Speaker" InTheChair="True" PimsId="3965" UID="13082928002721" xid="43" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/debtext/130829-0004.htm#13082928002721">Mr

to March 2008. This means it is unable to compare directly today's

commitment to “Work with the sector to find new ways of
encouraging landowners to plant more trees where it best suits them and
their local conditions”. It is therefore primarily up to the
landowner to define the nature of woodland planted and the management
objective. However, we would expect a significant proportion of conifer

authorities and so the data could not be easily interrogated to obtain
a satisfactory breakdown. However, AHVLA records do show that in 2012
AHVLA served six statutory notices as a result of a driver not being in

regards to the introduction of any further charges, DEFRA officials are
still considering the case for the introduction of a limited range of

of a package of measures to rationalise EU Animal Health and Welfare
legislation. This includes those provisions directly relating to
charging for official controls, such as inspections. It is too early to
predict what changes are likely to be adopted at the EU level upon
conclusion of negotiations, but the Government will wish to ensure that
where charging is justified, it is proportionate, non-discriminatory in

The figures given for staff training are for the total spend recorded
against training account codes in the Department's financial management
system for the whole year. This expenditure could be for a variety of
reasons from actual training courses to booking course venues. We have
given a total for the year as the monthly breakdown indicates a
negative figure for April 2013 due to accounting policies.</hs_brev>

reaching its decision the Government considered how the EAW contributed

underpinned by it, and whether there would be a detrimental impact on
such co-operation if it were pursued by other means. We also considered
the impact of each measure on our civil rights and traditional

nationals of EU countries was considered. The European Convention on
Extradition (1957) governed extradition relations between the UK and

in adult immigration removal centres other than in the specific event
of their having been stopped at the border as part of a family group
because enquiries are necessary as to whether the family can be safely
admitted or, if not, pending a flight home. In these circumstances,
families stay together in accommodation specially designed for families
and separate from the other detainees. There are occasions when
evidence emerges to indicate that a person who has been detained in
other circumstances and as an adult is under 18. In those
circumstances, the individual will be released from detention as soon
as the local authority can make appropriate arrangements for them in
the community. If the case meets the criteria for an age dispute case
as set out in the following published criteria, the individual will be
the subject of a formal local authority age assessment and will be

A finished admission episode (FAE) is the first period of in-patient
care under one consultant within one health care provider. FAEs are
counted against the year or month in which the admission episode
finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a
person may have more than one admission within the
period.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>3. The first recorded procedure
or intervention in each episode, usually the most resource intensive
procedure or intervention performed during the episode. It is
appropriate to use main procedure when looking at admission details,
(e.g. time waited), but a more complete count of episodes with a
particular procedure is obtained by looking at the main and the
secondary procedures.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>4. The number of
episodes where this diagnosis was recorded in any of the 20 (14 from

from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be
interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage
(particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of
independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in
NHS practice. For example, changes in activity may be due to changes in
the provision of care.</hs_TableFooter>

there was external interest in this subject and a formal consultation
allowed external parties the opportunity to contribute their views on
the merits of the criteria. The review will be completed later in

Boles:</Member></B> The Government is fully committed to supporting
town centres. Our National Planning Policy Framework sets out clearly
that local councils should recognise town centres as the hearts of
their communities and pursue policies to support their viability and
vitality. Specifically, it requires that local planning authorities
apply a sequential and impact test to planning applications for certain
uses, such as retail, leisure and office, that are not in an existing
centre and are not in accordance with an up-to-date local plan. Where
an application fails to satisfy the sequential test or is likely to
have significant adverse impact it should be
refused.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13082926001089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/text/130829w0002.htm#13082926001089">Our
policy also supports the retention and re-introduction of markets in
town centres, makes clear that local approaches to parking should
support town centres, and that the needs of retail, leisure and other
main town centre uses should be met in full. We have taken action to
help rejuvenate high streets by backing communities across the country
with a multi-million pound package of support, providing over
£80 million in loans for start-up companies and doubling small
business rate relief to help small entrepreneurs. Since the publication

Francois:</Member></B> The Ministry of Defence (MOD) is pleased to be
recognised as the single largest deliverer of apprenticeships in the
UK. Apprenticeships are firmly embedded across armed forces initial
training. 95% of Army recruits enrol in an apprenticeship each year,
most of whom complete it within two years. Apprenticeships are now the
means by which the majority of service personnel develop the skills
that they need to succeed on
operations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13082926001122" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/text/130829w0002.htm#13082926001122">Defence
training for armed forces personnel is governed by a systematic
approach that ensures all training is regularly re-assessed to ensure
it delivers what we need. This process provides the mechanism by which
we can examine options for further development, including
apprenticeships and higher apprenticeships where
appropriate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13082926001123" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/text/130829w0002.htm#13082926001123">The

Francois:</Member></B> In 2007, the Ministry of Defence (MOD),
excluding its Trading Funds, began to operate centrally administered
manpower substitution contracts which provide MOD business units with
access to short-term staff known as agency workers. These arrangements
provide placements at agreed fixed rates on a national basis, thereby
offering benefits to the entire Department. The first centralised
contracts provided clerical/administrative and secretarial agency
workers. This has expanded over time to a centralised Manpower
Substitution Service (MSS) owned by Defence Business Services (DBS)
which also encompasses the provision of interim professionals
(including HR, finance and audit, project and programme management and
procurement), specialist IT workers, health care and dental grades and
Skill Zone workers, drivers and security
guards.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13082926001266" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/text/130829w0003.htm#13082926001266">The

broadening of scope. It records the number of centrally-held individual

is a serious criminal offence which carries a maximum four-year
custodial sentence. Where someone is actually harmed there are a range
of existing offences against the person, in particular offences of
wounding or causing grievous bodily harm, that reflect the seriousness
of the offending behaviour and the harm
caused.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1308302000124" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130829/text/130829w0003.htm#1308302000124">In

specific point in the consultation which has attracted significant
response is the proposal to remove client choice in the model for
competition for criminal litigation. The rationale for proposing this
change was to give greater certainty of case volume for providers,
making it easier and more predictable for them to organise their
businesses to provide the most cost-effective service to the taxpayer.
This was not a policy objective in its own right. We have heard clearly
from the Law Society and other respondents that they regard client
choice as fundamental to the effective delivery of criminal legal aid.
We are therefore looking again at this issue, and expect to make
changes to allow a choice of solicitor for clients receiving criminal
legal aid. We will be launching a new consultation in the

Wright:</Member></B> Parliament sets the maximum penalty for an offence
at a level to provide for the worst possible example of the offence and
to give the courts sufficient range of sentencing powers to deal with
all the cases which come before them. The courts, therefore, rarely
impose the maximum sentence. However, sentencing 
<?notus-xml column=1035?>has become more severe over the last decade: in 2012, the average
custodial sentence length was 14.5 months, an increase of 1.9 months

The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons
for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were
dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more
offences it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed.
Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the
offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty
is the most severe.</hs_TableFooter>
