thanking the Clerk of the Parliaments and all his staff, members of
<I>Hansard </I>and of the leaders’ and whips’ offices who
have facilitated the meeting of our House today. Naturally, there is no
formal time limit for today’s debate. It is a Motion to Take
Note. Seventy-five colleagues have signed up to speak. If, therefore,
Back-Bench contributions are limited to five minutes, we would expect
to rise by about 10.30 pm. Clearly, it means that if
colleagues were to take a little more time, every minute that they took
would add more than an hour extra to the rising time. Whips are very
keen to assist the House with the normal passage of business and
therefore from time to time, during the course of the evening, a Whip
will come to the Dispatch Box to give an update on when we think the
rise of the House might actually take place. Perhaps I may also remind
the House that the Chamber clocks, which will start shortly when my
noble friend Lord Hill rises to move the Motion, start at zero and that
as soon as the clock shows “5” it means that our full
five minutes have already

as always in these cases, I remind those who are due to take part that
the <I>Companion</I> tells us that a Member of the House who is taking

not to be present for at least the opening speeches, the speeches
before and after their own, and the winding speeches. I realise that

however, it is important to be clear what the issue that we are
considering today is not. It is not about taking sides in the Syrian
conflict. It is not about invading. It is not about regime

opposition. I know that this afternoon we will hear from many noble
Lords with a huge amount of experience—diplomatic, political and
military—and I am sure that we will hear many nuanced arguments
and that there will be discussion about the complexities of the
situation. I know that we will benefit greatly from that advice but, in
essence, the issue is really very simple. It is this: what should our
response be to the large-scale use of chemical weapons; and, with that
response, what message do we want to send to the rest of the world
about their

will start with the evidence that we have. Medecins Sans Frontieres
reported that in just three hours on the morning of 21
August, three hospitals in the Damascus area of Syria received
approximately 3,600 patients with symptoms consistent with chemical
weapon attacks. Thousands of social media reports and at least
95 videos record evidence of attacks in at least 11
different locations in the Damascus area. There are horrible pictures
of bodies showing signs of nerve-agent exposure, including muscle
spasms and foaming at the nose and mouth. At least 350 were killed.
These deaths and injuries were caused by weapons that have been
outlawed for nearly a century.</hs_para>

fact that the most recent attack took place is not seriously disputed.
The Syrian Government said that it took place, but blamed the
opposition. Even the Iranian president has said that it took
place. The Syrian regime resisted calls for immediate and unrestricted
access for UN inspectors, while artillery and rocket fire in the area
reached a level around four times higher than in the 10 preceding days.
Examining all this evidence, together with the available intelligence,
the Joint Intelligence Committee has made its judgments, published and
placed in the Library in the form of a letter from the chairman of the
committee to the Prime Minister. The committee reached its judgments in
line with the reforms puts in place after the Iraq war by the noble
Lord, Lord Butler of Brockwell. The letter states

we may have about the complex situation in Syria, there is surely no
disagreement that the use of chemical weapons is wrong. For nearly a
century, the international community has worked to build a system of
defences to protect mankind against their use. The international
agreement outlawing the use of chemical weapons was signed by Syria and
dates back to the period after the Great War, a war in which 90,000
soldiers died from mustard gas, chlorine and phosgene and up to 1.3
million were blinded or burned by them.</hs_para>

Geneva Protocol reflected a determination that the events of the Great
War should never be repeated. It said that, whatever happens, these
weapons should not be used. Our judgment is that this is the first
significant use of chemical weapons this century. Together with the
previous 14 smaller-scale attacks, this is the only instance of regular
and indiscriminate use of chemical weapons by a state against its own
people for at least 100
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13082910000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829-0001.htm#13082910000013">We

the most exceptional circumstances. It would have to be a humanitarian
catastrophe, and it would have to be as a last resort. By any
standards, this is a humanitarian catastrophe. If there are no
consequences for the large-scale use of chemical weapons, there would
be nothing to stop Assad and other dictators from using them again and
again. If there are no consequences for breaking international
agreements, the agreements themselves are rendered meaningless. Decades
of painstaking work to construct an international system of rules and
checks to prevent the use of chemical weapons and to destroy stockpiles

argue that, in considering our options, we should be guided only by
what is in the British national interest. I agree. But surely it is in
our national interest, and that of all nations, to ensure that the
rules about chemical weapons are upheld. That is why the Government
argue that we should play our part in a strong response from the
international community, first at the United Nations, but also
potentially including legal and proportionate military action; action
designed simply to prevent the further use of chemical weapons and

a condemnatory Chapter 7 Resolution in the Security Council, backing
“all necessary measures”. We yesterday put a new draft
resolution to our Security Council colleagues. In doing that, we must
pursue every avenue at the United Nations, every diplomatic channel,
every option for securing the greatest possible legitimacy for any
action we take. Only once that route has been exhausted would the Prime

is a series of important questions about any potential operation to

sure that the military action envisaged by the United States of America
or its allies would work? Of course, when dealing with a dictator like
the Syrian president, there can be no guarantee of dissuading him from
further use of chemical weapons. But our judgment reflects the
assessment that Assad is likely to fear and respect a strong and
focused response. Of course, there is no action without risk. But
alongside the risks of action, we also have to weigh the risks of
inaction.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-08-29?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_08_29_PT_1/C14A38E9E70FF76F89C0439DEFFD7C1D448883F4" __version__="1.11"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 29 August 2013">Thursday,

weapons, and has used them repeatedly and indiscriminately in the past.
He has repeatedly tested our resolve to stand up to his crimes. If we
do not act, he and others will, I believe, take it as a signal that he
can use chemical weapons again and again. That would risk not only
further chemical attacks and further human suffering in Syria, but also
greater proliferation of these weapons across the region and the world,
with all the consequences that could bring. We should not tolerate the
risks of inaction or allow Assad and other dictators to conclude that
they can continue to deploy chemical weapons against their people with
impunity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13082910000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829-0001.htm#13082910000019">There
are those who ask as well whether we are in danger of getting sucked
into a new war in the Middle East. To them I would say that the issue
before us today is not about sanctioning wider involvement in Syria,
horrible and devastating as that conflict is. It is purely about
responding specifically to the large-scale use of chemical weapons and
acting to deter and prevent them being used again.</hs_para>

whether we are in danger of undermining our ambitions for a political
solution in Syria. The Government do not believe that there is a 
<?notus-xml column=1723?>choice between, on the one hand, acting to prevent
chemical weapons being used against the Syrian people, and on the
other, continuing to push for a long-term political solution. We
obviously need to do both, and we remain committed to using diplomacy
to end this war with a political solution. But, for as long as Assad is
able to defy international will, he will feel little if any pressure to
come to the negotiating table. Far from undermining the political
process, a strong and military response to the use of chemical weapons
can actually strengthen
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13082910000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829-0001.htm#13082910000021">Some ask
whether action over chemical weapons could further destabilise the
region. The region has already been profoundly endangered by the
conflict in Syria. Lebanon faces sectarian tensions as refugees flood
across the border. Jordan is coping with a huge influx of refugees.
Turkey, our ally in NATO, has suffered terrorist attacks and shelling
from across the border. However, standing by as a new chemical weapons
threat emerges will not alleviate those challenges; it will only deepen
them. That is why the Arab League has been so clear in calling for
international action. A region long beset by conflict and aggression
needs clear international laws and people who are prepared to stand up
for
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13082910000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829-0001.htm#13082910000022">There is
also the question of whether intervention, however well motivated,
could risk radicalising more young Muslims, including here in Britain.
This is a vital question and one that the National Security Council
addressed yesterday. The Government received considered analysis from
our counterterrorism experts and their assessment is that, while there
is no room for complacency, the legal, proportionate and focused
actions that we would propose would not be a significant new cause of
radicalisation and extremism. In fact, young Muslims in the region and
here in Britain may well be wondering if the world will ever step up
and respond to the pictures of Muslims in Syria suffering horrific
injuries and death from chemical weapons. I would argue that the
message to give them is that we will.</hs_para>

relatively few occasions been asked to consider whether to endorse the
principle of the use of military force. It is inevitable that
today’s debate here, and particularly in the other place, will
be viewed from the perspective of the debates held before our
interventions in Libya and indeed in Iraq. Given that
perspective, we are right in Parliament and as a nation to be cautious
and to strive to be consensual. That is why we have published
the summary of our legal position and the key judgments of the Joint
Intelligence Committee. It is why we have deferred our decision until
the United Nations inspectors have completed their immediate work and
briefed the Security Council. It is why we want to try to secure a UN
Security Council resolution. But the situation today is not the same as
in 2003 on the eve of the Iraq war. We are not invading another

Royall of Blaisdon:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the Leader
for his measured and informative introduction to our debate this
afternoon. Information and answers to questions about the situation and
proposed action in Syria have been lacking, so I warmly welcome the
debate. I am pleased that the Leader responded positively to our
request that the House should be recalled today for consideration of
the plans for military intervention, and I echo the thanks of the Chief
Whip to the staff of the House. It is right that it is the Commons that
should debate and vote on the issue of armed force, both to hold the
Government to account and in order to confer legitimacy on any military
intervention, but it is also right that our own House should in
parallel debate the issue. The Constitution Committee said in its
timely report, <I>Constitutional Arrangements for the Use of Armed
Force</I>:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13082910000167" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829-0001.htm#13082910000167">“We

Motion before us is rightly couched in very general terms, but that
does not detract from the critical and grave nature of the issues
before us: acts of war, the stark reality of life and death, and global
stability. The burden of responsibility will lie on the shoulders of
our colleagues in the other place, but the voice of noble Lords will
carry great influence both in Parliament and throughout the country. In
our daily debates on legislation we rightly speak of the consequences,
often painful, that laws will have on the lives of individuals and
wider society, but the decisions taken in the other place on this issue
relate to life and death. It could be said that to carry out military

weapons is abhorrent, a moral outrage and a crime against humanity. The
question of whether chemical weapons have been used in Syria seems to
be beyond doubt evidence of man’s inhumanity to man.
Governments, the Arab League, journalists and non-governmental
organisations, along with sources contacted by the intelligence
services, agree on the use of chemical weapons. Following the attack on
Damascus, the UN team of inspectors is now collecting samples that will
be sent to special laboratories for rigorous analysis before the team
reports to the UN Secretary-General and the Security Council. As the
Secretary-General said yesterday, the team must be given time to do its
job. Such actions are not and must not be a sop but part of a robust UN
process. While the team is not mandated to discover who used the
chemical weapons, it is clear that the evidence it collects should
provide information about who was responsible. It is then that the
Security Council will best be able to consider what action should be
taken. This must be part of the due process.</hs_para>

the Arab League said on Tuesday that it holds Bashar al-Assad
responsible for the chemical attack on Damascus and that it supports
the use of force through the UN. We look to the US Government, our
Government and others to set out their evidence in relation to the
responsibility of the Assad regime. I have one specific question for
the Minister in response: can the Government tell us what chemical
weapon caused the appalling injuries and deaths in Ghouta, and whether
it was a proscribed chemical weapon under the Chemical Weapons

must be taken only on the basis of evidence. Momentum is not a reason

trying to achieve? I realise that the Leader of the House gave some of
those answers. However, is the aim of any action to punish Assad for
the past use of chemical weapons, to deny the future use of chemical
weapons by taking out 
<?notus-xml column=1726?>the potential for future use, to deter future use or to exercise a
responsibility to protect Syrian civilians? I ask the Minister to be
absolutely clear on that. Many people, including many noble Lords,
might be prepared to support action but only if it were possible to be
assured that we could remove and neutralise every single chemical
capability in Syria. They would want unequivocal proof that this was
achievable and the sole aim of military action. Civilian lives are lost
in any military action, no matter how strategic the action, so would it
be possible to punish Assad or teach him a lesson if it is his
countrymen who suffer rather than him and his henchmen? His
repugnant actions demonstrate that he does not value the lives of
others. The 100,000 already killed and nearly 2 million refugees are
clear and tangible proof of his devastating cruelty. It is a nation
destroyed and a whole generation with little or no hope for the
future.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13082910000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829-0001.htm#13082910000034">I
have seen this with mine own eyes. I visited a camp in Jordan nearly
two years ago when there were merely tens of thousands of refugees, and
it was a deeply shocking experience. I watched a family that included
elderly people bent double, walking with help, and tiny children, all
fleeing across the border from snipers. Their warm reception in Jordan
was extraordinary. Now millions of people have fled their country, with
no hope, no home, no dreams, just physical and mental problems. How can
they continue to cope—likewise Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon and the
other countries to which they flee? Would any military intervention
make the flow of refugees even greater, or
smaller?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13082910000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829-0001.htm#13082910000035">The
situation is likewise for the 6.8 million people inside Syria,

questions are rightly asked about the proportionality and legality of

out in an excellent article earlier this week, comparisons are
inevitably being made with military actions in Kosovo in 1999 and in
Libya in 2011. In both cases neither Serbia nor Libya had friends whose
support they could rely on, but this is not the case with Syria. Syria
is firmly embedded in an alliance with Iran and Hezbollah, which poses

the experience of Iraq but rather learn from it. Political leaders must
lead and the Government must govern. The Government have
information that influences their decisions and that we are not party
to, but it is incumbent upon them to be as open and as transparent as

is clear. Chemical weapons cannot be used with impunity, there can be
no free pass for those who use them, and military intervention must be
an option. However, is a military strike the best way to deal
with an immoral, unprincipled bully with no regard for humankind? This

shall conclude by adding one important point from a Muslim perspective.
I have lived in and been in and out of the Middle East since 1973 and I

sentiment is growing in the region. I returned from Egypt earlier this
month. The noble Lord, Lord Warner, is in his place. He listened to the
same protestations that I heard in Cairo. One of the things my
interlocutors say again and again is that the West engages with
them only when our own strategic interests are engaged, such as our
energy needs in the Middle East. In Egypt, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and
the Gulf I hear the same refrain: “You don’t protect our
rights, only your own interests”. A familiar question arises now
with Muslims in the UK. We need to act with caution to dispel this

intervention in what has long been a Sunni-Shia war. I still believe

inflicted by two years of this terrible

of Iraq, I drew particular attention to the inconsistencies of our
alleged objectives for that attack. I do so again, as did the noble

on Syria. Is our objective, as American statements

deployment of chemical weapons? Is it a “shot across the
bows”, as President Obama said—I think this
morning—to dissuade President Assad from deploying chemical
weapons again? Is it part of a campaign to get rid of President Assad
and his Government, and to replace them by the so-called Free Syrian
Army? Is it designed to put pressure on President Assad to enter into
negotiations at a Geneva peace conference? Or is it aimed at the
destruction of his acknowledged stock of chemical weapons? Is it

of chemical weapons, whether by the Syrian Government, the rebels or
both, is itself a breach of international law, does that justify an
illegal response? We are assured that any action taken will be
proportionate, but we also need assurance that it will be legal. Surely

Howard of Lympne:</Member></B> My Lords, the use of chemical weapons
has been illegal for almost a century. Their use was banned by the
Geneva protocol, which was agreed by the international community in
1925. That ban was agreed because, as we have seen in the past week,
the use of these weapons has particularly dreadful and horrible
consequences. It is a ban that should be respected, observed and
enforced. That is why President Obama was right, in his much criticised
speech of several weeks ago, to declare that the use of chemical
weapons would constitute a “red line”. That red line has
been
crossed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13082910000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829-0001.htm#13082910000059">Therefore,
the questions that have to be answered are these. Should the use of
chemical weapons in breach of that ban go unmarked? Should no action be
taken to enforce the ban? Should those who use them be able to cock a
snook at the rest of the world and continue to use them with impunity?
I believe that the answer to all those questions is no. As the noble
Baroness the Leader of the Opposition said, there is a strong moral
case for enforcing the ban against the use of these dreadful
weapons.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13082910000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829-0001.htm#13082910000060">It is
precisely this kind of situation that has given rise to the evolving
doctrine in international law of the responsibility to protect. To
suggest that in order to achieve a badge of legality any response to
the use of chemical weapons must have the support of the Security
Council of the United Nations is to confuse law with the kind of
realpolitik that determines the way in which countries vote in relation
to decisions of this kind. No one believes that all the permanent
members of the Security Council will reach their decision on the basis
of a dispassionate and objective assessment of the evidence on the use
of chemical weapons in Syria last week. That is what you would need if
you wanted to see the Security Council as an indispensable part of a
legal process. It is manifestly not what we
have.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13082910000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829-0001.htm#13082910000061">Of
course, I understand that in the light of what happened in 2003 there
is a good deal of scepticism about the intelligence the Government have
produced. Indeed, I warned in the aftermath of the Iraq war, not least
in the debate on the report of the committee chaired by the noble Lord,
Lord Butler, that the way in which the intelligence was misrepresented
then would make it more difficult for Governments to take action in the
future. However, as the noble Baroness the Leader of the Opposition has

leave the level of any release of chemical weapons up to you alone, and
we expect you to punish this man”. Something like that would be

not make people do what you want them to do. We found that with Desert

ingredient of that powder keg is going to be chemical weapons and gas.
There is one mistake that we make with baleful constancy when we
consider warfare action, and that is always to judge what we do in the
next war by the lessons we thought we learnt from the last. That is
almost always wrong. I well remember trying to persuade Parliament that
we needed to intervene in Bosnia. The shadow that hung over us then was
that of Vietnam, and I was constantly told, “We can’t do
this. What we’ll get is body bags”. And so it is now. We
are living under the shadow, sadly, of Iraq, but this is not Iraq. We
are not putting boots on the ground, we are not invading, we are not
seeking to govern someone else’s country, and above all this is
not George W Bush, this is Barack Obama. You need only to look at what
this American President has done to see how nervous, hesitant and
cautious he is about taking
action<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T16:33:16"></hs_TimeCode>. Of all
the arguments that are used, particularly the one that the Americans
are hell bent on expanding this into some new war in the Middle East,
every piece of evidence that we have about the current American
Administration points in the opposite direction. That is simply an
irrational

single question: do you take more of a risk through acting or do you
run a greater risk through lack of action? That is the central

for international law, and above all to protect one of the few pillars
of international law that has been in existence for 100 years and
more—against the use of chemical weapons and gas—and to
act in support of international law while at the same time seeking to

there are uncertainties. You cannot take actions without having
uncertainties. I would have thought that as a man who made his career

accept that as a judgment, you do not have Armed Forces, you do not

Jay of Ewelme:</Member></B> My Lords, much has been said recently in
this House and elsewhere about the need to learn the lessons of the
past in considering the options in Syria. Of course, the trouble is
that the lessons of the past do not all point in one direction. Many
will believe we were wrong not to intervene in the genocide in Rwanda.
Let us remember that the most recent weapon of mass destruction to be
used on a massive scale was the machete. Many will believe that we were
right to intervene in Sierra Leone and, although we were lucky that
Milosevic fell when he did, in Kosovo. Many, including the noble Lord,
Lord Ashdown, think that we should have intervened in Bosnia to prevent
the massacre at Srebrenica. Many have serious doubts now about military
involvement in Afghanistan, although it seems politically inconceivable
not to have taken action after the attacks on the World Trade
Center.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13082910000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829-0001.htm#13082910000088">I
believe that most people think that the invasion of Iraq was wrong, and
many thought so at the time. I agree wholly with the noble Lord, Lord
Wright, and argued in this House for the inquiry into Iraq precisely so
that we could learn the lessons. When faced with decisions such as
those we now face, it is a tragedy that we do not yet have that report.
I think that most people would argue that the intervention in Libya was
justified, although it is probably too early to be
sure.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13082910000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829-0001.htm#13082910000089">It is
hard to draw clear conclusions for Syria from this variegated past. The
lessons will need to take account above all else of the circumstances
in and around Syria, and not of what happened in the past. The key
questions are as follows. Would intervention be in accordance with
international law? In part that will depend on what the weapons
inspectors say and on the conclusions that the UN Security Council
draws from their report. However, we need clarity on this, and to be
confident in retrospect that, even if things go wrong, we were right to
take action when we did. The Attorney-General’s advice
is very helpful on that point, but I am not convinced that it is
conclusive.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13082910000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829-0001.htm#13082910000090">Would
intervention achieve its objectives, and are they clear? In other
words, how sure can we be that intervention will so degrade
Syria’s military capability that it will not use chemical
weapons again? The moral case for acting against the use of chemical

be confident, even if we cannot be absolutely sure, that our action
will
work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13082910000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829-0001.htm#13082910000091">What is
the risk of collateral damage? I have no qualms, even after the speech
of the noble Lord, Lord Ashdown, in talking about collateral damage. I
recall being told before the Iraq war that US missiles had 95%
accuracy, so if 500 missiles were sent, 25 would miss their target.
Perhaps they are better now, but one or two missiles hitting a school,
hospital or crowded market can shift the moral argument.</hs_para>

strengthen or weaken the United Nations? The past decade or so has

can we be sure that we can conduct a surgical strike and withdraw? I
agree very much with what the noble Lord, Lord West, said. How will
other states such as Iran and Israel react if provoked? How
will Hezbollah react? Syria is in the middle of a vicious civil
war that could only too easily draw others into a regional
conflagration, with incalculable consequences for our interests and
those of others. The Foreign Secretary said that this uncertainty may
last for decades. The noble Lord, Lord Ashdown, spoke about the
importance of focusing on our interests. Surely they are to work with
others, however difficult that may be, to prevent that conflagration.
Such prolonged instability and uncertainty cannot be in our interests,
or those of the US, Israel or Russia. That, and helping to solve the
appalling humanitarian crisis now engulfing Syria and its neighbours,

perhaps inevitable. However, it does not really make sense. It implies
that there will be no response to the punishment and that the Assad

whatever punishment we are giving. That is most unlikely. We therefore
need to feed into

to concentrate, finally and briefly, on the point that the noble Lord,
Lord Jay, has just made. The aim of military intervention must be to
improve the lot of those who are suffering. There is no doubt about
that suffering; we see it every night on the television. It is ghastly
and intolerable but our action, if it is to be effective, must be
proportionate, and must be in line with and help the
people who need it. I cannot for the life of me see how dropping some
bombs or firing some missiles in the general direction of Syria, with
targets probably some way removed from the weapons that we have been
criticising, will lessen the suffering of the Syrian people. It is
likely to increase and expand the civil war in Syria, not bring it to

I felt that military action would lessen—not today, tomorrow or
the next day, but in the long run —the suffering of these people
and bring closer the day when that civil war comes to an end, that
would change my whole attitude. I am not opposed to intervention on
principle. There have been, as the noble Lord, Lord Jay, mentioned,
cases in which we have successfully intervened, but this is not likely
to be one of them. That is my judgment. Unless we are actually
going to bring some help or prospect of improvement to the people who
have been suffering these fearful attacks, we would be better to hold
off<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T16:48:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

a fairly desperate conclusion because it leaves one open to the charge
that one is doing nothing. Of course that is not so. There is a mass of
activity, diplomatic and economic, that we could and should undertake.
We should surely have cured ourselves by now of that fearful habit of
going into military action with our eyes half shut and without thinking
through the consequences. My noble friend said that we are not going to
take sides; but we are going to take sides. That is exactly the point,
and the people whom we are assisting will be pleased and others
outraged. To say that we are not taking sides seems a completely unreal
proposition: we are deliberately taking sides in a civil war. That is
an example—or it would be because we have not done it
yet—of the lack of thought, insight and perception that has led
us, over and over again, to throw ourselves into battles with the odds
somewhat loaded against us and without us, as Parliament, having really
thought through the consequences of what we are aiming

Goldsmith:</Member></B> My Lords, it is inevitable that this
debate looks to the past. Some of the parallels that are being drawn
with past events are absolutely right. Some of them—in
particular I single out what is being said about
Iraq—are not necessarily helpful parallels. However, there is a
parallel that matters. Just as it was essential in relation to
Iraq that two conditions were satisfied, so they must be satisfied if
there is to be military intervention here. I identify those two
conditions as: any action must be lawful, but must also be right. Those
are not the same. Being lawful is a necessary precondition to military
action, 
<?notus-xml column=1739?>but it is not enough on its own. Equally, being right and moral may well
be essential, but it is not enough on its own.</hs_para>

contribution to this debate is to focus particularly on the issue of
legality, on which we now have, in the note from the Government, a
statement of their position. I notice how it is described as a
statement of the Government’s position and is divided into two
parts. The first is legal principle which identifies in what
circumstances military action may be lawful and the second considers
whether the conditions that are set out are met. There is an important
difference between them. On the first issue, I agree, or Members of
this House would agree, that the primary and preferred approach or
basis for legal action would, of course, be a United Nations Security
Council resolution passed under Chapter 7. Will it happen? I suspect
that all noble Lords in this House believe that it will not because of
the existence of the veto.</hs_para>

there, therefore, another basis? This is where this potential conflict
differs from Iraq as there is no pre-existing Chapter 7 resolution that
could be relied upon. The Government say that humanitarian
intervention would be the legal basis. That is a controversial
doctrine, although more and more accepted. It was the basis on which
action was taken by NATO in relation to Kosovo and the bombing of
Serbia. Generally that would be recognised as justified, I think by
many people in the world, and increasingly by international lawyers,
although there is no basis for it in fact in the United Nations
charter. However—this is essential and I am glad to see that it
is made clear in the Government’s statement of legal
conditions—certain conditions must be

the purpose of the humanitarian intervention must be just that. It is
for humanitarian purposes. It is to prevent further humanitarian
catastrophes. It is not to punish. Even though there are breaches of
international law if chemical weapons are used, that does not justify
the use of force for punishment. It must be to prevent further
humanitarian catastrophes. That means, in itself, that one needs to be
satisfied as to what has happened. Was there a chemical attack? Did it
take place? Was it the result of action by the Assad regime?
Critically, if action is not taken, is there a likelihood—I
would say a strong likelihood—that that may be repeated? I will

a measure of last resort—you need to try everything else
first—and thirdly, it needs

that means. Proportion is not just about the same degree of force that

that it was the Assad side for the reasons that are given. Was it, on
the other hand, the Assad regime at the very top? I notice that the JIC
report says that it is believed that authority has been
delegated to commanders. I have seen press reports suggesting
that there may be a rogue—perhaps that is the wrong
word—commander acting on his own initiative. One needs to know,
because if that is what has taken place, the chances of it happening
again are different from the chances of it happening again if a
decision was taken at the centre. That is just one example of what one
needs to

want to say, and it has not been much touched on so far in this debate,
is how vital it is to retain the interest and, so far as is possible,
support of the Arab and Muslim powers in the world for whatever action

Arab League, in the shape of its Secretary-General, Mr Elaraby—a
distinguished Egyptian who has been in that role for some years
now—has come out and said that it believes that it is right and
proper to take action on the use of chemical weapons against the people

come a little later to the fact that the underlying clash in the Middle
East is, sadly, one between Sunni and Shia and that therefore we need
to think very hard about the crucial question posed by the noble Lord,

than we have done the Shia and not just the Sunni powers, and it is of

we are looking not at a single challenge but at two, and we cannot
totally divorce one from the other. There is the military challenge,
but associated with it—indestructibly so—is the
humanitarian challenge to which the noble Lord, Lord Jay of
Ewelme<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T16:59:11"></hs_TimeCode>, and
others have referred. That humanitarian challenge is almost beyond our
control now. As the noble Baroness, Lady Royall, pointed out, there are
already nearly 2 million refugees outside Syria who are
beginning to cast almost immeasurable pressures not only on the states
immediately around such as Turkey, Jordan and, tragically, Lebanon but
extending increasingly far beyond that; for example, even to the great
inflow into Iraq of refugees from the Syrian campaign and civil war.
What does that mean? It means, to choose again the question asked by
the noble Lord, Lord West, that we have to associate what we do about
that continuing crisis with what we do about the short-term one. That
in turn requires the maximum support of the Arab world to
assist us because we have to resettle all these refugees if Syria is to
have a serious future.</hs_para>

final point I want to make. I regard it as little short of a tragedy
that this country has no representation in Tehran, the single greatest
Shia power in the region. It is quite clear that we have missed an
opportunity because we did not accept the invitation extended to
us—not an easy one to accept—to be part of the
inauguration of the new president. I shall say two things about that.
The House ought to know—I am sure there are individuals who do
know—that Iran has consistently been totally opposed to the use
of chemical weapons. It has taken that position in one United Nations
official charter after another. Why is that? It is because it is the
country that suffered more than any other from the use of chemical
weapons in the Iraq-Iran war where we, tragically, supported the
Iraqis, even to the extent of arming them, against the huge losses of
life by Iran. Why do I say that? It is because Iran is an ally of Syria
and hates the use of chemical weapons. I suggest that it would be
sensible for us to explore, possibly through the good offices of
France, whether Iran would be prepared to suggest to Syria that it
would be entering terribly dangerous

Williams of Baglan:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the
Government for this debate. There is nothing more serious that a
Government can undertake than conducting military action. Like many
others, I commend the Government on the wisdom of bringing this matter
not only to the attention of Parliament but to the Security Council of
the United Nations. I strongly support the decision to await the report
of the weapons inspectors, without which the case for military action
could be seriously undermined. The charter of the UN is
clear that approval is necessary for the legitimatisation of military
action unless a country is acting under Article 15—namely,
self-defence—as Britain did following the invasion of the
Falklands in 1982.</hs_para>

responsibility to protect is still taking place, and I have strong
misgivings about that being used to justify military strikes in the
next few days. In all probability, we will see those strikes. However
limited, we must be clear that they are acts of war. Many Members have
referred to the possible risks that that entails. The noble Baroness,
Lady Royall, referred to an article that I wrote earlier this week. I
believe that those risks are considerable. Syria is not Kosovo in 1999
or Libya in 2011. Unlike those two countries, Syria is firmly embedded
in a military and political alliance with Iran and Lebanese Hezbollah,
which is almost certainly the most heavily armed non-state actor in the
world. Within its ranks, that alliance is known as the axis of
resistance. Syria is the bridge between Hezbollah and Iran, and neither
could afford to see that relationship rupture. Syria, as has been
noted, also enjoys considerable political cover from Russia. While it
is improbable that Iran or Syria itself would engage in overt military
action in retaliation for expected US raids, I believe that it is
highly possible that Hezbollah would at the very least deepen its
assistance to the Syrian regime, whose downfall it could not tolerate.
It could also do so by widening the war to Lebanon, which in the past
two weeks has already been the scene of two very large car bombings,
where bombs have been planted in Sunni mosques.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13082910000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829-0001.htm#13082910000118">Hezbollah<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T17:13:13"></hs_TimeCode>
might also threaten UNIFIL, the 10,000-strong UN peacekeeping mission
in southern Lebanon, in which many NATO countries are represented,
including France, Italy and Spain. It might even seek to break the
cessation of hostilities with Israel, which has lasted since the 2006
war. Hezbollah, an organisation that I had much to do with in my UN
service in the Middle East, has already warned of the consequences of
strikes against Syria and considers that it will undermine the balance
of power and deterrence—concepts in which the axis of resistance
believes strongly. Indeed, intervention could intensify the civil war
in Syria. It would make a decisive military victory or the
formulation of a compromise to end the war more difficult. In this
regard—we should note this, I believe—both Syria and
Hezbollah will draw some comfort from the fact that an allied military
strike will not meet with support in much of the world, particularly in
key developing 
<?notus-xml column=1743?>countries with which we are trying to develop closer
relations. I think of Brazil, South Africa, Indonesia and even India in
that regard.</hs_para>

of legality will, as with the 2003 war, dog the West for some years to
come if military strikes take place. There will also be consequences,
perhaps profound, for the West’s relationship with
Russia—a relationship that is hardly in good shape anyway.
Seeking a political solution after air strikes would be extremely hard.
Terrible though chemical weapons are, there are even worse
weapons—I refer to nuclear weapons. Sitting in Tehran and
perhaps watching on television missiles falling from the sky over
Damascus, Ayatollah Khomeini may well decide that Iran’s
acceleration of nuclear power is the only option to preserve its
independence. Russia and China, whose support we have counted on for so
long in the nuclear negotiations with Iran, may well become less
supportive of our position and that of our allies. Certainly the
outlook for the next round of talks over Iran’s nuclear weapons
will become much more

Elton:</Member></B> My Lords, it is not often that so much has been
said, and so quickly, at the beginning of a debate. The danger of
repetition is very great, and it also makes it possible to be briefer
than one might otherwise be. I suppose it is true, as the noble Lord
just said, that our reaction to any prospect of war is conditioned by
our previous experience, and my previous experience about the decision
to go to war is not a happy one. It is impossible to escape the first
question on this, which is certainty as to what has happened to which
we are reacting. I read through the JIC report on chemical weapons use

chemical weapons, you are then the aggressor because you spread them
around the country. On the other hand, if you decide to attack those
people who are thought to be in control, you release them from control.

agree with the Government, and with other allied Governments, that

be in many ways to legitimise an instrument of war that has been

any action carries the risk of siding with one side in a civil war, I
say this, which has not yet been said even by the Government: we have
already taken sides. We do not recognise President Assad as the
President of Syria. This country and two dozen others recognise the
National Coalition of Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces as the
legitimate representatives of the Syrian people. We have taken sides.
All we have not done is very much about it and it is time that we did,
not only by preventing the human catastrophe of another chemical
weapons attack, but by helping and supporting—indeed,
arming—the anti-Assad forces which we recognise as the
legitimate representatives of the people; by creating truly safe areas
for refugees, learning all the lessons of what not to do from Bosnia;
and by being generous with Jordan and the other countries that are
bearing the unbearable burdens of the spillover. We need to make it
clear that genocidal killing and ethnic cleansing by artillery,
rockets, grenades and guns, as well as poison gas, are at least as evil
and need to be treated in the same way.</hs_para>

that if we singularise this form of weaponry, we appear a contrario to
be legitimising other forms of slaughter and massacre. It seems to me
that murder is murder, irrespective of the choice of murder weapon. For
us to take on ourselves the job of punishing murder if it is committed
with a particular weapon and ignoring the 100,000 casualties that have
already taken place in Syria is paradoxical and perhaps driven more by
emotion in the case of President Obama, whose red lines have been

Milosevic gave

now. I do not believe that we should send massive land forces into
Syria. However, nor do I think that it is right to borrow Mr

“Is the country behind us? Do the people support what we are
being asked to do?”. That is an extraordinarily important
question to have in mind when we consider the Syria issue. It is all
very well having a military covenant and enshrining it with the force
of law—it is very important that that should have been
done—but we are not treating troops fairly if they are not given
a truthfully positive assurance in answer to that question. That is the
great significance of the opinion polls. The Government have to face
the fact that so far opinion polls have been about nine to one against
what is understood to be in the Government’s mind on military
intervention. It is therefore extremely important that in the days
ahead, as the evidence available becomes clearer, the Government make
every effort to explain the basis upon which the doctrine of the

tendentious cherry picking and is unhelpful rather than helpful. The
public will be reassured to see that one of the criteria to be
fulfilled is a humanitarian purpose inspired by humanitarian needs of
almost catastrophic proportions. That is the kind of thing that we
should expect to see more readily understood in the days ahead. The
days ahead are going to be extremely important. Upon them may depend,
among other questions, of course, which there is no time to develop,

the major one from Iraq has been missing. When we look back, there was
no doubt that Saddam Hussein had chemical weapons and had used chemical
weapons. Inspectors had been in not for 10 days but, on and
off, for 10 years. Saddam Hussein himself declared that he had chemical
weapons. Every intelligence agency in the world concluded that he
retained chemical precursors. In short, there was “no plausible

Hannay of Chiswick:</Member></B> My Lords, when this House last had a
debate on Syria, on 1 July, I urged the Government to try to prevent
any further use of chemical weapons by tabling a UN Security Council
resolution requiring President Assad to admit UN chemical weapons
inspectors and to give them unfettered access to any sites where past
or future allegations of use were made. Unfortunately, the Government
did not do that; indeed, the Minister, when she replied to the debate,
did not even respond to the proposal. I say
“unfortunately” not in an attempt to say, “I told
you so”, but because if we had pursued that course we might be
in a better place than we are now. Such a resolution, if passed, might
have deterred all concerned from the use of these appalling weapons,
and if Russia and China yet again vetoed any action against Syria we
and our allies should at least have been able to make clear at the UN

authority, is the least bad option available. If the Government decide
to go ahead on that basis and the House of Commons approves it, it
could be worth while, before using force, to give the Assad regime an
ultimatum to hand over all their chemical weapons to the United Nations
and to allow UN inspectors unrestricted access throughout the country.
That would make it even clearer where the responsibility would lie for
what might follow and would make clear the limited objectives of any
action taken. In any event, what is surely essential—and many
other noble Lords have said this—is that any military action
against the Assad regime should be accompanied by a renewed effort to
convene a conference designed to find a political solution to the

is broad consensus that the actions of the Assad regime are
increasingly intolerable. They have been the cause of revulsion and
condemnation for some time. In particular the awful images of children
suffering in what Save the Children has said is a human tragedy on a

response that something must be done. But we find ourselves torn

there are no easy answers. It is rare indeed for there to be such

before they can get better. I am sure that the Government will have
taken into account the increased strain on neighbouring countries as
more people flee Syria. Has extra money been provided to help these

which these events were being considered. I am glad that sanity has
resumed and the timetable slowed. I do not have the depth of experience
of many who have spoken or indeed who are yet to speak, but I have
little understanding of the region; Iraq and Syria in particular. I
have visited Syria on a number of occasions and held talks with
President Assad on several. I also spent some time in Iraq during the
second Iraq war. I was dispatched their seven times during the conflict

zone<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T17:49:33"></hs_TimeCode>. Those
experiences have coloured my judgment and I hope that your Lordships

sanctions. However, we must take military action only if it complies
with international law and is evidence-based. That means sometimes
having patience in the face of what seems to be an open and shut case.

giving this House and the other place time to digest the legal and

do not intend to repeat the powerful points that have been made on
international law, which is itself based on the Christian theory of
just war. That has been said very eloquently. However, I want to pick
up a couple of points. First, it has been said, quite rightly, that
there is as much risk in inaction as there is in action. In a conflict
in another part of the world—a civil conflict in which I was
mediating some years ago—a general said to me, “We have
to learn that there are intermediate steps between being in barracks
and opening fire”. The reality is that, until we are sure that
all those intermediate steps have been pursued, just war theory says
that the step of opening fire is one that must only be taken when there
is no possible alternative whatever under any circumstances. As the 
<?notus-xml column=1755?>noble Lord, Lord Alli, just said very clearly and very eloquently, the
consequences are totally out of our hands once it has

consequences we can predict. We have heard already about Lebanon and
about Iran, particularly the effect that an intervention would cause on
the new Government in Iran as they are humiliated by such an
intervention. However, there is a further point. I talked to a very
senior Christian leader in the region yesterday and he said that
intervention from abroad will declare open season on the Christian
communities. They have already been devastated. There were 2 million
Christians in Iraq 12 years ago; there are fewer than 500,000 today.
These are churches that do not just go back to St Paul but, in the case
of Damascus and Antioch, predate him. They will surely suffer terribly,
as they already are, if action goes ahead. That consequence has to be
weighed against the consequences of
inaction<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T17:57:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13082914000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829-0001.htm#13082914000024">In
civil wars, those who are internal to the civil conflict fight for
their lives, necessarily. Those who are external have a responsibility,
if they get involved at all, to fight for the outcome. That outcome
must be one that improves the chances of long-term peace and
reconciliation. If we take action that diminishes the chance for peace
and reconciliation, when inevitably a political solution has to be
found, whether it is near-term or in the long-term future, then we will
have contributed to more killing, and this war will be deeply

preventing any further use of chemical weapons. I have not yet heard

strategy: there must be more chance of a Syria and of a Middle East in

success of getting Russia, for the first time in this area, to agree to
United Nations inspectors going to establish the truth, that there was
apparently some proposal that we should launch a bombing attack while
they were there. There were stories that that was proposed for between
today and Sunday. The change of approach seems to me very sensible.
There must be every effort to establish the facts: were they real
chemical weapons? Questions have been raised about what category they
were in, who did it and at what level it was authorised. Obviously,
then, the report must come back and must be properly considered in the
United Nations.

because, across the world, we do not have great credibility on this
issue. It is no good Vice-President Joe Biden standing up to say,
“I am absolutely satisfied”. It is no good Secretary of
State John Kerry saying the same: “I am absolutely
satisfied”. Many of us remember a very good and honourable man,
Colin Powell, being put in an impossible position in presenting

notice the number of people with military experience who have the
greatest reservations about this, which should make us think. It should
make us think for this 
<?notus-xml column=1757?>reason, too: we are looking at a situation in this
region that is as dangerous as one could imagine. It is not just about
Sunni and Shia. There are splits within Sunni—there is Sunni,
al-Qaeda Sunni elements and a whole range of different people. Somebody
told me that this risks a conflagration that could stretch from Beirut
to Mumbai. That is wrong. It could go from Mali to Mumbai. We need to
look at the state of countries such as Egypt, the threat to Lebanon,
Syria, the refugee problems for Jordan, Yemen, the whole area and the
Gulf states themselves. Some of their rulers are very worried about the
situation. We must be extremely careful, and we must also be careful
because it is not without risks to our own country. The statement by
young Muslims that car bombs are their cruise missiles threatened us
previously when the Iraq invasion took place and when we were advised
that there was not necessarily a great risk of terrorism in this
country increasing. That was pre-7/7 and the problems that we had. We
need to be very careful indeed before we take these actions. We must
work as far as we can with the United Nations and use the wisdom,
authority and responsibility of Parliament to take this decision.

Griffiths of Burry Port:</Member></B> My Lords, we were urged at the
beginning of this debate to remember what we were not discussing, but
that has not prevented a number of us addressing those issues anyway.
We were not discussing regime change, punishment or the thin end of the
wedge. The tangle of knots of the noble Lord, Lord Hill, left one
clear-cut issue that he wanted us to debate today. One thing, he said,
and one thing only, was the question of the use of chemical weapons and
what to do about it. There has been widespread, indeed unanimous,
recognition of the evil of owning and using chemical weapons, the
defiance of the outcomes of such usage, and of internationally agreed
statements on such matters. The plea for a clear- cut,
simple, open and shut discussion of this debate leaves me saying,
“If

a number of fronts to share with us their own feelings about the
simple, clear-cut addressing of this question. Again and again we have
learnt that 50 shades of grey might indeed be a more appropriate way of
describing the varied responses and potential ways of looking at this
question, whether from a legal, military, political or moral point of
view. For the most part we have tried to keep on the ball, but it is
clear that across all these fronts, as many questions are raised by the
issue of a potential military intervention as would be solved,
especially, as we have heard from various quarters in the House, by an
inappropriate use of or resort to force. The likelihood, even a
small likelihood, of a mistake would quite simply tip the balance and
make it quite likely, as the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of
Canterbury suggested, that there would be the opposite of an
improvement of the likelihood of a positive outcome in the medium and

contribution, which will be very short, is to look at things from the
top deck of the Clapham omnibus and to ask how such an intervention
would 
<?notus-xml column=1758?>play out. What perceptions would it feed, real
or imagined, in ordinary people? We could look
internationally for starters. What would be the attitudes of people in
the countries and movements that traditionally support Syria when they
saw yet again an intervention of this kind from the West, bringing and
wreaking its own damage? It might be very clear-cut and a precise
course of action with a very welcome, simple outcome, but it might not.
The peoples of the Middle East, as has been referred to again and again
in this debate, are both angry and frightened at present. They are
bitterly divided and increasingly violent. To launch cruise missiles
into this volatile situation would be to invite the unforeseeable, and
for the unwanted to make its explosive appearance. We must be terribly
careful that we can convince ourselves that we have exhausted all other
possibilities and looked at every other possible way forward before we
take such risks, which are

opposition forces in Syria? Who are they? Who would we support? What
inner dynamic would we be likely to create between those groups of
rebels and the Government by intervening in this way? Is it not likely
that even the best organised might take the arms that we might offer
them, if it comes to that, without necessarily ending up as our
friends—indeed, the opposite? What about the people of this
country who are sick and tired of these adventures and no longer
believe politicians? It would behove all of us to ensure that the
public of this country were given the fullest and frankest possible
information so that they can sense the genuineness of what is being
proposed. We must be careful along those lines. The British public are
much more aware of the weakened state of the United Kingdom in the

working for better understanding between religions, races and classes

other and to work together to common ideals. Why is the United Kingdom

Maclennan of Rogart:</Member></B> My Lords, the underlying theme of the
international legal aspects that has to some extent motivated the
Government appears to be 
<?notus-xml column=1759?>the 2005 agreement and the responsibility to
protect. It does not seem in the least likely that military action
taken against the Assad regime would achieve that purpose. It appears
that military action would not necessarily be enough to wipe out the
use of chemical weapons. It does not seem likely that it would be
entirely targeted to be as effective in that direction. We will never
know, because we will not be advised by military representatives, in
this country or anywhere else, what the effects of such a
military attack would
be<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T18:14:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

what has been published today as inadequate to justify the use of force
in response to the horrific and shocking use of chemical weapons by the
Assad Government. It appears to me very unlikely that military action
would prevent the use of chemical weapons by Syria. It also seems
highly likely that it would stimulate responses that would be damaging
to other populations. Against the background of this appalling war,
with some 1.7 million people going into exile and 100,000 already dead,
it would be an intensification of the hostilities, not moving in the
direction of pacification or reconciliation. Both of those would seem
to be the prime responsibility of a country like ours, not a
retaliatory demonstration of a kind that seems to be utterly
unsuitable to the 21st
century<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T18:15:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

of an achievement to get the Russians to agree that they will come to
Geneva, but what would be the effect of military action on that
agreement? It is highly probable that they would withdraw, and I cannot
think that that is an outcome that we should be looking to achieve.
Surely we ought to be putting pressure directly on the Assad regime not
to use chemical weapons, but a retaliatory attack is unlikely to be
persuasive. If we are to exercise any influence on the Middle East and
its appalling problems, our role should be a conciliatory and mediating
one, not that of a participant in the use of force in that part of the
world. We ought to be aligning ourselves not only with the Arab League,
which is calling for action, but with the Russians and the Chinese.
Indeed, we should be calling for a uniting for peace resolution in the
General Assembly of the United Nations in order to create a forum in
which all the interested parties can play their

Dannatt:</Member></B> My Lords, the Leader of the House began and
finished his speech in opening this debate by referring to the issues
before us as simple. On one level they are simple. It is simple to say
that the use of chemical weapons and the results of the casualties that
they can inflict are abhorrent, that they are a moral outrage and that
therefore the issue is simple. I fully agree with the notion
that we should do all we 
<?notus-xml column=1760?>can to prevent their use, but I take that simple
notion and hold it up against the complexity of the situation that is
the civil war in Syria, and that apparently simple aspiration melts
away against that complexity.</hs_para>

looking at the Syrian civil war we have agonised over what form of
military intervention we might be able to follow, but each time we have
pulled back because the issues are too difficult. We have pulled back
from arming the opposition because we do not really know enough about
it and there is a high likelihood that some of the weapons that we
supply will wind up in the hands of the same people we are fighting in
Afghanistan. We have pulled back from a no-fly zone because the
technical and practical difficulties are too great. We do not have the
ability to take out the Syrian integrated air defence system. That is
too difficult. That would require a major military operation. We have
pulled back from that. If we cannot do that, we cannot establish
humanitarian corridors or safe areas.</hs_para>

from military intervention because the risks and consequences, whether
intended or unintended, are too great and the uncertainties that we
have identified are too many. But we are still looking at possible
intervention in the Syrian civil war, and we are now looking at it in
the narrower context of taking military action in this apparently
simple manner of deterring the further use of chemical weapons. Even
within that very limited objective, have we really thought this through
in the way in which the military would require intervention to be
thought through? Can we state with certainty what our strategic
objectives are?</hs_para>

our strategic objectives are actually very limited, that regime change
is not the objective, but we have been saying for the past two years
that Assad cannot stay as leader of that country. We are unclear about
our strategic objective, in which case we can have no campaign plan
that adds up. The campaign plan must have a beginning, middle and end
and it must take us to an exit strategy that leaves the place that we
have gone to in a better situation than it was before we went. I do not

unintended consequences are too

do we do? Clearly, your Lordships believe that we should be doing
something. Doing nothing is probably not our historical responsibility.
What we should be doing, in my view, is two things, in the main. First,
we should renew with great ferocity our diplomatic activity,
particularly to try, through greater dialogue with the Russians, to
bring some degree of unanimity to the United Nations Security Council.
Why is Russia so key? Russia is so key because Assad looks at the world
from Damascus and he looks at the West and says, “They
don’t like me but I don’t care. I look to the east and
the Russians support me, and the Iranians, and to an extent the
Chinese. I don’t care about the West. From my perspective, I am
supported and I am in position because the Russians are supporting
me”. We have to work the dialogue with the Russians in a very
open way and, dare I say it, work much harder than we have been able to
do in the past, because some degree of unanimity is really important in
the UN Security Council.</hs_para>

much harder for regional engagement and regional peace. What if we had
bombed Iran two years ago? Would we have any chance of the kind of
dialogue that is now potentially beginning with Iran? No, there would
be no dialogue there. Regional engagement is critical.</hs_para>

that we should do is rigorously apply law. When a leader of a country
has broken international criminal norms, he must know that there is a
very high probability that he will wind up in the dock somewhere in The
Hague. I have given evidence in The Hague against leaders who have done
just that; I am doing so again later this year. Assad and others must
know that if they do that, this will be their fate —unless they
are killed in the execution of their
crimes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13082914000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829-0001.htm#13082914000050">Finally,
what has been happening in our country this week has been very
interesting. The drums of war were banging very loudly two or three
days ago. The people did not like it. The dialogue and the debate have
changed. The other place has been considering a different Motion from
the one that was probably intended, looking for more time, a second
debate, a second vote. The drumbeat has got quieter, and that is really
important. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew of Twysden, has
already alluded to this: the people who have to carry out the military
actions that we might or might not require are the soldiers, sailors
and airmen of our Armed Forces. They are not some kind of elite who are
kept in a box and just wheeled out when they are needed; they are
citizens, like your Lordships and I, who absolutely have to know that
what they are being asked to do is what the country wants them to do
and what the country believes is right. We do not govern by consensus,
but we are democracy and the people have a very important voice in
this.</hs_para>

am delighted that the drumbeat has become more muffled. I do not
support intervention in Syria in any shape or form at this time.
Circumstances might change. There might be an international agreement
if we work the diplomatic peace and regional engagement better. There
might then be an opportunity, rather like Dayton, for an international
force to go in to implement an agreement. That is a long way away, but
it is the only the set of circumstances in which I would be prepared to
support military
intervention.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-08-29?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_08_29_PT_1/D85674BB23D754DD77848B51FF751CF1EC97ABFF" __version__="1.10"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 29 August 2013">Thursday,

I believe equally that we should not make judgment of guilt without due

disingenuous decision to invade Iraq, a support which with the benefit
of hindsight I have deeply regretted ever since. I believed then what
we were told the intelligence indicated and I now know that I was wrong
to do so. Whatever the legal advice—and I say this as a lawyer
and with respect for all other lawyers here—it is only advice. I
personally believe that, without United Nations sanction, any military
action on our part would be illegal. At least in Iraq there were many
unimplemented Chapter 7 United Nations resolutions. For the moment, no
such justification exists in relation to

Americans could achieve our joint military objectives. After the first

believe that we were not directing the action to regime change, and why
should they when we have from the outset opposed the Assad regime,
declined to recognise him and recognised the opposition instead? Most

change using a very high moral ground to justify our actions. Nor does
the concept of limited-target military action hold water. Even as we

those of your Lordships who think that without the UN we can be
arbiters of undoubted evil doings. Can we be confident that we as a
country are not knowingly contributing to all sorts of human rights
abuses and abusive regimes? Sadly, the answer at the moment seems to be
no. It came emphatically in a report of Sir John Stanley’s

the Summer Recess. It
said:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13082920000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829-0001.htm#13082920000022">“The

the US put their strength behind efforts to make that initiative
succeed. In political circles here, you hear a lot of rumours about
Iran’s alleged wish to make weapons-grade fissile material but
almost nothing about Israel’s obdurate refusal even to discuss
its nuclear weapons. Nevertheless, we can sell Israel £8 billion

Brennan:</Member></B> My Lords, the Parliament that we sit in, when it
considers military intervention in another country, is undertaking one
of its highest duties and one of its most anxious tasks. That we should
be asked to consider intervention in a civil war in the Middle East
with a religious background that has gone on for years and is likely to
end only with the defeat of one side or through exhaustion beggars
belief. I am sorry to be so blunt. It is fraught with difficulty and
danger, particularly in terms of the law.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T18:49:45"></hs_TimeCode> in this
country and the world at large will not accept the intelligence
assessments of this event to justify action. That will no longer be the
way to persuade people. They will want
evidence.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13082916000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829-0002.htm#13082916000018">On
23 August, CBS ran a news item suggesting that the US had been tracking
chemical weapons movements in the days prior to 21 August. Whether that
was right or wrong does not matter. It shows the kind of evidence that
people will want to see. At the weekend, as other noble Lords may have
heard, a retired Mossad officer proclaimed his confidence that
recordings would exist of conversations illustrating the movements of
these weapons and the associated decision-making. That will have to
come out if we want to persuade not only this country but the world of
the legality of action.</hs_para>

be reserved for the people who have committed these war crimes, not for

elimination of chemical weapons if it can be achieved, and, if not,
deterrence. I have seen nothing that indicates that this action will
achieve either. We will bomb Syria and the chemical weapons will
continue to exist there. These are serious difficulties. When we talk

we bomb one side in Syria? That is a most dangerous judgment to make
when our people will be at risk. As the most reverend Primate said
about Christians, do we seriously think that if this action is taken,
there will not be reprisals and advantage taken of the weakest people
who will be associated with the West? These are terrible consequences

states that have neither signed nor acceded to the Chemical Weapons
Convention of 1992. The others are Somalia, North Korea, Angola and
Egypt. Two states have signed but not ratified the convention: Myanmar

prohibition of chemical weapons was not novel, even at the time of the
Geneva Convention of 1925. The Brussels Convention of 1874 prohibited
the employment of poison or poisoned weapons and the use of arms,
projectiles or material to cause unnecessary suffering. Its aims were
restated in 1899 in the Hague Convention, whose parties declared their
agreement to abstain from the use of projectiles the sole object of
which was the diffusion of asphyxiating or deleterious gases.
Of<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T18:55:08"></hs_TimeCode> course, that

chemical weapons by the regime in a heavily populated area is a war
crime, and it is likely that the regime will seek to use the weapons
again. The question that must have occurred to your Lordships when we

responsibility to protect doctrine, which it is suggested was a cloak

International Law Commission spent more than 70 years before the 2005
United Nations conference discussing the principles that should be
applied. But it concluded, even after all its considerations in 2005,
that the Security Council is still the only means through which a state

state<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T18:59:43"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
essential that, when the evidence is clear, the matter goes back to the

that I hope will commend itself to your Lordships. It is a new
diplomatic approach. Once we have discovered or confirmed that
President Assad was responsible for the use of these weapons, we should
go back to the United Nations, certainly to the Security Council. Like
my namesake, I think that in those circumstances it is conceivable that
even Russia and China will support us if the evidence is not
controversial. We should then adopt a procedure that was characteristic
of what happened—and I think the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, will
confirm this—during the Korean War. At that time, in 1950, the
Russians were known not to be likely to support the idea of a task
force sent by the UN to Korea, but the Governments of the time got
round that by having something called the “uniting for
peace” procedure, whereby the General Assembly was asked to take
action by a two-thirds majority and, indeed, it did. The Korean War was
fought by the UN under those circumstances. After that, having
established ourselves well with the UN, we should then
dispatch a mission of various representatives to President Assad. As
this is a House of bishops, why not include in the delegation a number
of churchmen? That might inspire the Syrian leaders to realise that at
least we are capable of novelty, if nothing else.</hs_para>

dismay. The contributions that have been made by the
Opposition—which is their duty—have helped to make us all
think twice about the issues. Of course, I absolutely agree that the
use of chemical weapons is a moral question. But it is also a moral
question to use high explosives to destroy women and children and
inflict pain and suffering—all the events that are going on in
Syria. Surely the moral question is: what can we do to bring this to an
end and to end the suffering? For the life of me, I do not believe that

listened to this debate, it seems that there are really no good
options. Every one has its downside. Despite the horror of 100,000
killed, 1 million refugees and the victims of terrible
chemical warfare, the right course of action is still not
clear—except that the case for armed force, for bombing, has not
been made. Certainly, we would need more evidence. We have to wait for
the weapons inspectors. We need more intelligence information that is
in the possession of our Government and others than we have seen so
far. Above all, we need evidence of Assad’s responsibility for
the use of chemical weapons. It has already been suggested that the
decision to use them may have been made at a lower level in the Assad
military. It will be hard to prove—it will be difficult to get
the evidence for that—but if that is the case, certainly if

the great likelihood is that last week’s chemical weapons attack

an intervention in the Syrian civil war but an exercise in deterrence,

to be wrong with that argument. First, deterrent theory works by being
clear and understood by both sides. Some of us sat at the feet of the
great Michael Quinlan on these matters. Mutually assured destruction at
the time of the Cold War worked because two players who understood each
other understood the risks and knew what the consequences were. I am
sorry to say that President Obama issued unclear threats, and we do not
know 
<?notus-xml column=1777?>whether there is in Syria a rational opponent playing the same game by
the same rules. Nor do we see a clear read-across to other situations.
What would we do if, say—and I hope it is
unimaginable—China, used chemical weapons in a local war, or
Russia herself? The deterrent argument seems to me to be more like that
deployed at Suez: that if one dictator nationalises things, all
dictators will nationalise things; or at Vietnam: that if one domino
falls, all the other dominos will fall. Those were not good arguments
then. You can paint yourself into corners with red

the deterrent theory argument for a moment, action in pursuit of it is
inevitably also an intervention in the Syrian civil war, the
consequences of which we cannot predict. Here is one—not
implausible, it seems to me—scenario. We fire rockets that
degrade Assad’s command structure and perhaps damage indentified
chemical weapons stores. In the ensuing chaos, the toughest anti-Assad
fighters, the al-Qaeda affiliates, gain momentum and capture one of the

the Leader of the House for the statement at the beginning of the
debate today, and I particularly welcome the indications from the
Government that they have slowed down their approach and will take more
time to deal with this issue. That has been welcomed by the House and
the country generally. Secondly, I urge that we ensure that as we slow
down and examine this issue carefully, we do it to our own timetable
and are not responding to the timetable set down by others, such as the
USA<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T19:30:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13082925000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829-0002.htm#13082925000007">I
come at the Government’s proposal with a degree of scepticism. I
am sure that I am in line with many of the population. This is not
because of a lack of sympathy or abhorrence about what has happened to
the Syrian victims. There is concern for them and the Syrian population
as a whole, and there is concern for the wider implications of the
consequences that might arise from any military action on which we
embark. I can be quite honest that my scepticism is based to a
degree on the fact that, like others who have spoken 
<?notus-xml column=1778?>today, I gave full support to the intervention in Iraq and subsequently
going into Afghanistan. As time has gone by and I have seen what has
happened, I have come to regret the decisions that I took at the time.
I am very anxious to ensure that as I approach this issue, we do not
repeat some of the errors of the past and what has happened in the
recent past<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T19:31:25"></hs_TimeCode>. I
say this in a week especially when more than 50 people were killed in
Baghdad and after a report from the United Nations that last month

test that we ought to be exercising increasingly, even though people
say that we should not be conditioned by what happened in Iraq and
Afghanistan is: have we improved the quality and safety of life for the

improved the quality and safety of life for our citizens here in the

surrounded and guarded, which was not the case a decade ago, and I look
at the cost and burden to the public, it is not
difficult to understand why this time round the public are
extraordinarily against what is being proposed by the Government. It
behoves us to take account of that and to pick up the points made by
the noble Lord, Lord Dannatt, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord
Mayhew, that we cannot ignore the knock-on effect on our troops if we

way—that so many suggestions and proposals have emerged, which I
sense have not been addressed by the Government in their full respect,
that he should ask his officials to take the debate away and draw up a

learn about where the Government have taken appropriate action, or
think they have, or where no action on the lines that some people have

Phillips of Sudbury:</Member></B> My Lords, 10 years ago, several of us
who are in the House today took part in the Iraq debate, for which
there were 115 speakers. I remember in particular the contribution of
the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall. It has been reflected in
today’s remarkable debate by the noble Lords, Lord West and Lord
Dannatt. There is no doubt that our military heroes have a rooted
practicality in their view of these intensely difficult foreign affairs
issues. I also recollect that on that occasion there was opposition to
our going into Iraq at roughly two to one among those who contributed
to the debate. This afternoon, at a rough reckoning, it is more like
eight to one or even 10 to one against the notion of unilateral
intervention—by “unilateral”, I refer of course to
America and France as
well<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T19:36:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

legality issue is one that I cannot avoid, and we have heard some plain
speaking on it. I put it to the House that the justification
for humanitarian intervention depends, because it is a
common law justification, on that unilateral intervention being
reasonably likely to lead to less violence, death and destruction and
to more chance of a resolution of the deep, underlying issues. Many
other speakers have alluded to the fact that the likely consequence of
a unilateral attack on the chemical weapons installations in Syria will
be precisely the reverse. It will intensify the extremism, radicalise
even more, and undermine the tender shoots of reconciliation within
Syria. Indeed, I am not thinking of Syria alone because the whole
region is unbelievably unstable, staggeringly fragile and frighteningly
liable to internal explosion. One must look very carefully at the
Government’s case for saying that the action they may eventuate
would be justified by international law. I doubt it.</hs_para>

consequences of such an intervention would be wholly counterproductive
is again one that other speakers have referred to: that, sadly, the
United States and the United Kingdom in particular are not viewed in
the region as being honest brokers. We have form and we do not have
clean hands. We are regarded as being very far from even-handed. I make
these remarks having travelled extensively throughout the Middle East
over the past 12 years, and that is the message I get again and again.
Of course we act with sincerity and try to do our best. However, for
example—I am sad to have to raise it, but one cannot avoid
it—if one considers what is happening in Israel and Palestine,
the fact remains that Israel is colonising the West Bank by military
force and has been doing so for more than 20 years. The colonisation
goes on and on, and Gaza is under siege. What happens? We go on
supplying arms and America goes on giving financial support. There is
no way in which the average Muslim who is interested in the politics of
his country and region can view what we are doing as remotely
justifying our intervention in Syria in the way that is now being
contemplated. Look at our support for Saudi Arabia, which is scarcely a
model state in terms of democracy and progressiveness. Look at what has
happened in Iraq, and Iran was mentioned by my noble friend Lady
Williams and other noble Lords.</hs_para>

is a very striking example. As the noble Baroness said, in 1982 we
supported Saddam Hussein when he invaded Iran. We supplied his weapons,
and he subjected the Iranians to gas and chemical weapon attacks for
some considerable length of time. What did we do about it? I cannot
recollect that we did anything. Now we have the current attitudes. I
emphasise that for us to go in, however good our intentions,
would be potentially

I want to ask, what do we do? I liked the phrase “ferocity of
diplomatic action”, which the noble Lord, Lord Dannatt, used.
That is just what we need, and imaginative action at that. Through the
UN and through our work with Russia—and, I hope, with Iran and
everybody else—we will maximise what chance there is for a
peaceable resolution, not just in Syria but across the whole Middle

read the claim in yesterday’s <I>Times</I> that weapon strikes
against Syria following the chemical weapon incident on 21 August were
legitimate—one of Thomas Aquinas’s conditions of a just
war. The use of the word “war” seemed typical of a
media-induced frenzy, on the back of which the Government appeared to
be proposing that moral outrage justified unilateral military action,
whatever the consequences. Thankfully, the measured introduction to
today’s debate by the Leader of the House suggests that Mr
Miliband has succeeded in introducing a degree of common sense into the
situation, which appeared to be getting rapidly out of control, revved
up by unsubstantiated assertions such as Mr Hague’s public
statement that President Assad was responsible.</hs_para>

this reminded me of my thoughts about the invasion of Iraq. In December
2002, I wrote to Mr Blair on behalf of a group that had met
at the Royal United Services Institute to discuss non-military
alternatives—those intermediate steps mentioned by the most
reverend Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury—pointing out the
damage that unjustified military action would do to the United
Kingdom’s national interests by undermining the relationships
that we had built up in the Middle East over many years, encouraging
extremist Muslim organisations such as al-Qaeda to take retaliative
action against the West in the West, and by causing us to be seen in
the Muslim world as a warmonger rather than a peacemaker. Any
international action should demonstrate a clear balance between
long-term objectives and short-term gains, with regional issues
paramount.</hs_para>

was the first time that we could recollect our Armed Forces being sent

my concern about what our Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary seem to

what chemical

the threat from Middle East regional devastation and from missiles

of people have been exiled and killed, including women and children. We
had perfectly good cause to intervene under the “responsibility

sort of rehearsal, like the Spanish Civil War, for the bigger
conflagration that is about to come. We should therefore dread the
possibility that the UN inspectors will find evidence and that perhaps
the UN Security Council will co-operate. Then we will intervene. All
the consequences that people have mentioned regarding what will happen
if we intervene—all the side-effects and responses—will
happen, even if there is full legitimacy for our move. In war, there
are no clear, clean outcomes. The Second World War, which was the last,
as it were, just war, was full of mistakes on all sides. There were the
most God-awful tragedies, but we still respect that war because the end
result was better than when it
started<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T19:53:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

out in Iraq is a Shia majority and democracy—the only one in the
Middle East. We got that regime change. In that debate, I said that I

The whole problem is that the US and UK have created this structure for
international order, which we have been embellishing by duties such as
the “responsibility to protect”. We have now lost the
will to sustain it. We may have also lost the power to sustain it, but
we have certainly lost the will to sustain it. Red lines can be drawn,
but red lines will be withdrawn and then drawn somewhere
else.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13082925000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829-0002.htm#13082925000030">We have
now perhaps to rethink our entire doctrine. International order is a
global public good. Do we have the strength and resources to provide it
and protect it? We will have to come to the conclusion very soon that,
even together with America and France, we do not have the will or the
power to sustain the global public good we created. The noble Lord,
Lord Howell, asked why the eastern powers are not intervening. They did
not create this order; they do not care for this order; why should they
defend this order? It is our responsibility, but we will not defend it.
It is clear to me that the poor Prime Minister, on holiday, when the
blood rushed to his head, thought, “My God, I must
intervene”. I think that he should not go on holidays and then
we may have a better

we are facing now is that we are chickening out and that we will
intervene the next time when circumstances will be much more against
us. That will happen when this general war in the Middle East touches
Israel. When Israel is under threat, that is the final red line that
America will draw. That is when it will go and then we will be in a
much worse circumstance than we are in right now. We will have another

my noble friend says that the choice is between action or no action, to
act or not to act, the problem is that his view of action is military
action and nothing else. As various noble Lords have said, military
action ought to come after everything else has been tried. The other
point about action or no action is that if you take no action for the

pulling back by the Government in the past few days has been a good
thing. It has clearly been in response to public opinion; I think that
it has been a response to an opinion in the Conservative Party and the
Liberal Democrats as well. It has also been a response to what has been
happening in the House of Commons among the politicians. Of course, the
press will always try to personalise it and say that it is a big
victory for one side or the other. I think that it is a victory for the
House of Commons which, as a body, has been responsible for this being
pulled back. In recent times, people have said, “Parliament is a
waste of time, the House of Commons is toothless and not like it used
to be”, and so on, but from time to time we get events and
crises when the House of Commons, in particular, can rise to say,
“Thus far and no further; we want a change”. I think that
this is a victory for democracy as much as anything
else.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13082925000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829-0002.htm#13082925000036">As for

The Minister, in introducing the debate, said that the Arab League was

by and large, in the Middle East; it certainly does not speak for some
other countries and, in particular, I am not sure that the leaders of
the Arab League speak for the Arab

problem is that while Sunni opinion throughout the world may be
watching and may be not too concerned about things at the moment
because there is an evident dictator, a brutal sectarian dictator who
is a version of Shia, once it goes wrong, if only 1% of the hundreds of
cruise missiles that may be launched lose their way and hit a hospital

Britain are concerned, I have no doubt that British action in Iraq,
Afghanistan, Libya and Pakistan have played a central role in
radicalising people. There are two aspects to this. Most of the
ordinary Muslims in Britain come from the south Asian subcontinent.
They are mainly Sunnis and mainly attend the mosques of a moderate
variety of Islam. People I have spoken to recently in my own 
<?notus-xml column=1785?>area in Lancashire have commented that what is going
on in Syria is dreadful, the chemical attack was appalling and Assad is
a bad man, but that when western countries go in to try to sort things
out, they almost always seem to make things worse. I do not think that
there will be lots of people out on the streets in demonstrations, like
there were 10 years ago when a lot of us went on the big march. I do
not think a lot of Asian people will do that at the moment, but the
problem is the small number of individuals who for various
reasons—their contacts, their psychological disposition or
whatever—are subject to radicalisation. I have no doubt that if
the missile attack on Syria takes place, it will almost certainly
contribute to serious radicalisation and possible future serious
incidents in this country.</hs_para>

attacking the Assad regime on the grounds that chemical weapons may
have been used. We are all horrified by TV pictures of the suffering of
innocent civilians in the civil war between different religious
factions, but those on the receiving end would probably say that
innocent men, women and children being killed or maimed by chemical
weapons is no worse than their being killed, maimed or wounded, or
having the limbs of those near and dear to you blown off, by more
conventional means of mass killing. The use of even more weaponry,
however tactical, will simply increase that suffering.</hs_para>

Obama’s wish to be seen as a strong and decisive world leader

vast areas of Vietnam, which led to hideous deformities in the unborn.
We have heard today that its use is prohibited by the 1925 Geneva

to invade the sovereign territory of other countries to kill, main and
destroy those it does not like. Such behaviour does not go unnoticed in
the Middle East and the rest of the world. It is wrong to pretend that
the USA has a moral right to lecture the rest of the world on ethical

know that President Assad is a cruel dictator, but he is not mad. It is
difficult to believe that he would deliberately try to provoke America
into going to war against him. It gets even murkier if we look at Saudi
Arabia, America’s Sunni ally in the Middle 
<?notus-xml column=1786?>East. It was a Saudi-owned news channel, Al Arabiya, which first broke
the story of the supposed chemical attack. The Saudi Government, with
United States approval, have been supplying arms to the rebel groups.
The use of chemical weapons can only strengthen the hand of the Sunni
factions, both inside and outside Syria. These include al-Qaeda and
other terrorist groups. It is not in the West’s interests to
strengthen their hand. For these reasons, I oppose military
action.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-08-29?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_08_29_PT_1/B69840321461FC539CE199E6AAEB5CFF537B1E8C" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 29 August 2013">Thursday,

Egypt, Iraq, Afghanistan and the subject of today’s debate,
Syria. If you look at Syria, a relatively young country created after

myself—my noble friend Lord Howell raised this—who in the
world today believes that the United Sates, the United Kingdom and a
couple of other countries should be policing the world? That is
not what the vast majority of the world believes; it looks to the UN to
provide that. We must work with the UN to make sure that that happens.

weapons issue, on the last incident—I am amazed to hear that
there were 14 other occasions; certainly I was not aware of
them and would like to know why they were not more broadly
publicised—we frankly still do not know who did it. We know that
it happened. The House knows that I have had deep involvement in Sri
Lanka and I know that evidence can be and is fabricated by rebel
groups. I have seen it with my own eyes, with the Tamil Tigers’
accusations about certain of the actions of the Sri Lankan Government.
Frankly, I do not believe that al-Qaeda is totally innocent in Syria;
it may be and it would be wonderful if it was, but I wonder. If it was
the Government, what was their motive? Was it a central government
decision that there should be a sudden strike on a suburb of Damascus?
Far more likely is the suggestion of my noble friend on the Liberal
Benches that it was probably, possibly, a rogue element in the Syrian
army. Let us reflect on what happened on our side in the Second World
War. We had a number of rogue actions taken against government orders;
that is not unusual in war and we should never forget that. That was,

sort—I speak as a former RAF pilot, as is my noble friend to my

Lord Judd, whose stance on these matters over many years I have come to

speech of the noble Lord, Lord Dannatt. I hope that the Government will
listen very carefully to his wise

on behalf of my party, Plaid Cymru, as well as for myself, in opposing
any question of military intervention in Syria on the basis of the
information—or rather, the lack of it—that we have at
present. I would oppose military intervention in any circumstances
without a specific United Nations mandate spelling out the legal basis
for intervention, the parameters of any military action and the outcome
that it was meant to secure.</hs_para>

three dimensions of the issue: the facts relating to the use of
chemical weapons, the potential methods of intervention and the
possible knock-on effects in the Middle East. We all condemn without
reservation the use of chemical weapons. They can be just as gruesome
as nuclear weapons—which, if we are consistent, we should also
ban in the name of humanity. In the case of Syria, three questions
arise. Have chemical weapons been used? The answer to this will be
provided by United Nations investigators. Secondly, if chemical weapons
have been used, who used them, and can be we certain of our facts in
this regard? If we are, can we be equally certain about who ordered
their use, and that they were not used on the orders of loose cannons
using them for Machiavellian
purposes?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13082925000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829-0002.htm#13082925000060">With
regard to intervention, we must surely be clear as to the specific
effects of any proposed military intervention and whether any new
scenario after such military action is sustainable. Frankly, when I
heard American officials talking of lobbing in 100 cruise
missiles—at which targets we were not quite sure—and of
Obama talking about a rap across the knuckles, I was driven to the
conclusion that the US does not know what it is trying to do. When I
heard the Liberal Democrat leader on a BBC programme this morning being
cornered into accepting that there may be many further steps, I
shuddered to think where mission creep may take

there is the whole tinderbox of the Middle East regional fragility into
which we may choose to fire those warning shots. One elects to throw a
match into a powder keg at one's own peril. There are many extreme
elements in that region who are just itching for the opportunity or
excuse to fire their own warning shots or massively more at Israel.
Goodness knows, there are those in Israel who would be only too glad to
fire their own ultimate weapons of mass destruction as a lesson to
their hostile neighbours. That scenario does not bear contemplation.
One thing is certain. We should not fire random shots into a powder
box. We should avoid that in order not to escalate to
Armageddon<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T20:21:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13082925000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829-0002.htm#13082925000062">Humanitarian
considerations drive us to ban chemical weapons—and rightly so.
Therefore, should not humanitarian dynamics also guide us in the way in
which we respond to such weapons? Will not the course being pursued by
the Government make it less likely, rather than more likely, that we
can move towards political action and reconciliation? Will it make the
Geneva II agenda more or less likely to progress? Will such action not
escalate the humanitarian crisis, with a flood of refugees becoming a
tsunami, which would cause the aid agencies immense difficulties? The
NGOs just could not cope. Those humanitarian factors must surely also
come into the equation. Should not any action which we take lead to the
greater likelihood of a coherent road map towards negotiations? Do the
Government seriously believe that firing cruise missiles as shots
across the bow will increase the chances of such a road map
emerging?</hs_para>

of chemical weapons; and at the deaths so far in the Syrian war of more

displaced, whose situation in the desert with no basic facilities for
their children, such as education, will reverberate across the region
long after Assad has gone from the scene. Where, incidentally, did
those chemical weapons come from? Can we cut off the supply? How

How long will the intervention last? When can it be said to have been
successfully accomplished? What if Assad or whoever the culprit is has
more stocks of chemical weapons and is able to import more? What will
our reaction be if the slaughter spreads to neighbouring countries?
Since Russia is involved, this possible exercise will not be like the
one undertaken in, say, Kosovo. If the US and the UK did not finish
what they started and Assad survived and continued, American
credibility and our own would be damaged and Iran, for example, will
see that the West is impotent in relation to its collection of nuclear
material. In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T20:26:27"></hs_TimeCode> the

reverberation across the Middle East and at home. We have never taken

Chinese occupation of Tibet and the protection of North Koreans, with
as many horrors, because of the strength of Russia and China and their

failure of the European Union in this foreign policy area. There has
been a low-key call from Europe for a diplomatic push. I would have
expected a stronger voice of leadership on this issue. If there is a
failure of our international organisations, we will have a resurgence

Inglewood:</Member></B> My Lords, as a follower of events in Syria and
an occasional contributor to discussions about it in this Chamber, I
always find that the noble Lord, Lord Wright, expresses my views more
clearly than I can myself and I have not been disappointed that
afternoon. Like everyone else, I am aghast at what has been happening
in Syria and especially horrified by the use of chemical weapons. I,
too, am very frustrated and distressed by the way in which this
wonderful country and its splendid population has been
caught up in the much wider volatility in the Middle East of which it
is now an integral and unfortunately inseparable part. We know that the
Assad regime and the Ba’ath Party have behaved appallingly and
appear to have used chemical weapons, but the rebels who line up with
the Salafists and who indiscriminately murder Christians and Muslims
are no
better<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T20:29:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13082925000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829-0002.htm#13082925000074">In
the circumstances of now, I believe that it is naive, as my noble
friend Lord Hurd of Westwell pointed out, to imagine that it might be
possible to intervene neutrally or impartially between the protagonists
in this civil
war<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T20:29:31"></hs_TimeCode>. It is bound
to benefit one side or the other, and then we have become a protagonist
ourselves. The beneficiary will soon forget our help and blame us for
neo-colonial intervention, and the loser will hold us responsible for
their setbacks. By then, we are completely

the use of chemical weapons is both unacceptable and illegal, but it
does not follow that we, or for that matter anyone else, must intervene
militarily even if it is legal to do so; it is merely an option. What
is legal is not necessarily wise; indeed—and I speak as a
lawyer—often it is not. Furthermore, recent history shows that
the criminal perpetrators of mass atrocities can run but they cannot
hide indefinitely from international law and its processes and
enforcement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T20:30:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

speakers today, I am glad that the Government have toned down their
bellicose stance of the weekend. We must not adopt a stance of macho 
<?notus-xml column=1792?>belligerence; rather, we must proceed carefully
within the framework of law in a manner which is pragmatic and
practical in military, diplomatic and political terms. Equally, it is
important that we do not allow Britain to become, or to be perceived to
have become, a kind of global vigilante. We should not feel that it is
necessary in any way to race to the front of the queue to join a posse,
even if it is led by one of our closest allies. I find myself recalling
with approval, and to my own surprise, Harold Wilson, who I believe did
this country a great service by keeping this country out of the Vietnam

course, it goes without saying that we must strive in every way to
contribute to the humanitarian needs of Syria and that part of the
Middle East and, equally, work for the cessation of the use of chemical

Bismarck’s comment that the Herzegovina treaty was not worth the
bones of a Pomeranian fusilier. I see no evidence now that persuades me
that Syria is worth the bones of a British service man or woman. That
is the likely consequence of the kind of military intervention
currently under discussion to respond to the use of chemical

Lea of Crondall:</Member></B> My Lords, this has been a very well
informed debate. It is not to be unnecessarily partisan but rather to
get my one party point out of the way first that I say that it has been
a great strength to the Labour Party’s position that it has
thought through many of the questions which have been posed for answer
today. That was in effect set out by the noble Baroness, Lady Royall,

speeches by the noble Lords, Lord Wright of Richmond and Lord Dannatt,
reflected great diplomatic and military experience. It is perhaps not
often recognised by people who have not been in the military that the
logistics involved in anything that is being talked about are very
considerable. If you do not have Brize Nortons scattered around the
eastern Mediterranean, you have to get the stuff to Cyprus first and so
on. It was with some incredulity that I kept reading that something was
going to happen on Sunday, leaving aside the point, also made very
tellingly, that the chemical weapons dumps are apparently spread around
Syria and that to take them, or to do anything to make sure that they
could not be used again, you would have to have thousands of boots on
the ground. I ask the Minister to comment on that particular point in
his reply. That rather suggests to me that that is probably true. We
have a few days to reflect on where we are trying to get to. As the

should like to focus on the proposition that military action should be
taken if it is clear that Assad has used chemical weapons. I believe
that there is a need for a far greater clarity about the thinking
behind such proposals before we can have a sensible discussion about
its merits. If military action is not backed up by a UNSCR, what is the
legality of such a step in this case? Why is it thought that a limited
strike would prevent further humanitarian disaster? I will return to
that point in a moment. It is that—not the breaking of the
chemical warfare convention; the legal advice we have had this

just a couple<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T20:39:52"></hs_TimeCode>.
Is it to punish Assad and thereby deter him from the further use of
chemical weapons? If so, what is the assessment of how this can be
achieved against a man and a regime hardened by years of brutal civil
strife? Why on earth do we think that he will care? Are we judging that

the objective to target chemical warfare dumps? If so, how convincing
is the evidence that we know where they all are and whether they are in
penetrable bunkers? What will be the measure of success? Chemical
weapons are extremely difficult to destroy completely. The most common
method is incineration at very high temperatures over a sustained
period in contained systems. Munitions used by the military almost
never reproduce such effects, especially the ones designed to penetrate
hardened structures. Another problem is the sheer volume of material.
Estimates put Syrian stockpiles in the hundreds of tonnes of various
types. What considerations have been given to collateral damage from
chemical weapons released by a strike, possibly generating a worse
humanitarian
problem<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T20:41:06"></hs_TimeCode>? The

Tebbit:</Member></B> My Lords, I think we can be confident that we
would all agree that the Government have got one thing absolutely right
today: they put down a Motion on which there could not be a vote in
this House. I think that was a very wise move. We are all familiar with
the expression “mission creep”, but we should also be
aware of language creep. I notice that, in ministerial language, what
was the Assad Government has now become the Assad regime. When the dog
is given a bad name, it knows what to expect next. When I read the JIC
assessment, I noticed that it said,</hs_para>

Prime Minister speaking in the other place today, that had morphed in
his words into the “certainty” that it had done so. I
think this is almost certainly an unconscious act of creep, but it

in so much of the development of policy on more than this one
matter.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13082925000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829-0002.htm#13082925000098">The
noble Lord, Lord Kerr, rightly questioned the exaltation of chemical

questioned that. Indeed, as many terrorist victims in this

moral objection to the people who did that, procured it or ordered it

country.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13082925000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829-0002.htm#13082925000099">I
find myself in the somewhat unnatural position—it is certainly
an unusual position—of agreeing completely with the noble Lord,
Lord Wright of Richmond. It does not often happen; we should celebrate
this matter. Indeed, there were so many others whom I agreed with that
I cannot list them all in my allocated time, but notably my noble
friend Lord Hurd and the noble Lord, Lord Dannatt, expressed many of
the concerns that worry me. Like them and many others, I am not
satisfied that Ministers have adequately thought through the likely,
let alone the possible, consequences of the course of action to which
they seem unnaturally attracted. We in this country may think that the
use of force against the Assad Government will be seen in the way that
we would like it to be seen, but in the Middle East, and perhaps in
Moscow too, it will be seen, as the noble Lord, Lord Judd, suggested,
as an intervention against President Assad and in favour of the rebel
forces. I ask myself whether that is what the Government intend. Do
they really intend to intervene on behalf of 
<?notus-xml column=1796?>the rebel forces or for it to be seen in that way across the Middle
East? I am far from convinced that if Assad were to be brought down it
would any more bring peace to Syria than the fall of Mubarak has
brought it to Egypt. I think we are now all becoming convinced that the
Arab spring did not last very long and that a deep and long winter has
now set in instead. I wish that my friends in government will really
think before they drift into places where they never intended to go,
but I doubt that they are in any mood to do
so.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-08-29?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_08_29_PT_1/C4728B04648EB0B8A37C651583E2EB50B2EE97F4" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 29 August 2013">Thursday,

Soley:</Member></B> My Lords, the decision on whether or not to
intervene has become an increasingly difficult problem over recent
years and will continue to do so given the current state of the Middle
East. It is a profoundly difficult decision. If you do not intervene,
lives will be lost and, if you do, lives will also be lost. The lesson
of Iraq is not necessarily “Do not intervene,” but,
“If you intervene, make sure that you have thought through the
post-conflict situation”. That is where those sorts of things go
profoundly wrong.</hs_para>

whether we should use force. I am prepared to see force being used in
this situation. However, I cannot see what the object would be of using
force now. I could see it right at the beginning, but what is the
purpose of military intervention of some type now? There is a case for
intervention to prevent weapons of mass destruction from being used
again. I understand that; it is laudable and proper. My problem is that
I do not know how you would achieve that end. What military actions
would you take to prevent weapons of mass destruction from being used
again, whether in Syria or in the immediate neighbouring areas by
agents of the Syrian Government? I believe that the Syrian Government
used them. If it was the opposition, the Syrian Government would be in
a position to show us the various stores that the weapons came from;
they have never attempted to do so, nor claimed that they had lost any
to the rebels.</hs_para>

intervention is to stop weapons of mass destruction being used, I need
to know how it would work. That is where I get worried, because Barack
Obama’s use of the word “punishment” comes from
the idea that you can prevent these weapons from being used if you
impose enough force on the regime to make it think twice. That is a
dubious proposition.</hs_para>

it could work would be if it were combined with a diplomatic
initiative, which might involve reaching out to Iran. A couple of
speakers have made the point that Iran has strong views about weapons
of mass destruction, not least because Saddam Hussein used them against
the Iranians, who saw the sheer horror of them. If Iran could be
persuaded to come on board in putting pressure on the Syrians not to go
on using them, the threat of force might be useful. Once you have used
that force, however, there is no going back. I do not know where that
would lead.</hs_para>

of using force would be to try to pressure Assad to go to the
negotiating table and to persuade Russia to put pressure on Assad to
go. I have made the point to the Leader of the House in previous
exchanges that I do not see that either 
<?notus-xml column=1797?>Russia or Assad has an interest in going into serious negotiations while
they see that they have a chance of winning more on the battlefield.
The general approach is not to negotiate if you are winning. If Assad
can go on using weapons of mass destruction, he will win.</hs_para>

me, “Saudi Arabia is pouring in arms”, and so on, but
there is a difference. Russia’s aid is that of a sophisticated
power with a lot of ability right across the range. That is not true of
the armaments going to the opposition, so I am not at all convinced
that that is equivalent. If you use the threat of military action to
get Assad to negotiate, that might be of benefit. Apart from that, I
cannot see how military intervention would work at this stage. That is
not to say that we should rule it out for all time, but those are
currently the only two points where there might be an advantage and I
cannot see how they might be achieved.</hs_para>

me deeply. Russia is in a strange position on this. President Putin
sounds like someone who is obsessed with the United Sates, almost as
though he feels inferior, has had his nose put out of joint by them and
wants somehow or other to gain his revenge. The United States is no
longer the dominant power that it was for the first 50 years after the
Second World War. Other powers are coming up. That makes this very
dangerous. When you get that sort of instability, you get bigger

Middle East. We are into something that will last for decades. The
Foreign Secretary was right. Unfortunately, a lot of it is between
those who believe either in the Sunni/Shia struggle or, more seriously,
it is about whether you have religion as a central part of government

the region but for the rest of the world.</hs_para>

the use of chemical weapons in Syria. One thing that is quite clear
from this debate is that the Government should take note of what has
emerged in it. What has emerged is something very close to consensus
and, among certain categories of Members of this House, I think,
unanimity. The emerging consensus clearly is that people are absolutely
unconvinced that the case has been made. Unanimity has come from
Members of this House who come from the diplomatic profession and those
who have served in the military. I may have missed one or two speeches,
but I have not heard anybody from either of those two backgrounds state
any support for what, in effect, we are really debating. If the Order

aggressive, even macho tonality that would

just look at the criteria that would be crucial and decisive in making
the case. Clearly, there has to be an element in which it is explained
that our national interest is somehow involved in this outcome. We are,

Armed Forces. That case is not made. We have to be convinced that there

that we are hitting the right targets and that, above all, it would act
as a deterrent. I find interesting the phrase from President Obama:
“a shot across the bows”. It is of course clear that a
shot across the bows is not meant to hit anything. A shot across the
bows is a warning. The second shot is the one that is meant to
register. What would the second shot be? I think that it is clear that
the majority view in this Chamber is that if you send off the first
warning shot, other shots will follow, so one has to think very
carefully about
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13082925000113" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829-0002.htm#13082925000113">I shall be
followed in this debate by the noble Lord, Lord Birt. I spent three
decades of my life as a television journalist and in the television
profession. I have to say that one thing that has fuelled the momentum
of the debate is the ghastly photographs that we saw of the victims of
chemical attack. However, if you are in television journalism, you know
that what matters is not just the pictures that you see but the
pictures that you do not see. For example, in the Iraq war, there were
pictures of appalling damage that was done, which, although our media
received them, were never transmitted because they were thought to be
too repulsive. These pictures were sickening and tragic but they were
transmittable, and because they were transmittable they were in a sense
latched on to as a justification for the military action and they
fuelled the mood. I think that we have now pulled back from that mood
and our approach is much more considered. I finish by urging that part
of that consideration should be about what this country and our allies
could do to alleviate the appalling refugee crisis that is now
enveloping the entire
region.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-08-29?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_08_29_PT_1/0DAAF742D2954C01C1C484C878511459CC6E28C3" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 29 August 2013">Thursday,

Birt:</Member></B> My Lords, throughout history, nations have taken
military action out of self interest, but they have increasingly acted
with the good of others prominent, or at least present, among their
motives. As many have mentioned, we intervened in Sierra Leone to
prevent an elected Government being deposed by gangsterism. We deterred
a possible massacre in Kosovo and we helped to throw out Saddam after
his unlawful invasion 
<?notus-xml column=1799?>of Kuwait. Out of common humanity, I am one who
strongly supports the fundamental notion of using military force to
avert barbarity. I regret, as does President Clinton, that in Rwanda we
failed to stop the worst massacre of modern times, and that we stood by
in
Bosnia<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T21:01:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

consequences of military action cannot easily be predicted. It can be
quick and decisive in pursuit of a clear goal, as in the Falklands, but
it can also spiral out of control, as in our second venture in Iraq.
Military action is not only unpredictable, it is never cost-free. It
will always involve sacrifice and pain. In World War II, the United
States had to transform its economy, mobilise millions and suffer
massive loss of life to save a continent an ocean away from
totalitarianism<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T21:01:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that of the use of chemical weapons in Syria, is heinous and grotesque.
As the noble Lord, Lord Watson, has just mentioned, the sight of those
bodies—men, women, children and babies—in neat serried
ranks enshrouded in their kafans was heartrending. So what, as many
have asked, should our objective now be; what our response? A civil war
of great complexity is raging within Syria with a multiplicity of
groups and their supporters defined by faith, politics and other
national interests—the splits within splits that were
graphically described by the noble Lord, Lord King. I can see no
immediate prospect of any military or diplomatic intervention that
would bring an early end to that tragic conflict, although the noble
Lord, Lord Kerr, among others, credibly delineated a pathway that might
draw in Russia and Iran.</hs_para>

reasonable objective of a finite, limited and clinical military strike
could be, as many have said, to deter the further use of weapons of
mass destruction in Syria and even elsewhere in the world. But for all
the aforementioned reasons, before picking the military option, there
must be a reasonable expectation, as the noble Lord, Lord Hurd,
suggested, that more good than harm will flow from such an action. It
is not clear that it will. The situation in Syria is unusually tangled.
We have a ruthless regime in place with advanced weaponry, which is
fighting for its life with few options open to it. Moreover, Syria is
located in the most troubled and unsettled part of the world—the
“powder keg” described by the noble Lord, Lord
West—riven by rivalry, history and hate. Syria is itself
sponsored and supplied by a nuclear superpower.</hs_para>

united in our sense of outrage and repugnance. We will all want the
whole world to signal that the use of such weapons is unacceptable. We
will all agree that those involved must in due course and when
possible—and it will be possible—be brought to justice
before the international courts. However, like most who have spoken in
this excellent, informed debate, I am not yet persuaded that military
action is the right course in this particular set of
circumstances.</hs_para><hs_time UID="1308301000158" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829-0002.htm#1308301000158">9.05

Cormack:</Member></B> My Lords, I am of the gas mask generation. I
remember the gas mask I had as a little boy in the war. My horror of
chemical warfare was brought home when I read for the first time that
extraordinary poem by Wilfred Owen, which will be 
<?notus-xml column=1800?>familiar to many of your Lordships, “Dulce et
Decorum Est”, which tells in the most graphic language of a gas
attack in the First World War. So I completely understand the revulsion
and horror of the Foreign Secretary, the Prime Minister and others. Of
course, they have seen this and they want to do something about
it.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1308301000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829-0002.htm#1308301000010">However,
let us remember that before the 350 who died last week—terrible
as that incident was—100,000 had been slain in Syria. Was not
each one of those deaths as much a blot upon the escutcheon of those
responsible as the others? As I have listened to this remarkable
debate, and thought of the inexact prescription of Ministers for what
should be done, I could not help but think of “King
Lear”:</hs_para><hs_newline10 UID="1308301000001" url="1308301000001">I

a couple of years’ time we shall be marking the 70th anniversary
of the founding of the United Nations. The United Nations is far too
toothless. We should be using all our best endeavours to bring together
Russia and China. China will increasingly dominate the world as this
century progresses. As has been pointed out by a number of contributors
to this debate, we should also be looking at Iran and opening up
dialogue there. In doing these things, we should of course be seeking
to put pressure on Syria and other rogue regimes and doing it in a way
that can have them tested at the bar of world opinion.</hs_para>

be internationally enforced. The concept of a shield, that there should
be a United Nations force permanently established, would not be
realisable in the immediate future. But there is no reason why we
should not seek to work towards it. I very much hope that we would. Our
own nation is not able to play a full and vibrant part in any military,
naval or air bombardment of Syria—nor should it. Someone quoted
Bismarck and the Pomeranian soldier and it is right.</hs_para>

this country’s endeavours should be on the diplomatic front.
That does not mean that we should never intervene anywhere. As
colleagues who were in the other place with me will know, I was almost
alone on the Tory Benches arguing for intervention in Bosnia. I am glad
I did and I am glad that eventually we did, although sadly it was after
Srebrenica. But that was a very different, European conflict. We do not
have specific interests in Syria, save the interest that the Middle
East should cease to be a powder cauldron. The noble Lord, Lord Reid,
in a remarkable speech, said that we were talking about a regional war.
He likened it to the Thirty Years’ War, and it could last for 30
years. Even the Foreign Secretary talked in terms of
decades.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1308301000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829-0002.htm#1308301000014">In the
past two or three weeks while we have been off, I have been reading a
very remarkable book about July 1914. What comes across is that nobody
in Vienna, London, Petrograd or Berlin wanted a world conflict.
However, because of diplomatic bungling and ineptitude, and an
unwillingness to acknowledge mistakes, the world moved forward
inexorably over a six-week period into a conflict that transformed it
for ever.</hs_para>

Winston:</Member></B> My Lords, I always seem to find myself in tandem
with the noble Lord, Lord Cormack. It is a delight to follow him. The
House is very grateful to the Leader for introducing this important
debate and putting on record what in general we feel in the House of
Lords. It reflects extraordinarily well on the
House.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1308301000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829-0002.htm#1308301000017">I will
make five brief points. The first is on the question of trust. Some 10
years ago I gave a speech on the proposed invasion of Iraq. I remember
saying in that debate, in one of my many very poor speeches in this
House, that while I was against the invasion of Iraq, we had to trust
our leaders, who had information that we did not have. I now feel in
complete disagreement with the noble Lord, Lord Carlile of Berriew, who
argued that we have to trust our leaders. The value of this House is
that we are independent and that we do not entirely trust our leaders.
Part of the reason we are here is to offer an alternative,
non-political view. The value of that has been shown greatly
today.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1308301000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829-0002.htm#1308301000018">Secondly,
it is very important that we see leadership. That was shown
extraordinarily well by two speeches. One was from the noble Lord, Lord
Wright, who started the debate. The other was from the noble Lord, Lord
Hurd. Both noble Lords showed the experience of age. I am afraid that
one issue that can be clearly seen is that in general the leadership of
all parties is pretty inexperienced. This is an issue that we face, and
why the House of Lords in its present state is so
valuable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1308301000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829-0002.htm#1308301000019">I
will also address the issue of certainty. It is very difficult to deal
with uncertainty, but one thing that we must do in a mature world is
just that. What worried me very much about the speech of the noble
Lord, Lord Ashdown, was his certainty that by going for military action
we would do something, while the experience of our military leaders who
spoke in this debate—my noble friend Lord West and the noble
Lord, Lord Dannatt—clearly showed that we will have to live with
uncertainty and balance it in a much better
way.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1308301000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829-0002.htm#1308301000020">The next
issue is that of humanitarian concern. The noble Lord, Lord Forsyth,
said everything that I wanted to say but much more eloquently. He
pointed to the humanitarian issue. If we really want to be of any
account and to be humanitarian, rather than lob shells into Syria, why
should we not open our borders to refugees and help the other countries
that they are going into? That is very unlikely to happen, but it shows
the curious situation that we are
in.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1308301000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829-0002.htm#1308301000021">The last
question is that of psychology. Do we really consider that by lobbing
shells into Syria we will soften Assad’s heart? It is worth
looking to the Book of Genesis and the question of Pharaoh. Again and
again, he is threatened with attack. Finally he suffers the most
targeted strike of all, which is the killing of 
<?notus-xml column=1802?>the first-born, who are particularly targeted as
Egyptians. It does nothing but affect Pharaoh’s pride, which is
what would happen with Assad as well: it would be the same sort of
thing. <I>Haaretz</I> newspaper, which is part of a free press in
Israel that is reporting very fairly on the situation, yesterday argued
very clearly that it is not only Assad who commits atrocities; the
other side are quite capable of doing so as well. It pointed out that
if we start lobbing shells into the situation, we may cause not merely
a mess but a quagmire. That is what it said in its reporting
yesterday.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1308301000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829-0002.htm#1308301000022">It
said one other thing, which I thought was rather pertinent. It argued,
for example, that the issue to some extent is that we have the
perception—it has been said in this debate, somewhat
unfortunately—that somehow Israel is responsible for this
situation in some way. The problem, rather opposing what the noble
Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, said, is that Israel sees itself
surrounded by Syrias. It is surrounded by nations that are not likely
to take democratic action in the way that we would expect. It is
inevitable, therefore, that it hardens its heart and appears to be a
great deal more intransigent. We have to be extremely careful how we
handle the whole issue of the Middle
East<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T21:15:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-08-29?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_08_29_PT_1/3E7615B83BBAF3E5A7BF06D2C93F5C1FEB3B253D" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 29 August 2013">Thursday,

to say is that there has been some criticism of the Opposition for
their attitude to the Government’s original position. I do not

our vital interests. They resent money being spent on these conflicts
while their living standards and services are being squeezed. They also
understand that military interventions increase the risk of retaliation
by extremists on this country and, indeed, others. Why the rush to take
military action even before the United Nations inspectors have
reported? That has been remarked on by many noble Lords this afternoon,
and perhaps the Government should explain in more detail why they are
so anxious to rush to military action. I am completely opposed to
military intervention in the Syrian conflict, especially since it is
being rushed into being without having clear objectives and without
considering the long-term implications of such

not try peace? Why are we not peacemongers rather than warmongers? Why

including al-Qaeda, to dictate 
<?notus-xml column=1803?>the terms of negotiation? Negotiations are the only
way forward if the civil war is to end and a stable Government
established. Any other way will lead to complete and utter disaster. Of
course, like all other noble Lords, I deplore the use of chemical
weapons in any circumstances, but I also deplored the use of Agent
Orange in Vietnam and the use of napalm on innocent civilians. Etched
on my memory<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T21:19:23"></hs_TimeCode> is
the picture of that naked little girl running down the street flaming
from being enveloped in napalm, so I am certainly opposed to weapons of

property, but I am afraid that the British Government sat idly by when
such atrocities were being carried out.</hs_para>

Hunt of Chesterton:</Member></B> My Lords, it is a pleasure to follow
the trenchant remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart. The framework
of this debate about government action has been the 1920s international
convention about chemical warfare and the practice of intervention by
foreign countries for humanitarian purposes, but in the 1920s there
were no satellites or internet. One of the important changes is the
role of communication, to which I shall
return.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1308301000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829-0002.htm#1308301000029">Chemical
warfare was one of the heinous methods deployed by Saddam Hussain.
There was plenty of evidence for it in his attack on the Kurds, but it
was not so clear, as the noble Lord, Lord Reid, reminded us, whether he
was planning to use those weapons in 2003. There was, however, enough
suspicion that the allies intervened. I voted to support the
Government. Scientists were particularly doubtful at that time about
the estimates of the range over which his weapons could endanger other
countries and about how rapidly they could be deployed. No United
Kingdom or United States scientific report was produced before, during
or after that conflict. The Chilcot report may have some evidence of
that sort.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1308301000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829-0002.htm#1308301000030">In
the case of Syria, as the excellent Joint Intelligence Committee report
stated, toxic chemicals were discharged last week with a devastating
impact on thousands of people. The timings and location of some of the
releases have been reported and intelligence has identified which
weapons were used, but we must now have much more open scientific data,
which should be produced by several countries. Unlike in previous
conflicts, this information is now available in near real time. For
example, complex chemicals can now be detected though satellite
measurements in the urban areas where this conflict is taking place,
and the gases that enable these chemicals to be dispersed can also be
computed so that it is possible to make predictions.</hs_para>

make these measurements, it might be possible through the much wider
distribution of information for us to understand what is going on and
particularly for people to see what is going on. As we now know, people

first point is that it would be very important to enable people on both
sides in Syria and in the Middle East to have more information about
what is happening. I believe it will make more likely collaboration
with other countries with which we want to negotiate, which has been a
theme of this afternoon. Ultimately, this may be the most powerful way

other organisations in their humanitarian

final remark. Perhaps the government chief scientist, the chief
scientists at the MoD and other organisations, and people with military

Maginnis of Drumglass:</Member></B> My Lords, in deference to noble
Lords’ patience after more than five hours of debate, I am not
going to repeat what has been said by many who are more experienced
than I. Hence, I want to look not exclusively at Syria but at the
United Kingdom in relation to the current Syrian provocation. I would
suggest that we as a nation have for the past 16 years become
an abject follower rather than an incisive leader of world opinion. How
sad. I do not believe that the United Kingdom can, from this point in
history, take a military initiative that will benefit us or the various
people in the Middle East, including Syrians, who are daily the victims
of sectarian warfare and sectarian
oppression<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T21:26:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the situation in the Middle East on the basis of the United
Kingdom’s Christian-based values—although, I suppose,
this Government have largely abandoned those, too. Of course one
deplores that there are several hundred victims of chemical weapons,
and we have a responsibility to identify and cite before a war crimes
court those who have ordered or executed these outrages. I heard a
debate between the noble Lords, Lord Lea of Crondall and Lord Carlisle,
about the effectiveness of that. Citing leaders before a war crimes
court would, from the moment we did so, cause the perpetrators and
those who follow them to recognise that whatever they may achieve in
the short term they have become internationally irrelevant and
international pariahs until the day they
die<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T21:27:30"></hs_TimeCode>. Why do we
imply that the hundreds who died as a result of the use of chemical
weapons are any more to be

sectarian conflict for many years. That was where religion was used as
an excuse for terrorism. However much we may take so-called appropriate
action in Syria, will it produce other than justification to those who
regard religion as a cause—who are willing to become human
bombs—whether in Iraq, Syria or here on the streets of London? I

danger of deluding ourselves that if we can minimise deaths arising
from our intervention and concentrate on Assad’s armaments
Russia would not resupply? Russia will do so. We must know that the
ineptitude of the United Nations as an arbitrating organisation would
be even further neutralised by any direct provocation that led to a
greater schism between the western powers, Russia and so on.

provocation such as the preordained red lines, or was it lines in the

Obama this morning. He sounded so implausible that I cannot help but
wonder why we British, with hundreds of years of diplomatic experience,
appear almost blasé about tagging ourselves to his coattail. Let
us just pause at this point and examine where we have failed and where
we could have more effectively intervened diplomatically but failed to
do so. I am not going to give the House a long list, but I think of
Zimbabwe, where for years we virtually ignored the plight of the
Matabeles; of Cyprus, where we have long and carelessly abdicated our
guarantor responsibilities; and of Northern Ireland, where we subsidise
ex-terrorist prisoners at seven times the rate that we compensate the
victims of their terror. That is where our Government have failed for
so many years
now.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1308301000152" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829-0002.htm#1308301000152">I conclude

Murphy:</Member></B> My Lords, I have never before spoken about foreign
policy in this House. I have been here nine years, and whenever I felt
the urge to do so, I looked around at the experts in this House and
thought better of it. But when I was listening to the messages coming
from the Government a couple of days ago, I thought I should
come in, stand up and at least be counted and express a view.</hs_para>

Griffiths of Burry Port, said that he was talking for the man on the
Clapham omnibus. Today, I am the woman on the Clapham omnibus. I am not
convinced that any military intervention would be to the benefit of the
people of Syria, the ordinary people who are suffering in Syria, and I
believe that most people in this country feel the same way. I have
listened with enormous care to the debate today, and I found it
enormously heartening because 
<?notus-xml column=1806?>there were so many moving speeches. I want to
mention particularly the noble Lords, Lord Wright of Richmond, Lord Jay
of Ewelme, Lord Hurd, Lord Tebbit—I never thought I would say
that—and so many others.</hs_para>

pick up on something the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, said about the mood
music—he used another phrase. It has been getting worse in the
past two or three years. Every time Syria has been mentioned by the
Government there has been a sort of worsening approach to talking about
it, which has made me feel deeply uneasy. I do not know what the
outcome of the Syrian civil war will be, but I do know that at this
point a blow against that regime is going to be a blow for the
opposition. The House of Lords notes give me a list of 15 organisations
in that opposition, and half of them I would not want to support. It
therefore seems to me that the international community has got to think
very carefully about what it does. We say that we cannot allow people
to use chemical weapons with impunity and that it is illegal to use
them, but in fact we have let other regimes use other weapons with
impunity without too much difficulty.</hs_para>

people use about what the meaning of the strike would
be—“retaliation”, “showing them they
can’t get away with it”, “punishment” and
“vengeance”—form no moral basis for escalating the
conflict. It is fanciful to think that the regime will not continue to
attack rebel civilians through other means. It would contribute to less
safety and less security in that region. We know very well that we
cannot change this regime; only the Syrians can do that for themselves.
Civil wars have to be sorted out by the community in which they occur.
The regime cannot be changed by us—we have demonstrated very
clearly that we do not know how to do it in this very difficult region,
and we should not be trying to do so in any way, or making any move to
support action in that direction. Therefore, I say no to any form of
military intervention. Sometimes not to take a legal, offensive way to
express our views is the moral thing to do. Sometimes it is more
difficult to sit on our hands and say, “No, we must not
act”, but that is what we should

Sadly, I am not going to do that. However, I will try to emphasise some
of the questions that have been posed to the Government by other

why did the Foreign Secretary immediately attribute the chemical weapon
attack on civilians in Damascus to President Assad when no evidence had
been presented? Are we to assume that as with the previous Government,
conclusions have been drawn and acted upon without the evidence first
being gathered and made public? I hope not. Is the intelligence source
for recent events in Syria the same source that was used for the
allegation that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction? What is the
significance of the large 
<?notus-xml column=1807?>delegation of Israeli security officials in Washington this week, having
talks all week with US National Security adviser Susan Rice? I merely
pose the question.</hs_para>

guarantee can the Government give—many noble Lords have made
this point—that they will not make the situation in Syria far
worse, without dealing with the stocks of chemical weapons held there?
What extra assistance will the Government give to countries surrounding
Syria which have already received more than 1.9 million refugees? If we
have money to burn, literally, why are we not helping those refugees
and spending money within Syria, if we can get it in there, on all
those displaced Syrians who have been driven from their

in the Government of Israel, some of them in the present Government,
make Mr Netanyahu look like a pussycat. There are some quite difficult
characters there. Is it true that Israel has missile systems supplied
by the USA which could deliver nuclear weapons? The noble Lord, Lord

it. We are scarcely a disinterested party in Syria. We have stripped
recognition from the Assad Government—or regime, as my noble

the rebels. No matter what we said, we would be seen as taking sides

Hussein regime when he was mounting appalling chemical attacks on Iran.
I wonder whether, if we at least acknowledged that fact, it might open
some of those closed doors in Tehran. While we are talking about Iran,

in Syria deserves the most extreme condemnation from all nations. I am
saddened by the willingness of certain groups in this country, the
United 
<?notus-xml column=1809?>States and Europe to advocate military action to
punish whoever in their view is responsible for recent transgressions.
To witness evil and not to fight is not credible, yet to set oneself up
as judge, jury and executioner over another sovereign territory is to
assume an arrogance that itself cannot be condoned. The notion that
those who have the military power should intervene in others’
disputes at their own discretion could have potentially dangerous
consequences, especially in regions such as south Asia. The defence of
human rights, if it is sincere, is commendable, but it must be
authorised by proper international procedures and sustained by wide
international support if it is to be
credible.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1308301000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829-0002.htm#1308301000056">In
this instance, even those who do not have an in-depth knowledge of the
Syrian conflict are aware that layer upon layer of sectarianism, ethnic
conflicts, tribal wars and other hatreds have been unleashed. Jumping
into this turmoil seems at the very least to be lacking in wisdom and
failing to recall the recent lessons of both Iraq and Afghanistan. Our
international reputation is not enhanced by appearing to be
trigger-happy. So many other western interventions in non-western areas
since the Second World War have been disasters, such as in Vietnam,
Algeria, Suez, Lebanon, Libya and Egypt, to name but a few. In these

of experience and introduced by my noble friend the Leader of the

West of Spithead; diplomatic experience from the noble Lord, Lord
Wright of Richmond; and political sense from my noble friend the
Marquis of Lothian. It is clear that we have cause to be thankful that
Parliament was not invited today to approve direct military action
against Syria, which, we are told, could have happened as early as this
Sunday—in three days’ time. I am sorry to have to say
this, but to me it is amazing and disquieting that until 36 hours ago
the Foreign Secretary was speaking in just those terms—immediate
action—and that the Prime Minister, 
<?notus-xml column=1810?>apparently supported by the Deputy Prime Minister, was planning to move
such a Motion today. How could this be, to vote on the issue before the
United Nations weapons inspectors have even reported? We are, it seems,
indebted to the leader of the Opposition that such a vote has been
deferred until next week. To have voted now to unleash the missiles
would have been a ghastly mistake with incalculable consequences, as a

case might be made for military action against Syria in the absence of
a Security Council resolution, but is military action in the form of
missile strikes what we really want? Surely now is the time for fresh
diplomatic initiatives. If the Security Council is blocked by a veto
from doing or discussing anything, what about the General Assembly of
the United Nations? A number of noble Lords have referred to Resolution
377 in 1950 for Korea and the Uniting for Peace resolution, an approach
that might be used more constructively than generating cruise missile
strikes. There has to be a better way to make effective the

Shipley:</Member></B> My Lords, history is littered with examples of
military interventions that did not work out as planned. We know from
experience that things can end up worse than before. Experience also
tells us that, if you have no strategy for what happens next, you
should avoid intervening. The desire to respond to the atrocities in
Syria is entirely understandable, but that response should be based on
firm evidence, with international backing for action and with an
outcome that can be predicted with a reasonable degree of certainty.
The outcome of any intervention must be better, not worse, for the
people of Syria. It has to save lives and shorten the civil war, not
create a wider conflict in the Middle East. It is difficult to see how
a military intervention will achieve any of these objectives.</hs_para>

understand. I hope that my noble friend the Minister will explain the
timing when he replies. The UN inspection team needs a few days to
complete its work and the Security Council needs the opportunity to
consider its findings. What is the point of our involvement with the UN

weapons stockpiles? It seems not. Is it to deliver regime change? It
seems not. Is it to shorten the civil war? That might be the aim, but
the danger is that it will lengthen it and extend its area. Is it
simply a humanitarian intervention? If so, how will it prevent a

the UN Security Council has rightly been questioned in many quarters.
The brutal and unjust war in Iraq must be echoing through the minds of
many in our country and elsewhere in the world. It seems that we have
failed to learn the lessons of our aggressive misadventures in Iraq and
Afghanistan. We all witnessed the result of shock and awe. It meant
that innocent men, women and children died. They were blown to
smithereens by our own lethal weapons. The pictures of this were
blanked out on our screens. We have surely caused evil to rise from
every corner of the latent globe. The entire region is ablaze. This

three obvious bases for any military action: a UN mandate, self defence

that all peaceful means have failed. In this case, a UN mandate may be

strong argument that Britain is directly at threat from Syria’s

the Government: where is that evidence? Where has it come from? What is
the source? The UN Secretary-General said yesterday that we need to
give diplomacy a chance and allow the inspectorate to produce its
report. There seems to be an overwhelming consensus, at least in this
House, to wait for that report. Can the Minister assure the House that
the UK Government will await the UN report before any action is taken?
The drive behind our proposed plans for a strike is focused on the
responsibility to protect. That is hugely controversial, as has been
said by the noble Lords, Lord Wright, Lord Jay and Lord West, among
many other distinguished speakers. The arguments so far presented are
flawed in their very inception. We need to allow the UN inspectors to

possibility that such a strike could result in the unleashing of
retaliation and counter-retaliation from a range of actors in the

for further intervention to prevent humanitarian catastrophes, the
noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, and others have said that we are already

But that is not in itself a reason to blunt or dim our revulsion. No
tyranny should be able to act with impunity. The Attorney-General is
certainly right to say that he has no doubt that this is a war
crime—a crime against humanity. Of course, such crimes against

gas, but it is a war
crime.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1308301000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829-0003.htm#1308301000086">The

For a start, we must proceed with absolute clarity on the facts. Our
judgments must be based on the facts. There should be no moves in the
dark or with inconclusive information. Many noble Lords rightly start
with the fundamental understanding that action has its consequences.
Only a liar or a fool will say that they know exactly what those
consequences will be. Inaction has consequences that are as profound.
Whatever we decide, we should be in no doubt that this dictator and
others will conclude that they can use any weapon, however venal, if it
carries no consequence for them. If, as in Syria, a tyrannical ruler
with a tyrannical army is overstretched militarily, these weapons might
become a cheap and deadly alternative to using other kinds of

those criteria should be. It is also clear, and I want to be clear,

reached—judgments on regional balances, consequences for
minorities and so on. A wide variety of matters of all kinds must be
considered. Evidence will tell us how safe our footing is, but then
comes the political judgment of what will make the lot of the Syrian

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, I start by thanking the
noble Lord, Lord Triesman, for that extremely constructive speech, and
by saying that this is very much an area in which the Government are
looking for the widest possible consensus across the parties. I have
spent much of the past two days working within the coalition on making
sure that we have an agreed position. Perhaps I can say that one of the
many areas in which this is not another Iraq is that we have been going
through a very carefully constructed series of discussions and
consultations within the Government. As the Opposition Front Bench will
also know, there have been a series of discussions with the 
<?notus-xml column=1817?>Opposition to try to make sure that everyone is as closely as involved
as possible and that the information is exchanged as broadly as
possible. Therefore, in all sorts of ways this is not Iraq

has been a take note debate, so of course the first thing I should say
is that we will take note of the very many concerned and cautious
speeches that we have heard in the course of the past few hours. The
mood has been very sober and very concerned, although some noble Lords
have perhaps not followed the newspapers as well as they might have. As
I will come on to say later, the suggestion that we ought to try the
diplomatic track appears to ignore the enormous efforts the Government
have been putting in in recent months. As we have heard
tonight<hs_TimeCode time="2013-08-29T22:18:34"></hs_TimeCode>, the
shadow of Iraq falls over all our discussions.</hs_para>

obvious thing. One or two noble Lords have talked about a unilateral
operation. This would in no sense be a unilateral operation. Indeed, a
number of other Governments have asked if they might be included in the
operation, and the levels of support are large for some response to
this clear breach of international law. The Arab League has condemned
it and a number of other Governments have condemned it; the Turks have
been very clear and the European Union has been very clear—this
is not the sort of position in which we found ourselves in March 2003.
We have a much broader coalition and much clearer evidence. Much of
that evidence is open evidence. A lot more is in widespread diplomatic
telegrams of not particularly high classification. The regime is
thought to have used chemical weapons in much smaller quantities on
somewhere between 10 and 14 previous occasions. On some of these, there
appears to be sufficient evidence to report them to the United
Nations.</hs_para>

about this intervention was that it was on a much larger scale. As my
noble friend the Leader of the House said in his opening speech, there
were attacks on 11 different locations in the Damascus area. That is
very hard to cover up. It also suggests that it is unlikely to have
been an operation conducted by a junior officer on his own. It was
clearly conducted by a large series of simultaneous operations,
suggesting a senior command structure, and it was conducted in
Damascus, close to the central command structure of the regime. Of
course, it is possible that we may discover that President Assad was
not previously informed, but this is not a rogue incident that happened
in Aleppo, Homs or somewhere else; it happened in 11
different locations in Damascus. That suggests that we have much
stronger evidence, not a dodgy dossier of the sort that one or two
noble Lords have suggested that this might again
be.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="1308301000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829-0003.htm#1308301000097">The noble
Baroness, Lady Royall, asked what chemical was used. All the evidence
we have suggests that it was diluted sarin, which is one of the many
chemicals banned by the chemical weapons convention, but as she will
know, the chemical weapons convention bans the use of all poisonous
chemical agents in warfare or conflict of this sort.</hs_para>

evidence, and more compelling evidence will be presented as the UN
inspectors provide what will be a preliminary report. I again
remind  
<?notus-xml column=1818?>the House that the inspectors have not been asked to attribute
responsibility; they were asked simply to confirm that chemical weapons
have been used. The scale of this chemical weapons attack suggests
something that is way beyond the capacity of the opposition to have
conducted. The projectiles used were those that no one has any evidence
that the opposition has access to, and the attacks were made on
opposition-controlled areas. Therefore, the very strong probability is
that this was an Assad-regime attack and that it was ordered by people
relatively high up within the current
regime.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1308301000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829-0003.htm#1308301000099">On the
legality, we have heard a number of very expert speeches, in particular
that of the former Attorney-General, the noble and learned Lord, Lord
Goldsmith, who rightly said that we have to include a large number of

resort. That picks up what the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of

one has to use force, but one should be extremely cautious about how

spoken is that if we do nothing the regime is likely to assume that it
can use chemical weapons again, and in larger quantities if

do not attempt to go for regime change. Perhaps I may go on to my next
point. We are of course all concerned to learn the lessons of Iraq.
Disastrously, our American allies dismantled the entire structure of
the state and the armed forces when they went into Iraq. The reason why
we are all attempting to achieve transition in Syria is that we
maintain as much as we can of the current state and social structure.
We are all aware that to allow the Assad regime to collapse altogether
would be to risk chaos following. That is why we have been pursuing,
through Geneva I and, we hope, the Geneva II conference, proposals for
some form of agreed transition in which—with, we hope, the help
of Russia and others—some members of the regime would be removed
but which some of the officials within the current regime would help to
manage. We are not, therefore, attempting to promote that sort of
disastrous regime

strike on Syria it will be limited and very deliberately targeted, and
not intended to cause any significant number of casualties. We are
attempting to deter further chemical attacks. We are also attempting to
defend the principle of international law. Let me say to those who say
that it does not matter how you are killed, by whatever weapons, there
are differences. The international community and international law have
outlawed weapons of mass destruction. Chemical weapons have been
illegal internationally since 1925. That is a red line and if we do not
support the principle that using chemical weapons either against your
own people or against members of another state is different, we are
simply allowing that major principle of international law to decay.
That is the principle with which we are engaged. At the same time, we
and others, including the Arab League, the World Muslim Council, the
European Union, and many others are working to try to resolve the
situation and the conflict in

this had happened before. According to the report, it has happened
exactly 14 times. The Minister then said that we do not know whether it
was a senior or junior officer, and then that it could be, should be,
possibly was or must have been a senior officer. The preliminary report
talked of a strong possibility. Then came the phrase, “as far as
we know”. We have heard from many noble Lords who spoke in the
debate on Iraq 10 years ago, when there was a two to one majority
against going into Iraq. The Government at the time did not listen. Now
the majority is nine or more to one. Why did the Government want to

breach of international law has taken place, there is a very delicate
calculation about how rapidly you respond or how long you should wait
until the evidence is entirely clear. If you wait too long, it becomes
impossible to respond. Of course you do not rush in immediately, but
you should, as we have done, at least indicate rapidly that you intend

spot. However, to follow up the question from my noble friend Lord
Robertson, I realise that the government Motion has only very recently
been defeated but I would hope that the Government already had a plan B
in mind when they took the substantive Motion to the Commons this
afternoon. It is clear that at some point in the very near future the
Government will have to come back to the House of Commons to explain
what action if any they will now advise to the House of Commons. I
therefore ask the Minister and the Leader of the House this: in the
vacuum that seems to exist at the moment and the great concern that has
been expressed this afternoon, I would hope that when the Prime
Minister comes back to the House of Commons to report on his future
action, this House also will be recalled so that we, too, can debate
the future action.</hs_para>

military plans of the Government, but if I were I would not be able to
tell him on the Floor of the House. What I can tell him is that
inaction also has consequences. We are talking in particular to the
Russian Government, who appear to be concerned as the scale of this
chemical weapons attack becomes clearer. We hope that the diplomatic
track may become easier as the seriousness of what happened in Damascus
on 21 August becomes clearer to a range of other Governments. In all of
these the use of force itself is—and I end on this—a last
resort. Our preference is always for the diplomatic track. However, we
have to bear in mind that international law and international

consequence of that may well be, therefore, that the United States may
take action quite soon. Indeed, there were suggestions that that might
happen this weekend. For that reason, and because the House has been

was not due to sit next week—it would be enormously helpful to
know what might happen next and what involvement this House might have

these organisations have now begun to resume operations. The United

continued detention in the case of a criminal who is already separated
from his family by virtue of the custodial sentence passed by the
courts, will affect a pre-existing family unit it is our practice to
ensure that safeguarding child welfare issues are taken into account,
and weighed against the need to detain and implement deportation or
removal. In such cases close attention is given to Article 8 of the
European Convention on Human Rights, and Article 3 of the
United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The aims of both
these are supported by paragraphs 396 to 400 of the Immigration Rules.
These changes were introduced on 9 July 2012 so as to deliver in
individual cases where a parent is liable to deportation outcomes that
are compatible with the two conventions mentioned and with Section 55
of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009. In all such cases
we are open to discovering the views of the children concerned. This is
done principally through the parents and others who are in close
contact with the children and are trusted by
them.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question"><hs_DebateHeading UID="1308131000970" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829w0002.htm#1308131000970">Internet:

Popat:</Member> Zimbabwe's elections took place on 31 July.
While the Government are pleased the election day itself passed off
peacefully, we have serious concerns over the conduct of the election.
As the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, my
right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond (Yorks) (Mr Hague) has noted
in his Statement on 3 August, we are gravely concerned by significant
irregularities outlined by African Union and Southern African
Development Community observation missions, and those of the domestic
observer groups, in their initial statements. These irregularities call
into question the credibility of the election. It is vital that all
allegations of electoral violations are investigated thoroughly. We
will continue to monitor the situation in Zimbabwe and consider further
reports from regional and local observer missions. In the mean time,
the Government will continue to support the Zimbabwean people in their
aspirations for a democratic, peaceful and prosperous
future.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-08-29?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_08_29_PT_1/82A580B29671DC6AF9FB47DF4B94AC2FA82BA2A8" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>1</House><System>1</System><Sitting short-date=" 29 August 2013">Monday,

Iceland was not obliged to ensure payment of compensation to depositors

Icelandic government. Therefore the loan has been transferred from DIGF

April 2013, and will rise to £10,000 in April 2014, to support
hard-working individuals. This is the largest cash increase ever. The

2013. These are available at
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rough-sleeping-in-england-autumn-2012.
Figures for the rest of the United Kingdom are a matter for each
devolved administration, although web-links to relevant information for
Scotland and Wales are given on page 9 of the statistical release
available at the web-link
above.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1308195000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829w0003.htm#1308195000096">Comprehensive
data on rough sleepers, including support needs, is held under the
Greater London Authority’s CHAIN (Combined Homeless and

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member> The net migration statistics are compiled
by the Office for National Statistics based largely on the
International Passenger Survey (IPS) and are not based on the type of
visa held (where applicable) by an individual. ONS use the UN
recommended definition of a long-term international migrant. That is
someone who changes his or her country of usual residence for a period
of at least a year, so that the country of destination effectively
becomes the country of usual residence. This is the definition used to
calculate net migration, and is also used for the UK usually resident
population estimate series. Further information about the ONS data is

National Planning Policy Framework sets out the Government’s
planning policies for England, including when it would be appropriate
for local planning authorities to consider whether otherwise
unacceptable development could be made acceptable through the use of
planning conditions or obligations. There are no general planning
requirements on developers to provide compensation to local residents
and planning obligations should only be sought where they are necessary
to make the development acceptable in planning terms. The existing
statutory compensation schemes in England are limited to compensating
people for the depreciation in value of their land due to the adverse
effect of the construction and use of “public works”.
This is restricted to the effect of certain physical factors including
noise, vibration and smell but not loss of a view. “Public
works” are defined as “any highway, any aerodrome and any
works on land provided or used in the exercise of statutory powers and
which have statutory immunity from actions for nuisance”.

from 2008 to 2012. With the end of the pilot, the Department for
Education no longer directly monitors arrangements in the participating
local authorities. We believe, however, that six local authorities
retain some or all of the elements tested under piloting arrangements:
Barnet, Blackburn with Darwen, Bristol, Kent, Norfolk and
Staffordshire.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1308296000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130829w0003.htm#1308296000023">The
start and end date of each pilot is contained in the table below. The
table also contains indicative figures for the number of children each
pilot intended to include within scope of the social work practice.
Numbers will, of course, have changed over the course of the pilot

Responsibility for the control of ragwort rests with
the landowner or occupier in the first instance. A complainant
concerned about the spread of ragwort, or any of the other injurious
weeds specified in the Weeds Act, should contact the owner or occupier
of the land in question to address the

reasonable efforts are not made by those responsible, the complainant
should contact Natural England which has been delegated responsibility
for investigating complaints about ragwort and other injurious weeds
and, where necessary, for taking the appropriate enforcement action.
However, neither Natural England nor Defra have the resources to
investigate all weeds complaints. In determining what follow up action
is to be taken, priority is given to complaints involving possible

order to assist public bodies (along with other landowners and

the Weeds Act with the Ragwort Control Act 2003. This provided for a
Code of Practice on preventing Ragwort spread. My colleague, Richard
Benyon, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary
