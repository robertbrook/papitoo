The Busan agreement includes the commitment to strengthen the role of
Parliaments in the oversight of the development process by monitoring
to ensure that aid is on budget lines that are subject to
parliamentary scrutiny. What measures are the Government taking to
ensure that the Busan parliamentary scrutiny includes democratic
accountability, challenging the view of some that there is no
relationship between democracy and development? What plans do the
Government have to compensate for the drain on parliamentary capacity
in developing countries caused by the high percentage of parliamentary
staff trained under aid programmes leaving for more attractive posts

Northover:</Member></B> As my noble friend will know, parliamentarians
are represented in the global partnership steering committee meetings,
and DfID certainly believes that democratic government helps to promote
sustainable development in the way which he has indicated. That is why
we are supporting democratic elections through various programmes and
other work, which we will be supporting in 13 countries by 2015. As for
his point about the drain in staff, between 2011 and 2012 DfID invested
£181 million in public sector reform, which includes improvement
of staff performance and retention. We very much understand my noble

if development is to be sustained, it is necessary to have stability
and security? Can the Minister give us an assurance that, whatever
happens, we will

and if she looks—as I am sure she has—at the recent DfID
annual report, she will see that evidence there. It is extremely
important that both aid givers, such as the United Kingdom, and aid
recipients make sure that they address the requirements laid down in
Busan. Only by doing so will we ensure that aid is most effectively

1.3%; this compares with the CPI of 2.7%. We are also encouraging the
supply of new homes with a £1 billion build-to-rent fund which
will help to keep rent levels

Is he not aware that we are facing a bit of a housing crisis at the
moment, particularly in London? Younger people cannot afford the
deposit to buy a place and cannot afford the rents because they are far
too high. Is the Minister aware that following the last war there was
also a housing crisis and that the Government then dealt with
it by building lots of small houses—the famous
prefabs—and also introduced a system of rent controls through
the rent tribunals so that people were not pushed into poverty by

I am aware, that is a matter for NHS England. However, if I can
enlighten the noble Lord, I will be happy to write to him. I can say
that the programme for bringing trusts to foundation trust status has
to be taken slightly more slowly than we thought was appropriate
perhaps a couple of years ago. That is because of the Francis report. I
make no apology for that, because it is right for trusts to
take a longer and harder look at the issues that

Finlay of Llandaff:</Member></B> I declare my interest as
president-elect of the BMA. As 200,000 11 to 15 year- olds start
smoking each year in the UK, what are the criteria and time frames that
the Government will use to judge the outcomes of standardised packaging
in Australia? The high mortality rate does not appear until about 25
years after these youngsters start smoking. As this is fundamentally a
child protection issue, how will the Government now prevent vulnerable
children—particularly those in local authority care—from
starting smoking, given that the Department of Health’s own
systematic review showed that current packs are particularly attractive
to youngsters and that they mislead them into thinking that some brands
are less harmful than
others<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T15:02:11"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071684000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0001.htm#13071684000049"><B><Member ContinuationText="Earl Howe" PimsId="1035" UID="13071684000377" xid="1749" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0001.htm#13071684000377">Earl
Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, we want to keep a close eye on what is
happening around the world before making a decision. We are keeping
standardised packaging under active consideration. It has been newly
introduced in Australia, and other countries are intending to follow
suit, so it is sensible for us to see what we can learn from other
countries’ experience. The impacts 
<?notus-xml column=641?>could be several. They could include, for
example, health benefits, as well as impacts on businesses
such as retailers and tobacco manufacturers, and could possibly bring
about a change in attitude to smoking.</hs_para>

the risk to children, the noble Baroness is of course absolutely right.
Evidence suggests that action needs to be taken to reshape social norms
around smoking so that tobacco becomes less desirable, less acceptable
and less accessible, particularly to the young. That is why we are
committed to ending tobacco displays in shops. We have a TV-led
marketing campaign to encourage smokers not to smoke at home or in cars
and we have banned the sale of tobacco in vending machines, which has
removed a source of cigarettes that underage smokers could access as
often as they liked. There is a range of work going

those in many comparable western societies, but our reductions in
prevalence still lag behind those in countries such as Canada and the
United States, and in some Australian states. Overall prevalence is
gradually coming down, but we still need to worry about smoking take-up
by the young. There is no doubt that smoking is a significant cause of

Friday evening, following the annual 12 July parades, around 5,000
people gathered to protest against the Parades Commission determination
not to allow three Orange Lodges to return home past the nationalist
Ardoyne area. This has been the scene of serious disorder in recent
years, including shots fired at police by dissident republicans.
Violence erupted as the crowd reached the police line on Woodvale Road
preventing access to the route past the Ardoyne shop fronts. This has
been followed by further disturbances and rioting on each night since
then, mainly in the Woodvale Parade/Twaddell Avenue area,
but also in the Newtownards Road in east Belfast, Mount Vernon in north
Belfast, Rathcoole in Newtownabbey, Portadown and Ballyclare.</hs_para>

disturbances, the police have come under attack from a variety of
weapons including fireworks, petrol bombs, bottles, stones, bits of
masonry, iron bars and ceremonial swords. Last night, four blast bombs
were thrown at police officers in east Belfast and a pipe bomb from
Brompton Park in the Ardoyne. Water cannon and AEP plastic bullet

71 police officers have been
injured.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071684000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0001.htm#13071684000067">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T15:12:26"></hs_TimeCode>

people feel, there can be no justification, or excuse, for the
behaviour we have seen in recent days. Attacks on the police are wholly
unacceptable and I condemn them without hesitation or reservation. It

has been talk of attacks on British identity and culture in Northern
Ireland. Well, the sort of behaviour that has been taking place in
north Belfast does nothing to promote Britishness or the pro-Union
cause; rather, it undermines it in the eyes of the overwhelming
majority of people in Northern Ireland and the rest of the United
Kingdom. In fact, it is hard to think of anything less British and less
patriotic than wrapping yourself in a union flag and going out to
attack the people who are there to maintain the rule of law and protect
the whole community.</hs_para>

now it is the responsibility of everyone with influence, including the
Orange Order, community leaders and politicians, to do what we can to
defuse tensions and calm the situation. We need temperate language over

would like to pay tribute to the outstanding work of the Police
Service of Northern Ireland over recent days. Its officers have
demonstrated fortitude, determination and courage in defending the rule
of law. They have put its own safety on the line in the face 
<?notus-xml column=645?>of violent attacks and deserve our utmost praise, support and thanks, as
do the police officers from Great Britain who provided mutual aid
support. I would like to commend the leadership of chief constable Matt
Baggott and Justice Minister David Ford. I know that meticulous
planning took place to ensure that everything possible was done to try
to keep people safe over the weekend of 12 July, including bringing
approximately 1,000 mutual aid officers from Great
Britain.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071684000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0001.htm#13071684000071">Of
the 4,000 or so parades that take place annually in Northern Ireland,
the vast majority pass off without major problems, including hundreds
on 12 July. But any rioting is unacceptable, not least because it
undermines efforts to secure economic recovery for Northern Ireland and
because it makes competing in the global race for jobs and investment
that much more difficult. The way forward has to be through dialogue to
find sustainable local solutions to contentious parades, as has been
the case in, for example,
Derry/Londonderry.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071684000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0001.htm#13071684000072">I
welcomed the talks that took place between members of the Orange Order
and Ardoyne residents before the Parades Commission determination. I
know how difficult this will be after what has happened, but I believe
that it is vital that local dialogue continues. I also welcome
inclusion of parading in the remit of the Executive’s all-party
working group and the appointment of the distinguished US former envoy
to Northern Ireland, Richard Haass, to chair it. The Government have
always made it clear that we are open to a devolved solution on
parading if one can be found but, in the mean time, we will not
tolerate lawlessness on the streets of Belfast any more than we would
in any other UK
city.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071684000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0001.htm#13071684000073">Last
week in this Chamber, issues were raised regarding my powers in
relation to Parades Commission determinations. They are set out in the
Public Processions (Northern Ireland) Act 1998. Section 9 states that
the Secretary of State can only review a determination made by the
Parades Commission following a request by the chief constable. The
reason why he has not made such a request is because at all times he
has been confident that the officers under his command can police the
situation, and I fully share that
confidence.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071684000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0001.htm#13071684000074">So
to those on the streets over recent days taking part in this violence I
say this. So far, 60 arrests have been made and emergency courts were
sitting on Sunday to accelerate the criminal justice process. But that
is just the start. No stone will be left unturned in building the case
needed for more arrests and more criminal convictions. Those who engage
in so-called recreational rioting and attacks on police officers can
expect to face the full force of the law. I am confident that for some
that will mean that the next 12 July holiday will be spent not in the
sunshine following the parades, but locked up in prison living with the
consequences of the crimes that they have
committed”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071684000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0001.htm#13071684000075">My

know that policing these large-scale public order incidents is costly.
Does the Secretary of State have an estimate of how much the policing
operations have cost to date? Who will meet this cost? Will it be her
department, the Department of Justice or a combination of the two?
There is always a concern about the involvement of paramilitaries in or
on the margins of contentious parades and protests. Has she looked at
who is involved and who is being arrested? Is there any indication that
loyalist paramilitaries or dissident republicans have organised, or
taken part in, the

origins of the appalling scenes we have witnessed lie in the dispute
around parading. We have been here before. Does the Secretary of State
agree with me that meaningful dialogue and working towards local
agreement is the key to finding a solution? It has worked well in other
places. The Orange Order held a peaceful, enjoyable and colourful
celebration on the 12th in the UK City of Culture, Derry-Londonderry.
It was a huge success, attended by thousands of people, and was able to
happen because of years of dialogue and communication between
neighbours in an atmosphere of respect and good will. Will the
Secretary of State update the House on what discussions she has had
with the First and Deputy First Ministers, the Orange Order,
residents’ associations and local political and civic
representatives over the weekend? Does she agree that she has an
important role to play in having further discussions over the coming
days and weeks in north and east Belfast? As well as condemning the

view is that the British and Irish Governments still have a hugely
significant role to play in helping to resolve all these issues. They

<?notus-xml column=647?>the Northern Ireland Office is working with the OFMDFM on this? It is
crucial to bring people together to look at what needs to happen now to
prevent a repeat of what happened over the weekend, when a disagreement
that was not addressed led to significant tensions between communities
and ended in unacceptable violence. That is the main message I wish to
send out today. I encourage all those working to find a solution to
these matters to keep going and not give up, and to keep talking. I say
to those involved in parading and protesting—unionist and
nationalist—that respecting the law, your neighbour and the
wishes of people right across a community to live in peace is the only

relation to his comments about a civic forum, the situation in Northern
Ireland is such that this process is worth reconsidering. In view of
the recent <I>A </I><I>Shared Future</I> document, issued by the
Executive, and the recent Cardiff conference, which addressed issues of
concern from the past and dealt with facing the decade of anniversaries
and centenaries to which the noble Lord referred, this is an
interesting concept which I am sure will be raised again and again. It
would obviously help to engage a wider spectrum of the community in
dealing with these problems. I have used his name already, but Richard
Haass has, of course, the issue of the anniversaries that are coming up
within his remit of reviewing of the past and how it should be dealt

Kilclooney:</Member></B> My Lords, the riots must of course be
condemned without any reservation whatever. However, it is important to
analyse their cause, is it not? Unless we understand the cause, we will
never get the solution. Can the noble Baroness confirm that many
Members of our House approached her last week to warn her that there
could well be violence as a result of the determination made by the
Northern Ireland Parades Commission? The violence was predictable and
predicted. Can she confirm that the chief constable concluded that he
could not police the decision of the Parades Commission: that the PSNI
would be incapable of doing so? As a result, 16% of police officers on
the streets of Northern Ireland are now from England, Wales and
Scotland. That is the kind of situation that the Parades Commission has
led us into in Northern Ireland. Would it not be better if we had a
Parades Commission that had widespread consent in Northern Ireland and
attracted support? At the moment, it does not. Would it not be better
to have an independent chairman of the commission who is not tainted by
party politics, has not been involved in an elected position against
unionism but is totally impartial and
independent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T15:31:18"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

Randerson:</Member></B> The noble Lord referred to an informal meeting
held last week. It is indeed the case that the Parades
Commission’s determination was discussed at that meeting and a
number of views were put. I have to say to the noble Lord that the
chief 
<?notus-xml column=649?>constable was confident that he could police the
parades but felt that it was important to have additional support under
the mutual aid scheme. It is indeed the purpose of that scheme that
events such as this should be dealt with in that way. The noble Lord
referred to the status of the Parades Commission. It is of course a
lawfully constituted authority that is independent of government. Its
determinations must be obeyed. It is not a devolved authority and was
set up by an Act of Parliament. It is essential that its determinations
are duly obeyed on all sides in Northern Ireland. It is important to
note also that the decisions of the PSNI, the chief constable and the
Parades Commission, and the way in which they acted, were based on the
experience of previous years and the problems that had previously been
experienced at this time of
year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T15:33:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071684000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0001.htm#13071684000093"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Dubs" PimsId="3031" UID="13071684000399" xid="1109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0001.htm#13071684000399">Lord
Dubs:</Member></B> My Lords, many of us will feel utterly dismayed,
saddened and angry at the events in Belfast when, yet again, the PSNI
bravely had to bear the burden of this violence unleashed at it. Does
the Minister agree that one of the tragedies is that there seems to be
very little political leadership for the loyalist community?
There was such leadership at the time of the Good Friday agreement, and
it gave the loyalist community a sense that they had a stake in what
was happening. I ask the Minister and her colleague the Secretary of
State to engage in discussions with the First Minister, the Deputy
First Minister and David Ford to examine what the problems are in parts
of Belfast where members of the loyalist community seem to have the
sense that there is nothing for them in the peace process. They are
then too easily persuaded that the only way out is violence against the
police. Real problems need to be addressed in the loyalist community in
terms of lack of jobs and hope for the future. Will the Minister and
the Secretary of State take an initiative with the people in Northern
Ireland to deal with that?</hs_para>

points, and there is the issue of there having been a process of change
in loyalist
politics<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T15:34:39"></hs_TimeCode> and its
leadership—but that is now devolved in large part, and the
leadership in the Assembly has to develop from within and cannot be
dictated from outside. I agree with the noble Lord about the
significance of poverty among many in the loyalist
communities in Belfast. It is therefore all the more important
that Northern Ireland make the most of the economic package which was
agreed recently between my right honourable friend the Secretary of
State and the Executive, the First Minister and the Deputy First
Minister. That economic package had a specific purpose of
reinvigorating the economy in the poorest parts of

point—that is, to refer us to the past and indirectly to point
out the terrible situation that existed prior to the existence of the
Parades Commission. It is important to bear in mind that there are many
hundreds—thousands—of parades at this time of year in
Northern Ireland. The city of Derry/Londonderry, for example, has done
a superb job in making sure that its parades are successful and
enjoyable and that they do not cause trouble. I had an extremely
interesting meeting with the mayor of Derry/Londonderry, in which he
pointed out the very simple and straightforward ways in which the sting
has been taken out of the situation in that important
city<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T15:42:28"></hs_TimeCode>. I

Morgan:</Member></B> My Lords, Griffith observed that Irish history was
trapped between the dead past and the prophetic future. Is this not a
particularly tragic and all-too-familiar example of it? This is
exploiting a battle that happened well over 300 years ago for sectarian
provocative purposes. It seems to me that the problems lie far deeper
than simply the social and economic circumstances of Northern Ireland.
Could there not be a totally different way of celebrating the cultural
and historic traditions of unionism? By definition, these events are
going to be violent and produce casualties. We know that they
are—it happens every year. They are as much a part of the
calendar of our country as, let us say, Remembrance Sunday, and they
have equally sad connotations. Is there not some peaceful historic or
cultural way of celebrating unionism rather than these provocative
battles? If not then frankly it is not worth

people of Northern Ireland are able to embrace the future, and to let
go of the past while not ignoring or neglecting it. They should be able
to celebrate it in a positive way. I point to the importance of the
Derry/Londonderry City of Culture in that transition process, because

Government left the NHS with a system that covered up weak hospital
leadership and failed to prioritise compassionate care. The

targets mattered more than
people.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071684000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0001.htm#13071684000114">We owe
it to the 3 million people who use the NHS every week to tackle and

Francis report into the tragedy at Mid Staffs, the Prime Minister asked
Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, the NHS medical director, to conduct a
series of ‘deep-dive’ reviews into other hospitals with
worrying mortality rates. No statistics are perfect, but mortality

would normally be expected at the 14 trusts reviewed by Sir

poor practice. He identified patterns across many of them, including
professional and geographic isolation; failure to act on data or

openness; a lack of willingness to learn from mistakes; a lack of
ambition; and ineffectual governance and assurance processes. In some
cases, trust boards were shockingly unaware of problems discovered by
the review teams. So today I can announce that 11 of the 14 hospitals
will be placed into special measures for fundamental breaches of care.

problems, followed by decisiveness in sorting them out. The public need
to know that we will stop at nothing to give patients the high-quality
care they deserve for themselves and their loved ones. Today’s
review and the rigorous actions that we are taking demonstrate the
progress that this Government are making in response to the Francis

In the vast majority of places it does just this—and we should
remember that there continues to be much good care, even in the
hospitals reviewed today. Just as we cannot tolerate 
<?notus-xml column=655?>mediocre or weak leadership, we must not tolerate any attempts to cover

have today begun a journey to change this culture. These 14 failing

other examples of unacceptable care, we will find them and we will root
them out. Under the new rigorous inspection regime led by the Chief
Inspector of Hospitals, if a hospital is not performing as it should,
the public will be told. If a hospital is failing, it will be put into
special measures with a limited time period to sort out its problems.
There will be accountability, too: failure in the NHS should never be a

Health Questions earlier today in the other place, the Health Secretary

it is not. These trusts were identified on the basis of mortality data

failings, happening on this Government’s watch. Anyone who
supports the NHS must always be prepared to shine a spotlight on its
failings so that it can face up to them and improve. However, in doing
so, we must be fair to staff and to the NHS as a whole. In his report,
Sir Bruce puts the failings at the 14 trusts in their proper context,
by concluding

should have chosen to turn this occasion into a rather poorly directed
political tirade. I can assure him that I am perfectly capable of
trading party political debating points with him; I have a great deal
of material in my brief which I will not hesitate to use if he pushes
me. However, I choose not to because I think this is an occasion for
reflecting in a mature and considered way as befits this House on a
very important report. Therefore I begin with a welcome—I am
glad that the noble Lord and his party accept the veracity of the
report. It is a fine piece of work. It was done very thoroughly and
very rapidly and we are grateful to Sir
Bruce<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T16:08:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071684000146" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0001.htm#13071684000146">The
noble Lord said a lot about mortality data with which I agree. At a
national level, mortality has improved; however, the 14 trusts selected
for these deep-dives had long-standing performance issues on mortality
rates, some going back to 2005 or even earlier. Therefore, it is only
partially true to say that this is a problem that happened on our
watch. We want to make sure that we are lifting the lid on any failures
of care that need to be tackled and we are not afraid of doing that.
Again, the noble Lord was right to say that while higher mortality
rates do not always point to deaths that could have been avoided, they
indicate that there could be issues with the quality of care. That is
why we decided to ask Sir Bruce Keogh to carry out these inspections
and to give us his
findings.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071684000147" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0001.htm#13071684000147">The
rationale for the review was that the 14 trusts were outliers for at
least two consecutive years on one or other measure of mortality. I
agree with the noble Lord that it is pointless to bandy figures around,
and I am not going to do that. He rightly quoted Bruce Keogh
saying that it is clinically meaningless and academically reckless to
use mortality formulae to quantify actual numbers of avoidable deaths.
That reflects Robert Francis’s view, but we now have clear
evidence that those mortality data were indicative of more deep-seated
problems. That has been the value of this exercise, I suggest. I cannot
comment on the letter written by the noble Baroness, Lady Young; I have
not seen it. However I am sure the House will agree that the report by
Sir Bruce has challenged us all to look again at why poor care persists
in some hospitals.</hs_para>

levels, the number of front-line staff has gone up since May 2010.
There are 6,000 more doctors and 1,000 more midwives, for
example. On staffing, one can be too simplistic. It is not simply about
the crude numbers. It is not simply about nurses. The number of staff
on the wards will vary according to skill mix, clinical practice and
local factors. It is right that nurse leaders have the freedom to agree
their own staff profiles. That gives flexibility to respond dynamically
to changes in patient demand and workforce supply. I do not in the
least dismiss the potential concern that staff may in some instances
have been stretched, but I do not think we can make generalisations of
the kind that the noble Lord was suggesting that we
did.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071684000149" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0001.htm#13071684000149">On
A&amp;E, as the noble Lord knows, urgent care boards have been working

plans in 
<?notus-xml column=659?>order to improve A&amp;E performance in all areas
where targets have not been met, and that includes the 14
trusts considered by the Keogh review. However, this is not only about
A&amp;E; it is about how the NHS works as a whole, how it works with
other areas, such as social care, and how it deals with an ageing
population and more people with long-term conditions. Dealing with
these pressures means looking at the underlying causes. That is why,
together with NHS England, we are putting together a
strategy that focuses on the people who are the heaviest users of the
NHS: vulnerable older people and those with multiple long-term
conditions.</hs_para>

people are right to focus on the funding of social care. That is
exactly why we in the Department of Health have allocated significant
additional funding to local authorities, including a transfer from the
NHS that is worth £1.1 billion a year by 2014-15. We have also
announced as part of the spending round that has just concluded a local
integration fund of £3.8 billion across health and social care
in 2015-16. Pooling budgets in that way will help drive down the costs
to the acute sector by tackling the acute and expensive
pressure points in the system, such as A&amp;E, by improving
prevention, reducing unplanned hospital admissions and allowing people
to stay in their own homes and live independently.</hs_para>

plan to build into the Care Bill, it is very relevant to it. It will be
introduced by secondary legislation. The key challenge is a change in
behaviour rather than the law. That is why the legislative changes

require constant attention, year on year? Can we expect to see, either
by Sir Bruce or by the new Chief Inspector of Hospitals, an annual look

Howe:</Member></B> We will see the Chief Inspector of Hospitals picking
up the baton, as it were, from Sir Bruce Keogh, whose way of working in
this exercise has been very instructive. His judgments were based on
talking, not just to a few people in the trust, but to patients, a wide
range of staff and, in some instances, people outside the trust. I am
sure that Sir Mike Richards, the new chief inspector, will want to
learn from that. It will be up to the CQC to decide whether this will
be institutionalised. Its methodology is evolving. The hospital
aggregate rating system will have a role to 
<?notus-xml column=660?>play in systematising the evaluation of performance and in any future
instances of very poor care we will no doubt see a level of
transparency from the CQC which we have, perhaps, not had before.

Parliament in a particular way. It will report annually to Parliament

Armstrong of Hill Top:</Member></B> My Lords, will the Minister

past decade there has been significant improvement in mortality rates
across the National Health Service? He said that, because of the
increasing complexity of the patient, that improvement 
<?notus-xml column=661?>is probably greater than the 30% that is measurable.
Will he therefore congratulate those hospitals—the vast
majority—that have led the improvement? At the same time, of
course, we must tackle poor performance and make it clear that that is
unacceptable. However, in doing so we have also to acknowledge the
significant improvement that has happened over the past

some of the hospitals that are struggling in certain respects to show
the way, whether that is on governance, on systems in A&amp;E, on
quality of surgical outcomes or whatever it happens to be. That is an
appropriate idea, and we should undoubtedly ensure that it is taken
forward. However, as the Statement itself reflects, the 14 hospitals

Howe:</Member></B> I can certainly use my best endeavours through the
usual channels with regard to my noble friend’s latter question.
On his first point, he is absolutely right. That is what led us to
believe that aggregate hospital ratings, provided that they are
produced in a sophisticated and careful way, will be very informative
to the general public and to patients in a local area, and to
professional staff within the health service. The Healthcare
Commission, of old, used to produce aggregate ratings. They fell into
disuse and, I have to say, into some disrepute, because they were so
broad brush as to be meaningless. When we asked the Nuffield Trust to
look at this area, it told us very clearly that, as long as we adopted
a nuanced and sophisticated approach so that what was assessed was not
just a hospital trust or an individual hospital within that trust but
rather the performance of individual medical teams and units
within a hospital, we would provide useful information to the public.
However, that information needs to be
accessible.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_16_PT_1/118F23102DBDA10EF967C82EAB8EDF9521BAA29C" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 16 July 2013">Tuesday,

Elystan-Morgan:</Member></B> The Statement repeated by the noble Earl
makes the point that the story does not end with the 14 failed trusts.
Does he agree that there is clear evidence of the acceptance of
standards that are not worthy of our community or of the National
Health Service, and that, very probably, such a situation is not
unassociated with the lack of a hierarchy of discipline in nursing?
Will the Government therefore give an undertaking that, by way of an
agonising reappraisal of the situation, they will concentrate on
establishing whether the institution of the hospital matron could be
considered again, as a post that was effective and seemed to operate
well? Many people the

worshipping at the altars of accountancy and

Those hospitals that I have visited where the standard of care is
manifestly excellent have all had nurse leaders at board level
whose responsibility it is to make the quality of nursing care

with the whole set of

That being said, there is, of course, a “but”. The
“but” is that one element of the government
response—already referred to at least twice—is the role
of the future Chief Inspector of Hospitals. The view taken, and
reiterated again today, is that the inspector should be within the
umbrella of the CQC. For some of us, at the moment, the CQC is
part of the problem. It has not solved all our problems. I share the
hopes of the Government that the CQC will remove itself from its
current difficulties. However, in the mean time at least—or, in
my view, in the longer term—a chief inspector should
have both the responsibility and the authority of reporting directly to
Parliament, as does the Chief Inspector of Schools. That would
be a helpful element of
transparency<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T16:35:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071684000179" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0001.htm#13071684000179"><B><Member ContinuationText="Earl Howe" PimsId="1035" UID="13071684000440" xid="1749" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0001.htm#13071684000440">Earl

those comments 18 months or two years ago. However, the CQC has turned
a very important corner. It has new leadership and has articulated new
ways of working. The leadership of the CQC commands high levels of
confidence in every quarter of Parliament. I am encouraged by that.
However, the point that the noble Lord makes about transparency is
vital. The CQC is very clear that it is not its function to gloss over
poor care when it is found, nor indeed to fail to celebrate good care
when that is
found.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_16_PT_1/0B9EBDD7196858E071F8F70B31EE1D69E90E0CCB" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 16 July 2013">Tuesday,

Amendment 88M, I will speak also to Amendment 92ZZN, both of
which are in my name. These amendments would ensure
that regulations specify in what circumstances a specially trained
person must carry out an assessment or reassessment. A number of groups
of disabled people may need a specialist assessment. For a
deafblind person, 
<?notus-xml column=666?>for example, the ability to access a specialist
assessment carried out by someone who understands the impact of
deafblindness is a critical first step in the process of getting
adequate and appropriate care and support. Assessors who do not have
these specialist skills—for example, a generic assessor who
assesses older people or a single sensory assessor who knows about
visual impairment but not about deafness and blindness and how
they interact—often offer deafblind people inappropriate
mainstream or single-sensory services which are inaccessible and do not
meet their
needs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T16:40:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071684000185" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0001.htm#13071684000185">Similarly,
community care assessors can easily misunderstand the needs of someone
on the autistic spectrum if they do not have experience and knowledge
of how to communicate with someone with autism, or of the impact of the
condition of autism on someone’s day-to-day life. People with
autism can lack insight into their own condition and may struggle to
define their needs. For example, if a person with autism is asked,
“Are you able to wash yourself on your own?” they may
reply, “Yes”, but omit to mention that this is with
verbal prompting at every stage. I hesitate to venture on to this
ground with the noble Baroness, Lady Browning, in the Chamber. Perhaps
she will intervene in the debate later to supplement or, indeed,
possibly correct what I am saying. However, what I have said so far is

addition, some people with autism may be non-verbal or have limited
capacity to communicate or take part in the process unless substantial
adjustments are made. People with profound and multiple learning
difficulties and people who display challenging behaviour are two
further groups where it is vital that they have a specialist assessment
undertaken by an expert. People with PMLD do not use formal
communication such as words, signs or symbols and may rely on others to
speak up for their needs. Staff carrying out the assessments will need
to have skills to ensure that people with PMLD can be meaningfully
involved in the assessment process and have the opportunity to
influence decisions made about their lives. It is also important that

Assessments must be carried out by assessors with the necessary
training and expertise to understand the needs they are assessing. This
point has been made time and again in this Chamber. The noble Lord,
Lord Low, also referred to the Autism Act. The Department of Health has
provided clear direction that autism training is essential for
community assessors to ensure that the needs of adults with autism are
fairly assessed. Here I declare an interest as a vice-president of the
National Autistic Society. The noble Lord, Lord Low, also told us of
the too few local authorities that have awareness training in

a National Autistic Society survey found that one in three social
workers did not have a good understanding of autism. This is, in part,
because adults with high-functioning autism or Asperger’s
syndrome can have less obvious, hidden needs that can be hard to pick
up in any assessment. That is why the assessor must have the necessary
training and expertise. Failure to assess needs can mean that autistic
people and others with disabilities are denied the support they need to
live independently. As we all know, this makes it much more likely that
in later life they will have a significantly greater need for

lessens existing essential provision. As both noble Lords have clearly
described, the initial assessment of someone’s
needs is critical and must be carried out by someone who is
appropriately qualified and understands the impact of the impairment
and the types of support that are needed. As we have heard,
the Bill does not provide the same requirement as the current statutory

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Earl
Howe):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble
Lords, Lord Low and Lord Touhig, for bringing forward these amendments.
I say straight away that I fully support the intention of Amendment
88M, which is to ensure that local authorities engage a suitable expert
when carrying out complex assessments. The assessment will remain an
integral part of the process of determining a person’s care and
support needs and whether these meet the national eligibility criteria.
To ensure that this is done correctly, it is essential that the person
carrying out the assessment has the right knowledge, skills and
competence. We heard from users of care and support during the
engagement on the draft Bill about the importance of the assessor
having knowledge of the condition that the person may have, whether
they are, for example, a frail older person, a person with mental
health problems or a person with autism.</hs_para>

social workers are trained to carry out assessments. Their skills and
experience will allow them to assess people with various conditions
such as physical disability. There are, however, certain complex
conditions where these skills are not sufficient to allow assessments
to be carried out effectively. I am particularly thinking about a
person who is deafblind—the example, given by the noble Lord,
Lord Low. In those circumstances, most care managers would find it very
difficult, if not impossible, to communicate with the person. It takes
someone with expertise to carry out an assessment properly and identify
the person’s needs and the outcomes they wish to
achieve.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13071684000203" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0001.htm#13071684000203">I
agree with the noble Lords that, in such circumstances, the local
authority must engage a person with the relevant expertise to carry out
the assessment. That continues to be our policy. I also accept that if
the adult’s condition is so complex at the assessment stage as
to require the services of an expert in the field to provide advice,
then it makes perfect sense for this to be repeated when the plan is to
be reviewed. I should like to reassure the Committee that the Bill
already has provisions in place to allow this joined-up approach to
occur if an adult’s circumstances have changed in a way that
affects the care plan. Clause 27(4) states that the local authority
must, to the extent it considers appropriate, carry out a fresh needs
assessment. In doing so, it would have to follow the requirements of
regulations to consult a person with expertise. I hope I have
reassured noble Lords of our agreement to the principles that they
raise. In the light of what they have said in support of the amendment,
I will look again at Clause 12 to ensure that we are giving ourselves
the relevant powers to achieve our aims. I hope that the noble Lord,

the legislation to make sure that it put the principle into effect on
the same basis as our amendment seeks to achieve. However, lo and

half way to meet us by saying that he is willing to look at the Bill

assist the achievement of a consensus on this for us to meet, I would

that historic underfunding of the social care system, the pressures of

authorities set their eligibility criteria at “moderate”.
By 2012, 84% had set the eligibility criteria at the higher level of

an individual has been deemed eligible for care. Setting the bar for
eligibility too high effectively means that there will be hundreds of
thousands of people who think that they will not have to sell their
homes to pay for care in their old age, yet will not be eligible for
the cap itself. They will still have to pay for the cost of their care,
even well above the £72,000 threshold, unless they are deemed

not exclude this group of more than 100,000 disabled people with

threshold in creating a truly preventive care system. While I welcome
the explicit duty on local authorities actively to take steps to
prevent delay or reduce the need for care and support, I fear that the
regulations published last week on the national eligibility threshold
will impede the realisation of this vision. In confirming their
intention to set the threshold at a level equivalent to
“substantial” under the current criteria for fair access
to services, the Government would exclude more than 100,000 disabled
people with moderate care needs from the care system. These are people
who need support to get out of bed in the

denying disabled people with moderate needs the care and support they
need is a false economy. If their needs are not met in the care system
there is a real risk that they will escalate to a point where they have
to be dealt with further down the line once they reach crisis point.
This does not come cheap. It could lead to longer hospital stays,
frequent readmissions, even the need for residential support, not to
mention the lost tax revenue resulting from disabled people having to

would have on her independence, that her hours would be reduced to
three per week. As a consequence of losing this support she fell into a

effectively regulating for prevention to be taken out of the care
system. The consultation document published last week on the draft
minimum eligibility threshold states that for those people who are not

universal support, including information, advice and preventive

this implies that coverage of such services is comprehensive,
consistent and of adequate quality when we know that this is not the

are at risk of closure. Indeed, research by the Red Cross has found
that nearly two-thirds—64%—of councillors said that their
local authority had cut or frozen funding for prevention and lower
level social care since the last local elections. This means that
universal services will simply not have the capacity to provide the
adequate preventive support that the Government intend. People who are
not eligible for care will continue to face a postcode lottery of

end by emphasising that setting eligibility at a lower level is the
essence of prevention. We cannot have a system where you have to reach

intervention and preventive support can also have significant financial
benefits. Research undertaken by Deloitte on behalf of disability
charities found that investing in people with lower levels of need
provides a net positive return of at least 30% to the Government. I
therefore hope that the Government will be prepared to take these
points on board and ensure that the regulations on eligibility underpin
rather than undermine the vision of a truly preventive care system,

the Government do not agree with the intention behind the amendment, it
is clear that they accept, no doubt at the Treasury’s

come. As we have already heard, the social care system is currently
failing to support four out of every 10 disabled people of
working age to do the basic things in life such as washing, dressing,
eating and getting out of the house. The proposed national eligibility
threshold will do nothing to change this. The cap on care costs for
these people will be a fiction; unless their needs are assessed to be
at the equivalent of “substantial” under the current FACS
criteria, they could well spend a small fortune paying for care, none

public would be shocked to learn that the level of needs spelled out in
the amendment in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Grey-Thompson, is

people whose needs are below the proposed national eligibility

in Clause 2. However, as the Care and Support Alliance points out, many
of these services have already been axed in the cuts or are at risk of
closure. The £2 billion funding is very welcome, but we need the

as the Government have rightly recognised, social care is not merely

the debate on the question of someone having to reach a level of
substantial disability before becoming eligible for care. It should be
the right of all people with a disability at least to be assessed
properly, from the lowest level of disability to the highest. A level
may be set where tens of thousands of people are excluded, such as
people with a learning disability. Many are already being excluded by
local authorities and being denied the use of day centres, or whatever.

However, I share the concerns which were so well articulated by the
noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Low of Dalston, that setting
the fair access to care services criteria at
“substantial” is simply plain wrong. It is wrong because
it will exclude many people who I know with autism, and who have a

Hollins:</Member></B> My Lords, I would have added my name to this
amendment because it is excellent and necessary. I, too, hope that the
noble Earl will see the sense of it. Certainly, people’s fears
that the Government would propose to set the national eligibility
threshold too high have been confirmed. Rather than celebrating the
achievements of councils that have been able to provide highly valued,
innovative and low-cost services to people with low and moderate needs,
we are instead to fall in line with the majority of local authorities,
with the false hope of avoiding financial strain. Failing to provide
services to people with moderate care needs is, at best, a missed
opportunity to encourage preventive care and significantly improve the
quality of life for a highly disadvantaged group of people. At worst,
we are leaving a considerable proportion of people with a lifelong
disability to fend for themselves.</hs_para>

recently excluded from receiving support are extremely troubling. We
have heard some examples already today with some people losing all

briefly to give the example of Frances, a middle-aged woman with a mild
to moderate learning disability who has always struggled to understand
and manage bills. Since receiving a few hours support a week she has
finally had relief from receiving constant threats and eviction
notices. How long will her support survive before she is declared
ineligible? Clearly the resources of the state are limited but they
need to be used wisely, and I believe that our care system must
encourage and incentivise local authorities to provide lower intensity

concern in doing that was not just that we were mealy-mouthed stooges
of the Treasury but the overwhelming amount of evidence given to us

underfunded and that funding had failed to keep pace with demographic
changes in people of working age and those who were not. We thought
that the deficit had to be made good but that that was a matter for the

issues was that the recommendations should be affordable. Given the 
<?notus-xml column=679?>deficit funding, we could not see how in the short term you could end up
with eligibility criteria that would be more generous than
substantial, which is where, in reality, most local authorities had
ended up, whatever the rights and wrongs of those kind of
considerations. That is where we were. We wanted a consistent
architecture between working age and non-working age; we wanted
practical proposals that would be implementable in the reasonably short

Government deserve a lot of credit for the way they have simply
accepted our recommendation that the FACS system was opaque and totally
misunderstood or not understood at all by most of the public. They have
abandoned a banding system that was a poor servant to comprehensibility

shot at draft eligibility criteria in their draft regulations, moving
away from that discredited banding system under
FACS.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071684000248" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#13071684000248">In that
situation, it is very difficult to foresee circumstances in which we
can go from where we are now into a new cap system which is consistent
between working age and non-working age and make the leap beyond a
national threshold of substantial. You could argue that as we are being
brave and making this change, we should become braver. The argument
against that approach is that we would raise expectations among a lot
of people of working age or non-working age about what they will get
when the financial reality at the local level is that they will not get
it because there will not be the resources to deliver those services.
That would be a cruel deception. The only way to break out of that is
to say that we will take one particular group—those of working
age—and deal with them differently in the eligibility criteria
for meeting needs from the older age group. If we are going to keep
consistency between those two age groups, we have to accept that at
present it is very difficult to introduce this system with eligibility
criteria that are substantially more generous than
“substantial” under the present FACS system. I fully
accept that that is not likely to be a popular view and that it will
mean that some people will not get the services they need and may
deserve, but—and this is a big but—if you look at the
characteristics of this system, even if people do not get free
services, they still get a guarantee of an assessment of their care
needs and advice on how to meet those needs. That is a lot better than

Lipsey:</Member></B> My Lords, I rise to make two brief points. First,
this argument is not really about eligibility criteria but about money.
It would be highly desirable to extend eligibility to people with only
moderate needs, but we will find it extremely hard simply to cater for
people with substantial needs unless the pot of money is substantially
expanded. That is the elephant in the room. In all the discussions
here, we are describing a marvellous new system, but we have not yet
said how it will be paid
for.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071684000254" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#13071684000254">Secondly,
I think that eligibility criteria are, to a degree, a bit of a phantom.
We know that there is variation between authorities across the country:
some accept people with moderate needs and some accept them with
substantial needs. Quite aside from that, there is overwhelming
evidence of enormous variety not between local authorities but within
local authorities depending on who is assessing you and their state of
mind. I quote in support of this a report from the National Care
Standards Commission in 2005-06 and an excellent report by the PSSRU
last year which tells you what actually goes on when people are being
assessed. You might have a social worker who is terribly sympathetic to
the older or disabled people she is assessing, and her boss who is, no
doubt, sympathetic but who knows what budget he has to meet
each month. In those cases, you simply get a wrestling
match.</hs_para>

worryingly, once the cap comes in, people and their families will have
a huge economic interest in demonstrating that they have substantial
needs because that is when the meter starts ticking for them getting
help. The danger is that those with, in some cases, the biggest needs
will not be very good at gaming the system. Somebody with autism may be
told by their parents to seem as bad as possible so they can get the
meter ticking. They are not going to be very skilled at that, but the
mums and dads of articulate middle-class people will have a different
set of instructions to go on. There will always be a tendency 
<?notus-xml column=681?>to exaggerate—play up to the full may be a better way of
putting it—their needs to get them graded as
substantial.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071684000256" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#13071684000256">I
make these points, not to draw any firm conclusion, not even on the
question of whether those with moderate needs should be catered for,

needs to be met, developing them with an appropriate care and support
plan, enabling the best use of a personal budget and/or direct payments

concern among many stakeholders about the level at which the

those of the noble Lord, Lord Low, and my noble friend Lord Touhig.
However, we must also take account of the points raised by my noble
friends Lord Warner and Lord Lipsey because this is, in the end, an
issue of funding. I hope that, 
<?notus-xml column=682?>when she winds up, the noble Baroness will address
the issue of affordability. This may be a technical point, but this
might be a matter of supply, since the Commons might well assert their

guidance is very important and my noble friend Lord Warner said that it
was a good first shot. I agree with him and it is certainly something
to work on. However, could it warrant more parliamentary scrutiny than
is normally given to regulations? We usually have a debate of about one
hour; the conventions allow us to defeat a statutory instrument
on very few occasions, and there is no opportunity to amend
those regulations. We have benefited enormously from having a Joint
Select Committee to advise us on the draft Bill: might it be right to
have a similar process in relation to the regulations? I hope
the noble Earl might be sympathetic to my Amendment 88T, which asks for
a joint parliamentary committee process to look at the regulations
before they are laid before Parliament.</hs_para>

would ask the Minister to focus on the points raised by my noble friend
Lord Lipsey. If we go towards national eligibility criteria, which we
all support, can we be assured that there will then be a consistency

the consequences of the introduction of Dilnot and the cap. I am
concerned about the capacity of local authorities to deal with all the
responsibilities being placed on them, not just in terms of funding
services and support, but the capacity to carry out the assessments
required by this legislation. We will talk later about the impact of
self-funders. On commencement day, we can have hundreds of thousands of
people needing to be assessed in order to make sure the clock starts
towards the £72,000 cap. Alongside that, all the other
assessments that are covered by this legislation will need to take
place. There is a real worry that local authorities do not have the
capacity to do this. I am always tempted to talk about the problems of
the Child Support Agency, but when you have a commencement date there
is a risk that many more people become eligible to be assessed at that
point. There is a real risk that local authorities will not be able to
meet the demands placed on them. This is why my noble friend Lord
Lipsey is right to raise the issue of consistency of approach and
capacity in assessment against the national eligibility criteria which
will have to be undertaken by individual local
authorities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T17:47:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000009"><B><Member ContinuationText="Earl Howe" PimsId="1035" UID="130716115000336" xid="1749" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000336">Earl
Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, this has been an excellent and very
important debate and I thank all noble Lords who have contributed. I
will, if I may, begin by picking up the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord
Warner. He put his finger on a number of very important points. The
system of locally-determined eligibility for care and support has been
confusing to people for too long. It has been seen as an unfair system
under which different levels of needs are met on the basis of where 
<?notus-xml column=683?>somebody lives. The changes we are bringing forward will mean that
people’s entitlements to care and support will be much clearer
and fairer and will reduce variation in access between local
authorities.</hs_para>

point and, once this legislation comes into effect, local authorities
will not be able to reduce eligibility below the level set out in
regulations. They will be able to meet other needs which do not meet
the national eligibility criteria through the power in Clause 19, but
they will be required to follow a consistent approach to determining
eligible needs. That is a big step forward. We must not view these
national criteria in isolation. The Bill does a great deal for people
with lower levels of need, including through provisions on prevention,
information and advice. One of the key aims in relation to assessment
is to ensure that this is effective in identifying needs and support
options for all people, in particular to help those who do not have
eligible needs and to prevent
deterioration<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T17:49:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000011">Clause
13 provides for regulations which will set out the eligibility criteria
according to which local authorities must meet an adult’s needs
for care and support or a carer’s needs for support.
Amendment 88Q seeks to add this detail to the Bill. I
understand why the noble Baroness would like to see the eligibility
criteria set out in this way. Some noble Lords have questioned the
number of important provisions being introduced through secondary
legislation. However, in this case I believe that it is necessary. It
is important that we get the eligibility criteria right, otherwise
there is a danger that we will put in place a system that is more
confusing than the one that we are
replacing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000012">There
is advantage in having the flexibility of setting the criteria in
regulations; once again the noble Lord, Lord Warner, gave a helpful
pointer to this in his remarks. We are not proposing to amend the
national eligibility criteria on a regular basis. However, we need the
ability to amend the regulations if it is shown that the criteria need
to change at some point in the future. Of course, we would consult
fully before making any such
change.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000013">To
help inform debate on this area, and as noble Lords have mentioned, on
28 June we published draft regulations for discussion which set out the
proposed national eligibility criteria. I emphasise that these are
intended to set a national minimum equivalent to the level operated by
the vast majority of local authorities in the current system. As part
of the spending round announced recently we have committed to provide
funding that will maintain the same level of services when authorities
move to the new system in April 2015. This is the beginning
of engagement with stakeholders before we formally consult on draft
regulations next

88T is concerned with parliamentary scrutiny of the eligibility
regulations. The power to set the eligibility criteria in regulations
is one of the most important in the Bill and is central to the new care
and support system. For this reason the Bill requires the regulations
to be made under the affirmative procedure. That will ensure that
Parliament will consider the regulations before they are introduced and
that it will also consider any future changes. As a matter
of course 
<?notus-xml column=684?>the regulations will also be considered by the Secondary Legislation
Scrutiny Committee and the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments.
Therefore we do not believe that the regulations need further scrutiny
by a Joint Committee of both
Houses.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000015">Amendments
88R and 88S in the name of the noble Lord,
Lord<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T17:52:54"></hs_TimeCode> Hunt, refer
to matters that the Secretary of State should have regard to when
making the regulations. Amendment 88R clarifies that the regulations
may describe a person’s care and support needs by reference to
the effect of needs arising from a physical or mental condition. The
well-being principle at Clause 1(2)(a) includes physical and mental
health, and this is reflected in the draft regulations. Regulation 2,
which sets out the eligibility criteria, explains that needs are
eligible needs if they have a significant impact on a person’s
well-being and are as a result of a physical or mental impairment or
illness. Amendment 88S proposes that a person should be eligible for
care and support if they are in receipt of health services. As we
debated earlier, a person can expect to receive an integrated service,
but the determination of eligibility for care and support must be based
on care needs only, rather than what health services a person is
receiving.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="130716115000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000016">A
number of noble Lords suggested that the eligibility criteria should be
set at moderate. As I have already said, this threshold is about
establishing a minimum standard, not about taking away councils’
discretion to go further. Local authorities will remain able to meet
lower needs locally if they choose to do so. Once again I was grateful
to the noble Lord, Lord Warner, for his realistic assessment, and to
the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, for his comments. The eligibility criteria
are intended to be equivalent to the level operated by the vast
majority of local authorities in the current system. Independent
research suggests that it would cost an additional £1.2 billion
to set the threshold at moderate for younger disabled people and those
with mental health needs, and a further £1.5 billion for older
people. The combined total is £2.7 billion, which is a large
amount to find in the current financial
climate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T17:55:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000017">The
pooled funding that we are proposing is important to factor in here.
The noble Baroness, Lady
Grey-Thompson<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T17:55:24"></hs_TimeCode>,
suggested that setting the criteria at moderate would save money. It is
important to understand what the pooled funding is designed to do. Once
again, the eligibility criteria should be seen as part of the overall
system that we are putting in place. The pooled funding that we have
announced will support better integration between local authorities in
the NHS to improve outcomes for the local population. Part of this
funding will be used to support local authorities and the NHS if they
need to intervene earlier to prevent people’s health or care
needs worsening. That will include many of the people with low or
moderate
needs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T17:56:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000018">The
noble Lord, Lord Low, suggested that universal services do not have the
capacity or resources to meet the aspirations that the Government have
set out. As we have debated, the Bill sets out new duties on local
authorities to provide universal services such as preventive services.
These will also be supported by statutory guidance to make clear the
expectations that we are placing on local authorities. Moreover, as I
have 
<?notus-xml column=685?>mentioned, the pooled funding is relevant here.
Among other things, that will enable preventive and integrated
services, which also benefit the

Lady Grey-Thompson, said that it was not fair that the cap applies only
to eligible needs. We will debate the Government’s proposals for
the cap cost system in due course. However, access to the cap needs to
be consistent in order for the system to be fair. Using national
eligibility criteria will ensure that the cap applies on an equivalent
basis in every area. The noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, commented that the
eligibility criteria will not solve the huge variation within local
authority areas due to variable assessments. First, the eligibility
assessments will set a minimum threshold, which is important. Some
differentiation in local implementation will remain, but as we
referred to previously, we will require that local authorities
appropriately train assessors to ensure that assessments are carried
out properly, and we will publish guidance that will help to reduce
variation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T17:58:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000020">My

Browning:</Member></B> As far as the eligibility criteria are concerned
there is another indicator, which I have not heard mentioned in this
debate, and that is the number of people who challenge their local
authority through the courts. Currently—from my own experience
of case work, particularly with those on the autistic spectrum and with
learning disabilities—many local authorities, when challenged
legally on this, will settle before it goes to court. It is difficult
to quantify what that number is, and I do not know whether what I am
asking my noble friend is practical. However, in monitoring the success
of whether the eligibility threshold is correct, particularly for those
with low to medium needs, would the Government be prepared to use the
number of applications for legal challenge and, if possible, of those
who settle out of court before it goes to court? That is a very clear
indication of where local authorities refuse because the current
eligibility criteria have not been properly constructed. When
challenged, they usually pay up pretty
quickly.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T17:59:44"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T18:09:24"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para><hs_time UID="130716115000317" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000317">6

a great deal of what this Bill will deliver is, so to speak, invisible
to the naked eye, because it will ensure that those with lower needs
will also be catered for in some way or another. I would like to hope
that, for that reason, there will be less scope for challenge. I will

Lord, Lord Warner, when he says that we need to be realistic. However,
my view still is that a small amount of support for working-age

actually save us money in the long term. Moreover, expectations have
been raised about what older people can expect.</hs_para>

support, does not help them; it just raises their expectations in a
slightly misleading way. Again, disabled people and older people are
paying the price of the economic downturn. Although this is not the
right time for it, I would welcome a really honest debate on what the

Pitkeathley:</Member></B> My Lords, I wish to speak to Amendment 89B as
well as Amendment 89A, as they are both amendments about the
circumstances in which a carer can be charged for services. Carers
UK—I declare an interest as its vice-president—has
estimated that carers save the UK economy £119 billion per year.
That is a statistic that I never tire of giving your Lordships. Local
authorities recognise the value and cost-effectiveness of supporting
carers. As a result, very few local authorities charge for services
provided to carers. The Government’s impact assessment for the
Bill sets out current evidence on the cost-effectiveness of supporting
carers, and refers to the benefits received from doing so: for example,
preventing or delaying hospital or residential care admissions;

take a break—operates with two neighbouring local authorities.
One regards replacement care as a service for the cared-for person,
including sitting services. The next-door authority allows carers to
purchase a sitting service, as long as it does not include intimate
care, with their direct payment. Varying interpretations mean that
there is a disparity for carers in the same area. Some can access

reverse order, with the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey. He
has hit on something that is a bigger issue than perhaps has been
realised yet. When we were debating the pension credit legislation in
this House, the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, talked about the fact that
she had taken over the affairs of an elderly relative. She was probably
the one person in the whole of Britain who at that time knew exactly
what the regulations were. Yet it was only after the person died that
she discovered that they had a little account about which she had known
absolutely nothing. Why? Because many older people put money aside to
cover their funeral. That is the truth. It is something that is very
important to them. They probably do not tell people about
it. I am sure that they also have other reasons, but that is a very
common one. It is not uncommon for relatives to discover such accounts,
although they are not vast amounts of money. The noble Lord, Lord
Lipsey, is absolutely right that if, in a circumstance like that,
somebody was deemed to have transgressed the law, it would be unfair
and
unjust.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000056">I
also add support to Amendment 89BA, an amendment of the noble Lord,
Lord Low of Dalston. I was lucky to serve with the noble Lord, Lord
Best, last year on an inquiry into the availability of aids and
adaptations for older people who need help to remain in their own
homes. We discovered extraordinary variations across the country and
heartrending stories of elderly ladies having to carry their very

or not this was necessary. They saved a lot of money that went instead

particular services. I am not sure whether my noble friend’s

they are published, the regulations themselves will inevitably be
complex and disputes are likely. Dispute through judicial review or the
courts is not the way. Will the Minister explain why there appears to
be no response to appeal or conflict resolution processes contained in
this part of the Bill? Why do many of the decisions made under
provisions in Part 1 seem not to have some mechanism of appeal attached
to them? The appeals system should be fair, easy to access and
independent. Does the Minister acknowledge that this is
needed?</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000064">On
the specific amendments in the group, my noble friend Lady Pitkeathley
has provided an excellent explanation of the importance of her two
amendments, Amendments 89A and 89B. As usual, it is very hard to find
anything additional to say when it comes to carers and carers’
rights after she has spoken. It is right always to underline our
support for the provisions in the Bill providing statutory rights for
carers, but there are still areas of concern that need to be addressed
relating to means testing and local authority care charges, and the
widespread fear among carers about charges as local authorities become
increasingly strapped for

89A aims to make the distinction between what is a disabled
person’s service and what is a carer’s service by using
the wording under the Carers and Disabled Children Act 2000, and
ensuring that personal services provided for the disabled person in
order to meet the needs of the carer cannot include services of an
intimate nature. There are very real concerns that without this the
Bill would not prevent the carer being charged for a respite care
service which includes personal care that is provided to the person
they care
for<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T18:30:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000066">My
noble friend has set out some of what are presumably the
“unintended consequences”, to quote the Select Committee
on the gaps and risks in the Bill that need to be addressed. It would
be particularly confusing when trying, for example, to work out whether
a service would be accrued to the care account under the capped system
and whether a direct payment can be spent on a replacement care
service. We need clarity on what carers and disabled people’s
personal budgets and independent personal budgets can be used
for.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000067">Amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T18:30:51"></hs_TimeCode>
89B again focuses on the position of carers caring for an adult in the
community receiving support under NHS continuing care. The amendment
that was tabled last week sought to clarify who was responsible in
these circumstances for assessing the carer. Today, the concern is to
ensure that the NHS meets the cost of support services provided to a
carer. The noble Lord, Lord Low, raised important issues about the
provision of, and payment for, aids and adaptations in the home. It is
a complex issue that 
<?notus-xml column=694?>causes deep frustration among those who are eligible
in terms of knowing what is available, the bureaucracy involved, the
time taken to assess and make adaptations, the availability locally of
basic equipment such as grab rails, and, indeed, the different charging
practices of local authorities. This issue also came to light around
the bedroom tax, where properties which had been adapted were vacated
and the new property then had to be adapted and the old one unadapted
for the new tenants. Presumably, that was another unintended
consequence. Adaptations of low cost can have a high value for the
independence of older people and so again we should make it as easy as
we can for them to get that
support.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000068">Finally,
the amendment of
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T18:32:05"></hs_TimeCode> noble friend
Lord Lipsey makes a strong case in relation to Clause 64 —this
deals with a local authority’s powers to enforce debts owed to
it—for trying to distinguish between people who deliberately
supply fraudulent information on their finances and those who make
mistakes or misunderstand what is required of them. The financial
assessments for care and support are involved and complex and errors
can occur with no intention to be dishonest or defraud. I hope that the

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, not for the first time, I find myself in
sympathy with the noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley, and the concerns
she has raised about the Bill’s practical implementation. I am
sure it is a shared view across the Committee that people should be
supported to remain independent within their own homes for
as long as possible. As the Bill recognises, supporting carers and
preventing or delaying the need for care and support are both vital to
achieving this
goal.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000070">On the
specific amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, our previous debate
shows the value and importance which noble Lords place on carers and
the need to support them. I thank the noble Baroness for her
recognition of the significant improvement that this Bill will make. I
reassure her that the Bill makes it clear that local authorities cannot
charge carers for services provided to the person being cared for. Our
clear view is that Clause 14(3) puts this matter beyond doubt, and this
would include services of an intimate nature provided to the person
being cared
for.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000071">Local<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T18:34:11"></hs_TimeCode>
authorities need to retain the flexibility to meet the needs of carers
in the most appropriate way. This might include providing services to
the adult needing care such as feeding them or taking them to the
toilet. Providing these services is necessary to allow carers of people
with the greatest needs to take a well earned break from their
responsibilities. However, Amendment 89A would create a legal barrier
which may hinder the provision of support to carers. For that reason, I
do not warm to
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000072">Amendment
89B would ensure that services provided to carers were provided free of
charge by the NHS. Local authorities currently do not usually charge
carers, as they recognise the vital work that they do. In some cases,
however, local authorities may charge a fee for services provided
directly to carers, such as when the local authority arranges a trip
for them. We want to continue to give local authorities this
flexibility.</hs_para>

expressed a worry about the scope for different interpretation about
who is the beneficiary of a particular service. In most cases, I
suggest that it will be clear what is being provided to the adult
needing care and support as opposed to the carer. However, statutory
guidance will be provided to help to promote national consistency on
that point. I hope that that reassurance will provide the noble
Baroness with the wherewithal to withdraw the amendment for the time
being although I will, of course, reflect further on what
she has
said.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000074">On
Amendments 89BA and 92ZZM, I reassure the noble Lord, Lord Low, that we
intend to maintain the existing entitlements to aids, minor adaptations
and intermediate care in regulations. Aids and minor adaptations
costing up to £1,000 will continue to be provided free and
without the need for a financial assessment. We will shortly be
consulting on the implementation of our reforms to care and support
funding, which will inform the future regulations. In designing the new
regulations, we will consider whether we should update the list of
services which must be provided free of charge. However, we must bear
in mind that further limitations on the ability of local authorities to
charge would reduce the resources available to support people with the
greatest needs. The draft regulations will be subject to a further
public consultation to ensure the final regulations are based on the
best available
evidence.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000075">As
I indicated earlier, we are introducing a fairer system, including a
cap on care costs. It is right that people who can afford to do so
should continue to contribute a fair amount towards their care costs,
and when they do not, Clause 64 allows local authorities to recover
these costs as a debt. I understand the desire to protect people who
make mistakes or accidentally fail to disclose relevant information.
However, I fear that Amendment 104ZB, which would require local
authorities to prove intent, would result in complex and expensive
legal cases. Intent is not always easy to prove. Local authorities will
not be able to charge people more than their due debt and the costs
incurred in recovering that debt, and we think it is right that they
should be able to do so even if someone has made a genuine mistake.
This is not about instituting recriminations but about correcting
mistakes. We should surely allow local authorities to take action in
such a case if we believe in protecting public

Lipsey:</Member></B> I am a bit bemused. I cannot see where my

makes a mistake should have to pay not only the extra money they have
received but the cost to the local authority of retrieving that money.

Howe:</Member></B> I had rather assumed, perhaps wrongly, that if, for
whatever reason, there has been a discrepancy in the declaration made
by a person, it either has to be a genuine error, or something
more deliberate, in which case there is intent involved. I am not sure

think that the ability of a local authority to recover costs ought to
act as a disincentive to people to be careless about what they are
doing. They should make sure that what they declare is accurate and
should be made aware that if they make a mistake, it might prove a
little more costly to them than just rectifying the error.

able to complain to the local authority and have that complaint handled

amendments hardly deserve the epithet
“probing”—more a light examination by the

substitute for the monetary cap proposed by the Government a cap based
on the number of years a person has been receiving
care<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T18:47:20"></hs_TimeCode> at a

origins of my amendment were in a proposal floated in the minority
report to the 1999 royal commission on the funding of long-term care.
As I was the author, I remember this quite well. It did not even gain
the support of a majority of the minorities, as the noble Lord, Lord
Joffe, declined to sign up to it. Nevertheless, it has had a life after
death and I think it can claim paternity —the noble Lord, Lord
Warner, knows better than I—for the cap proposal in the Dilnot
report, because it shares precisely the same objective as the 
<?notus-xml column=698?>cap: to limit the costs of care to those unlucky enough to require it
for a long time as it costs a lot of money. That is the aim of the
proposal<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T18:48:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000090">When
I first saw the Dilnot proposal, I thought that it was clearly superior
to the one in the minority report—everyone would spend the same
before the state kicked in. But as time has gone on I have become much
less sure of this as two defects of the Dilnot version have become more
apparent. The first is that it is extremely complex for local
authorities to administer. There have been figures of between
£300 million and £500 million floating about for the cost
of administration, before money is handed out to people. That is
because, to implement the Dilnot report, it is necessary to track each
individual from the time the meter starts ticking to see exactly what
they are spending on care or, rather worse, to see exactly what a local
authority thinks it should be providing in spending on care for each
individual—a sort of abstract concept that has to be turned into
a concrete figure.</hs_para>

will be apparent from other amendments I have tabled, I am not even
confident that local authorities will have their systems sufficiently
sorted to manage it by the proposed start date of April 2016. There is
a non-negligible risk that this will prove to be universal benefit mark
2, a scheme that will in practice prove impossible to operate. I hope I
am wrong but the fact is that, putting the best face on it, it will
cost a lot of money to implement without any of that money going to
better care, and not a penny of it going to the people who should be
helped. In the Government’s ghastly jargon, it will be money
spent on bureaucracy, not front-line services. That is my first query
about the Dilnot way of doing things.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="130716115000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000092">My second point is
equally worrying. The Dilnot system is terribly difficult for anyone
normal to understand. When do you start to get it? How much is assessed
as being the cost of the care that you may get from the council? How
much have I spent? How much of that counts towards the cap? People may
say, “My care costs differ because my condition goes up and
down”. All those factors are crucial if people are to know what
they spend out of their own pockets. I am sure that better-off people
who are in full possession of their faculties will work it out, but we
know that 40% of people over 80 have some degree of dementia and are
therefore not in full possession. Certainly, those with
computer-literate families and sons or daughters who happen to be
independent financial advisers will crack it all right. Their claims
for substantial care needs will be there on day one in a large pile on
the local authority’s desk. They will know every penny that has
been spent, but are we confident that everyone else will? Just
explaining the system and the process of communication, to which we
shall come later, will be jolly difficult. It should be remembered that
more than half the people think that the state at the moment pays their
entire care costs without deductions. There is a long way to go from
there to understanding Dilnot.</hs_para>

time-based system is simplicity itself. You have an assessment, and if
it shows that you need substantial care or its equivalent under the new
system, the clock starts ticking. Five years later, you no longer have
to pay the cost of your care. That is 
<?notus-xml column=699?>very simple. Five years is what you have to find. In
my variant, the council would then pick up the whole cost, not some
notional cost, as under the Dilnot cap, and you would simply have to
find your hotel costs where applicable. That is simplicity itself and,
incidentally, it makes it much easier for you to insure privately.
Private insurance companies are going to struggle to know how much
their liability will be under the Dilnot system. Under a time-based
system, they will know that they have a liability. If you live more
than five years the state will pick up the bill and the only bit that
they will have to cover is the first five years.</hs_para>

in generosity with Dilnot? It will probably be about the same. The
Dilnot cap would be reached by someone in residential care rather more
quickly than the five years but, on the other hand, as you are going to
be paid only in part if you reach the cap, you may not be any better
off. I suspect that for those receiving care in their own homes my
proposal will prove to be more generous than Dilnot’s
£72,000 cap. In most cases, people will take more than five
years to reach the £72,000 and it may therefore be slightly more
generous to people who live at home, which is no dreadful
thing.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="130716115000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000095">Sunny
optimist though I am, I do not expect the Minister to go snap on my
scheme today. I am not even sure that I do. He and his colleagues had
enough trouble getting the Government to sign up to Dilnot, and they
will not want to execute any unnecessary U-turns now. However, I
suggest that he puts this proposal in his bottom drawers because it may
become apparent in six, 12 or 18 months’ time that Dilnot, as
encapsulated in the Bill, is simply impossible to administer on any
realistic timetable. When that day dawns— I hope it does
not—my scheme may come in handy. I beg to

Campbell-Savours:</Member></B> My Lords, I totally dissent from the
case that my noble friend Lord Warner makes. I have opposed Dilnot
since the first day that it was made public as a report. My view is
very simple. It will simply transfer money from those without
to those with, and it has been introduced to appease—I repeat:
to appease—the demands of those who insist on passing on
inherited wealth from one generation to another, a most ignoble way of
proceeding.</hs_para>

brilliant—it deals with exactly the concerns that I
have, and I hope that it does not end up in the department’s
bottom drawer. I hope that when the Government begin to realise that
the whole complicated process they are imposing on local authorities
will inevitably lead to mistakes and errors and congestion and
arguments between carers and people being cared for and their relatives

want to tempt the noble Earl to say a little bit more on two areas
which have been referred to by noble Lords. The first is the complexity
for local authorities of what they have to administer. The noble Earl
has not really responded in detail on this matter so far. Indeed, it is
noticeable that local authorities have not responded. We have received
a huge amount of evidence, but not very much from local authorities and
the local authority associations. This worries me. I understand why
local authorities would be keen to play a prime part in the
administration of this new system, but these are genuine concerns about
whether there is capacity to make changes of this complexity happen.
Nothing would be worse than the new system coming into being and
collapsing almost on day one. At the moment, that is my view on what is
going to happen. I do not know what the Government intend in terms of
testing out the robustness of the system for when it is due to come in.
I hope that at some point during our debate the noble Earl will be able
to tell
us<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T19:03:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000105">Secondly,
the next group of amendments deals with the public understanding the
complexity of the system being considered, but it seems to me that this
issue relates to the point about insurance raised by my noble friend
Lord Lipsey. My understanding is that one benefit of full
implementation of Dilnot—although I am not sure that the
Government have gone down that path—would be that, if the public
knew that their liabilities would be capped, there would be likely to
be a ready insurance market. A number of us have looked with interest
at the comments of the Association of British Insurers and other parts
of the insurance industry. I have to say there does not at the moment
seem to be much optimism about whether there is going to be a market
and whether packages are going to be developed. This may come up in
later amendments, but at some point I hope that the noble Earl will
give a little more information about the Government’s view of
the potential of the insurance market to develop products which the
public can understand and will be willing to invest

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, as the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey,
explained very clearly, these amendments would mean that the capped
system counted time rather than costs. I agree that there are
advantages to this approach. The Dilnot commission, in considering this
option, said that using years instead of costs would be easier to
administer and simpler to understand, and I appreciate those arguments.
However, the commission also made the case that to adopt this approach
would disadvantage those with more intensive care needs, who over a
given period of time could spend significantly more on care than those
with less intensive needs, so that what we might gain in simplicity we
should lose in fairness.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T19:05:43"></hs_TimeCode> am sure that
we all want to see a fair care and support system giving the most
support to those in the greatest need. Using time instead of costs

noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, pointed to the understandable fear that Dilnot
will mean spending money on administration rather than on meeting
people’s needs. I accept that times are challenging for
councils, but we are committed to funding these reforms. Critically, we
are also committed to co-producing the implementation of the reforms to
minimise the bureaucracy that accompanies them and maximise the
benefits that they bring. The noble Lord suggested that local
authorities might not be ready to implement Dilnot in 2016, and the
noble Lord, Lord Hunt, also asked about this, and whether we were
intending to test the robustness of the system. We shall be coming to
the issue of readiness in the next group, but I agree with the noble

in this Chamber before about Dilnot, and his view that it is
fundamentally unfair. I simply say to him that the vast majority of
state support, under the Dilnot system, will be provided to the roughly
40% of older people with the lowest income and the lowest wealth. The
cap, and the extended means test, provide the most reassurance to that
particular group. Our view is that we need a system that protects
people with the greatest lifetime care needs. It is not about

clarify the question that the noble Lord, Lord Warner, raised in the

However, we do not think that guidance should be subject to
parliamentary scrutiny every time it is updated, as with a code of

as the current guidance issued under Section 7 of the Local Authority

However, I was reassured that the Local Government Association said

the announcement that we have made as a positive step forward in
tackling the challenges of an ageing society. Arising out of that is a

there is awareness and understanding of the implications of that

much if we do not understand what those facts mean or what their
implications are for you. That is why my amendment is slightly stronger

Amendment 104ZD in this group takes this a little further. The
Government agree with Dilnot’s view that communication is
fundamental to the success of the whole enterprise. If communication
fails, so will the new system. That is why, I assume, the Government
have made the very strong promise to maximise awareness. However, if it
is so important to maximise awareness, surely we need some clear
indication of the progress being made in maximising this awareness and
some indicators to show that, when awareness is in fact maximised, that
is where it stays. As it stands, Clause 66 proposes a
five-yearly review by the Secretary of State of the funding provisions,
and Clause 80 provides for reviews and performance assessments related
to care standards. However, there is no provision in the Bill for a
review of progress towards the Government’s goal of maximising
awareness of the Dilnot terms and their implications.</hs_para>

not an onerous requirement; it is the kind of thing that commercial
organisations do entirely as a matter of routine. However, even if it
were onerous, it would still be the right thing to do. It is vital that
we know how we are doing in maximising awareness and understanding, and
the amendment enables us to do that. I hope that the Minister will be

information task that we face here. This is not just a question of
advising individuals when they go to their councils, although that is
important and we have had a debate on that. It is a question of making
the whole of our society aware of what is going on against a background
of very great ignorance and misinformation. It is crucial that
something is done on a real scale to turn that around and that the best
communication skills are used in doing so. We have to move from the
language that we use in this Chamber as aficionados or geeks studying
the detail of the Bill to the general public out there, and that is a

speak to my Amendments 90D, 92ZZB, 92ZZC and 104ZC. Amendments 90D and
92ZZC relate to a topic that we touched on in the debate on the
previous amendment—namely, the costs and administrative
difficulties for local authorities of introducing the cap in the
scheme. The Local Government Association has expanded on the numerics
in the briefings for this debate, as has London Councils. I think that
the local authorities have a slight tendency to underplay what is going
on for fear that the Government will take the whole thing away from
them, and they want to be shown as “can do” rather than
“can’t do”. When you get into the detail, and look
below the politicians in local government at the fine detail of those
who have to implement it, you find that it is quite
difficult.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000124" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000124">The
Government have in principle accepted the burdens doctrine, namely that
if they make local government do something they will pay for it. They
have provided around £335 million to pay for that.
None<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> of this
extra money is coming now, by the way. The contributions will not start
until 2016. Bad though the administrative mess may be, if local
government does nothing to prepare for this scheme until
2016<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T19:20:09"></hs_TimeCode> it
will certainly fail. Already it is doubtful whether the burdens
scheme is really being met. Many of the costings put forward are
fingers in the air stuff. The detail has yet to be grappled with.
Details crucial to costing the implementation of the scheme, such as
the eligibility requirements, are only emerging bit by bit. We do not
even know what the government money is supposed to cover. Does it fund
in full the cost of additional self-assessments, when the self-funders
and people who will potentially benefit from Dilnot queue up for
assessments? I<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
really do not think that we know the detail of duties around advice and
information, on which we spoke earlier, or on the funding for setting
for up new deferred payment schemes.</hs_para>

to write into the Bill what is in effect the burdens doctrine. Whatever
the cost, the Government must pick it up. It is not as if local
authorities have got large chunks of money in their

<?notus-xml column=706?>pocket at the moment to reach in and pay for all
this stuff. They do not. They cannot afford basic care services at the

with whom I agree on nearly everything, agrees—that it was a
terrible mistake to bring forward the start of the scheme from 2017 to
2016. We know why it happened, do we not? The Government found that
they had a few spare quid in their pocket, and wanted to be able to
tell the electorate that Dilnot was nigh, and so without proper
consideration of any kind they brought the date forward. It was a
U-turn, and my amendment U-turns on the U-turn to get back to the right
place where they were to begin with, namely that the scheme will come
in in 2017. This would give it a good chance to

turn now to my other amendments in this group. I hope that we might
finally get an actual concession from the Minister, instead of words of
great sincerity and great sympathy and not much change. My other
amendments in this group refer to the setting up of a ministerial
advisory group on the cap and the means test. They insist that this
group should be consulted in the planned five-year review of
how all of this is working. This is not a criticism of the Department
of Health. I have been impressed by how effective officials have been
in grasping this scheme, particularly as for most of the time that
Dilnot was under consideration they probably thought that it was never
going to happen. They are a first-class team, but I do not think that
they possess a monopoly on wisdom, and indeed they do not think so,
either. The Minister just referred to the working parties with the
financial services sectors that have been set up to give advice. I
applaud that.</hs_para>

complexities in all of this that even the most literate advisers have

experts, local authority representatives, representatives of the
financial sector and someone from Dilnot. Maybe the noble Lord, Lord

We did not put them on local authorities. We did this because we
thought that unless the Government of the day—and this would
apply to a Labour Government as much as a coalition

the information and advice strategy, we would end up with a badly

to start to change that is for the Government to grasp the nettle. I

Campbell-Savours:</Member></B> My Lords, my noble friend refers to the
exhortations in the report to require the Government to carry out an
awareness exercise. However, the reality is that there has been a huge
spin on the whole Dilnot proposal. Many people, even those in care,
believe that as of the starting date, 2016, everyone who has already
spent something like £70,000 will suddenly receive free care. Of
course, that is not true. It only affects people who enter the care

is important to bear in mind the concern of my noble friend Lord

Lady Greengross. I have learnt over the past few months how complex
this issue is, and if noble Lords do not understand the full complexity
of the scheme—and I gladly hold my hand up that I have yet to

our debate on Clause 2, we discussed the responsibilities of local
authorities in providing advice and we debated the need for independent
financial advice to be made available. The consequences for a person
making the wrong decision on funding could be catastrophic. It is
therefore important that advice is readily available, and I agree with
those noble Lords who think that it ought to be a national
responsibility. Whether I would give it to the current Secretary of
State, I am not quite so
sure<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T19:33:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000142" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000142">I
remember how the Government spun this Bill in the Queen’s Speech
and the Prime Minister giving the impression that no one would for ever
more have to sell their home and that the £72,000 cap was the
limit. However, as we have gone through the Bill has become quite clear
that neither is the case. I agree with my noble friend Lord
Campbell-Savours that the Government have not thought through the
implications of what the noble Earl said last week about the issue of
transparency<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T19:34:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

point is that most people have to spend more than £72,000
because self-funders do not pay local authority rates. In his
sophisticated response last week, the noble Earl suggested that local
authorities took advantage of procurement at scale, which is why they
were able to get a rate lower than self-funders. That was a remarkable
argument. Most people see this as a case where local authorities
underpay and that if homes only existed under local authority rates
many of them would not be viable. It is therefore not surprising that
many homes are on a cliff edge of viability on the one hand and at risk
of being put out of business because of CQC inspections on the other.
There is no doubt that it is generally thought that self-funders
subsidise the people in those homes who are paid for by the local
authority<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T19:35:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000144" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000144">However,
most people do not know that. Only an inside circle is aware of the
issue. However, come the new implementation, everyone will
know—as the noble Earl said last week, it will be
transparent—and people will not put up with it. That is why,
first, it is essential that more thought is given to implementation. I
am not sure whether my noble friend Lord Lipsey is right to want to
delay it by a year, but I am sure that he is right to say to the
Government that they need to look carefully at the practicalities of
implementation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T19:36:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

important that self-funders are in future fully aware of the
consequences of any decisions they take. At the moment, I and many
other noble Lords are not convinced that the public are aware. That is
why it is so important that a duty is laid on Ministers to fund, and
continue to fund, a national campaign of information and that we come
back to our debates on Clause 2 in relation to independent advice being
made
available.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000146" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000146">Thirdly,
I hope that the noble Earl will readily accept the amendment of my

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, the clauses on the capped-costs system
represent a significant step forward, ending decades of uncertainty,
with the introduction of a clear system that fairly shares costs. For
the first time, people will be protected from spiralling costs and will
no longer have to fear that their home will be sold while
they are in a care home. In response to Amendment 90ZA, I
can confirm that we published an impact assessment of the reforms which
includes the distributional impact by
income<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T19:38:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000149" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000149">The
current system exposes those with little savings or modest housing
wealth to the greatest risk of losing everything to pay for their care
and support. We will enable people to keep more of their capital and
still 
<?notus-xml column=710?>receive a contribution from the local authority towards their
residential care costs. Under new regulations, those with capital
assets of less than £118,000 will see the local authority pay a
proportion of their residential care costs rather than only those with
assets of under
£23,250<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T19:39:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000150" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000150">As
I mentioned earlier, the vast majority of state support will be
provided to the 40% of older people with the lowest income and wealth.
The cap and extension to means-tested support provides the most
reassurance to this group. This is about protecting people with the
greatest lifetime care needs and not people with the greatest wealth.
The reforms must be sustainable and affordable for the long term,
which is why we have accepted the Dilnot commission’s
recommendation that the level of the cap should be adjusted annually in
line with inflation. It is an approach used in taxes, pensions and
benefits, ensuring they remain equally fair year after
year.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000151" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000151">I turn
to amendments 92ZZB, 92ZZC and 104ZC. The noble Lord, Lord Lipsey,
shares our aim in drawing up the Care Bill of ensuring the system can
respond to changing circumstances. However, that dynamism must be
balanced with some certainty about the basis for changes. That is why
Clause 16 requires annual adjustments to be made to the cap and to an
adult’s accrued costs, so that they keep pace with inflation.
Clause 66 provides some certainty that changes are likely to occur only
as a result of the annual adjustment or five-yearly review. In
reviewing the level of the cap and the means-test threshold, the
Government will want to involve a range of experts in assessing how
external factors such as demographic change and healthy life expectancy
are affecting affordability and the benefits of the capped costs
system. A standing independent committee is therefore unnecessary and
could suggest that the system is subject to constant
change—which may, perversely, result in fewer people planning
and preparing on the basis of these
reforms.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000152" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000152">Amendments
90A, 90B and 90C would require the annual adjustment to be made in line
with average care costs. The first point to make is that there is no
nationally recognised measure for care costs inflation. Linking the
annual adjustment to a care costs inflation measure that has no
national benchmark would not give people, or the financial services
industry, certainty or confidence in the system. It would of course be
possible to develop such a measure, but we feel it is unnecessary, as a
robust proxy already exists. Average earnings is one element of the
measures used to determine the state pension and therefore represent
changes in people’s ability to pay. Earnings is a national
statistic certified as compliant with the code of practice for official
statistics. In addition, care costs and average earnings are related
since labour is a substantial proportion of the cost of care. The
latest Laing &amp; Buisson market survey states
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="130716115000315" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000315">“in

to Amendments 89E, 90 and 104ZD, which is where my noble friend Lord
Sharkey began this debate, I fully agree that it is critical that
people are made aware of the reforms and what they will mean. The
Dilnot commission rightly recommended that there should be an exercise
in raising awareness alongside 
<?notus-xml column=711?>implementation of the reforms. Many people do not realise that they may
have to pay for their care and support, which acts as a significant
barrier to effective planning and prevention. The Committee will be
aware from the debate on Clause 4 that we know that easier access to
good quality, trusted information and advice is a critical enabler. The
Bill places a duty on local authorities to provide information and
advice, including on the capped cost
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000154" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000154">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T19:43:40"></hs_TimeCode>
assure the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, that we have absolutely
no intention to or interest in allowing spin to replace clear and
balanced information for the public. In improving awareness and advice,
national and local must work together. It will be in the interests of
local authorities, the public, government and the financial services
industry to make sure that people are aware of the reforms and have
access to the right information and advice at the right time so that
they can plan and prepare to meet their care and support needs. We will
seek views in the forthcoming consultation on the design and technical
implementation of the funding reforms, which will include addressing

noble friend Lord Sharkey made the good point that awareness and
understanding of the Dilnot reforms has to be evaluated and measured
over time. As with any other policy, we will seek to evaluate the
effectiveness of this particular policy, but we believe that to require

unnecessary cost. There are other ways of delivering the same

respect to Amendments 90D and 92ZZC, I recognise that alighting on a
solution to the long-standing issue of funding reform should not mean
that we sacrifice effective implementation for speed of delivery. There
must be a suitable balance, but that does not mean that we cannot
deliver in April 2016. We are working closely with the key
representatives of the care sector to shape the consultation over the
summer on the detail of implementation to make sure we get it right and
realise the benefits we all want to see. There is a shared
understanding that we need to work together to address the
implementation challenges. However, the capped cost system builds on
what already exists—assessments and personal budgets are two
elements that will form the building blocks of capped cost
implementation. It is worth adding that government guidance requires
all new burdens on local authorities to be fully funded. Alongside the
funding that we have announced for the reforms at implementation, we
are providing additional funding for transition to ensure that councils
are ready to take on their new responsibilities from April

trivial. I may be wrong about that, but I should be very grateful if

understand what a percentage is—even that may be an
overstatement—and Dilnot’s implications are much more
complicated than that. We need the best communication with the most

McConnell of Glenscorrodale:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful for
the opportunity this evening to lead this short debate and to pose some
questions to the Government about the situation in the eastern DRC. I
am also particularly grateful, on such a sunny summer’s evening,
to the Minister and other noble Lords for volunteering to speak on this
topic. I should record my role as the chair of the All-Party
Parliamentary Group on the Great Lakes Region of Africa, partly because
it was in that role that I recently had the opportunity to visit both
the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda as part of a parliamentary
delegation from the United Kingdom.</hs_para>

debate, I thought that it would be timely, partly as a result of that
delegation visit, which took place at the end of May, and partly
because I spent last week in Burundi at the regional conference on
women, peace, security and development in the Great Lakes region at the
invitation of the new UN special envoy, Mary Robinson. However, this
debate has become even more timely with the events of the last 48, or
perhaps 72, hours. There has been renewed fighting in the eastern DRC,
not just in one area but across much of the region and involving, it
appears, many different groups. Publicity this week will no doubt focus
on the clashes between the M23 and the FARDC—the Congolese
army—which now appear to be battling outside Goma, yet again,
for control of parts of that area. Fighting appears to have begun at
the weekend, involving a group called the ADF, which is at least
alleged to be mainly made up of Ugandan-based rebels and which appears
to have some links with Islamist extremists from elsewhere in the
continent.</hs_para>

growing trend over recent weeks, which again appears to have been shown
over the weekend, for the FDLR—a former Rwandan rebel
group—and other smaller groups to use the fact that the main
focus appears to be on the M23 around Goma to execute all kinds of
attacks on local villages. There have been kidnaps and in some cases
rapes and deaths. Yet again today we see an outbreak of accusation and
counter-accusation from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwandan
Governments, which will no doubt heighten tensions in the area and in
the region as a whole. I have received a series of e-mails over recent
days documenting the horrors that this means on the ground for local
people who are living in small communities. To be honest, they are too
painful to read out tonight.</hs_para>

has, as a whole, seen incredible conflict over the past 20 to 25 years.
The eastern DRC is not the only area affected. There is the Central
African Republic and the long-standing campaign for 
<?notus-xml column=714?>independence in South Sudan, with conflict
continuing even after that independence has been achieved. There is the
terrible civil war in Burundi and the horrific genocides in Rwanda, the
20th anniversary of which is next year. In and around the DRC itself,
there is what has been described as Africa’s world war, in which
over 5 million people have died in the past 15 years or so. The whole
region is affected by each of these conflicts in turn, but tonight I
want to concentrate on the situation in the eastern
DRC.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000168" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000168">This
area, and indeed the whole country and the region, is populated
by wonderful people. It has incredible resources and a beautiful
landscape, but the poverty, violence and hopelessness at its core has
been debilitating, as anybody who has visited or studied the region
over recent years knows, while other parts of the continent have grown
and prospered. Lives have been ruined and opportunities are being
wasted on an incredible scale. That is why we, as the United Kingdom,
need to continue to be interested in what is happening
there.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000169" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000169">Last
year, a group called the M23 broke off, as we know, from the official
Congolese army and eventually overtook the capital of the area, Goma.
There are allegations against that group, the Congolese army and others
for the way in which the conflict in 2012 was conducted. The UN failed
to protect Goma. More than £8 billion has been spent on the UN
peacekeeping force over the past 14 years, yet it has continually
failed to contain and deal with these conflicts at the local
level.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="130716115000170" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000170">In
2013, however, there have been what might be seen in the context of the
region as quite dramatic developments. On 24 February, a peace,
security and development framework for the whole region was signed by
all 11 heads of state in the Great Lakes region and by four supporting
multilateral institutions: the International Conference on the Great
Lakes Region, the African Union, the United Nations and the Southern
African Development Community. Subsequent to that, on 28 March the UN
Security Council passed Resolution 2098, which updated the mandate of
MONUSCO in the region but also called for and started to put in place a
regional intervention brigade, which for the first time in UN history
will have the specific job of dealing with combatants at local level to
try to secure peace for local people. It also bravely
appointed the first ever woman special envoy in this area for
the United Nations, Mrs Mary Robinson, the former President of Ireland.
She has begun her work and, as I said, I was with her in
Burundi last week.</hs_para>

focused on this area, we met President Kabila and senior Ministers from
both Rwanda and the DRC. We met human rights campaigners,
parliamentarians and senior officials in the UN. We also met a
significant number of former combatants from the M23. This visit has
indicated a number of things to me. First, the anger and suspicion in
the area continue on all sides and are deep-rooted, but there is,
perhaps for the first time, some hope that this regional framework can
make a difference. There are at least public, formal commitments from
everybody involved to work with the new framework. The President of
Burundi reinforced that when I met him last week in
Bujumbura.</hs_para>

has been slow in implementing the details of the new framework, perhaps
especially in relation to the peace talks presided over by President
Museveni in Kampala. However, the UN has put in place the regional
intervention brigade and Mary Robinson is in place and being very
active. Her appointment has been welcomed by almost everybody in the
region as someone whom they can trust. She has said that it is time to
do things differently, by trying to implement a bottom-up approach to
peace as well as a top-down approach, and in particular by trying to
involve women in a way that is so needed, as was of course highlighted
by UN Security Council Resolution
1325.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000173" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000173">The DRC
Government have at long last started to pursue, in a more determined
fashion, security sector reform and genuine dialogue between different
groups. Oversight mechanisms are starting to be put in place and
improvements in governance are at least promised. However, this peace,
security and development framework has not just national
recommendations and commitments but regional and international ones,
and it is to them I want to turn in my questions.</hs_para>

series of conflicts involving identity, land, fear, greed and power.
These different emotions and elements of history cross borders in this
region perhaps more than anywhere else in the world. We need to see
implementation and determination on national, regional and
international commitments. Inside the DRC there needs to be real reform
and genuine improvements in governance, including decentralisation.
We need a balanced, negotiated political
approach that ensures that everybody has a stake in the
future. We need a regional context that will help to bring peer
pressure and, I hope, economic progress to the area. Women must be much
more involved than they have ever been before in these discussions and
efforts across the whole
region.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000175" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000175">I
want to ask the Minister some questions quickly within the time
allocated. First, as this is a unique opportunity, perhaps a
once-in-a-generation one, to see some progress, how strong is the
Government’s support for this regional peace process and what
actions have we taken to secure its success? Secondly, what actions
have we taken to support the new UN special envoy, Mrs Robinson, and
what discussions have taken place with her? Thirdly, do the Government
have an update on the peace talks in Kampala, which appeared until
recently to have stalled and whose stalling may have triggered some of
the violence at the weekend? Fourthly, do the Government have an update
on the events of the past few days and a response and reaction to
them?</hs_para>

Government agree that there is a need for a regional approach not just
by the 11 states of the Great Lakes region and the African Union as a
whole, but also by the British Government, other major European and
North American donors and the European Union? Can we do more to
integrate our diplomatic and development efforts across the region,
taking a regional approach to our development decisions and our
diplomacy? Can we use the European Union more? Can we integrate our
various initiatives, including the Foreign Secretary’s admirable
Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict initiative, and can we review
the 
<?notus-xml column=716?>decisions on aid to Rwanda and Burundi to secure
their greater enthusiasm for this approach? The killing, rapes, fear
and incredible violence against women and children in particular have
gone on in this area for far too long. Along with others, we have been
too inconsistent in our attention to this matter in the past. I hope
that we can use this opportunity to say that we will be consistent and
determined to see this through to an end that might actually bring some
hope to the people of a land that has suffered for too long.</hs_para>

Chalker of Wallasey:</Member></B> I thank the noble Lord, Lord
McConnell of Glenscorrodale, for asking for this debate. It could not
be more timely. Anything that we can do to halt the conflict in the
eastern region of the DRC and its wider ramifications—as I will
mention—needs to be done. I thank him, too, for the visit that
he has made, because not many people have gone across this
territory—with some fear, I have to be honest—in many
years. The eastern Congo area is not a specific concern of my company,
Africa Matters Ltd, at this time but I declare an ongoing interest in
the whole of sub-Saharan Africa, as stated in the register of
interests, and I am an unpaid or volunteer chairman of that
company.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="130716115000178" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000178">My
first journey to the Congo was in 1986—a very long while ago. I
made other trips in the late 1980s. My first time in eastern Congo was
in 1994 after the flood of refugees out of Rwanda following the
genocide. One thing undeclared at the beginning of that was
the number of ordinary people suffering from death and
disease, not just in the camps but over a far wider region.
Kinshasa, Kigali and until recently Kampala have not really focused on
what this is doing to ordinary people who could otherwise be productive
in agriculture or small business and making a change in those areas of
Africa.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="130716115000179" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000179">I
want to say a word or two about the developing refugee problem. I hope
that the Minister will be able to give us some of the detail of what I
know Britain is already doing through DfID and non-governmental
organisations in the area. There are literally hundreds fleeing every
hour into neighbouring countries, mainly women, children and the
elderly. Mary Robinson’s comment, to which the noble Lord
referred, that it is time to do things differently caused me to wish to
speak in this debate.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="130716115000180" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000180">Two days ago, in
addition to more than 210,000 registered refugees and asylum seekers in
neighbouring counties, 63% of whom came from the DRC, a further 66,000
refugees had fled into the western part of Uganda. Today, Congolese
government forces have attacked the M23 rebels near Goma and this is,
as the noble Lord said, the third day of heavy fighting, causing
hundreds more still to flee their homes. It is right that the UN should
now be deploying the 3,000-strong intervention force of South African,
Tanzanian and Malawian troops, patrolling and not yet in combat role.
The new mandate may help, although it could hinder, because it will
allow UN forces to attack if rebels continue to attack local
populations. We hope that we will see some progress under the new
mandate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000181" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000181">However,
progress in stopping fighting is not going to be sufficient to sort out
the immense problems in the region. I am quite certain that the UN
would now 
<?notus-xml column=717?>block any attack on Goma, but that comes long after
a period of waiting to see what would happen. If there is one
thing that I ask my noble friend on the Front Bench, it is that we stop
waiting to see what happens and, with others in the Security Council,
ensure that Mary Robinson and others in the field have all the support
that they need to make a difference.</hs_para>

reported that three Congolese government helicopters were in the area
and were attacking the rebels in the town of Kibati, about four
kilometres north of Goma. Congolese government forces are pushing
rebels back to wherever those rebels come from, but there have been
further attacks and so the churn of new refugees increases hour by
hour. I know that, on Monday, rebels and the Congolese government
troops traded mortar fire again in the north. This is happening not in
a mining area, as some would have us believe, but in inhabited
areas.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="130716115000183" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000183">That
is what I wish to underline in this debate. Over the past 20 years,
millions have died from violence, disease, wounds and hunger. Whoever
is arming the rebels is prolonging the unrest. What do the British
Government know about the sources of the weaponry and the other means
by which the rebel forces are prolonging the campaigns against ordinary
people? One of the past failures in the area has been to communicate
with people on the ground the reality of what they are doing. There is
a need for a tougher line to explain to the rebels and to others who
may be drawn into the conflict exactly where this is leading. I
for one have deep fears about what is happening.</hs_para>

hope my noble friend will pursue is the question of how people are
recruited into the M23 or any other rebel groups. There must be some
knowledge in the UN of exactly how people are recruited. It is not
happening by accident. They may be recruited from border areas of
neighbouring countries without the permission or blessing of those
Governments. I am well aware that the Government of Rwanda have
declared that they do not assist the M23, but if Rwandan
people—and I do not just mean Tutsis who may happen to be in
eastern Congo but are citizens of Rwanda—are turning up among
the rebel forces, it must be for the Governments on both sides of the
border to take action about those who are crossing simply to perpetuate
the violence and
warfare.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000185" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000185">This
is causing a real refugee crisis for the neighbours. The only way in
which we can be of maximum help is by taking the sort of action that we
took years ago, with clear direction, in Sierra Leone under
General Sir David Richards. We need to give a lead to the UN
troops about how they deal with this continuing insurrection because,
unless we and others who have the ability to make the change do so,
Mary Robinson’s task will be
impossible.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_16_PT_1/E10F0B8011B2B131A391340137B5EEE8950FF35F" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 16 July 2013">Tuesday,

National Electoral Commission—CENI—has been under
scrutiny since before the 2011 general elections. Prior to the
election, I and a small team of parliamentarians met CENI in Kinshasa.
Its main objective seemed to be to present an election funding and
facilitating wish list beyond reason. We were not impressed. It may be
that the mission that visited in May, which the noble Lord, Lord
McConnell, described, has better news, and I look forward to
seeing its report in due course.</hs_para>

society sees revision of CENI as just one step in a wider process of
reform of electoral institutions. A review of the electoral roll, the
redefinition of constituencies and improving and supporting civic
education are all on the urgent agenda. According to the constitution,
the president should not be able to run for a third term but, having
amended the constitution in 2011 to reduce the presidential election to
just one round, many anticipate Kabila being tempted into further
amendments to give himself a third term.</hs_para>

commentators are slowly coming to the conclusion that there is little
to show for all the peacekeeping missions, special envoys, inter-agency
processes and diplomatic initiatives in the failed state that is the
DRC. Since Mobutu’s removal from power in 1997, probably more
than 5 million people have died in the DRC through civil war, massacre
and criminal activities. The DRC is second only to Somalia in the
failed states index. It is last in the UN Human Development Index, last
in GDP per capita, behind even Somalia and South Sudan, and very close
to bottom of the Transparency International’s corruption
perceptions index.</hs_para>

world’s largest recipient of international assistance after
Afghanistan, yet there is still no effective governmental structure
serving the needs of the two-thirds of the population—60 million
people—who live outside Kinshasa’s area of influence. To
DfID’s credit, it has launched a humanitarian development aid
programme from 2011-15 which, if the security situation allows, will
begin to make a difference to the people of the DRC.</hs_para>

November 2012, the M23 rebel group, which is thought to be backed by
Rwanda, seemingly walked past MONUSCO troops and occupied Goma, North
Kivu’s provincial capital. A few days later, their point made,
the rebels melted back into the forest. This March, fighters of the
Mai-Mai Bakata Katanga entered the DRC’s second largest city,
Lubumbashi, clashed with government forces and then surrendered,
harking back to events in the 1960s when Katanga province broke away
from the Congolese state. The latest report from a UN group of experts
given the role of gathering and analysing relevant information on flows
of arms and networks operating in violation of the embargo on the DRC
has to date found no evidence of support for the M23 rebels from
Uganda. However, it has evidence of limited and continuous support to
the M23 from within Rwanda. When my noble friend the Minister responds,
will she say what impact the continuous outbreaks of violence are
having on DfID’s programme for
2011-15?</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000194" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000194">The
UN Panel of Experts report goes into great detail about the changes in
leadership of the M23 and the rivalry between indicted war criminal
General Bosco Ntaganda and his deputy Sultani Makenga. Their struggles
led to a split in the M23 and, ultimately, to military confrontations
and the surrender of Bosco Ntaganda. Supplied with arms in exchange for
gold and ivory gained from poaching activities in many parts of the
DRC, the M23 are now thought to have some 1,500 soldiers spread over an
area of 700 square kilometres. Yet the authorities have been slow to
recognise the dangers in the current situation, given Katanga’s
pivotal prominence in the region’s economy. Meanwhile, Joseph
Kony now has a window in which to regroup his repugnant LRA in the
Central Africa Republic that could soon spread again to the DRC. This
could well reverse the gains made in quelling the rebellion in the
region which, with the help of US advisers based in Uganda, cut attacks
by half. There is a real concern that, with this mission currently on
hold, attacks will build again. Can my noble friend the Minister shed
some light on when this US-supported mission is likely to
recommence?</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000195" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000195">As
part of the strategic review of MONUSCO included in the peace, security
and co-operation framework for the region, the UN Security
Council’s resolution 2098 provides, as noble Lords have
mentioned, for a brigade of over 3,000 troops drawn from Tanzania,
South Africa and Malawi. At last, MONUSCO has been given a more
offensive mandate, providing for targeted and robust offensives with a

MONUSCO senior staff I met in Goma would have been mightily pleased at
the strengthening of their mandate. However, the emphasis on civilian
protection will be hard to achieve. I met a group of five women in a
church hall in Goma who had come to tell us how they had suffered
multiple rapes at the hands of soldiers: whether they were rebels or
army was not clear. They carefully and earnestly explained the details
of their suffering. One had had a toddler snatched from her arms and
butchered in front of her

Ki-Moon has made it clear that the UN brigade is only one element of a
much larger process. The peace deal has to deliver a peace dividend:
health, education, jobs and opportunity. Can my noble friend tell the
House where the allocation of additional resources needed to support
the implementation of the peace, security and co-operation framework is
to be made? What is the Government’s assessment of the military
and logistics capability and capacity of the 3,000-strong UN brigade to
take on and eliminate the 20 to 40 guerrilla groups
consistently wreaking havoc across North Kivu and South Kivu alone?
What does my noble friend believe has been learnt from the UN
operations in 2009 that were intended to enable the government to
regain control of the region? Finally, what plans are in place
to prevent a repeat of armed groups being chased away to be immediately
replaced by new ones, resulting in more displacement of civilians,

Collins of Highbury:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, thank my noble

experience in the DRC brings a terrific insight to the debate and
highlights some of the issues to which all noble Lords have
referred.</hs_para>

period of relative stability and closer security co-operation between
the DRC and Rwanda, the political and security situation in eastern DRC
has once again worsened during the past year. As my noble friend
described, it commenced with an armed rebellion by a breakaway militia
from the DRC army—the M23 group—which, as we have heard,
has close links with Rwanda and which seized the regional capital of
Goma.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000200" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000200">As my
noble friend and the noble Lord, Lord Chidgey, have highlighted, this
happened despite the presence of the largest UN peacekeeping force
anywhere in the world, consisting of 17,000 troops. When tested, on
this occasion and others, the force has unfortunately failed to
maintain security and to protect the civilian population. As the noble
Lord, Lord Chidgey, has just said, the humanitarian impact of conflict
is huge and women, in particular, have suffered atrocious sexual
violence which continues to occur with impunity. As the noble Baroness,
Lady Chalker, has said, the <I>Guardian</I> reported today that some
66,000 Congolese refugees were pouring across the border to Uganda
after a surprise attack by the Islamist ADF.</hs_para>

Lord McConnell highlighted, fresh fighting erupted near Goma on Monday
when, according to the residents, more than 100 armed men, disguised in
women’s clothing, entered the country from Rwanda. Like my noble
friend, I ask the Minister what the Government’s immediate
response is to these recent events.</hs_para>

eastern DRC requires radical security-sector reform, a political
settlement and a focus, as my noble friend highlighted, on long-term
development assistance. As the noble Baroness,  
<?notus-xml column=721?>Lady Chalker, said, there is no doubt that Rwanda
should immediately cease its interference in the east of the
DRC. However, the DRC cannot continue to blame Rwanda for all its
problems. It needs to tackle its serious governance issues. I, too,
recognise the terrific role that DfID has played in the DRC in the most
challenging of circumstances. The UK is one of the largest donors to
the DRC and should be taking a leading role in the east, including
setting up a DfID office in Goma; that was discussed in 2009 but never
delivered<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T20:24:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000203" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000203">We
need to start to address the key structural causes of poverty and
underdevelopment across the world. I welcome many of the initiatives
that the Prime Minister has announced. However, those issues are
nowhere more pertinent than in the DRC. As my noble friend Lord
McConnell said, it is crucial that the international community supports
the implementation of the peace, security and co-operation framework
initiative, which attempts to bring stability and prosperity to the
eastern DRC. Only a coherent strategy that combines security, a
regional political process and a development focused on the long term
has the possibility of achieving sustainable
change<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T20:24:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000204" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000204">First,
radical, not superficial, reform of the security sector is necessary.
The police and army need to be professionalised and properly paid. As
we have heard, the UN’s MONUSCO force is unable to act
sufficiently effectively at the most critical of times. Secondly, there
needs to be a genuine political process between the DRC, Rwanda and
their neighbours to negotiate a political settlement for the long term
and to ensure that it is implemented by all parties; and, as the noble
Baroness, Lady Chalker, said, to ensure that all parties are held
accountable. The new framework and the role of Mary Robinson are
undoubtedly crucial to this.</hs_para>

a shared strategy from the Government and donors is necessary for the
country to move from humanitarian and emergency assistance, vital
though that is, to sustainable economic and social development. This
will have to include new governance arrangements and transparency to
ensure that the benefits of the rich natural resources of that country
are no longer lost to corruption. For this to happen, first and
foremost, as the noble Lord, Lord Chidgey, so ably highlighted, there
needs to be a functioning DRC Government and state. Many of the
political party representatives desire to rebuild the country, promote
peace and rebuild their national economy. However, over many years the
Government have failed to deliver any significant progress on these
objectives<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T20:26:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

crisis of legitimacy and leadership. The most urgent task is to
organise local and provincial elections, which the noble Lord referred
to, which have been delayed since 2006. With the next presidential
election due in 2016, the international community must make it very
clear that any attempt by President Kabila to change the constitution
to extend his mandate will be unacceptable and will lead to a strong
response<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T20:27:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000207" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000207">I
also have questions for the Minister, but perhaps rather than simply
repeating those which have already been asked, I will ask: given the
concerns over the last presidential election, what are the Government
doing in conjunction with the European Union, the African 
<?notus-xml column=722?>Union and the US to help ensure that the Kinshasa
Government are more representative? What are the Government doing to
secure a more legitimate mandate for the Government of the DRC from the
people of that country? I hope that the Minister will be able to
respond to the immediate concerns that noble Lords have raised, but
also to focus on what my noble friend Lord McConnell described at the
beginning of this debate—the longer-term sustainable development

eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo has been subject to cycles of
conflict for many years, and more than 5 million people have lost their
lives as a result. Its people have suffered too much and for too long.

noble Lord, Lord McConnell, and my noble friend Lady Chalker referred
to the ongoing tension, but also to the recent increase in fighting.
The actions of the ADF-NALU militia have driven tens of thousands of
refugees into Uganda, and the ongoing fighting between the M23 and the
DRC army are, of course, concerning. This is an appalling
record—more concerning in recent times—and it cannot be
allowed to continue. We have urged all sides to show restraint and all
militia groups to lay down their arms. We have heard reports of

a window of opportunity. First, the signing of the UN-brokered peace,
security and co-operation framework—the PSCF—in February
marked a moment where 11 regional countries, including the DRC and
Rwanda, came together to sign up to commitments which, if implemented,
will lead to peaceful co-operation and economic integration across the
whole region. This agreement was also signed by four organisations: the
UN, the African Union, the Southern African Development Community and
the International Conference on the Great Lakes
Region.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000214" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000214">For

decentralisation, building economic development, and further structural
reform of public institutions—the long-term developments needed
for stability<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T20:31:54"></hs_TimeCode>.
The DRC’s neighbours have committed to respect their
neighbours’ sovereignty and territorial integrity. They have
also committed to neither tolerate nor assist armed groups, to
strengthen regional co-operation, and to refrain from harbouring or
protecting anyone accused of war crimes or crimes against humanity. The
PSCF is a great example of the region coming together, with the
support of the international community, to agree to the principle of
peace and a way forward to make it
happen.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000215" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000215">Secondly,
there was the appointment in March of Mary Robinson as the UN special

welcome, in particular, the noble Lord’s recent visit to

could play in implementing the PSCF. The noble Lord also asked about
contacts. Foreign Office Ministers have been in contact with Mary
Robinson, both in person and by phone, and I understand that the
Minister for Africa saw her in London about three weeks ago. He
underlined to her the UK’s support for her role, and offered to
consider any requests for practical assistance that she may

there is the new mandate for MONUSCO peacekeepers. While protection of
civilians remains the core principle of the peacekeeping operation,
this mandate also, for the first time in the UN’s history,
includes an intervention brigade—the FIB—with a specific
task of preventing the expansion of, and neutralising, armed groups in
eastern DRC. We have welcomed the deployment of the FIB, which we feel
will act in support of the PSCF. We hope that it will help to bring a
period of stability to eastern DRC to allow reform and peace-building
to take root<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T20:34:10"></hs_TimeCode>.
The mandate also allows for the use of unmanned aerial
systems—another first for a UN peacekeeping mandate. Given the

this process has been somewhat irregular, and the talks alone cannot
achieve a sustainable peace in eastern DRC, they have a part to play in
the wider peace process. The confluence of these events, with the
military track in support of political and development efforts,
provides an opportunity to achieve lasting stability in eastern DRC,
for the cycle of violence to finally be broken, and for the terrible
human rights abuses that have afflicted the people of that region to
end.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000219" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0002.htm#130716115000219">Of<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T20:35:02"></hs_TimeCode>

DRC are many and various, and often deeply entrenched, so we do
not claim that resolving conflict there will be easy or quick. It will
require the sustained effort of the signatories to the PSCF, which
contains some hefty commitments. It is important that all signatories
fulfil these commitments—for the DRC to carry out significant
reform of its security sector, for example, and for the other
signatories, including Rwanda, to respect the sovereignty of their
neighbours and refrain from supporting armed groups. It is equally
important that all signatories work together for the potential peace

Governments and the international community must work relentlessly to

comparison in terms of size is that of the whole of western
Europe—and in the east there are areas of seemingly impenetrable
forest with very limited roads, communications and infrastructure. We
know that there are deeply entrenched problems to overcome, but the
framework for peace is in place and, with the commitment of the
Governments of the region and the support of the international
community, real progress can be made; progress that will be felt by
communities and people across the DRC, so that the many who have waited

Lipsey:</Member></B> My Lords, this has been a great test of my filing
system, which fortunately has stood up to it on this occasion. Each of
these three amendments in my name is entire of itself and could be
passed on its own, but they are designed as a package. Taking them
individually to start with, they would do three things: first, to make
the tariff for the means test proposed by the Government less
draconian; secondly, to increase the allowance given to people helped
through the means test to pay for their personal expenses; and thirdly,
by abolishing overtime of current nursing care allowance to pay for
both the above and leave some money over for better care
services<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T20:51:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

thinking. I am a supporter of Dilnot—at the margin, I disagree
with my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours on this. I do not regard
Dilnot as perfect, but I regard the distribution of ill effect, which I
quite agree with him exists, as a small price to pay for the advantages
of Dilnot, namely the danger that people quite at random are chosen to
be wiped out financially. So I support Dilnot’s scheme. However,
I am, as my noble friend is, aware of its defects. The plain
fact—Dilnot is perfectly clear about this—is that it
helps only one lot of people and not another lot of people. The
Minister quoted figures about who benefits from the system as a whole
before the dinner break, but the reality is that, under Dilnot, the
poorest gain nothing from a cap; they are paid for by means-tested
benefits anyway. Nearly all the benefits go to better-off people. That
is a serious defect and it is very expensive—not as expensive
with the cap at £72,000 as it would have been under
Dilnot’s original proposals, but very expensive. This means that
it will compete in practice with another set of problems, namely the
sheer lack of resources going into long-term care, a short-fall that is
getting worse as the number of older people rises and which will go on
getting worse as the demographics described in the House’s
report on the ageing population continue. So we have a serious
problem<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T20:53:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000231" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0003.htm#130716115000231">The
package is not designed to take apart the fundamental architecture of
Dilnot. It does not take from anyone a single penny that they would
gain under Dilnot. It is designed to spread the benefits 
<?notus-xml column=727?>more widely, all without increasing public spending by a single penny.
Is that magic? Your Lordships will be the judge of that.</hs_para>

is the easy bit, I am afraid, and I apologise to the House for any
lapses in techno-speak in the words that
follow<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T20:54:10"></hs_TimeCode>. The
first amendment refers to the tariff. I will explain briefly what the
tariff is, because it is not altogether familiar. Suppose that you are
above the minimum threshold for the tariff, which is around
£14,000 at the moment, and you have some assets. For every
£250 in assets, you lose £1 a week in benefit, about
£50 a year—the equivalent of an assumed 20% return on
your capital. That continues under the present system until you reach
the £23,250 cap for the means test, but will continue under the
Government’s proposals in 2016 until £118,000 is reached,
the top level of the cap. You are fined £1 a week for every
£250 that you have in assets. If you start applying that to the
government system you discover something that has been virtually
unremarked upon in the Dilnot proposals. Although the Government are,
in theory, raising the upper limit to £118,000, the fact is that
someone with £118,000 in assets will gain virtually nothing
under the changed means test. That is for two reasons.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="130716115000233" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0003.htm#130716115000233">First, once you start
to claim local authority help with your care, you stop receiving
attendance allowance four weeks later. Indeed, according to Philip
Spiers of the old persons’ charity, FirstStop, many people with
£100,000 or more in assets, if they were properly advised, would
be worse off, not better off, if they claimed local authority support,
because they would lose £79.15 a week in the higher rate of
attendance allowance, or around £87 when inflated to 2016-17
prices. In other words, the apparent cap for means testing under the
Dilnot proposals is actually much lower because you do not need much in
assets<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T20:56:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="130716115000234" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0003.htm#130716115000234">The second thing is
that the tariff is ripping into your entitlement. Suppose that you are
in a home where the fees are £400 a week—if you live up
north, and that is what the local authority allows. Say, for example,
you have £100,000 in assets above the lower threshold. It is not
nothing, but it is not a large amount. On £100,000, the tariff
will amount to virtually all the benefits you get under the means test.
There you are, getting quite excited because the Government have
improved the means test to help you, but you suddenly find that they
have not. You will notice that this feature of the Dilnot proposals was
not emphasised by either Andrew Dilnot or government proposals. That is
a cruel system to confiscate the wealth of people who have only a
little bit of it. If the Bill goes through with this feature intact, I
predict that we are laying the basis for disappointment and even anger
among a generation of older people and their families—people of
modest means—who deserve something
better<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T20:57:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

tariff less harsh. Instead of losing £1 for every £250 in
assets, you lose £1 for every £500. According to
estimates by Ruth Hancock of the University of East Anglia and her
colleagues at the PSSRU, the substitution of a £500 tariff for
the current £250 would cost around £150 million in public
expenditure. That is element one of the
package<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T20:58:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

<?notus-xml column=728?><hs_para UID="130716115000236" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0003.htm#130716115000236">I
am sorry, but this will take a while because I have three amendments
wrapped together. The second component of the amendments is the
increase in the personal requirements allowance. It deals with a nasty
feature of a very nasty means test. I think that Dilnot himself said
that it was the nastiest means test in Britain. If you are on the means
test for your care home fees, you are left with just £23.90 a
week for all your personal needs. Perhaps you want to give your child
or grandchild a birthday present, buy cosmetics or some little
comforts, a few sweeties, or even pay for taxis to the doctor when you
cannot get about. All that comes out of £23.90 a week. That is
not a rich reward for the poorest people in our society to be left with
at the end, many of whom have worked long and hard. My amendment raises
that to £32.75. That figure, I hasten to add, is completely
arbitrary. It is because it costs the same—£150
million—as the change in the tariff. It helps the poorest among
us. Thus I have one proposal that helps people of modest means, and one
proposal that helps the poorest people. All it means is that they get a
smallish share of the goodies handed out by Dilnot to the better
off.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_16_PT_1/F06C440D5F56E813E6FDF175626115E4EEA2ED53" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 16 July 2013">Tuesday,

is the nursing care allowance? It is paid to people in care homes at
one of two rates, irrespective of their means, to contribute towards
the provision of services which can come only from a registered
nurse. According to the Minister’s answer to a recent
Parliamentary Question, nursing care allowance costs some £540
million now, and it will rise again by 2016. The saving from abolishing
it would be slightly less, since there would be some additional
means-tested spending—not much, according to
PSSRU<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T21:01:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000239" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0003.htm#130716115000239">Why
are we handing out £540 million irrespective of whether people
need it? It is not going to people who have built up an awful lot of
expenditure through years of care, such as those Dilnot helps; it is
paid to everybody on above average means but to nobody on below average
means. It seems a crazy use of public money. Whose idea was that? I am
afraid that the answer, in part, is mine, because it was one of the
recommendations of the minority report. Although I defend most of the
minority report fairly fervently, on this one we were wrong. What my
noble friend Lord Joffe and I had in mind when we recommended it was
this: nursing care was free when provided in the health system, and so
it should be free in an old persons’ home too. We wanted
comparable services paid for in social
care<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T21:02:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000240" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0003.htm#130716115000240">However
this recommendation ran counter to the main thrust of the minority
report, which was to concentrate services for the less well off. A
corollary of that was that people would have to pay more for their own
care when they could afford it. It was a universal benefit, and since
the poor got their care free, in practice it has benefited only the
better off. Removing the allowance would cost those in the lowest two 
<?notus-xml column=729?>income quintiles £7 a week, but those in the
highest £21 a week, according to Professor Hancock. In other
words, this is a strongly progressive
proposal<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T21:02:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000241" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0003.htm#130716115000241">The
cost of the allowance has escalated since we reported. Indeed, I think
that had we known what the figures were going to be, we would not have
recommended it. We thought that it would cost £110 million,
rising to £280 million in 2021. That was the costing in the
minority report on the advice of the PSSRU. Now we estimate it north of
£500 million today, and it is rising
fast<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T21:03:41"></hs_TimeCode>. However,
it does not buy us much. I had virtually forgotten that we had
recommended it until I saw a credit for the amount on my mum’s
care home bill. I have tried this on quite a lot of people, and nobody
knows they are getting it.</hs_para>

because of my mum—that would be too much. It is not a good idea
to take away benefit from people who are already getting it. They make
far more noise than people who gain from the benefits they receive as a
result. The people who are having them taken away feel their pockets
have been picked, and the people who are receiving the benefit think
that they are not getting anymore than they were due anyway. However we
do not need to abolish it. We simply bar, as my amendment would, new
claims from April 2016. Since most recipients of the benefit are old,
and not in a good state, their life expectancy is not good. I hope, of
course, my wonderful mother is an exception. Therefore, in a few
years’ time—probably three or four years—the total
cost of the benefit will be saved. Through that, we will provide enough
to pay for the less severe tariff and enough to pay for increased
personal requirements allowances, while leaving more than £200
million over to fill part of the black hole in the provision of
services to older people. What is not to like about

sympathise with the intention of the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, to
redistribute funding between health and care and support so as to
increase the personal expenses allowance and local authority support
for those in residential care. However, we need to face the reality of
the current economic climate. One important aspect of our reforms is
that the greatest support will go to those with the greatest need, and
that is surely the policy aim that we need to keep most closely in mind

funds nursing homes to support the provision of registered nursing
care. This reduces the burden on the NHS of having to provide NHS
nurses in residential care homes. Removing this funding would risk
increasing costs elsewhere in the NHS, but it would also breach a
serious point of principle. If we were to stop people in residential
care homes from being eligible for NHS-funded nursing care, it would
undermine one of the founding principles of the NHS, which is that it
should be a service free at the point of delivery. I am sure that noble
Lords would agree that we would not like to see
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000251" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0003.htm#130716115000251">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T21:14:35"></hs_TimeCode>
understand why the noble Lord seeks to increase the personal expenses
allowance. If someone is contributing to the costs of their residential
care from their net income, for example from their pension, the
personal expenses allowance is the amount people can retain to spend as
they wish. This is currently set, as he rightly said, at £23.90.
The amendment would increase it to £32.75. When living at home,
people pay for their food and heating from their income. It is right
that people should continue to contribute towards these costs in
residential care. The personal expenses allowance reflects the fact
that for most people these costs represent a large proportion of their
income, but it allows people to retain some of their income for other
uses. The reality is that spending additional resources on
the personal expenses allowance would reduce the resources available to
provide support to those with the greatest
needs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000252" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0003.htm#130716115000252">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T21:14:35"></hs_TimeCode>
heard what the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, said about the loss of the
attendance allowance meaning that people would be worse off. Local
authorities 
<?notus-xml column=731?>should support people to maximise their income. If a
given individual would be better off receiving the attendance
allowance, the local authority should support them to achieve this. We
will bear this in mind as we draw up the

turn now to Amendment 91, which relates to financial assessments. One
of the problems the Dilnot recommendations attempt to tackle is the
cliff edge between being a self-funder and being supported by the local
authority. By extending the means test for people in residential care,
we aim to avoid a situation where a small change in a person’s
capital results in a large change in what they pay for
care.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716115000254" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0003.htm#130716115000254">From<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T21:14:35"></hs_TimeCode>
2016, the maximum tariff income for someone with £118,000 in
assets will be £404 per week. If we reduced the rate at which
people contribute toward their care costs from their assets to
£1 per week for every £500 of assets, the contribution
for someone with £118,000 in assets would become £202 per
week. This means that an individual facing a typical care home fee
would be over £200 per week better off if they had assets of
£117,000 than if they had assets of £119,000. This would
reintroduce the cliff edge that surely none of us wants to

and the state. People with care needs will receive additional support
with care and support costs through the extended means test, safe in
the knowledge that health services will remain free at the point of use
and that they are protected by the cap from unlimited care costs. I
hope the noble Lord will see that there is method in the

people. There are about 350,000 people in care homes and about
50,000-plus of them get care allowance. If a local authority claims a
person’s needs can be met in a home costing £400 a 
<?notus-xml column=733?>week and the old person or their family prefers one costing £500
a week, they get the means-tested support as if they were in a

there is a strange twist. As long as a third party—usually the
old person’s family—is prepared to dip into their pockets
for the extra £100, there is no legal problem. They can do so
under LAC circular (2004) 20, which derives from the National
Assistance Act 1948. But if the old person wants better care, they can
top up out of their own pocket only in very limited circumstances. They
can do so only if they are subject to the 12-week
disregard—which is the period you can be in a care home to see
whether you get better and come out—or if they have a deferred
payment agreement with the council, when the council may make top-up
payments on their behalf. In theory, people cannot top up their own

a historian of the Treasury, I can sort of see how this might come
about. The Treasury would not want those whose means-tested
contribution is offset by the tariff, as has been discussed, running
down their assets to pay for better care, thus throwing more of the
burden on the state. However, those in the know say that the
restriction is widely ignored, often with the connivance of councils
that do not want to get into an argument about whether the
accommodation they will provide within their own limits is adequate for
the old person. As a result, they allow the old person to chip in for
their own care—perhaps he or she puts the money into a
son’s bank account, the bank account pays the home and we do not
know what goes on.</hs_para>

perfectly clear that local authorities know very little about what is
going on with top-ups. I refer to the report due to be published by the
charity Independent Age tomorrow, which analysed this after doing a
freedom of information request on all councils. Out of the councils
they asked, only 30 or so can be reckoned to have best practice or a
good system for keeping account of top-ups. The rest are either bad or

mysterious top-ups go on, otherwise the old people would have to move
out of the home they are in and into a local authority home. As noble
Lords know, if you move old people from the home they are in to another
home, what frequently happens, I am afraid, is that they die. This
strange top-up mess is more difficult in the post-Dilnot world. Because
of the extension of the asset limit for means tests, many more people
will be receiving means-tested support, and anyone who is receiving
means-tested support cannot do a top-up; that is the law. Many more
people will therefore find themselves limited in what they can
do if they stick by the law—which, as I say, they
often do

because the deferred payments scheme will be made available to
everybody, more people will escape through the loophole in the current
regulations that allows those on deferred payments to top up—you
can do it if you have a deferred loan from the local authority but you
cannot if you do not. The injustice between those who can and do defer
and those who do not is made worse—the former can top up but the

<?notus-xml column=734?>latter cannot. That will be a growing problem and a
huge incentive for people to take out deferred payments, because they

and potentially more importantly, let us suppose a person is
self-funding and in a home where the fee exceeds what the local
authority will pay. They reach the cap, having spent their
£72,000. What will happen then? The state will meet that part of
the cost of the home that they are in which is equivalent to what they
would pay if they were in the home selected and provided by the local
authority—their limit. If the home costs more than
that—£600 a week not £400—where will the
rest of the fees come from? Perhaps their family does not have any
money for a top-up or is unwilling to provide it. Who is going to top
it up? I am afraid that the crude reality is that some people will
persuade the council to pay the higher fee while others will be
moved—and, as I have already said, people who are moved will as
a result, on average, die considerably younger. That is not a
side-effect that Dilnot planned for but it is a side-effect of the way
it is going to work out. Nothing much has been said by the Government
about what happens if you reach the £72,000 cap and are in a
home costing more than the local authority is prepared to pay. Until we
get reassurances on that, the reality must be that they will be moved
out to another, poorer, home and that this is going to be a

irony is that these are not poor people falling back on the state. They
may well have assets and might be very willing to put in a bit extra to

opt out of Dilnot and fund their care in full, in which case they will
not benefit from the cap and Dilnot, for them, amounts to nothing, or
they go through the business of moving to the inferior home and we will
have inflicted that disaster on

Committee was working on it. There were not good data, other than that
many of us have been increasingly learning that the top-up levels have
been quite considerable in some homes. There is clearly a problem with
the cross-subsidising of people who are state funded from self-funders.
The issue is now complex and I do not know how good the
Government’s data are on the use of top-ups. We were clear that
you could count towards the cap only what the state-funded element of
that payment was, which would be determined by what the local authority
would pay in its area for the care being provided. If we depart from
that principle, we will end up in chaos—and probably end up with
a much higher public expenditure bill.</hs_para>

self-funders when responsibility is taken over by the local authority
once the cap has been reached. Has any work been done on the extent to

supported to receive the care they want and should be able to use their
own assets to achieve this when they can afford to do so, but this
should never be an excuse for local authorities to underfund the cost
of meeting people’s needs. I agree with the noble Lord that
people should be able to spend their money on purchasing more expensive
care and support for themselves if they wish to do so, provided this is
affordable. We are seeking better to understand the impact of such a
relaxation and the protections that are appropriate for vulnerable
people. It would clearly be undesirable for a person to spend their
life savings on residential care and late in life be faced with the
prospect of having to move to alternative accommodation purely on
affordability grounds. I take that point absolutely. In addition, we
want to consider the implications for the ability of local authorities
to arrange services for other people. If individuals were to use their
resources to purchase more expensive care, this could ultimately reduce
local authorities’ income from charges. This in turn would
reduce the amount of care the local authorities could arrange for other
vulnerable people. There are a number of factors at play here, which we
need to think through a bit

should be able to use their savings to purchase more expensive care if
they want to. We are determined to clarify and modernise the care and

need care, their families and the taxpayer. The revised arrangements
for people to use their savings to pay for their own care will be set
out in regulations made under Clause 30(2) of the Bill. Through the
public consultation on funding reform, we are seeking better to
understand how relaxing the existing restrictions on making additional
payments, which the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, outlined, might impact on
the wider care and support system. The evidence we hope to gather from
the consultation will inform the regulations that will set out the
revised arrangements. Those regulations will also be subject to further
public consultation. In view of that, which is really a long-winded way
of saying that this is work in progress but we are on the noble
Lord’s side, I hope he will feel able to withdraw his

for the local authority to meet any additional cost, for example, where
moving the person receiving care and support would adversely affect
their health. However, where paying the higher cost might limit the
local authority’s ability to support other individuals with care

amendments follow on from the discussion relating to the amendments
tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey. The first amendment is about the
duty to meet needs. We know that carers are often old people
themselves. They have often cared for a long time for somebody with
dementia or something similar before that adult meets the eligibility
threshold for care. In my view and that of the Alzheimer’s
Society, those carers should have the right to ask the local authority
to arrange that person’s care because it is important that an
individual who is in a position to arrange care and support has the
right to ask the local authority to do so even when the adult is
self-funding. Enabling a carer who would otherwise be required to
arrange care to request that the local authority meet that need would
help to reduce the strain that that carer is under. Being able to ask
the local authority to arrange care would also enable the adult to take
advantage of the 
<?notus-xml column=738?>better rates for care that the local authority can
command through block booking and other means. It would be unacceptable
if adults who do not have capacity but who have deputies or other
representatives were forced to pay higher costs than other
people.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307175000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0003.htm#1307175000008">Amendments
99ZZLA and 99ZZQA are about the usual rate of independent personal
budgets. Clause 26 refers to the calculation of a personal budget that
will enable eligible needs identified by the assessment to be met. The
budget needs to be sufficient to enable this to happen. Clause 26
treats this as being the cost to the local authority of meeting that
person’s needs, whereas a person receiving their direct payment
as a cash payment would not necessarily be able to purchase care at the
same amount since care homes, as we know, routinely charge self-payers
more than they charge local authorities. Legislation has to be clear
that local authorities have a duty to meet eligible needs and personal
budgets must therefore be, after application of the local
authority’s normal means-testing system, sufficient to purchase
that level of care at its local actual cost and not at a tariff rate
based on the bulk purchasing power of the local authority.</hs_para>

calculating the independent personal budget which is, confusingly,
different from the personal budget referred to in Clause 26. The
independent personal budget is used to calculate the amount that an
individual can spend on his or her care that will count towards the
expenditure cap. Clause 28, therefore, refers always to
expenditure by the individual, so it should be the true cost available
to the individual of meeting their assessed needs, rather than the cost
to the local authority. Once again, there is a
difference.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307175000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0003.htm#1307175000010">The
amendment to Clause 26 also has an impact on Clause 30. This clause
replaces the current choice of accommodation directions which enable a
person to choose a different residential care home from that provided
by the local authority and to top up the payments if their preferred
accommodation is more expensive than the local authority’s usual
cost. The Minister has confirmed that this is possible. However, the
current system is widely abused with local authorities often requiring
top-ups even when there are no places available at the so-called usual
cost and the person has chosen the only available accommodation that
meets their
needs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307175000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0003.htm#1307175000011">Clause
30 does not refer to the usual cost but, instead, defines “more
expensive” as being more than the value of the person’s
individual budget. If the personal budget is defined in Clause 26 by
how much the local authority says it will pay to meet the
person’s needs, the system is open to the same abuses as
the choice of accommodation directions. However, if Clause
26 requires that the personal budget should be sufficient for the
person to purchase services which will meet their needs, this ensures
that the rate that the local authority will pay for care is directly
related to actual market
conditions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307175000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0003.htm#1307175000012">Amendment
92ZZR is about the review of independent personal budgets in Clause 28.
People should be able to refuse an assessment as long as they
understand the implications of that refusal. However, this clause does
not offer adequate protection to people who lack capacity. As it
stands, the clause puts people with a deteriorating condition, such as
dementia, at risk of 
<?notus-xml column=739?>falling through the gaps. The proposed new clause stipulates that Clause
28 does not apply when an adult lacks capacity to refuse the
assessment. It would stop vulnerable individuals from falling through
those gaps as local authorities would be required to carry out a needs
assessment and continue to maintain their care account.</hs_para>

chair of the All-Party Group on Dementia and the Alzheimer’s
Society shares my concern about this. There is potential that the Bill
will not provide the same right to choose a care home as currently
exists. Individuals currently have a right to exercise genuine choice
over where they live. If an individual has a preference for a
particular care home, the local authority should arrange accommodation
in that home subject to the following conditions being met: that the
home that is chosen is suitable to meet the individual’s needs
as assessed; that it does not cost more than the local authority would
usually expect to pay to arrange accommodation for someone with those
assessed needs; that it is available and the provider is willing to

individual may wish to move to a home that is more than the local
authority’s usual cost, even though there is a home that meets
their needs and within the local authority’s usual cost. In
these circumstances the individual or another person can make
arrangements to make a top-up payment, as the Minister has said. The
Bill states that regulations “may” provide that the local
authority must arrange for the provision of the preferred
accommodation. This should be amended to “must”
rather than “may” to ensure that the right to choice
continues. In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T21:49:37"></hs_TimeCode>
addition, the Bill currently says that regulations may provide that

will not repeat what I said earlier, but this certainly applies to this
clause because the integration is very important. This amendment is
supported by the Care and Support Alliance, and particularly affects
young people who are coming from adolescence into adulthood, where the
seamlessness of their care package is very important. As I mentioned in
moving the earlier amendment, this has, of course, a read-across into 
<?notus-xml column=740?>other legislation. I know that my noble friend gave
me a reassurance last time, but it is important that the Bill requires
that double banking, if you like, to make sure that there is joined-up

“can include”. What has concerned the noble Baroness,
Lady Emerton, here is that although there may well be sanction
for a personal budget for the adult concerned, the impression
given by this particular wording is that it could possibly constrain
the choice as to how that personal budget was spent. I appreciate that
the care plan or the support plan would identify that sanction had been
given for a personal budget. However, it is very important that it in
no way presumes the choices in a prescriptive way that would take away
from the individual concerned what is at the very heart of
personal budgets, which is the right to choose services and items which
might well be something that they have a preference for and on which
the local authority should not get too much into the detail, having
sanctioned the personal budget in the first place. It would be helpful,
when my noble friend responds, if he could give some reassurance on
that
matter.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="1307175000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0003.htm#1307175000019"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T21:49:59"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Dubs" PimsId="3031" UID="1307175000081" xid="1109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0003.htm#1307175000081">Lord

fluctuating conditions, individuals could be assured that they would

spoke at Second Reading, the Minister pointed out that Clauses 31 and
32 set out that, before a direct payment is made, the local authority
must be satisfied that the adult or someone nominated on their behalf 
<?notus-xml column=742?>is capable of managing the direct payment. He
felt that these and other provisions in Clause 4 should

It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T21:56:22"></hs_TimeCode> would be more

92ZZS would put in place. It simply requires the local authority to
make known in writing and discuss with the applicant the criteria that
it uses to satisfy itself that the adult is capable of managing a
direct payment. This would have the effect of bringing about a proper
discussion of the implications for the applicant of managing direct
payments and provide a proper and informed basis for the local
authority to make a judgment. I hope that it would also ensure that the
criteria for judgment were clear, understandable, user friendly and
completely transparent. Making this simple change would greatly improve
the chances of correctly matching direct payments with those who

Wilkins:</Member></B> My Lords, I speak to Amendment 92ZZSA, which
stands in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell of Surbiton.
The amendment seeks explicit clarification from the Government that
nothing in the Bill lessens the strong duty on local authorities to
offer direct payments to those requiring care and support services. A
right to request direct payments is a welcome encouragement to those
who would like to arrange their care and support with the autonomy that
direct payments bring. However, it should not undermine the duty of
local authorities to offer direct payments as enshrined in the Health
and Social Care Act 2001 and regulations. It would be unhelpful to
shift the onus on to individuals to know about and request direct
payments and away from local authorities’ duty to offer
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307175000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0003.htm#1307175000029">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T21:57:54"></hs_TimeCode>
general, case studies in this area show that where people already have
a care package and then want to convert to direct payments, a battle is
often involved. Care services recipients need a clear indication that
direct payment is one of the support options available. The Bill
requires local authorities to tell an adult which, if any, of the needs
can be met by making direct payments. It is vital that local
authorities understand that they must always provide information
about direct payments. This information must include how to
request one, the conditions, and advice and brokerage
services.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307175000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0003.htm#1307175000030">Local<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T21:58:42"></hs_TimeCode>
authorities need to provide support to help the adult to manage direct
payments. As the Bill stands, they can refuse a request if the adult
has no help available to manage the payments. Could the Minister make
the Bill’s intentions clear in this regard? It is important that
the rights and duties enshrined in the original Act, which have
proved so beneficial to many disabled people, are not, as it

stages in the care and support journey have been raised. The amendments

92ZZG seeks to specify in the Bill that the adult or carer needs in the
care and support plan or support plan include both social care, to be
met by the local authority, and health needs, to be met by NHS
bodies in the area. This requirement would reinforce the need for local
authorities and primary, secondary and community health services to
work closely together for the benefit of the adult and the carer. It
would also provide a clear, joined-up picture of the adult and/or
carer’s interlinking care and support and health needs and how
they are to be met. Amendments 92ZZP and 92ZZQ also provide for this
important joining-up mechanism to apply to the care and support plan
and support plan reviews by underlining that in the review process,
local authorities must have regard to any changes in the health needs
of the adult or carer, including any health provision that they are

entitlements where the adult lacks mental capacity to arrange for the
provision of care and support. The amendments are designed to ensure

other groups that Clause 28(7) does not offer adequate

the Minister’s recognition that the clause is open to
misinterpretation is welcome. These are complex issues but we all
recognise the importance of ensuring that the Bill is watertight in
respect of adults lacking capacity to arrange care and support, and of
having clarity in respect of the local authority’s duty to carry

<?notus-xml column=744?>out a needs assessment and to continue to maintain their care

their carers. I am, however, intrigued to determine whether the

contingency planning for an emergency, ensuring that plans reflect the

national care service and a national entitlement to

the need for the completion of the care and support plan and support
plan to be conducted within a reasonable timeframe. The assessment is a
worrying and often traumatic time for the cared for and carer, so
knowing what the timeframe is from interview to completion, and then
for the personal budget decision, is pretty important. Getting an early
assessment and getting the clock ticking towards the cap will also be
crucial, so there must be targets and timeframes for the local
authority to adhere to and meet. Assessments under the self-directed
support process in my local experience as a carer involved four
meetings with social services, including with the domiciliary care
agency provider and with the daycare provider, and a lot of supported
work to be undertaken by the adult or the carer on the client’s
behalf. Is the Minister confident that local authorities will really
have the capacity and resources to cope with the demands of the new
system, including the estimated quarter of a million additional
assessments for self-funders that will need to be carried

our Amendment 92ZZSB seeks to implement the recommendation of the Joint

relation to Amendment 92ZZCA, I hope I can reassure the noble Baroness,
Lady Greengross, that it is already the case in the Bill—the
Explanatory Notes make this clear—that where the adult lacks
capacity to make a request, it may be made by someone else on their
behalf. This is the effect of the Mental Capacity Act 2005. It is not
necessary to set this out in legislation each time. We will also make
this clear in guidance. Condition 3 in Clause 18(4) imposes a duty on
the local authority to meet needs in cases where the adult lacks
capacity and has no one to arrange care on their behalf. This is an
additional safety net, enacting a provision previously set out in
guidance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307175000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0003.htm#1307175000045">On
Amendment 92ZZEC from the noble Baroness, Lady Wheeler, it is vital
that local authorities retain the ability to be proportionate to the
needs to be met. For some people the care planning process may be
relatively simple and therefore can occur relatively quickly, but that
may not be the case for people with multiple complex needs. As we
discussed earlier, there may be a need for experts to be engaged in
some cases, and this should not be overlooked in order to meet a
centralised target. Introducing a defined timescale may also have the
unintended consequence of some plans 
<?notus-xml column=746?>being rushed in order to meet the deadline, or even introduce gaming
into the completion of care plans. I hope that the Committee will agree
that this does not fit very well with our vision of a personalised care

specifying health needs in the care plan. The Bill creates a clear
legal framework to enable such integration to happen in practice.
However, it is not for the local authority to specify in the care plan
which needs the NHS should meet. Clause 25 requires local authorities
to involve the adult and carer, and take all reasonable steps to agree
the plan with them, which would include whether to refer to any health
needs.</hs_para>

completely agree with the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, in relation to
Amendments 92ZZH and 92ZZJ, that a modern, comprehensive care and
support system should be able swiftly and effectively to respond to
changing patterns of need. But the issue of fluctuating or emergency
needs and anticipated review dates should be left to the local
authority and the adult to discuss and agree when going through the
care and support planning process. Again, we will consider these
matters when producing statutory guidance with
partners.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307175000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0003.htm#1307175000051">I
turn to Amendment 92ZZK in the name of my noble friend Lady Browning.
As I have indicated previously, the transition of children to adult
care and links between this Bill and the Children and Families Bill
merit further consideration and will be discussed at a later date. But
I share my noble friend’s expectation. Where an adult has an
education health and care plan, their care and support needs assessment
and plan 
<?notus-xml column=747?>should be integrated with it. Both the guidance
supporting the Care Bill and the SEN code of practice will set out how
we expect this to
work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307175000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0003.htm#1307175000052">I turn to
Amendments 92ZZLA and 92ZZQA in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady
Greengross. The Bill is intentionally very clear that the personal
budget and independent personal budget must be the cost to the local
authority of meeting the adult’s needs, not an arbitrary or
hypothetical figure. I can reassure the noble Baroness that the local
authority may not set the personal budget to an amount which is less
than it would cost the authority to meet the adult’s needs.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T22:14:01"></hs_TimeCode> personal
budget or independent personal budget must reflect the cost to the
local authority of meeting the adult’s needs, not the cost to
the individual of doing so himself or herself. Otherwise, this would
create an unfair advantage for those with more means who are able to
pay more for their care and would therefore reach the cap
quicker.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1307175000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0003.htm#1307175000053">I
turn now to Amendments 92ZZMA and 92ZZQB, spoken to by the noble
Baroness, Lady Wheeler. Enabling adults to request a review of either
the care and support plan or the independent personal budget without a
determination of reasonableness may leave the process open to abuse and
create frivolous reviews costing the local authority time and money.
For example, it would not be reasonable to request a review when a
review has recently been conducted and needs have not changed. If an
adult request is considered unreasonable, then the adult should be
informed of the grounds for the local authority’s decision. We
will cover this further in
guidance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307175000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0003.htm#1307175000054">On
Amendment 92ZZR, we wholeheartedly agree with the noble Baroness, Lady
Greengross, that if an adult lacks capacity the local authority must
carry out the assessment if it believes that this would be in the
adult’s best interests. We have addressed this in government
Amendment 92ZZQC. This puts beyond doubt that the provisions of Clause
11 should apply to any refusal of a needs assessment by an adult with
an independent personal budget. As a result, where an adult lacks
capacity or is at risk of abuse or neglect, the local authority must
carry out the assessment if it believes it to be in the adult’s
best interests.</hs_para>

Amendments 92ZZRAA and 92ZZRAB, spoken to by the noble Baroness, Lady
Wheeler. It is important that people should, as far as reasonably
possible, be able to choose the accommodation they live in. People may
wish to move into a care home in a new area—for example, to be
close to relatives—and they should be able to do this even if
this is in another local authority area. I can reassure the Committee
that we intend to make regulations that enable people to exercise
choice of accommodation both within and outside their current local
authority. However, we do not believe that it would be appropriate to
require local authorities to find and arrange care in another local
authority area. While some might choose to do so, others might lack the
local knowledge effectively to undertake this task. The
requirement may also 
<?notus-xml column=748?>potentially have significant costs and could reduce

to Amendment 92ZZRB of the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross. Our
approach in the Bill is simple. It allows any “person”
nominated by the adult to receive a direct payment on their behalf,
provided of course that the conditions specified in the Bill are met.
In legal terms, a “person” means anyone with legal
personality. Therefore, Clause 31 already allows the local authority to
pay the direct payment to a person of a type specified by the adult.
This includes user trusts set up as companies and organisations set up
as
companies.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307175000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0003.htm#1307175000058">On
Amendment 92ZZS, I understand my noble friend Lord Sharkey’s
concerns, and I hope I can reassure him that the local authority cannot
fulfil its duties under the Bill unless it tells the adult what he or
she needs to know in order to make a decision and reach agreement about
whether or not to take a direct payment. Further, the Bill contains a
regulation-making power at Clause 33(2)(f) to set out cases or
circumstances in which the local authority must review the direct
payment to ensure that it is being used and managed
appropriately.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307175000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0003.htm#1307175000059">I
turn now to Amendment 92ZZSA of the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, to
which the noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins, spoke. There may be only a
limited set of circumstances in which a direct payment would not be
appropriate, such as where needs can be met only through local
authority-provided care and support. It is not our intention to for
this to be used to limit access to direct payments. However, it is
important that this provision remains in order to ensure that the
adult’s needs are met via the most appropriate
method.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307175000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-0003.htm#1307175000060">Finally,
I turn to Amendment 92ZZSB, spoken to by the noble Baroness, Lady
Wheeler. It has always been our policy that, as long as used legally,
there should be no restrictions on the type of services purchased with
a direct payment, provided it accords with the care and support plan.
Indeed, this reflects current guidance. Clause 25 requires the care
plan to detail the needs to be met by the direct payment and, under
Clause 31, a direct payment must be an appropriate way to meet those
needs. There is no need to state in the Bill the type of providers from
which people can purchase care and
support.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_16_PT_1/3A9919CB769F19A13D0A4B5ABD6B388CC3265DF0" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 16 July 2013">Tuesday,

Oxburgh:</Member></B> My Lords, I think we can all agree that our
energy system is a vital part of our infrastructure. It is a part that
is technically and commercially complex, and it is long-term. It is
slow to build but, when we have built it, it tends to last for 40, 50
or even 60 years.</hs_para>

Government to set objectives  for energy infrastructure, but
implementation strategy depends on expertise, experience and continuity
at a high level within the department. Unfortunately, that is not
something that is readily available at present. It is partly because
there has been relatively quick changeover of Ministers in the past
decade or so. Also, at a high level, among officials in the Civil
Service, we have very capable people who move from department to
department but are not specialists. This means that others in the
department, who are working hard, lack a coherence of view that could
come from an expert and experienced top-level
group<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T15:32:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

energy system is perhaps hard to explain to those who may not be fully
familiar with it. However, in my judgment, it is probably more
complicated than, for example, designing an aircraft engine. Who would
like to fly in an aircraft whose engines had been designed by
intelligent people working on the basis of consultants’ reports
and public consultations but who had never done it before? This is, in
essence, what we are doing with energy policy in general and, I might
comment, with this Bill in
particular<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T15:32:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071699000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#13071699000008">I
have suggested a solution to this problem. I will not elaborate on the
problem, which I did at Second Reading. The solution I put forward may
or may not be the right one, but I propose that we have an energy
investment advisory board which, above all, brings continuity at a high
level to departmental strategy. It would comprise people of commercial
and technical experience and, most importantly, it would report to
Parliament. This could be a very valuable resource for Ministers. It is
the kind of body that could see problems coming ahead of time in a way
that typically does not happen today. It could see implications across
the system for a decision here and a consequence there. It could look
at generation, transmission, interconnectors and energy storage right
across the spectrum, not to mention the markets and market
interactions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T15:34:26"></hs_TimeCode>.
Reporting to Parliament would be extremely important because it would
give Parliament confidence that this piece of infrastructure was being
properly looked
after.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071699000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#13071699000009">Those
who feel unable to support this proposal have three choices. One is to
say that there is no problem. In that case, I refer them to <I>Power
Politics</I>, the slim volume published in 2011 by the noble Lord, Lord
Tombs. In it, he describes decades of struggling with bureaucracy over
industrial strategies and the energy industry, and he is trenchant,
indeed mordant, in his criticism of the present
system<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T15:35:30"></hs_TimeCode>. If
people do not like that, they might look at the London School of
Economics Growth Commission’s report on infrastructure, which
comes to very similar conclusions. Alternatively, they might look no
further than the pre-legislative scrutiny group of this House, which I
had the honour to chair informally and which was extremely critical of
the current
situation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T15:36:10"></hs_TimeCode>. It
is, therefore, hard to make a case for saying there is no

second option is to say, “Yes, there is a problem but
we’re going to deal with it differently”. That would be
great, as long as it is actually dealt with. However, it cannot be
dealt with in the way that the Minister suggested in her reply to my
Second Reading speech, in which she said that in the department there
are lots of consultative groups helping the Government with EMR. That
is not really what this is about; it is about something much more
long-term and
strategic<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T15:36:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071699000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#13071699000011">Finally,
it would be possible for the Government to say that they think that
this, although perhaps not precisely right, is a possible way forward
and that they are prepared to sit down and discuss ways of tackling the
problem. Perhaps over the summer or before Report stage, an amendment
could be introduced. It would need a degree of cross-party support and,
indeed, there is significant expertise in this area—way beyond
mine—on the Cross

now an opportunity to deal with it. I am sure the Government would
rather not deal with something such as this at the moment, but in one
sense this is both the worst and the best of times, given that we face

too, at Second Reading reflected the increasing anxiety in this country
over the security of supply over the next four to five years. Since
then, the latest Ofgem capacity assessment report has confirmed the
fears that we face several years of very low margins. This has been
widely interpreted as posing a distinct risk of interruption to
supplies. You need only two major power stations to go out of
commission for even a few hours—as happened a few years ago with
Sizewell B and Longannet—to create considerable alarm as to
whether we have enough. If that happened again in a year or two
years’ time, we would be in very serious
difficulties.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071699000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#13071699000015">This
is what lies at the heart of the noble Lord’s amendment, to
which I was very pleased to add my name: how on earth have we managed
to get into such a perilous position? Is it something in the current
structure of the electricity industry or in the current attitudes of
the departments in charge? As the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, suggested,
is it to do with the experience and expertise of those whose job it is
to advise Ministers? Which of these has led to this difficult
situation—or is it all of
them?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071699000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#13071699000016">I will
draw a parallel. The noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, and I were both co-opted
on to the Science and Technology Committee to look at the capacity of
the nuclear industry in this country for research and development. It
is not an overstatement to say that we were dismayed by the very poor
level of understanding among DECC Ministers and most of the officials
who gave evidence to us. Happily, they appear to have read our report
but some of the solutions remain to be worked out. This is not the
occasion to go into the details of that but the experience convinced me
that something has to change if we are not to face similar failures in
the
future.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071699000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#13071699000017">Last

to the issues before us, tributes have been paid, quite rightly, to my

to help us to get to grips with this very complex piece of legislation.
Without them, we would have been in some difficulty. Thanks to the work
of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, to which my
noble friend Lord Roper drew our attention at a previous sitting, we
have now been given a glimpse of just how much of a policy that is
supposed to be enshrined in the Bill is left to regulations, which are
still being drafted or in many cases are still being worked
out.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071699000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#13071699000022">I spent
part of the weekend reading the DPRRC memorandum on Part 2 of the Bill.
It sets out the position in lurid detail: 60 pages of descriptive

certainly listen very carefully to what she has to say but I must warn
her that she faces an uphill task in persuading us that Ministers have
all the advice that they need and ought to have. I ask again: how is
it, after years of taking all this advice from consultants, panels and
experts, that over the next two or three years we face the possibility
of cuts? To put it crudely, this country is not replacing the

other document that I studied over the weekend, and perhaps should have
looked at earlier, is the one to which the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh,
referred: <I>Investing in Prosperity</I>, the report prepared jointly
by the LSE Growth Commission and the Institute for Government. That is
indeed a very interesting and authoritative document, and a number of
our colleagues in this House were part of its preparation, notably the
noble Lords, Lord Browne of Madingley and Lord Stern, as were a number
of other distinguished names who may eventually turn up in this House.
It is a very distinguished report and it covers the whole range of
infrastructure investment that this country needs if it is to secure
growth. Of course, it also pays attention to energy and just one
sentence on page 23 reinforces what the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, has
said. It states:</hs_para>

endorsing every proposal of the growth commission. However, three
characteristics are absolutely essential. First, the board must be a
top-level, expert, highly experienced body of people, whose views and
authority will be unquestioned by the great majority of people.
Secondly, it has to be advisory. It cannot be executive; a body of that
sort, which is in no way accountable to Ministers, cannot actually run
things. It is an advisory body; it must take a long-term perspective
and it should report both to Parliament and to Ministers. Finally,
decisions must be taken by Ministers, who are accountable to
Parliament.</hs_para>

proposed new clause out of hand. I envisage that the opportunity
offered by the Recess would allow for a full discussion between members
of this group, and perhaps others, and the department, to see how we
could get ourselves out of this situation that successive Governments

Cameron of Dillington:</Member></B> My Lords, I support this amendment.
I will not repeat the much more eloquently phrased words of my noble
friend Lord Oxburgh and the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin. All that I should
like to say is that power generation is a long-term game. From start to
finish, a major power plant takes between seven and, let us say, 12
years to get from conception to being able to produce power. For
instance, Hinkley Point C, which is in my county of Somerset, has
already been on the planning board for 10 years and probably has
another nine or 10 years to go before it takes off—if it does
take off—and produces any power.</hs_para>

Parliaments last for five years and Ministers almost certainly last for
even less time. I notice that the current Secretary of State seems to
be saying that there will be no power cuts in 2016. It is extremely
likely that he will not be there in 2016 to lose face if there are any
power cuts, or not to lose face if there are none. Meanwhile, as the
noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, has put much more eloquently than I could,
civil servants seem to come and go, seemingly without the baton being
passed between them. No one is playing the long-term game. Therefore,
this amendment is much needed because never again must we find

Crickhowell:</Member></B> My Lords, this is the first occasion on which
I have spoken on this Bill, although during the Queen’s Speech
debate, I made remarks very similar to those made by the noble Lord,
Lord Oxburgh, and others about the crisis that we face in the energy
industry. On this occasion, I am prompted to rise for three reasons,
all of which involve personal experience. The first has already been
referred to by my noble friend Lord Jenkin. He served with me and the
noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, on the Science and Technology Committee,
which looked at nuclear research and development. As he said, it was
one of the most dismal experiences that many of us have
had<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T15:53:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13071699000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#13071699000032">In our report, we spoke
of the extraordinary discrepancy between, on the one hand, the view of
some senior government officials and the Secretary of State and, on the
other, the views of independent experts from academia, industry,
nuclear agencies, the regulator and the Government’s own
advisers. A fundamental change in the Government’s approach to
nuclear R&amp;D is needed. We went on to recommend an R&amp;D road map
and an R&amp;D board. As my noble friend has already pointed out, it
must be said that the Government went a good way to meeting a great
many of our recommendations. Although they did not set up the advisory
board in quite the way we proposed, as a quango, they did set up a body
under the chief scientist armed with the advice of experts of just the
kind that we were suggesting, with the power and duty to report in
public and to make recommendations. On that particular issue, we have
made progress. There is a considerable similarity between the
recommendations that we made on that occasion and the amendment that
the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, has tabled: essentially, we need an
independent expert body, not just to advise the Government but to
advise them in public and on the record so that Parliament is aware of
what is going on and can take some action
accordingly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T15:55:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

enough the importance of advice given publicly. Reference has already
been made to  the plethora of consultancies. I have some
knowledge about the work of these consultancies; I have good contacts
with those who give advice in this field to the Government, and indeed
to Governments around the world. One prominent firm says that it now
dreads being asked to give advice to DECC because it realises that that
will involve a great waste of time. What happens is something like
this: the department is faced with difficult problems; there is a lack
of long-term continuity and expertise, as well described by the noble
Lord, Lord Oxburgh; and there is the agonised 
<?notus-xml column=227?>fear among the officials involved that they may be held responsible for
any advice given to Ministers that turns out to be faulty, so they
commission a consultancy. At long last and after due deliberation, the
consultancy firm produces a report, which causes perhaps even greater
consultation within the department because it actually gives advice and
makes recommendations. Officials then think to themselves, “This
is even more dangerous because this advice looks potentially extremely
worrying, and we may be blamed even more for what we do”, and
the whole thing goes on. Sometimes yet another consultancy is called in
and the whole department gets bogged down in a sort of
quagmire<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T15:57:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Government say that they are doing something about this. I am a member
of the Constitution Committee and when the Minister for the Cabinet
Office, my right honourable friend Francis Maude, came before us, I
raised this issue with him. He said, “Oh yes, of course we are
aware that there has been a problem of this kind. We are aware that
there are far too many consultancies and that the whole system is
getting bogged down, but we are doing something about it. We are taking
action, and it’s no longer going to happen”. I wish I
thought that was true, but I fear that it is not. It is therefore vital
that we take steps to ensure that consultancy advice is given by real
experts from outside the department, and given
publicly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T15:58:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

happened to notice in <I>Country Life</I> of 3 August an editorial on
the setting up of the new arrangements for English Heritage and the
so-called National Heritage Protection Service, which is taking over
the principal advisory role to government. The leading article asks:
who is effectively to argue its case? If heritage protection is to have
any teeth at all, the article says, it now needs to return to the
ministry. I cannot think of a more disastrous piece of advice. It is
quite certain that if that happened, that would be the last that we
heard of the advice, which would be lost for ever in the maw of
government, and the work of English Heritage would be almost
forgotten.</hs_para>

had the huge privilege of chairing a committee of unrivalled expertise

these relationships with the public, I had to establish a new

clear advice based on sound science and  the best professional
judgement, even if that advice might be

acknowledging that ministers answerable to Parliament have wider
responsibilities which might lead them to overrule that advice or vary
what we proposed. In the early years, we were much assisted by the way

only difficulty was that, even in that situation, the machinery of
government ground exceeding slow. I give one example. It was government
policy and part of the legislation that we should have statutory water
quality objectives, and those were combined with the system of
catchment management that we had designed. It was all agreed by
government, but it took six years, longer than the duration of either
of the world wars, for our first six pilot schemes to be approved by
Ministers. That is probably fast progress compared with some of the
progress made in recent years in the Department of

do not believe for one moment that is true, although certainly some
ministers and officials might have found it a more comfortable
approach. An agency that acts in that way will quickly lose the public
respect and support that was such an important factor in our success.
Ministers must have the final word because they have wider
responsibilities than any agency; but it also takes two to tango.
Ministers must be prepared to listen, whether the advice is given in
public or in private. Most of the ministers with whom I had to deal as
chairman welcomed our

is an example and a precedent that the Minister and her colleagues in

hope that, as the my noble friend Lord Jenkin of Roding has said, the

not reject it out of hand. The only change that I would make to it
would be to increase the numbers involved. I do not think that four or
five members are sufficient to provide the breadth of expertise needed.
Of course boards should not be too big to be manageable and effective;
nobody knows that better than the noble Lord. However, four or five,
when we are looking for expertise right across the energy field,
including the economic aspects, is not enough. With that one exception,

some contradiction between the work of the Committee on Climate
Change—I declare my interest as its chair—and the work of
this group, I would disagree. What is suggested here is an important
part of the programme. One of the difficulties is that the Committee on
Climate Change is asked to 
<?notus-xml column=229?>think forward to 2050, to ensure that Britain is able to reduce its
emissions by 80%, and yet the necessary mechanisms for delivering that
target often operate on a much shorter timescale. Indeed, the two most

is quite impossible to imagine a sensible parameter within which people

which we spend so little time thinking far enough ahead. My noble
friend the Minister will not have had encouragement in this area,
particularly from those concerned to ensure that there are no
restrictions on what the Treasury may decide. The real problem is that
that means the Treasury does not have a say in the long term, because

my noble friend looks for a reason, it is the whole of that White Paper
and, above all, the attitudes that surrounded it. I do not blame the
party opposite for that, although it might have put it right. I blame
the whole atmosphere, which was that you must not nail your colours to
any mast lest that ship did not sail in the hoped-for direction; you
must never be tough about the decisions to be made because you might
not turn out to be 100% right. This is the real issue my noble friend
raised when he asked about the nature of the governmental process in
Britain. Rolls-Royces work only when you have not only covered all the
details and very small issues but forecasted what the market will be
like in five, 10 and 15 years’ time. It does not happen if you
work on the basis of a day-to-day operation. I am afraid that we have
become the kind of nation that finds it very hard to make long-term
decisions. There is an awful phrase about selection, suggesting that we
should not back particular solutions. If you do not back anything, you
do not get anything in this long-term process. The reason that most
people in government do not want to back things is because they are
afraid that someone will hold them in some sense liable for
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T16:10:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

expressing my deep concern that the British have become believers that
if you do not do something, that is not a real decision—that
real decisions mean doing things. It seems that we all have to learn
again that not doing something can be just as serious a decision, with
just as much of a long-term effect, as doing something. Yet we have
built a system whereby the phrase, “Better not,
Minister”, is heard 
<?notus-xml column=230?>more often than any other. I hope that when I was a Minister I made it
clear that it was the one phrase that would never result in the
response that was hoped for. My father taught me that there was no
point in saying to him, “I want so-and-so because everyone else
has it”. That meant I would never get it. I always wanted a
cap-bomb, I remember, but I was never allowed it on the basis that I
once said that everyone else at school had one. That meant I never had
it. “Better not, Minister” is one of those phrases to
which all Ministers ought to say, “That means we have to find a
different answer from the one you are proposing”. I hope that my
noble friend will take seriously the concerns that we all have about
the fact that our system does not meet the demands of an energy
programme that takes 20 years before anything comes to real
fruition<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T16:12:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_16_PT_1/6CEBF045C3A231854EA3712E5E00BB4785DC6376" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 16 July 2013">Tuesday,

Teverson:</Member></B> My Lords, I must first apologise to the noble
Lord, Lord Oxburgh, for also having arrived a minute after he started.
I admit that I am a sceptic about the amendment, but I agree entirely
with my noble friend Lord Crickhowell about consultants. For a very
short period I was a consultant. Some of my best assignments were when
we went into an organisation, they told us who to talk
to—probably somewhere near the factory floor—we did so,
they told us what we needed to do and then we told senior management
what to do. They agreed, and it was a fantastic solution. All they
really needed to do was talk to their own staff. They even knew that,
but they did not have the credibility as management to do it. There are
many lessons
there<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T16:12:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

British disease, beyond what my noble friend Lord Deben and the noble
Lord, Lord Oxburgh, have described: when there is a problem, you add
another layer to the organisation without solving the fundamental
problem. I have seen it in business and I have seen it in government.
You do not have the guts, knowledge, determination and maybe the time
to fix the real problem, so what do you do? You invent something else.
When I used to deal with one of the world’s disasters, the
common fisheries policy, they started off with quotas when they had a
problem. They then started decommissioning, because that was not good
enough. When decommissioning did not work, they introduced days at sea.
When that did not work, they gave up for 10 years and finally decided
to try another tack, which may give us the answer.</hs_para>

Europe, when something is not quite right, they invent another body,
such as the Committee of the Regions. That is an advisory committee,
and I always get even more concerned when these organisations are
advisory. If they have executive power, that means that you are putting
your money where your mouth is: you are putting your belief behind an
organisation and saying, “Yes, get on with it. We weren’t
good enough. You go and do it”. At that point, you show
commitment and it tends to prove that there is a real

Teverson:</Member></B> I absolutely agree that there are places for
advisory boards. There are examples of where that works and I am a
member of some advisory boards. However, they tend not to do quite what
I believe this body is around to do. I accept much, although not all,
of the analysis of the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh. The issue is that we
have to get a much better way of governing at department level. We
probably have to reform how the Civil Service works in terms of
corporate memory. I have spent much of my life in the private sector
and my experience is that its corporate memory is probably far worse
than that of government. Perhaps it is not true of some in the oil and
energy industries, but certainly in many industries there is not a lot
of corporate knowledge. Certainly, there is no more than there is in
government
departments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T16:15:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071699000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#13071699000053">It
may have been more of an executive authority but in the rail industry,
which perhaps has similar levels or timeframes for investment, the
Strategic Rail Authority was brought into existence by the previous
Government and abolished because it did not work in relation to
departments. Ultimately, departments had to take control. Of course, we
have now seen problems with franchising but I do not think that the SRA
was the answer to
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071699000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#13071699000054">Another
area in which I would criticise the detail of this amendment is that
the list of areas it looks at avoids energy efficiency and demand
management, which are fundamental parts of how we think about the
economy. Although I agree that it could be varied in the way it is
written, from the description of this committee, I worry that it will
again look particularly at building or planning energy in terms of
capacity and generating capacity. It is interesting and dispiriting
that two weeks ago, when the National Grid asked for tenders for demand
reduction and for the demand-side response to looking at the future
possible energy crisis, there was generally a very negative reaction
from the press and wider than that. That is exactly how we should look
at this area. We should not necessarily look at planning for more and
more plant, although that would be part of it, but look at the demand
side as
well<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T16:17:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071699000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#13071699000055">As
regards why we are in the situation we are, I suspect that we will get
through it although I entirely accept that the margins are less than we
would want them to be. Through the Climate Change Act and the whole
area of the climate change challenge, we have changed direction quite
substantially in what we expect our generating and our energy
industries to do. With not a U-turn but certainly a 45-degree turn on
what we expect from our generating industry, it does not necessarily
surprise me that, through that policy change in areas where there are
long gestation periods in investment and planning, we have this
difficulty at the moment. That is not necessarily a function of the way
in which government works—necessarily imperfect though it
is<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T16:18:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

noble friend Lord Deben mentioned the climate change committee. To me,
that is the most important committee in this area by far. It may not be
a complete substitute and it clearly is not for the energy side, but
the Government really need to take notice of it. On the broader agenda,
the climate change committee as set up and put into legislation is a
good way of doing it. In terms of infrastructure planning, the case is
far from proven.</hs_para>

do here is to mend the future. I think I said that what I felt should
be done was not to add another layer but to fix the way in which the
Government and the Civil Service work within departments. To me, that

conclusion three weeks ago. I was having lunch in the Home Room and
found myself opposite the noble Lord, Lord Tombs. I was talking to him
about the Energy Bill and indeed this Committee, and mentioned the
proposal from the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh. He said, “Yes, the
reason I am not really taking any part in the Committee is that I have
been trying to solve that problem for a very long time and have never
got anywhere with it. I had a number of debates every year in this
House from 2002 to 2009 in which I argued for something similar, but
never got anywhere”.</hs_para>

that I should read his book <I>Power Politics</I>, which I did the
following weekend. Having read it, I realise the problem that the noble
Lord, Lord Oxburgh, set out: the lack of any long-term understanding of
the problem by Ministers who, on the whole, spend a relatively short
period dealing with these issues; and the fact that it is in the nature
of the Civil Service that there is no specialised knowledge of both the
economic and technical aspects of the industry’s problems. I
believe that, as the noble Lord and my noble friend Lord Jenkin have
said, this would be a significant addition to the way in which the real
problems to which my noble friend has referred would have a better
chance of being solved. I therefore hope that the Minister will be able

some sort of advisory board might be part of the answer. However, I
cannot support the wording of the amendment put forward here because it
has limited it. It talks of advice in implementing government policy
objectives for energy. You have to go wider than that and you have to
allow your advisers to advise you on what policy should be. If they are

What is he supposed to do? If the Permanent Secretary disagrees with

He should do that in private. He cannot speak in public against the

sitting there listening to these guys. He cannot speak because the
minutes will be published—he could not speak against the views
of his Minister anyway. This is neither fish nor fowl. I fear there is
a danger that it might turn into a red herring. If we need independent

Worthington:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord,
Lord Oxburgh, for tabling this amendment and to the other noble Lords
who have lent their name to it. It has been a springboard for a good
and necessary debate this afternoon. In response to the question asked
by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, on how we got here, I point out that
under the last Government, between 1997 and 2010, we saw 26 gigawatts
of new capacity added to the grid. In the last three years—2008
to 2010—we saw 7.8 gigawatts added. There was clearly a healthy
investment system under the last Government. What happened next is old
news. We had a decision to reform the electricity market and in that
process, which, let us face it, has been going on almost since 2010,
there have been a lot of conflicting messages coming out of government.
This has created an investment hiatus and an uncertainty that have led
us to where we are today.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13071699000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#13071699000072">Let us
not be overly dramatic. In 2010, we had historically high capacity
levels. That has partly contributed to the hiatus and it needs to be
cleared out for there to be a signal to the market to reinvest. Against
the 26 gigawatts or 7.8 gigawatts that were added in the last few years
of the previous Government, we have lost since then only 8 gigawatts of
old coal. Much mention is made of this, but the LCPD—the large
combustion plant directive—took out 8 gigawatts. That 8
gigawatts has already shut and the lights are still on. We must put
this in perspective. I am convinced that there is an issue of long-term
planning, but right now let us keep it in perspective. We are at the
tail end of this Bill process, which has been going on an inordinately
long time. Things, I am sure, should get better soon, but for that to
happen we have to get this Bill right. I think that all noble Lords who
have spoken today would 
<?notus-xml column=235?>agree that the key to get out of this now is to have a clear regulatory
framework that will do the job of restarting investment in our energy
infrastructure.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071699000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#13071699000073">The
other factors that have contributed to the hiatus, which I think it is
fair to say no Government could have been fully aware of or on top of,
were issues outside our control. One example is high gas prices. We
have gigawatts of consented gas capacity in this country. Why is no one
building it? They simply cannot afford to take that decision. Boards in
energy companies all around the country are asking: “Will this
pay back?”. They cannot give a definitive answer, because the
price of gas is uncertain. They will also say: “We’re in
the middle of an Energy Bill process. We’d be mad to commission
something now. Wait until the dust has settled”. The Bill is
partly in the Government’s control, but the price of gas is an
unexpected issue that has arisen quite
recently.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071699000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#13071699000074">The
second thing that has gone wrong, for which my party has some
responsibility, is that we have dropped the CCS ball. We have been
utterly hopeless at getting CCS away and demonstrated. That is partly
because—and this where I have some sympathy with the noble Lord,
Lord Oxburgh—we have been relying on civil servants to devise a
strategy for picking winners to develop CCS in this country. Quite
frankly, we have failed. A succession of wrong calls has been made. Our
first call was that it should be post-combustion coal, because somehow
we were going to help China. Well, it turns out that that is not what
we need, so, understandably, those projects have not gone forward.
There is a great need to address the future of CCS and to have more
market-based commentary on that and less control from the Civil
Service.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071699000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#13071699000075">The
third thing to have happened, which, again, has been outside any
Government’s control, is that the economics of nuclear have
changed. Fukushima was a disaster that happened on the other side of
the planet and public attitudes towards nuclear remained remarkably
resilient, but in Germany it was a completely different story, with the
phasing-out of nuclear. That obviously has an impact here because we
have two large German utility companies in this county. Having pulled
out of nuclear in Germany, quite quickly, they pulled out of nuclear in
the UK. That could not have been predicted, but it definitely
contributes to the situation that we are in today, where we are reliant
on only one nuclear project, certain aspects of which have proven
difficult.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071699000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#13071699000076">It
is fine just to look back and to try to explain why we are where we are
today, so I go back to my statement that the way out of this is to get
this Bill right. The way to do that is to think about the regulatory
framework that it creates. I have some sympathy with the proposal of
the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, because there are echoes of it in the way
in which we govern other aspects of our society. Perhaps the most
obvious one is the Monetary Policy Committee. As the noble Lord, Lord
Deben, pointed out, we also have the Committee on Climate Change. The
creation of that independent body of experts, able to advise the
Government publicly and to publish reports, was a major aspect of the
Climate Change Act and one of its most successful components. It has
depoliticised an 
<?notus-xml column=236?>issue that I am sure would otherwise have been more debated and
undermined than perhaps would be
appropriate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071699000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#13071699000077">There
are, therefore, examples of how the creation of an independent advisory
body can work, but I would argue that, if you are going to create
such  a body, you would want to give it clear parameters within
which to advise. Advising on the totality of energy investment is a
large task and I defy any group of experts, no matter how many are on
the board, to get their heads around every aspect. Setting clear
parameters within which you would require independent advice would help
to give the body a purpose in providing the right level of scrutiny and
advice for the Government.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13071699000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#13071699000078">The levers that the
Bill creates are clear. We will have a capacity market, in which the
Government will have to make decisions about the levels of capacity
that they will try to secure through auctions. That could certainly
benefit from advice. We have the decarbonisation obligation, which, I
think it is fair to say, has not to date been handled in a suitable or
effective way. The hard part has been put off, which is not what we
want. I have great sympathy with noble Lords who have said that the
tendency in government is to put things off; it is much easier simply
to shrug your shoulders and wait for the next person to come and take
the hard decisions. Unfortunately, that is what has happened with the
decarbonisation
obligation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071699000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#13071699000079">Another
key parameter within which the Bill operates is the levy control
framework and the amount of money that the Treasury has put aside.
Again, that could do with some external scrutiny. It might be necessary
for a body of experts to advise both the Treasury and DECC to
depoliticise the issue and to create unity. The last parameter in the
Bill, which we will discuss in more detail shortly, is the energy
performance standard, which could also benefit from external advice to
depoliticise it and underpin it with independent scrutiny and
analysis.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071699000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#13071699000080">Many
noble Lords have commented on what such a body might look like and how
it might operate. The key themes were that it should be independent, it
should have a long-term view, it should issue its advice in public to
both Parliament and Ministers and it should address energy
efficiency—the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, spotted that that was
missing from the list. I am sure that, as the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh,
would say, the amendment will stimulate debate and cause the Government
to come forward with something more complete.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13071699000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#13071699000081">I think that the
Government recognise that they need advice. They would not have created
three specialist advisory groups commenting on aspects of the EMR and a
technical advisory group to see them through this process if they
thought that they had all the answers themselves or if they could go to
Ofgem, the National Grid or any of the other agencies for advice.
Clearly a deficit was recognised.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13071699000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#13071699000082">I hope that the
Government will come forward with positive words about considering this
proposal in greater detail, as we have heard eloquent arguments about
why something such as this might be necessary. I hope that they will at
least concede that they have created 
<?notus-xml column=237?>bodies to advise them. Those bodies have been doing a short-term task,
but we are asking for the creation of  a body that takes a
slightly longer-term view, working within parameters. Perhaps they
could also consider whether the bodies that they have created already
need to be converted into something more permanent. If a clear process
is established for what they will do, how they will advise us and the
parameters within which they will operate, that would go a long way
towards answering many of the concerns that have been raised today. I
thank all noble Lords who have spoken and I look forward to the
Minister’s
response.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071699000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#13071699000083"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Verma" PimsId="5081" UID="13071699000173" xid="1929" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#13071699000173">The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Energy and
Climate Change (Baroness Verma):</Member></B> My
Lords, I, too, thank the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, and all noble Lords
who have spoken to the amendment, which proposes the establishment of
an energy investment advisory board within DECC. We already have a
number of advisory boards and I would like to go through my speaking
notes and lay out why we think that, at this moment in time, this could
add another layer, as my noble friend Lord Teverson said. I will also
respond to some of the questions and points raised.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13071699000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#13071699000084">First and foremost, we
attach great importance to ensuring that we consider the long-term
views of the UK’s energy needs. DECC therefore has many forums
for industry and energy experts to contribute and scrutinise policy on
energy and climate change. I will highlight some of these to noble
Lords. The main forum that DECC has with industry is the energy leaders
forum. This is a quarterly event that brings the DECC Secretary of
State, Ministers and senior officials, including the Permanent
Secretary, together with the CEOs of vertically integrated and
independent generators and suppliers. It is jointly organised by DECC
and Energy UK, whose members make up the industry attendance. The
high-level and wide-ranging discussions help government and industry to
anticipate and respond to existing and future issues in energy policy.
Importantly, the forum also discusses how industry and government can
attract investment to the UK to ensure that we have secure low-carbon
and affordable sources of energy now and tomorrow.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13071699000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#13071699000085">We have a flexible
structure of academic and industry experts who are also able to advise
the department on a much wider range of topics, including our major
programmes from the Green Deal to the electricity market reform. For
example, there are EMR expert groups for each policy area and we have
set up an independent panel of technical experts to provide the
Secretary of State with specific technical advice on the national
system operator’s analysis. The Infrastructure UK unit within
the Treasury exists to develop the UK’s long-term infrastructure
priorities and secure private sector investment. Other important forums
include the Science Advisory Group, which is a group of external
academic and industry experts who challenge and support the Chief
Scientific Adviser and DECC. It also helps to guide the
department’s scientific priorities and
strategy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071699000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#13071699000086">I
welcome the noble Lord’s point about skills in the department.
We are actively strengthening our systems for prioritisation of
resources. We are developing key 
<?notus-xml column=238?>specialist skills, including ensuring that the department has sufficient
corporate memory and leveraging the capability of our delivery
partners. As set out in DECC’s annual report, we consider
delivery skills essential as the department moves to implementation and
delivery as well as policy development.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13071699000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#13071699000087">In addition, we have an
internal governance structure. We have a departmental board whose role
is to monitor performance and delivery of DECC’s work and to
provide strategic and operational leadership for the department. The
board has non-executive members who provide advice, support and
challenge to the department. The board is supported by sub-committees,
most notably the executive committee that closely monitors departmental
strategy and delivery of objectives. In light of the existing
structures that have proven successful, I do not believe that it is
necessary or desirable to set up a new advisory panel.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13071699000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#13071699000088">I am also concerned
that the introduction of a board with explicit responsibility for
long-term energy strategy could reduce ministerial accountability. The
department regularly reports to Parliament on the progress that it is
making on energy and climate change. As we have discussed previously,
the coalition agreement states that we will give an annual energy
statement to Parliament to set strategic energy policy and guide
investment. This must be laid before Parliament by 31 December each
year. The statement provides a clear, succinct description of the
Government’s energy policy within the context of DECC’s
overall strategy. We also report to Parliament specifically on security
with the statutory security of supply report and, on Report in the
other place, we introduced a statutory annual update on EMR.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13071699000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#13071699000089">We report on climate
change via the government response to the Committee on Climate
Change’s annual report. The Committee on Climate Change consists
of independent experts and is a statutory body established under the
Climate Change Act 2008. Its purpose is to advise the Government on
emissions targets and to report to Parliament on progress made in
reducing greenhouse gas emissions and preparing for climate change. I
therefore reassure noble Lords that we already have in place forums and
structures to deliver the significant changes that we need in the
energy
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071699000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#13071699000090">A
couple of points were raised during the debate. My noble friend Lord
Jenkin asked whether we had enough capacity to keep the lights on over
the next few years. My noble friend also asked about investment. I can
reassure him and other noble Lords that through this Bill we are seeing
the biggest reform of the electricity market in recent years and
greater confidence from investors than ever before. Even with
Ofgem’s new estimates, the risk of the lights going out is low
and steps are being taken to ensure that sufficient reserves are in
place in the short and medium term. Essentially the short-term measures
are an extension of tools that National Grid and Ofgem have already
used to contract additional short-term capacity in order to balance
supply and
demand.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071699000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#13071699000091">My

Crickhowell:</Member></B> That was the point that I dealt with in my
speech, based on my own experience. I was going to intervene to say
that I did not understand my noble friend’s comment that she
feared that following the suggestions of this advisory committee might
reduce ministerial responsibility. We already have the precedent of the
nuclear advisory board; we also have the precedent that I described of
the advice that my National Rivers Authority advisory board gave to the
Government and then to the National Rivers Authority itself. In none of
those cases was there the slightest reduction in ministerial
responsibility and I cannot conceive that a committee of the kind
suggested could possibly have that
outcome.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071699000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#13071699000095"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Verma" PimsId="5081" UID="13071699000177" xid="1929" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#13071699000177">Baroness
Verma:</Member></B> My Lords, if I choose to slightly disagree with my
noble friend, that is perhaps a position that I will stand corrected
on. However, given that we have so many forums and advisory groups in
place, I do not believe that we need a further one. If I am allowed to
get to the end of my speaking notes, noble Lords may be relieved to
know that, having noted the significance attributed to this advisory
group by noble Lords, I may go back and reflect on what has been said
in <I>Hansard.</I> I see that the noble Baroness wishes to intervene at

Worthington:</Member></B> It is just a small point, which is that part
of the problem is the plethora of advisory boards. People are asking
for a sense of cohesion to be created and a hierarchy, so that you pull
one expert body together. Also, you try to create something with
independence, because many of the advisory boards that you rely on
today are, by necessity, made up of people with vested interests.
Something more transparent, more publicly accountable and at a higher
level would be
beneficial.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071699000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#13071699000097"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Verma" PimsId="5081" UID="13071699000179" xid="1929" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#13071699000179">Baroness
Verma:</Member></B> The important thing is that noble Lords know how
the governance of existing structures works as a whole. Rather than
trying to explain the role of each forum now, I will, if the Committee
allows, write to noble Lords on how each forum, advisory group and
committee works to support one another in advising government. We have
these forums under review all the time. We work to ensure that all
views are taken into account. As I said, I have taken on board the
seriousness of what the Committee has said and would like to go away
and reflect on today’s debate, perhaps responding to noble Lords
in writing. With those remarks, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord

was concerned about an added layer. Of course, he speaks as a

with, I think, a total misapprehension. She said that the proposal was
for a body to be established within DECC. That is precisely the point.
It would not be within DECC. It would be outside DECC. It would be a
parallel and complementary body to the climate change committee. It
would in fact monitor and report on DECC’s performance, as well
as giving advice. I agree that there is an immense amount of advice
from a series of committees within the department. On the other hand,
they do not have long-term continuity. They do not meet the strategic
challenges that I and many noble Lords feel that we
face.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071699000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#13071699000101">The

it. If in 2015 or 2016 there is an electricity supply problem, it might
be sensible for the Government to have said, “We saw that there

strategy”. I beg leave to withdraw the

listened very carefully to the responses given by the noble Lord, Lord
Gardiner, in our previous Committee session. I think he used the
expression “We put consumers first” no fewer than five
times on that occasion. That  is a sentiment to which we can
all subscribe and this  
<?notus-xml column=241?>is precisely what this amendment attempts to do. Furthermore, it does
not necessarily involve any expense, nor does it compel any Minister to
do anything. In that sense, it is innocuous. It seeks to give Ministers
the power to leverage the annual swings in gas price to consumer
advantage; in other words, to facilitate the purchase of gas when
prices are low in summer and to release when prices are high in
winter.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071699000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#13071699000104">I will
give a little background. This is a new situation for DECC—and
the country—because of two factors: first, the growth of the
liquefied natural gas market internationally and its increase in
importance means that today there is effectively a spot market, as
there is in oil; and secondly, our increasing dependence on that spot
market. I cannot remember the exact figures; I think it is around 40%
that we need to buy of LNG, and that will progressively increase as the
availability of North Sea gas declines. So there have been two
changes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071699000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#13071699000105">As
far as we are concerned, these have a good consequence and a bad
consequence. The good consequence is that we shall probably never get
really short of gas. We have two important gas terminals in the UK and
should be able to import what we need. The down side is that we are
exposed to the vacillation of global prices. For example, when
Fukushima happened there was a massive spoke in global gas prices
because people realised that Japan would require a great deal more gas.
We would be exposed to other international pressures of that kind, as
well as the seasonal variation of the surplus in the summer and the
inadequacy of supply in
winter<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T16:55:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

is worth going into the economic detail of this at all today. However,
one or more companies are interested in exploring this from a
commercial point of view. I have discussed this with DECC officials,
who were extremely helpful. It is clear that DECC, Ofgem and the
national grid have been very concerned about supply availability. That
has been their main concern, rather than the question of price, which
has really come in in a big way
recently<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T16:56:16"></hs_TimeCode>. The
first of two comments from DECC officials was, “We do not think
that this will be commercial”. With respect, that is not their
decision. If a business thinks that it might be commercial, that is
what we should test. The other comment was, “We think we might
be able to do this without an amendment anyway, with existing
powers”, but I could not get a definitive decision on
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T16:56:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071699000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#13071699000107">The
important thing is that we know from discussions with at least one
company that, if there was something in the Bill which allowed the
Secretary of State at his or her discretion to use the capacity
mechanism or the contract-for-difference mechanism within the Bill to
purchase gas under prescribed circumstances, that would be sufficient
for the companies concerned to approach potential investors again with
a better proposition, with a view to coming to the Minister to explore
what might be arranged. It is not clear that this will be feasible, or
that it will make sense to use this mechanism. It is simply a little
bit of

the Government do not take this initiative, no one else will. Gas
suppliers do not care. They simply pass on

Jenkin of Roding:</Member></B> My Lords, I was happy to add my name to
the amendment. I see it more as a vehicle for promoting a short
discussion, which I think we shall have, rather than something that

has made that

debated in successive energy Bills the need for the United Kingdom to
increase its storage capacity. We have far less than other countries. I
have always been met with the argument, to which the noble Lord, Lord
Oxburgh, referred, that we have so many different sources of supply
that we do not need the same levels of storage as other countries. The
mistake that we have been making, and I certainly plead guilty to this,
is that we have seen it in terms of security of supply,
whereas—as I think the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, makes clear and
I would argue—we are really arguing about price, not
supply<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T16:28:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

gas market over the past two years, 2011-12 and 2012-13, it is pretty
level for most of the season. The price rises slightly towards the
autumn, and then in December, February and March there are sudden
spikes and it goes up to sometimes two and a half times the normal
rate. That is what happens to world gas markets during the winter: the
demand substantially exceeds the supply and the result is that the
price goes shooting up—not for long but it does—and the
companies have no option but to pay it and immediately pass it on to
the consumers in higher prices.</hs_para>

storage whereby you could build up the supplies during the summer and
release them during the winter so that you are not dependent on the
huge spikes in world gas prices, it would protect consumers. I see this
whole question of storage as being much more about protecting the
consumer market against sudden spikes in prices, rather than any
shortage of supply. I do not see any risk of there being a shortage of
supply but it is perfectly clear that we have had very substantial
spikes in prices.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071699000113" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#13071699000113">I took the

sufficient gas storage last winter to maintain gas prices close to
average winter prices (~70p/therm) rather than seeing prices spike to
over £1.50/therm it would have saved costs to the UK economy of
between £300-400 million. This is the sort of saving/protection
that should be foremost in the Government’s
mind”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="13071699000123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#13071699000123">This
is something that should not be ignored. I am not suggesting that there
is any particular solution to this. If the market could be persuaded
that this is a proper thing to do—I have heard of a project
involving storage in a depleted offshore gas field; I think it is
called Deborah—that could provide the vehicle for the kind of
storage that we are talking about, which would save consumers the kind
of price hikes that they have had to face in the
past.</hs_parafo>

interesting point. A very interesting study was published this
morning—there may have been reference to it in the
press—by a very well known academic, Nick Pidgeon at Cardiff
University, who looked at public attitudes to all this. His synthesis
report is called <I>Transforming the UK Energy System: Public Values,
Attitudes and Acceptability</I>. It is a long report and I do not
propose to read more than one sentence of the executive
summary—well, two sentences—but it has relevance to the
discussion we are having. The report
says:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13071699000143" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#13071699000143">“While
‘energy security’ as a term was not salient to people,
the range of concerns that it encompassed (geopolitical issues, energy
shortages, black outs, unaffordable prices) did evoke strong reactions.
Energy security is particularly closely linked in public perceptions to
affordability because it relates to concerns about personally not being
able to access energy services, while concern about national level
insecurity in supplies of fossil fuels was seen as a symptom of the
problems of fossil fuel
dependency”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="13071699000115" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#13071699000115">In
other words, security is not seen primarily as “We are going to
run out” but as an issue of affordability. This is spelt out at
some length in Nick Pidgeon’s report. It is the product of more
than a year’s work by him and a team of academics, and it is
something to which we should give some
attention.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13071699000116" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#13071699000116">So,
in addition to the general point that the question of storage relates
to price rather than to capacity or the question of running out, so it
is also associated in the public mind with affordability. That is why,
if we can level out the prices by encouraging the industry to invest in
more storage, we would find it valuable on both accounts: it would be
valuable in terms of reducing cost but also in reconciling public
opinion to some of the difficulties that we have faced in the past of
sudden spikes in energy
prices<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T17:05:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Lord Oxburgh and Lord Jenkin, for tabling this amendment. I confess
that this is not an area where I have a great deal of expertise, so
really I just have some questions to add to the debate. I am
sympathetic to the desire for government oversight to ensure that gas
prices can be levelled out. Demand seems to be very seasonal and
storage is an obvious way of helping to smooth out prices. I suppose my
question is: to what extent has the department done any analysis of why
the private sector is not doing this? It should be in its interests to
secure cheaper prices, so you would expect there to be an incentive to
invest in more storage.</hs_para>

which is related to that, is: to what degree do the powers of the
regulator—our party’s views on the regulator are well
known, but this is a genuine question—extend upstream? Does
Ofgem have a power to look at fairness of pricing in the supply of gas,
meaning before it reaches the distribution network? There is a high
degree of vertical integration in the energy sector, and there are some
companies that control the extractive processes, the distribution and
then the use of the product. When you have that degree of vertical
integration, there is the potential for unfair pricing, or self-serving
that could lead to less transparent
pricing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T17:07:05"></hs_TimeCode>. That is
a genuine question. Does the regulator consider the potential for those
vertically 
<?notus-xml column=244?>integrated companies, right the way up to extractive? Does it cover
that? If it does not, it should. I look forward to the answer on
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T17:07:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

exposed to ideas around renewable gas, by which I mean syngas, which is
generated from other carbon sources than the hydrocarbons found in
natural gas. This area seems to have been overlooked by successive
Governments. It would be helpful to hear the latest thinking on
renewable gas, particularly its role in helping to hedge against high
natural gas prices. My understanding is that gasification technology
and pyrolysis in particular are now maturing as technologies
and helping to deliver alternative sources of heating gases for the
variety of uses that you can use gas for. Those are my

Verma:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord
Oxburgh, and my noble friend Lord Jenkin for prompting the debate on
gas storage. The noble Lords’ proposal is timely, coming
precisely as the Government are thinking about these issues. The GB gas
market is one of the best functioning and most liquid in the world, and
has brought forward significant investment in the past decade. This has
expended our infrastructure to the point where our input capacity alone
can meet 189% of our annual needs, and it has spare capacity to respond
flexibly to price signals to deliver gas to our market from a diverse
range of sources and routes. It has also increased storage in terms of
overall capacity, where we have seen a 25% increase in the past decade,
and even more so in terms of deliverability—the amount of gas
that can be delivered to the grid each day to cope with volatile
demand. Once two recently completed fast-cycling storage projects are
counted, along with a further two projects under construction, storage
deliverability has doubled in the past 10 years. The growth in input,
capacity and flexible storage delivered by the market provides the
additional flexibility we will need to help meet variable demand for
heating requirements on peak winter days in severe weather conditions,
or for the power sector, where gas is likely to be called on to respond
flexibly to intermittent generation sources such as
wind<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T17:10:00"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T17:10:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

complacent or averse to making appropriate legislative changes to
improve our gas security. Indeed, it was part of our coalition
agreement to do so. In relation to gas security, the Energy Act 2011
conferred on Ofgem new powers to sharpen the incentives on gas market
participants to secure gas supplies. Ofgem has been consulting on
potential reforms and is due to announce its final proposals very
shortly. We are also working within the EU to ensure adoption and
implementation of a variety of measures to enhance gas security through
a well functioning, integrated and transparent European gas market. For
example, the implementation of the third energy package has already
improved market integration across the EU, so that storage in other
countries such as Germany can respond to price signals sent by our own
market. In addition, the development of common gas codes provided for
by the third package will facilitate further gas trading across borders
according to pricing signals. The EU regulation on security of gas
supply requires member states to undertake regular assessments 
<?notus-xml column=245?>of their gas security and prepare plans to mitigate the risks they face,
as well as meeting supply and infrastructure
standards<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T17:11:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

investments in physical infrastructure are being made available to
enable gas to flow more freely around the EU. In addition, DECC is
working to maximise sustainable gas production from our North Sea and
unconventional gas resources. Furthermore, the Government have been
conducting a detailed review of whether further reforms—in
addition to those being considered by Ofgem—might be appropriate
and we intend to announce our decision in the coming
weeks<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T17:11:52"></hs_TimeCode>. In
reaching a decision, the Government will consider the physical and
price security arguments for intervening in the markets and whether any
of the potential interventions provide a cost-effective means of
improving the security of our
supply<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T17:12:06"></hs_TimeCode>.
Therefore, the Government may conclude that the interests of consumers
are best served by not intervening in the market.</hs_para>

our assessment is that all measures being considered—these
include the measures to promote gas storage envisaged by this
amendment—can already be implemented using existing powers. In
particular, Ofgem has powers under Section 7B(4)(a) of the Gas Act 1986
to introduce such licence conditions as it considers necessary or
expedient, having regard to Ofgem’s duties, which include the
promotion of the security of supply. It would also be possible for the
Secretary of State to make a direction under Section 7B(5)(a) of the
Gas Act 1986 setting out licenceholder
obligations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T17:13:05"></hs_TimeCode>.
Additionally, Ofgem can apply for an order to be made by the Secretary
of State under Section 41C of the Gas Act 1986 to make a new activity
such as gas storage a licence activity. Such an order made by the
Secretary of State may also provide any consequential changes to
primary and secondary
legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T17:13:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Lady Worthington, asked about the role of renewable gas. The Government
have plans to maximise the production of gas from all sources:
conventional, shale and renewable. She also asked whether the regulator
considers vertical integration and impacts on pricing. Yes, Ofgem
considers the impact on pricing in all its regulatory functions.
Therefore, the Government do not consider these amendments necessary

one of our recommendations was for the UK Government to examine the
potential for a regulatory framework to increase gas storage. The
Government’s written reply and what the Minister has said
indicate that a lot of thought has gone into this, but for the whole of
the energy sector it is about improving the flow and interconnectivity
of supplies of all sorts of energy across the EU. Can my noble friend

is doing on this? I know that I am rather bouncing my noble

this. I am certainly gratified to hear from the Minister how much
effort and concern the department has put into the question of gas
supply. However, we were more concerned about price security than about
supply security. That is the important point to emphasise. The Minister
said that she thought that additional powers were not necessary to
achieve this, but I am not entirely clear from what she said whether
that is the case.</hs_para>

effect, we are proposing a mechanism by which the private sector can
come to the Government and say, “Look, we can guarantee a
certain amount of gas at a particular price over a particular
period”. That would in fact be achieved by gas storage, but I do
not think that the Government need to get involved in it; all that they
need to do is make a deal with a company or group of companies to
supply gas in particular quantities at particular times. That is why
the capacity mechanism or the CFD mechanism would be extremely useful.
I am not clear that the Minister has the power to use those mechanisms
under the legislation as it is currently drafted, which is why I tabled
this amendment.</hs_para>

the Minister for the support that the department has given geothermal
energy recently. It has been slow and difficult but it is getting on to
the agenda, particularly in terms of the industrial renewable heat
initiative and the contracts-for-difference strike prices. It is
starting to appear far more regularly than previously without
prompting, which is very good. Geothermal is a technology that works
and I will not take a long time describing it because I am sure that
Members are all well aware of it. Globally, it is a very important
source of energy for hot water, direct heating and electricity
generation. As we mentioned in a previous sitting of this Grand
Committee, there have been discussions between Britain and Iceland over
the use of geothermal energy from that
area<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T17:20:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

easier when hot water comes to the surface of its own accord, as it
does in many parts of the world, such as New Zealand and Iceland. It is
different when one has to drill down five kilometres, 10 kilometres and
sometimes a very long way in order to circulate it and bring it up. In
the UK, there are examples of shallow geothermal energy but not much
deep geothermal energy yet. This technology is credible and possible.
It is a source of renewable heat that has a small footprint and acts as
a base load rather than being intermittent, which is why it can be
particularly attractive. Again, there is a choice between hot water and
heating or electricity
generation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T17:21:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

necessary? It is because this issue is a bit like the oil industry.
There are noble Lords here who know far more about the petroleum
industry than me. However, basically, when you have put a major
investment into drilling, as soon as you make your strike on a viable
geothermal hot water well, you do not want someone 100 yards along
buying the plot next door, extracting the water and then leaving you
with all the exploration costs and only half the benefit. That is why a
credible regulation infrastructure includes having a licensing regime
over a suitable area of land. I particularly emphasise that this does
not of its own right mean that there would be planning permission or
surface access. That would all have to be sorted out by the exploration
companies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T17:22:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716114000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#130716114000015">This
is a major area where Britain, particularly the south-west but other
areas of the UK as well, could benefit by building up its renewable
energy resources of heat and electricity. For that to move forward, we
must have a licensing system. I do not believe that there will be a
great cost to producing this. It has already happened in Ireland and
other parts of the world. In the past, we have had positive discussions
with Ministers about this but they have never got far—hence this
amendment. In due course, I look forward to hearing the

persistence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T17:23:30"></hs_TimeCode> in
tabling amendments on geothermal energy. He correctly identifies the
huge contribution that this could make to the UK’s energy mix. I
think this may be the third time that he has come forward with his
amendment. The last time was in February 2011 during Committee on the
previous Energy Bill. At that time, the Government had just slashed the
remaining £2 million of a £6 million
allocation for research from Labour’s time in office by
50%—plus ça change. Also at the time, the then Energy
Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Marland, explained that two ROCs already
in place were available for geothermal, which his department deemed to
be sufficient to bring forward investment. However, of course, he
rightly identified that it is not the ROCs that are important but the
regulations to maintain the returns for the
investor<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T17:24:37"></hs_TimeCode>. At
that time, the Minister spoke positively about this power source while
saying that DECC would continue to work on the complexities of
introducing a licensing system. That was well over two years ago.
Perhaps the Minister will update the Committee today on how those
regulations are
proceeding.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_16_PT_1/4E308E778B11F44CC029D6724BD31F8C93BCF6F5" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 16 July 2013">Tuesday,

noble friend and, I know, many in industry argue that a licensing

the UK sector is at an early stage of development, which makes it
difficult to gauge the impact of a licensing regime. The Government
accept my noble friend’s argument that the impact is likely to
be positive. The question is one of proportionality. At present, all
parts of UK law are essentially silent on the subject of heat from deep
below the earth’s surface. Any legislation would therefore
proceed from a blank page, and full licensing regimes are complex to
create. The legislation to do this in the Australian state of
Queensland  runs to more than 500 pages of primary legislation,
which suggests that the call on the time of this House would not be
trivial. The Atkins report will guide the Government’s position
on how best we may be able to help support the geothermal

First, in the county of Cornwall we actually have two planning

Worthington:</Member></B> We are now discussing the part of the Bill
that concerns the emissions performance standard. By way of background,
I thought it would be useful to recount where these provisions arise
from. It was in response to the Kingsnorth demonstrations, which were a
green group response to the threat of a new unabated coal plant being
built by E.ON. At that time, climate change concerns meant that there
was a great deal of public opposition to the idea that we would be
locking ourselves into many decades of unabated coal if a new plant
were to be
built.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716114000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#130716114000027">The
then Labour Government responded with a new planning restriction that
meant that all new coal plants would have to fit at least 300 megawatts
of carbon capture and storage, essentially closing the door on unabated
coal. The then Opposition stated that they would move to rule out new
unabated coal through the introduction of an emissions performance
standard. That was prompted in part by a visit by one of the shadow
Ministers to California, which is one of a number of US states that
already have emissions performance standards in place. When he became
Prime Minister, David Cameron stated that he would legislate—he
would put an EPS into an energy Bill—and 
<?notus-xml column=251?>consultation on that began, in conjunction with the rest of the energy
market reform package, in December 2010. Here we are today, talking
about the detail of that
proposal.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716114000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#130716114000028">The
Government did not get everything right in their first draft proposals.
One loophole that was quickly identified was that the plan was to give
exemptions to any plant fitting CCS. The fear was that this would mean
that large plants could be built with only a small portion of the
capacity being fitted with CCS. Representations were made. The
Government did listen and have closed the loophole so CCS plants will
now be caught by the
EPS.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716114000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#130716114000029">We have
tabled a number of amendments concerning the EPS. This amendment
addresses the concerns of the Carbon Capture &amp; Storage Association.
While accepting that plants with CCS will need to be compliant with the
EPS, there is a fear that if the industry were required to meet those
standards from day one, that would be unduly burdensome and could deter
investors. The association has asked that a period of grace of three
years be introduced during the commissioning and testing of the new
plant, when there would be a derogation of the EPS. This amendment has
been tabled to achieve that. We see that very much as part of a package
of measures, in conjunction with the EPS. I will shortly talk to two
more amendments that we support strongly, and I know that my noble
friend Lord Hanworth is going to speak to his amendments too. There is

great respect to the noble Lord who has just spoken. It is not right to
say that there is no place in the world where CCS is working. A couple
of years ago, some of us paid a visit to the BP research centre at
Sunbury, where we were given a very interesting demonstration of their
plant in Algeria. BP is extracting gas from very widespread gas
deposits, stretching over perhaps 20 to 25 miles in various pockets.
There is a substantial refining operation that includes CCS, and the
resultant CO<Sub>2</Sub> that is extracted is then pumped straight back
into the gas reservoirs from which the gas has been extracted. The gas
supplied for the market is then piped to the coast and goes across the
Mediterranean. The noble Lord, Lord Kerr, will perhaps be able to
explain his gestures. It is a single plant, I accept that, but it has
been made to work and it is economic for the company that operates that
gas field in Algeria.</hs_para>

CCS is very important. While most of us here—I am happy to note
that there have been some notable exceptions in previous Committee
sessions—are in favour of decarbonisation and the UK becoming a
leader of the world in renewable energy, I think we would all hope that
we can become leaders in the world in CCS because, frankly, there are
huge economic possibilities if we can pull it off. China is a very good
example; contrary to the often-put theories of the noble Lord, Lord
Lawson, China is deeply concerned about climate change. The Chinese
actually produce a new nuclear power station every week but still have
more energy produced by wind than nuclear energy, and they are
concerned.</hs_para>

China’s ravenous need for more and more power means that it has
found it difficult to produce that power without building more and more

one of the future supplies of gas, underground coal gas, could be the
cheapest way of removing the carbon dioxide—although, again, as
the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, said, these techniques have yet to be proven

hydrogen mix, which, as noble Lords will know, produces an effluent
made up mostly of water. UCG—underground coal gas—could
be a fuel of the future. If we can get CCS involved in UCG, it would be

pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill, concerns were raised around the
scope of the exemption provisions, in that the use of broad exemptions

there have been a number of developments since last year with our CCS

White Paper, <I>Planning Our Electric Future</I>, came out, the issue
of grandfathering the EPS—meaning that the limits created in law
should be allowed to be unchanged for plants below those

should last for 20 years. I am grateful for a briefing from the think
tank E3G, which pointed out that at that time the regulators said that
20 years of payback for a gas-fired power station was actually quite a
long time and that 10 years was usual for payback on investment. They
therefore suggested that a 15-year window for grandfathering would be

and the surprise joint Statement by Secretary of State Ed Davey and the
Chancellor, where it was announced that the EPS limit would remain
unchanged at 450 grams per kilowatt hour, all the way until
2025—a considerable increase on that level of grandfathering,
against what the regulator proposed and what was initially proposed in
the White Paper. Why was this? What had happened in the intervening
months? Quite clearly a grand bargain had been struck between the
department and the Treasury, and that grand bargain has been the cause
of a great deal of uncertainty. Essentially, it has allowed for two
competing philosophies and energy strategies to emerge. One strategy is
a dash for gas—unabated gas—which is obviously the
Chancellor’s preferred option, and the other is much more
sensible: the department’s policy of a mix of low-carbon
generation. Somewhere along the line, though, the department clearly
lost out in the arguments, and now we have an EPS that allows for
unabated gas all the way to 2045.</hs_para>

a decarbonisation objective—it is not clear that that will be

grandfathering period seems to go against the existing requirement that
all new thermal plants over 300 megawatts should be carbon capture and
storage-ready. That provision was put in there for a reason: we
anticipate meeting our targets through the application of CCS on
thermal plants. If a completely unabated dash for gas is allowed to
operate unimpeded until 2045, why should plants be made CCS-ready? It

sure that the Minister will come back with lots of arguments about this

to prevent us from exceeding our budgets, but I will speak to those
when we come to the final amendment in this group. Those arguments,
which I am sure will be around security of supply, costs and the like,
do not stack up. As I said before, the amendments that we are proposing
to the EPS clauses act as a package. We have been very encouraged by
the warm words and the acceptance of the logic behind the CCS amendment
that we have just discussed, and this is a part of that process. It is
not just about allowing CCS to have a grace period and a proving

Deben:</Member></B> My Lords, first, I thank the Minister for his
response to the previous debate, which was measured and extremely
encouraging. My problem with the issue that the noble Baroness has
raised is simply that were the late date to produce a very considerable
amount of gas-fired generation set at so late a date, we are seriously
suggesting that in six years we are going to meet an 80% reduction in
our emissions; that is what we are statutorily required to do. I say to
my noble friend that I have not yet seen any evidence that this helps
the other. This, after all, is a statement by the Government. It is not
a statutory requirement. We have a statutory requirement. I hope that
my noble friend takes this opportunity to explain to the Committee how
this particular date can possibly sit side by side with all the other
commitments of the
Government<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T18:01:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

is a very simple, quietly put, but absolute issue. If you look at all
the other things that the Government intend to do, and insist that they
are doing, they do not, could not and will not stand alongside this
date of 2044. That is six years before we have to achieve a statutory
requirement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T18:02:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

is hugely valuable to have the opportunity of raising this question
with the Minister. I recognise that he will not agree with the
amendment; I know perfectly well that that is not what is on his lists.
His problem is that the Government have so far been unable to explain
the disconnect between these two. I would not like to follow the noble
Baroness in her attempts to describe how this came about. The fact is
that it ain’t gonna stand up. The great thing about the Bill is
that we are trying to ensure that we have a real future basis for
action in order to meet our statutory requirements and the increasing
threat of climate change. Therefore, we ought to highlight to the
Government that this is not a matter of passing interest—a day
or two out, a year or two different. This is a fundamental flaw in the
present circumstances. The Minister will regret his position, because
the discussions should not be taking place here. This discussion should
have happened when it was announced. Many of us remember that no
discussion could have taken place because of the way in which the
announcement was
made<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T18:04:12"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T18:04:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716114000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#130716114000067">Any
policy which was consistent with a grandfathering situation leading to
2044 could not be consistent with the statutory requirements for the
reduction in emissions. Any policy consistent with the statutory
requirements for 2050’s reduction of 80% could not be consistent
with this statement about gas grandfathering. Because I have a great
desire that the coalition Government shall succeed in their claim to be
the greenest Government ever—a desire which I have independently
and as chairman of the climate change committee because I want any
Government to reach that goal—I say to the Minister that we
shall have to listen very carefully to what he says. So far no Minister
who has attempted to answer this question has been able to make these
two things consistent. As long as they are not consistent, Ministers
cannot blame industry outside. They have to ask themselves whether
there is a consistent policy or whether the policy is in fact right at

amendment. I will not repeat all the arguments that I and others have
already given for the 2030 decarbonisation target. I seem to remember
the Government’s response to that was, “Yes, probably a
good idea but not yet”. Frankly, their emissions target of 450
grams per kilowatt hour in 2044 is just laughable. Bearing in mind that
even if all our electricity is produced at that time by unabated gas,
in 2044 our emissions would be around 300 grams per kilowatt hour. I
cannot understand why this figure has been put in the Bill. It is
absurd to set such a target for

very late date here. It seems that this, perhaps ironically, is the one
area where I would hope to put a maximum, which might be 450, in
primary legislation but give the Secretary of State discretion to
tighten that standard through secondary legislation as years go by. I
would expect to do that in most other areas of life, perhaps through
European legislation for car emissions, white goods and all those
things where we expect to tighten emission and efficiency limits over
time. If a number is put in the Bill for the next 31 years,
obviously it could be changed by primary legislation but that would
take time and would be difficult. Rather than mess around with an EPS,
we might as well just say, “We want to stop any coal generating
after 2020 and we will let the rest of it do what we want”. That
is the effect of writing the Bill as it

Lords on ensuring that the UK remains an attractive option for those
looking to invest in a low-carbon electricity sector, and on the
importance of gas generation. Noble Lords have also noted that the key
to meeting that objective is providing investors with certainty about
the regulatory environment that will govern their
assets<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T18:13:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716116000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#130716116000008">The
Government’s gas generation strategy, published in December, set
out our view that, along with low-carbon generation, we expect gas
generation to continue to play a major role in our electricity mix over
the coming decades as we decarbonise our electricity system, providing
flexible back-up to increasing levels of intermittent generation. It
also said that we are likely to need 
<?notus-xml column=260?>significant investment in new gas plants, in part to replace older coal,
gas and nuclear plants as they are retired from the system, with much
of that investment likely to be in the 2020s. It is therefore vital
that we provide investors in new gas plants with the degree of
certainty needed to ensure investment comes forward. Certainty over the

in the argument. This is not just about grandfathering, as I read it,
it is about new plants in 2044. It will still only be 450. To get
investor certainty, yes, we need the grandfathering, because once you
have built the plants, as with cars, you are stuck with that. I would
accept that once you have built them you would expect them to go
through their normal life before any major refurbishment; you would
expect that to stay at the emissions limit applying when that plant was
first operated. However, this includes new plants, as I understand it,
right up to 2044. That is not related to investor certainty, because
plants at the moment would have grandfathering rights, but if we moved
this date later on we could have different rules, and that would not
affect investor

to be equipped with CCS while being above the level of carbon emissions
for a new gas plant. The 450-gram limit also provides some flexibility

Hanworth:</Member></B> My Lords, with the leave of  the
Committee, I will also speak to Amendment 51KA and to the other
proposed amendments to Clause 47. In the process of doing this, I am
sure that I will be echoing some of the things which have already been
said. It has been revealed that the Bill is utterly inconsistent in
this connection. It has been revealed that it is schizophrenic because
there seem to be two opposing factions driving the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T18:26:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

examining the implications of Clause 47. It declares a
formula for calculating an emissions limit for electricity generating
stations that is the product of three factors. The first factor is the
rate of CO<Sub>2</Sub> emissions in the grams per kilowatt hour of a
station running efficiently and at full capacity. The second factor is
the maximum capacity of the station. The third factor represents the
assumption that the plant will be operating for 85% of the available
hours.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="130716116000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#130716116000033">In
the discussion of these matters, attention has been concentrated on the
emissions rate but it is clear that this does not tell the full story.
The other assumptions also bear some examining. It seems unlikely that,
whenever it is running, the station will be operating at full capacity.
It is also unlikely that it will be in operation for 7,746 hours in the
year out of the total of 8,760 hours—that is, for 85 percent of
the time. The Committee can imagine a host of stations operating for
much less than 85% of the available time, all of which fulfil their
statutory limits as defined in the Bill, and all of which have actual
emission rates far in excess of the statutory rate. The consequence
would be an average rate of emissions that, likewise, exceeds by far
the so-called statutory
rate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716116000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#130716116000034">The
statutory rate of 450 grams may be compared with the emissions rate of
coal-fired stations and of stations employing combined-cycle gas
turbines. A DECC press release of March 2012 estimates the former at
800 grams of CO<Sub>2</Sub> per kilowatt hour and the latter at 400
grams per kilowatt hour. It follows that, whereas unabated coal-fired
stations fall foul of the limits, the combined cycle gas turbine will

declared in the Bill. Therefore, the  way is open for a second
instalment of the so-called “dash for gas”, which would
see virtually all new electricity generating plant taking the form of
combined cycle gas turbine equipment. Moreover, it has been widely
recognised that this is precisely the scenario envisaged by a powerful

other factors that would intrude on this scenario that ought to be
mentioned. The first is the existence of a carbon floor price, which is
a levy to be imposed on industries if the market price of carbon falls
below a certain level. Originally, coal was the only 
<?notus-xml column=265?>carbon source in question, but now oil and gas also fall within the
definition. If the floor price were to be used at a later stage as a
mechanism for achieving the decarbonisation of Britain’s
electricity-generating industry, an industry based on gas would bear a
heavy
burden<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T18:30:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716116000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#130716116000038">The
second factor to be considered is the EU emissions trading scheme. At
present this is barely operative, with the prices of the permits far
below a level that would impose an effective restraint on emissions. If
the scheme were to become fully operative, a heavy burden would fall on
the gas-powered electricity-generating industry; and this could be at a
time when international gas prices were escalating
hugely.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716116000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#130716116000039">Of<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T18:30:45"></hs_TimeCode>
course, as has been thoroughly emphasised, we must also consider our
obligation under the Climate Change Act to cut emissions by 80% by
2050. Clause 47, which declares a statutory rate of
emissions of 450 grams per kilowatt hour, effective until
2044, suggests that this obligation can be utterly disregarded. If
there is to be any chance of meeting the obligations of the Climate
Change Act, something far more stringent is required, as many speakers
have indicated.</hs_para>

amendments to Clause 47 propose that the allowable emissions rate
should be reduced to 300 grams per kilowatt hour and that
the allowance should extend no further than 2029. What is required is a
sequence of limits that become progressively more stringent as time
elapses. Such a regime of tightening limits is also required if we are
to send signals to encourage investment in renewable energy and in
carbon sequestration—assuming, of course, that the latter will
become an available and effective technology, which it is reasonable to

present, there is a hiatus in the investment in renewable energy.
Later, the Committee will have the opportunity to discuss the causes of
this failure. For the present, we might look at the adjacent page of
the Bill, where Clause 48 deals with the suspension of the emissions
limits in exceptional circumstances. The circumstances in question are
an electricity shortfall or a significant risk of an electricity
shortfall. As we all know, there is already a significant risk of a
shortfall. The impression given by Clause 48 is that the Government are
readily contemplating the abandonment of the emissions standards. In
accepting the amendment to Clause 47, they have the opportunity to
allay that
suspicion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T18:32:54"></hs_TimeCode>, and I

rightly said that the key issue, as we have been arguing right the way
through, is certainty for the future. Surely, if we are going to meet
the obligations laid before us under the Climate Change Act, we need to
make it possible for people to proceed along a sensible path. We have
carbon budgets that take us all the way to 2027—that is where we
are—yet we appear to have none of the underpinning activity 
<?notus-xml column=266?>to ensure that, side by side with that, the energy industry is able to
meet the requirements of those carbon budgets. However, Parliament has
passed those carbon budgets; they are part of the law of the land, as
part of a structure that Parliament decided upon. We ought to make the
point in this Committee that Parliament decided that as Parliament. It
was not the Government who decided on the Climate Change Act but
Parliament. Conservatives, Liberal Democrats, Scottish nationalists,
Welsh nationalists, Irish Protestants and Labour Members together said,
“This is a non-party issue. We as Parliament want this to
happen”. I am sure that my noble friend will know that in the
House of Commons there were but five votes against that Act, including
the two tellers.</hs_para>

right answer to this, but I say to my noble friend that we have to
recognise that unless we do something in this area, as in the previous
amendment, we stand challenged in defending the claim that we are
keeping to the law of the land. That is the issue for this Committee.
Our job is to ensure that we obey the law of the land, and the law is
very clear here. It has targets and budgets up to 2027, and I do not
see how you can meet those if at the same time you are continuing and
creating energy sources that are manifestly not in line with that. I
hope my noble friend will be able to say at least that he will take
this away and look at it again. Any other answer puts this Committee

this section for some time, but I feel that I should follow my noble
friend Lord Deben in this matter. The truth is that the 2050 target for
the electricity generating industry is zero. That is the reality of the
economy that we have to head into. To assume that we can have gas
plants running at this level five years short of that is perhaps
acceptable if they are constructed in the next short timescale, with a
view to them going out of use in 2045, but it will not be acceptable

that.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="130716116000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#130716116000046">The
purpose of having a discussion in a Committee like this on a Bill like
this is to enable Members to raise these types of inconsistencies and
for the Government to say, and I hope that the Minister will:
“There is actually a point here. We will go away and think very
seriously about this”. If gas generation is to continue past
2050, it will have to have CCS fitted to it and will have to work
pretty well perfectly. My opinion—I think I said this at Second
Reading—is that we should stop messing about with CCS in coal
because it is not going to get us there. It may get us there with gas,
or we have to have other forms of generation. That is now the law of
the land and we are not going to set that aside. Frankly, one would
have to say to our noble friends speaking for the department that if
they flatly reject this, they are asking for amendments to be brought
forward on Report that will then have to be voted on, and I would
rather they did not do that. They ought to be able to arrive at a more

Worthington:</Member></B> My Lords, in speaking to the amendments
tabled by the noble Viscount, Lord Hanworth, I will not go over what I
have previously said. I feel strongly that this aspect of the Bill has
not had the degree of scrutiny that it deserves. Our Committee has gone
through it in far greater detail than was achieved in the Commons,
where only a cursory debate was had. With the number of noble Lords who
have spoken, we clearly have expressed concern that the Government have
not quite got it right in their current formulation.</hs_para>

numbers and dates written into it. That makes it an incredibly
inflexible tool that would need more primary legislation to change. I
do not believe that the levels here were the product of a great deal of
consideration, analysis and thought; I believe that they came out of a
hurried meeting between two departments with different views, and to
have them enshrined in primary legislation seems reckless. I encourage
the Government to think carefully before pushing for these matters to
stay unamended in primary legislation. Perhaps it would be better for
them to be dealt

EPS focuses on helping us to meet our commitment to preventing new
unabated coal-fired power stations being built by limiting the
emissions of any new coal plant to around half of what they would
otherwise be. The EPS supports the planning requirement that any new
coal-fired power station must be equipped with CCS on at least at least
300 megawatts of its generating capacity, and will ensure that any new
coal plant is constructed and operated in a way consistent with our

this country’s security of supply and impact on

limit would restrict the running hours of new and cleaner gas plant

addition to introducing a significant risk to investors, the 300 limit
could, under certain scenarios, lead to increased emissions and costs.
For example, if new gas plants were restricted in their operating hours
by the 300 limit, that could lead to the need to use less efficient
coal or gas plants to make up the shortfall in operating hours in order
to provide power for the country. This is a scenario that I am sure the
noble Viscount does not intend to create through his amendment, but I
think that there is a danger of that.
Setting<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T18:43:54"></hs_TimeCode> the EPS

effect of course is in deforestation in developing countries. It was
previously estimated that some 20% of global emission were produced by
deforestation—by burning trees while they were standing in

it remains a major amount, and that is clearly adding to the stock of

low-carbon route map for our generation suggests that by about 2017 we

instead<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T18:49:20"></hs_TimeCode>. This is
a major change to make while we are still trying to understand the
whole-carbon cycle effect of that change. The amount of biomass
required to feed that capacity of some 6 gigawatts is of course much
larger than our own harvest of wood within the

necessarily oppose importing by ship from abroad. That is a very
efficient and low-carbon way of bringing fuel into the UK, depending on
where it comes from and on its road routes at either end. What concerns
me is to understand the thinking of the Government on looking at the
whole life cycle of biomass, in terms of it being used on that scale,
within the United Kingdom. As I understand it, there is a rule before
the ROCs can apply—and future financial benefits for renewable
energy—stating that the biomass must be at least 60 % of
emissions, as previously.</hs_para>

are the Government looking at this now? Can the Minister describe the
situation with European legislation, as I understand there are moves in
this area to restrict or reduce the amount of fuel or biomass that can
be used towards renewable targets? I want to 
<?notus-xml column=270?>understand how this Bill will fit within that potential scenario.
Unfortunately, in many ways I am now convinced that it is not quite as
straightforward as it was and that burning biomass is not a zero-carbon
sum. If you reduce the stock of wood in the world, it will take some
time to replace it. If that is within the current forestry limits or
within the current limits in cutting down and using that wood, then
that is sustainable. However, if we are going to increase it beyond
that amount, then that sustainability becomes questionable. We need to
pay rather more attention to these factors than we have done in the
past, and I look forward to the Minister’s explanation of how
the Government are looking at this and how we can ensure that this
harvest is sustainable over its whole life rather than necessarily
looking at it as a carbon-free, completely renewable resource for
electricity generation. I beg to

Deben:</Member></B> I should say to my noble friend Lord Teverson that
having not been perhaps been easy in my comments up to now, on this I
say to him that this is a real and very difficult issue that I am sure
the Government are thinking about very hard. This is because levels of
sustainability differ in different circumstances. The Committee on
Climate Change discusses this on a regular basis because it is
extremely hard to keep up with the developing circumstances. What we do
not want is to think that we have changed to a low-carbon alternative
and discover that actually it is nothing of the sort. That is the worry
that people
have<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T18:53:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

worry, which is that we are facing ever greater shortages of food. The
one thing we do not want is to have a situation in which our battle
against climate change—climate change itself causes some of the
shortages of food—is then seen as a kind of competition with the
provision of food. That is of course why biomass in those circumstances
is so complex a matter. However, I say to my noble friend that no one
has a simple answer to this and I am sure he is not going to give us
one today; we would not expect one.</hs_para>

one has a simple answer because we all started off on the wrong basis.
For example, the green movement was very much in favour of biomass. It
was therefore almost unquestionably a good thing until they began to
recognise the potential downside. That meant there was a huge swing to
the opposite direction. If we are not careful, we will find ourselves
in extremes rather than finding some sensible place for the pendulum to
stop.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="130716116000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0001.htm#130716116000068">It is
also true that there are many vested interests in this area. The
farming industry saw it as a wonderful way in which it could increase
its opportunities of reaching markets because this was a new area that
farmers could exploit. Of course, as food prices go up and their
returns from food production become greater, it is a real issue for
them too. While in the United States, I have to declare that I had a
visit from the representatives of the
so-called—“so-called” because I cannot prove this,
as I will explain shortly—sustainable forestry industry. They
came to explain to me, as chair of the Committee on Climate Change,
that they were unhappy about what we had said about these
issues.  I said, “Do you have forests that are
independently certified?”. “No,” they said,
“but we know it’s all right”. I cannot accept that
as a reasonable response. 
<?notus-xml column=271?>In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T18:56:00"></hs_TimeCode> the world out

I say to my noble friend: this is a difficult area. None of us expects
him to have an easy answer, because no one else has. However, I hope he
understands that we will have to look at this during the Bill and to
come back to it on Report, simply because things are moving so fast
that we need to be sure that we have done everything we can to protect
the Government from later assertions that they have encouraged the
substitution of one form of emission creation with another form of

this issue carefully. Before my noble friend Lord Ridley had a very
provocative article published in <I>The Times</I> three or four weeks

a number of other sources, which said that he was talking
rubbish.</hs_para>

am sorry that my noble friend is not here today: perhaps there will be
another opportunity for him to defend his view here. However, I do not
think I am doing him an injustice when I say that his view is based on
the proposition that a biomass that depends on the growing of trees
cannot in any way be regarded as a renewable source. I said to him that
they grow again and that if forests are properly managed—and
many of them are, not least by the Forestry Commission in this country
but also in Scandinavia and so on—the turnaround is about 30
years. He said no, it is 90 years. He may well know a great deal more
about this than I
do<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T18:58:05"></hs_TimeCode>. I have so
far subscribed to the view that when a biomass source is used as a fuel
for energy, if it can reproduce itself over a period—and of
course, as they grow, trees reabsorb the carbon dioxide that they emit
during combustion—then it is a renewable source.</hs_para>

was worried at one point about the importation of timber and its threat
to the health of our forestry, against the background of ash dieback. I
arranged an interview with the head of the trade association in America
that exports manufactured wood pellets, a large quantity of which come
to this country. I have also talked to the companies that burn them,
notably Drax, which is converting part of its coal-burning to biomass,
as is Eggborough, a different kind of company but one also in the
process of a substantial conversion to biomass. They base it entirely
on the import of manufactured wood pellets from reputable sources in
America or Scandinavia. I was completely satisfied that the
manufacturing process totally eliminates the possibility of the
importation of any funguses or other diseases that affect timber here.
I have not heard any suggestion that if it is properly handled there is
any risk in that
direction.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_16_PT_1/373293BF4755630ED27F70542D9F652786EF8A3F" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 16 July 2013">Tuesday,

the other thing they have to ensure is that in the course of
transportation the wood pellets never get wet; otherwise, they have to
use a great deal 
<?notus-xml column=272?>of energy getting them dry again. Indeed, if one studies the export
arrangements in America, the import arrangements here and the transport
arrangements by rail to the power stations, a great deal of effort is
made to ensure that they are always under cover and never get wet,
because it destroys the efficacy of the fuel

absolutely no objection to deriving some  of our energy supply
from that source. Indeed, the Government have accepted that, because
they are going along with—and indeed providing subsidies
for—the conversion of coal-fired power stations to burning

Teverson may well be right that we need to come back to this, to look
at it overall. As my noble friend Lord Deben said, it is not as simple
as it was thought to be at first glance and opinion has swung violently

now campaigning passionately against any form of biomass. That cannot

what I have discovered so far, the major uses of biomass as a renewable
source in this country are unexceptional. If they are properly managed
and properly replanted and so on, these trees are fine. I have tabled
an amendment, of which I have given my noble friend notice, concerning
the problem of people substituting a subsidised energy use for normal
wood products manufacture. We will come to that when we reach Clause
21. That is a separate issue. It is not an environmental issue; it is a
question of fair trading and fair competition. Nevertheless, there are
these issues and we need to keep a very careful eye on them.

of importation of wood chips is a very different matter. There you can
have the importation of the kind of diseases from which our forestry
may well suffer. That has to be very carefully monitored. We cannot
have a repeat of Dutch elm disease or ash dieback, and now there is the
threat to oak trees. If this country is anything, it is a country where
we have long basked in the glory of our wonderful trees and that really
has to be a top priority. I agree with my noble friend Lord Teverson

a very small business which promotes power generation for individual
factories and distilleries based entirely on the wood that is left
behind after the forest has been commercially felled and taken away.
There is always a mass of stuff left behind that can be gathered up and
used to generate fuel. I am sure that that is a great deal easier than
replanting the forest once the rubbish has been removed. Their business
is based entirely on removing the rubbish 
<?notus-xml column=273?>and burning it. That seems to me an admirable thing to do, and it is

was not going to speak because of time, but the noble Lord, Lord
Jenkin, has reminded me of a presentation that I had some years ago. I
may have got the town wrong but I think it was Barnsley. It was in a
coalfield area. The local authority there used coal for the district
heating in its blocks of flats. I will always remember the description
of the terrible mess that the coal dust made everywhere; the women who
lived in the flats hated it because they always got coal dust in their
curtains. The story is that they changed over to local biomass, which
was interesting biomass because it was entirely what they gleaned from
trimming and pruning trees and shrubs in the local area. Enough was
produced, so it did not have to travel a long way but was enough to
replace the coal in these blocks of flats, and the ladies with their
curtains were delighted because they did not get soot any more. That
has stayed in my

sustainability, I hope my that noble friend will understand the concern
that the thrust of these amendments to the EPS is covered elsewhere and
may risk creating undue complexity and uncertainty for investors. The
purpose of the EPS is to place a limit on the carbon emissions from
fossil fuel power plants. In addition to the reasons I have set out,
installations which use biomass exclusively as their fuel are
specifically excluded from the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.
Consequently, choosing not to cover biomass under the EPS treats it in
a manner consistent with the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.</hs_para>

Teverson:</Member></B> My Lords, I take the emissions performance
standard very seriously, as I did at Second Reading. An astounding
fact, if we have one in terms of energy generation, is the resurgence
of coal to its position of dominance of electricity generation in the
UK. During 2012, 43% of electricity was generated by coal; gas, the
previous number one, went down to 28%; and nuclear was at 20%. When the
Climate Change Bill was passed into an Act, I do not believe that any
of us would ever have expected that, as part of this programme towards
a 2050 decarbonisation of our economy as a whole, in a few
years’ time we would be looking at coal being so important to us
in terms of our electricity generation and our
economy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T19:17:19"></hs_TimeCode>. That
concerned me greatly but we have had assurance that, due largely to the
large combustion plant directive, coal will disappear over the next few
years as the remaining coal plants in the United Kingdom have to close
down, as a large number already have. We all felt very secure in that
knowledge and in the fact that that would
happen<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T19:17:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130716116000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0002.htm#130716116000096">However,
there is a significant concern if the price of coal stays very low in
comparison with gas. I see no reason why gas prices should come down in
the short term. Whatever happens with shale or whatever else, it seems
pretty likely that gas prices will continue to go up. There will then
be incentives for generating companies that own coal plants to modify
them to comply with the large combustion plant directive through
getting rid of their sulphurous and nitrous gases.
Of<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T19:18:32"></hs_TimeCode> course, that
directive does not deal with carbon emissions. They are completely
separate. But there is an avenue, and now a potentially economic
avenue, for those coal plants to comply with that directive. They can
continue under this Bill to generate coal well into the future until
finally they need to have their boilers replaced, at which point the
Bill very effectively says that you have to comply with 450 grams until
2044<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T19:19:15"></hs_TimeCode>. Therefore,
we have had a
pathway<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T19:19:16"></hs_TimeCode>. The way
out of that was meant to be carbon capture and storage. If we had
abated coal and it went below that emissions limit, that was a way
forward and coal was legitimate within that context. Therefore, I am
very concerned that this potential loophole—or gap, or
pathway—for coal generation to continue needs to be sealed once
and for all.</hs_para>

indeed that my noble friend the Minister, if I could quote him from a

CCS”. Absolutely—that is what we are here for. For some
reason we cannot put that plain language in the Bill. We could just say
that, could we not? But we are not; we are giving it a fair chance but
trying to make it impossible. I am asking the Minister if he would

previously described the measures that have been put down as a package.
This is an essential component of that. I go so far as to say that I
would be less concerned about the gas grandfathering if this amendment
was accepted. This amendment addresses a very real risk and need. My
worry about our current 
<?notus-xml column=277?>policy on coal is that a degree of complacency has started to take root,
based on the idea that all the old coal is simply going to shut up shop
and quietly disappear from the grid. Having worked for a power company
that owns coal-fired power stations, I can tell your Lordships that
these are incredibly profitable assets and the companies will do all
they can to keep them operating for as long as they can.</hs_para>

the media and elsewhere, and in statements from the Government, about
the lights going out and about this terrible problem of coal-fired
power stations closing. Actually, as I have said before, the 8
gigawatts of coal that was required to close under the large combustion
plant directive has already gone so we do not have a problem in the
short term. In fact, we have 20 gigawatts of old coal carrying on. That
is made up of 12 plants—the dirty dozen—that will be
carrying

process of the Bill started, the premise was that new coal was the
greatest threat. In fact, it says that in the consultation document.
But that is fundamentally wrong. When it comes to managing carbon, old
coal is far and away the worst source of emissions. These plants were
built in the late 1960s and early 1970s—some of them are older
than I am—and they have well paid back their initial
investments. They have made the successive companies that have owned

Worthington:</Member></B> I could not agree more. These dirty dozen
plants have very low efficiency and very high carbon intensity. They
have been made more carbon-intensive by the fitting of scrubbing
equipment to meet the requirements of the large combustion plant

electricity when it comes to
carbon.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307172000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0002.htm#1307172000007">The
assumption was that those plants would be closing under the next round
of air quality standards. However, the world is moving quite quickly
and gas prices are at such a level and coal prices so low that it is

on.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307172000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-gc0002.htm#1307172000008">I am sure
there will be many arguments in the Minister’s notes that will
tell him that closing the plants is something that the Government could
not possibly do and there are too many risk associated with it. The
first will probably be, “Oh, well, the lights will go
out”. That would absolutely and categorically not be a result of
the amendment. The amendment would merely place a carbon constraint on
plants that are seeking a significant life extension beyond the period
for which we currently anticipate them to operate. This would put us
much more in line with the Californian legislation that we have based
the EPS on. The Californian 
<?notus-xml column=278?>provisions apply if a company makes a significant investment in an
existing plant that would seek to extend its life beyond five years.
That is an important provision that is missing here, in our
interpretation of the EPS.</hs_para>

the lights going out. As we have discussed, the EPS is drafted in such
a way as to allow flexibility. It is an annual limit that is averaged
out, so these plants would not necessarily close but they would not be
able to base-load. That is the significant difference. Plants investing
in life extensions today must accept that they cannot base-load

sure the Minister will receive will say: “Well, they’re
old plants; they’re reaching the end of their lives”. I
would just point out that Uskmouth power station, owned by SSE and
built in 1961, will be 60 years old in 2020. These plants can and do
operate for very long periods, and they do not need boiler replacements
in order to do so. They could replace every other element of the

question that will be raised is that the amendment is not needed:
“We do not need this to apply to old coal because we have other
mechanisms designed to force coal off the system”, and among
them I am sure the carbon price will be listed. I would just say that
the carbon price is not a credible policy when it comes to investors
making decisions on the lives of their coal plants, for a number of
reasons: it is a financial Bill measure, it has no longevity and it has
no future path beyond two years. I have heard from former generators
that they cannot even sell their power on a PPA two years in advance
from thermal plant because of the degree of uncertainty about carbon
pricing. That is not going to force these plants to
close<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T19:27:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

maintained, the reason why they will not close is that these dirty
dozen are equally distributed among the existing vertically integrated
companies. The reason why that is significant is that if one of them
opts one plant in, they may as well all opt them in because the
companies can all just pass the cost of carbon through to their
customers. As we have previously discussed, there is no genuine
competition, so as soon as one opts in the other five may as well
follow. Actually, it is five out of the six; Centrica has no coal. The
other five, though, can all safely opt in a plant and pass on the costs
without fear of competitive distortion. So, even with a price, that is
not going to work with regard to ensuring that they are

“Well, you’re simply going to push up the costs to the
consumer. Coal is cheap and we need to keep it running”.
Actually, this is the cheapest way of staying within our carbon
budgets. I have mentioned it before but the climate change committee
has identified that we can save between 200 grams and 250 grams per
kilowatt hour by doing nothing other than reversing the merit order of
gas and coal. That is exactly what we are seeking to do. People say
this will push the costs up but it in fact it is much cheaper than
overinvesting in new capacity if it is not

carbon floor price is already pushing up the price. The difference

in the merit order. With the EPS, though, the price would go up only if

system, certainly not in a country with legally binding carbon targets
which we have to meet. Every one of these stations which stays open
displaces two gas stations. They are twice as emitting as gas, if not
more. If you want a future with a greater role for gas, you have to
accept that you cannot have that and have, certainly, around 8

Worthington:</Member></B> My Lords, the Minister mentioned in his reply
that under the gas strategy only two plants would be operating. I am
rather dismayed to hear that. I am not a great fan of the gas strategy
at any time but that has made me even less confident in its analysis.
It is absolutely clear that already four plants have opted in to fit,
to be compliant with the IED regulations. That is considerably more
than two. Once they have fitted that filtration equipment, they will
have a capital cost that they will want to see returned. They are not
going to suddenly decide to shut up shop in 2025. There is a high
degree of complacency, based on the fact that the analysis and 
<?notus-xml column=282?>the modelling that were done did not take into account the following
important factors.
Coal<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T19:40:30"></hs_TimeCode> prices are
low and are going to stay low. If you own a coal-fired power station
today, you can see pound signs ringing in your register for many years
to come and that is a huge incentive to comply and go forward with the
air quality standards. Also, the filtration equipment is very likely to
come down in cost, making that equation even more favourable. Finally,
with capacity market payments coming—we will have a chance to
debate that on Thursday—that is another financial incentive to
keep these plants running. The Government are being complacent and I
urge the Minister to think
again<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-16T19:40:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Teverson:</Member></B> I thank the noble Baroness for her expert
comments on this amendment. I admit I am perplexed by my noble
friend’s response and I will go through it in a very moderate
way. All this amendment would do is to put everything back to where the
Government actually want it to be, where the large combustion plant
directive, conveniently, gradually but fairly imminently shuts down
unabated coal. It seems that that has always been a Government
assumption. However, because of the high price of gas to coal, suddenly
being compliant with that directive becomes economic and so we have a
different situation. All this is doing is putting it back to where we
thought it was, probably when this Energy Bill started out in its long
course through the department and stages of consultation and into
Parliament.</hs_para>

also seems to me that ironically, in this area, it is a win for the
Treasury and a win for DECC. From the Treasury’s point of view,
if there is certainty about coal going out, there is much more
certainty for gas investors coming in—far more than probably a
2044 guarantee on investment. From a DECC point of view, we are
actually making sure that those high carbon emissions that come out of
old coal and that we were not expecting at least fall out of the system
pretty quickly. Therefore, we have a win for all those sides as well as
for climate change and we get back to what the Government’s
policy originally seemed to be.

Baroness mentioned, we have the added benefit that in terms of energy
security, because of the way that the EPS works, these plants can still
be available over short periods of time, but not base load, to meet
potential blackouts or brownouts within the electricity markets. So we
have a win there as well. While I understand my noble friend’s
arguments, I just think that they do not actually reflect government
policy—not Treasury policy, DECC policy or the coalition
agreement policy. Somehow we need to get out of that. However I am very
keen to continue discussions, particularly in this area. In the mean
time, in anticipation of that, I withdraw my amendment.</hs_para>

in scientific research, an ambitious but achievable goal. We recognise
that the use of animals in scientific research is a small but essential
function in improving our understanding of medical and physiological
conditions, the research and development of new medicines and the
development of leading edge medical technologies and is necessary to
ensure the safety of our environment. Scientific advances in knowledge
and new technologies present significant opportunities to replace
animal use, reduce the use of animals, and, where animal use is
unavoidable, to refine the procedures involved so as to minimise
suffering (3Rs). It is  key that we take these opportunities to
ensure that replacement, refinement and reduction in the use of animals
is integral to conducting animal research recognising that this not
about baseline numbers. The statistics published today are evidence of
a significant reduction in the use of animals for shellfish toxin
testing. In 2009 the number of mice used in this test totalled 7670
whereas in 2012 this has been reduced to 42. This is a prime example of
successfully implementing a non-animal alternative.</hs_para>

announced the science-led programme being taken forward by the National
Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in
Research (NC3Rs), which is primarily funded by BIS, and I am pleased to
report a number of significant advances in this area. Over the past
12 months, the NC3Rs have secured new funding which has
helped launch the first 3Rs evaluation framework; made the biggest
single investment in 3Rs research to date with new grant awards of
£5.1 million; supported new approaches to replace animal use
with £750k for interdisciplinary awards between toxicologists
and mathematicians; and awarded four Fellowships for exceptional
early-career scientists developing models and tools with reduced
reliance on animal research and improved welfare. The wider programme
encompasses collaborative work led by The Home Office and BIS, between
Government Departments and agencies, the Home Office Inspectorate, the
research community in both academia and industry, and others with
relevant animal welfare interests. Significant progress has been made
in developing a cross-Government action plan and we intend to provide a
statement in the autumn that details our agreed plan and describes
progress to date on the Coalition agreement.</hs_para>

Minister responsible for ASPA I was extremely concerned to read the
allegations of non-compliance at Imperial College London (ICL)
published by the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV).
The use of living animals in scientific procedures which may cause
pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm is strictly regulated under
ASPA and I am determined to ensure that animal research is carried out
humanely and only when necessary. The provision of a licence to an
individual not only entrusts them to uphold their legal obligations but
also to behave in ways which ensure the highest standards of animal
care and welfare at all times. I take any reports suggesting that
individuals or establishments are falling short of the high standards
required by the Act very seriously.</hs_para>

establishment licence holder and other relevant senior individuals to

licensed establishments, many of which are unannounced, are an
important aspect of determining compliance with ASPA. An additional
important role of inspectors is to advise those working under ASPA and
encourage best practice with respect to the 3Rs. Inspectors have a
right of entry to licensed establishments at all reasonable times and
ready access to all records and it is, therefore, right and proper that
they should investigate allegations when they are made. Home Office
Inspectors have been investigating the allegations against ICL at pace

taken from this incident. I have therefore requested the

requirements of Section 24 are now out of step with our policy on
openness and transparency and with the approach taken in other

the Government is publishing a summary of responses to the consultation
on creating a series of Marine Conservation Zones (MCZs) around our

MCZs consultation were received, ranging from support for the
designation of all 127 MCZs recommended by regional projects to
objections to many sites and concerns from most marine industries about
management of MCZs. A final decision on which sites will be designated
will be made over the summer with the aim of making designations in the
autumn. At the same time we will indicate our proposed approach to the
next stage of work on MCZs.</hs_para>

ever to protect our marine environment and a wide range of Marine
Protected Areas already exist. Nearly a quarter of English inshore
waters are already established as marine protected areas. In total the
UK has 214 marine protected areas covering 73,890 sq km designated
under the EU Habitats and Wild Birds Directives. Together, these
protect important European marine habitats and species and seabirds,
their habitats and foraging areas. New MCZs will supplement this
network, as will further Marine Special Protection Areas on which
consultations are planned for the autumn.</hs_para>

the way we manage fisheries in European marine protected areas. This
will ensure that key habitats are protected from damaging activities,
delivering benefits both in terms of conservation and the associated
wider ecosystem services. Any restrictions in fisheries must be
proportionate, fair and not discriminatory. Outside 12 miles,
cooperation with other Member States is necessary to ensure there is
effective management. That is why I am pleased that, with Netherlands
and Germany, we are working to submit to the European Commission joint
proposals, designed in cooperation with the fisheries and NGO sectors,
for managing fishing activities on the Dogger Bank Special Area of
Conservation, one of Europe’s largest marine protected
areas.</hs_para>

plans for the Eastern  Inshore and Offshore areas will enable
transparent and streamlined decision-making, reduce regulatory burden
and provide certainty for developers, while
safeguarding our environment. In short, Marine Plans will enable us to
manage competing uses of our seas and identify opportunities for
sharing space in busy areas so that as many industries as possible can
benefit.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13071690000113" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-wms0001.htm#13071690000113">Our
ambitious marine agenda also includes reform of the Common Fisheries
Policy, on which I made a statement to the House of Commons on 17 June.
We have secured significant reform of the current, broken CFP. We stood
firm during these lengthy negotiations to agree reforms that will make
fishing more sustainable, decentralise decision making and eliminate
the discarding of dead fish.</hs_para>

progress on implementing the Shark, Skate and Ray Conservation Plan
which aims to allow depleted stocks to recover and those faring better
to be fished sustainably. Finally, to protect cetaceans we have
implemented measures to reduce bycatch, which we will continue to
monitor through the UK’s cetacean bycatch monitoring scheme,
recognised as one of the best in Europe.</hs_para>

for the NEAB in accordance with Cabinet Office guidance on good
corporate governance. The report makes some recommendations in this
respect that will be considered by the Chairman

disclosure in this case effectively, bearing in mind the history, size

review concludes that despite the determination and hard work of the
prosecution team (CPS staff and counsel), the approach to disclosure
did not consistently meet the necessary standards. It notes that this

significance of the failure to disclose notes of police and CPS
contacts with key witnesses was substantial. Other errors were less
significant and some criticisms of the prosecution were unwarranted.

corrected—during the trial, their cumulative effect enabled the

concluded that there was no evidence that prosecutors or police

against designations made under the Terrorism (United Nations Measures)
Order 2009 and TAFA 2010 were ongoing in the quarter covered by this
report, brought by Zana Abdul RAHIM. The appeal brought by Gulam
MASTAFA against his designation under TAFA 2010 was concluded. Gulam
MASTAFA has since issued a civil claim against the Treasury and other
government departments. A civil claim against the Treasury arising from
the designation of another individual, known as “M” for
the purpose of these proceedings is also on-going. A new challenge
under s63(2) of the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008 has been issued by
Mohammed AL GHABRA against the Treasury. This has been joined to be
heard with a claim for Judicial Review brought by Mohammed AL GHABRA
against the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.</hs_para>

to my statement to the House of 23rd January 2013 I am today

being made available to Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) areas

expect that those LEP areas that make a good case for further transport
investment through their strategic economic plans will receive

the competitive funding available to LEPs for transport and other
projects and programmes within the Local Growth Fund, most LTBs receive
confirmed allocations for 4 years at a level one third below the
indicative numbers provided in January 2013. This is within the range

LTBs/LEPs where the principle of 10-year funding has been agreed
through city deals receive confirmed allocations for 6 years at the
annual level indicated in January 2013. They also receive an indicative
funding allocation for a further 4 years beyond the confirmed funding
levels. This recognises that these LTBs are expected to be further
ahead than others in strengthening their local decision making
arrangements and the previous consideration of transport needs
alongside other priorities in city deal
discussions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071690000329" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-wms0001.htm#13071690000329">In
addition to the funding allocations announced today, the funding for
existing DfT-approved Local Authority Major schemes will also flow
nominally through the Local Growth Fund and we will need to ensure that
any delay to these projects does not impact on the total funding
available to LEPs on a competitive basis. We will confirm the detailed
mechanisms for how this will work at a later date but the key principle
is that this element of the funding is dependent on the schemes going
ahead as
planned.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071690000330" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-wms0001.htm#13071690000330"><I>CONFIRMED

urgent action and a range of constructive ideas about how we should
take forward work to safeguard plant health using the Taskforce report
as a blueprint. The key messages from those discussions
were:</hs_para><hs_WAIndent>• We need strong
collaboration across the UK and with the Republic of Ireland to ensure
effective
biosecurity;</hs_WAIndent><hs_WAIndent>• At EU
level, we need to take a tougher line, seeking protected zone status
well before new pests and diseases arrive and only allowing new trades
when we are sure that they do not represent an unacceptable
risk;</hs_WAIndent><hs_WAIndent>• We need to
hold other Member States to high standards of surveillance and
enforcement to ensure that all are playing their part in keeping the EU
safe from threats from other parts of the
world;</hs_WAIndent><hs_WAIndent>• All our

summit also provided an opportunity to report on action taken since May
when I made a commitment to rapid progress on two of the
Taskforce’s key recommendations: producing a prioritised risk
register and improving our preparedness and contingency planning.
Stakeholders have said that this was the right place to start and that
we need the risk register in place as soon as
possible.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071690000413" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-wms0001.htm#13071690000413">Work
on the first phase of the risk register has advanced very quickly
through several weeks of intensive work with stakeholders to capture
the key risks to UK crops, trees, gardens and ecosystems from plant
pests and diseases, and the pathways through which they are
transmitted. Over the summer, work on the risk register will continue
to identify threats against which new action needs to be taken. This
will include where regulation needs to be tightened, where we need to
fill gaps in our knowledge and where the current approaches are no
longer cost effective and should be adapted in the light of new
information. Over 700 pests and pathogens will be considered. The first
phase of the risk register will be published for consultation in the
autumn.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071690000414" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-wms0001.htm#13071690000414">Work

ensure that there is effective leadership for these vital activities. I
am announcing today that I will shortly be launching an exercise to
recruit a senior-level Chief Plant Health Officer in response to
another of the Taskforce’s recommendations. He or she will play
a prominent and influential role in advising Ministers, industry and
others about the risks posed by plant pests and diseases. They will
also ensure that measures are in place to manage those risks and
minimise their impact. In the event of an outbreak, the Chief Plant
Health Officer will lead the operational response, providing clear

me that it is vital that the Chief Plant Health Officer has direct
access to Ministers and the authority to act when necessary. I will
ensure that that is the case. I have recently initiated monthly
biosecurity meetings to assess the latest risks to plant health, animal
health and from non-native invasive species. The Chief Plant Health

devolved, but the Chief Plant Health Officer will play a role in

UK.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071690000418" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716-wms0001.htm#13071690000418">The
Taskforce also recommended that we review the legislation and
governance surrounding plant health. The first phase of work on that

Challenge, which will include a review of existing regulation on plant
health and forestry. This will provide an opportunity for all with an

drilling platform is designed, constructed, erected and maintained and
has sufficient stability to afford adequate protection 
<?notus-xml column=105?>for employees and to withstand the environmental forces anticipated at
the site. In doing this, HSE would expect an operator to make an
assessment of the type of drilling platform required. This would
involve taking into account: the environmental factors (e.g. geology);
the type of well (e.g. the depth and the diameter of the metal tubing
used to construct the well); the weight to be suspended from the
platform's lifting hook; the particulars of the site; and the risks
associated with the type of work to be performed (e.g. drilling or
extraction). In practice, this means the drilling platform will need to
be as big as needed to conduct the specified operations

for all countries of the western Balkans. We supported the June
European Council’s decision to open EU accession negotiations
with Serbia on the basis of the real progress that Serbia had made in
its relations with Kosovo, notably through an historic agreement
reached on 19 April. This agreement will require full and consistent
implementation before Serbia begins accession negotiations. However,
this is only the beginning. There is still a great deal of progress
needed to bring Serbia in line with the EU standards required for
membership. The EU accession process is a rigorous conditions-based
process that is designed to ensure this. Aside from full normalisation
of Serbia’s relationship with Kosovo, particular areas of
concern regarding rule of law and justice and home affairs will be
addressed early and throughout the
process.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071688000177" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130716w0001.htm#13071688000177">The

it effectively through legislative changes or challenge. Where HMRC
finds taxpayers purposefully misinterpreting tax law, to gain an
advantage that Parliament never intended, it takes swift action. For
instance, at Budget 2013, it closed down ten newly identified loopholes
that were being exploited through tax avoidance schemes. Where there is
evidence of dishonesty, HMRC may carry out a criminal investigation,
with a view to the prosecution of those involved. As a result of HMRC
investigations, 770 individuals were prosecuted in
