have given over 20 million people paying the basic rate of tax,
particularly those on low incomes, a significant tax break so that they
keep more of the money they earn. It is under this Government that we
are taking close to 3 million people out of income tax altogether by
raising the starting point at which it is paid to £10,000. It is
under this Government that for the first time ever, from this
September, two-year-old toddlers from the poorest families will get 15
hours free pre-school support. Relative child poverty is now at its
lowest level since the mid-1980s, and the proportion of children living

fund, as I hope the hon. Lady will acknowledge, was that, although it
moved young people into jobs, often it did so only temporarily, and the
point of the Youth Contract is to learn from those mistakes to ensure
that the jobs created for young people last. The evidence, both from
our huge expansion of apprenticeships and the parts of the Youth
Contract giving young people opportunities, is that they are staying in
work, and not simply being provided with temporary work, which is what

fees separate. Those things are in response to the current

action plan includes other important measures, including reviewing how
we might reduce the distress caused to some victims by
cross-examination, particularly where multiple defence barristers are

re-traumatising very vulnerable victims by getting them to go through

hon. Members will be aware, this is a stand-alone decision that the
Government are required to make under the terms of the Lisbon treaty by
31 May 2014, with that decision taking effect on 1 December of that
year. It covers about 130 measures, some of which it is clearly in our
national interest to remain part of, but if we wish to remain bound by
only some of the measures, we must exercise our opt-out from them all
en masse and seek to rejoin those that we judge to be in our national

Government have committed to a vote in this House and the other place
before formally deciding on the matter. We shall honour that commitment
in full. Next week, hon. Members will have the opportunity to debate
and vote on this approach. Following our discussions in Europe, another
vote will be held on the final list of measures that the UK will
formally apply to
rejoin<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T12:34:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070952000214" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/debtext/130709-0001.htm#13070952000214">Let
me briefly set out the rationale by which the Government have
approached the decision. We believe the UK should opt out of the
measures in question for reasons of principle, policy and pragmatism
and that we should seek to rejoin only those measures that help us
co-operate with our European neighbours to combat cross-border crime
and keep our country
safe<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T12:34:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070952000215" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/debtext/130709-0001.htm#13070952000215">On
principle, I am firmly of the belief that that the UK’s
international relations in policing and criminal justice are first and
foremost a matter for Her Majesty’s Government. In policy terms,
the UK has and will continue to have the ability to choose whether it
should opt in to any new proposal in the field of justice and home
affairs. It is therefore right that we take the opportunity to consider
whether we wish to retain the measures that were joined by the previous
Government and to decide on a case-by-case basis whether we are willing
to allow the European Court of Justice to exercise jurisdiction over
them in future.</hs_Para>

the Government are being pragmatic. I have said before that we will not
leave the UK open to the threat of infraction and fines which run into
many millions of pounds by remaining bound by measures we simply cannot
implement in time. That would be
senseless<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T12:34:59"></hs_TimeCode>. In a
number of areas, the measures relate to minimum standards in
substantive criminal law. Even before their adoption, the UK already
met or exceeded the vast majority of these standards and will continue
to do so whether or not we are bound by
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070952000217" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/debtext/130709-0001.htm#13070952000217">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T12:34:59"></hs_TimeCode>
people have become more mobile in recent years, so too has crime. The
Government have sought and listened carefully to the views of our law
enforcement agencies which combat it. We understand that some of the
measures covered by this decision are important tools that they need to
protect the British public. The Government have identified 35 measures
which we will seek to rejoin in the national

measures, on which we propose to begin our discussions with the
European Commission and other member states, is laid out in Command
Paper 8671, which is published today. I want to be clear:
what must happen next is a process of negotiation with the European
Commission and other member states, and those negotiations will
determine the final list of measures we formally apply to rejoin. But
we promised that we would set out these measures clearly and give hon.

of the measures we will seek to rejoin, and on which I know many hon.
Members have strong views, is the European arrest warrant. I agree with
our law enforcement agencies that the arrest warrant is a valuable tool
in returning offenders to the UK. Its predecessor, the 1957 European
convention on extradition, had serious drawbacks. The arrest warrant
has helped us to secure and accelerate successful extradition
procedures, as shown by the case of Osman Hussain, one of the failed
London bombers of July 2005, who was extradited back to the UK from
Italy in less than eight weeks. More recently, Jeremy Forrest, the
teacher who was sentenced last month for absconding to France with one
of his pupils, was extradited back to the UK less than three weeks
after his arrest.</hs_Para>

2009 alone, the arrest warrant has been used to extradite from the UK
57 suspects for child sex offences, 86 for rape and 105 for murder. In
the same period, 63 suspects for child sex offences, 27 for
rape and 44 for murder were extradited back to Britain to face charges.
A number of these suspects would probably have not been extradited back
to Britain without the arrest warrant. We owe it to their victims, and
to their loved ones, to bring these people to justice. However, the
European arrest warrant has its problems, too, as hon. Members have
eloquently explained in this House. The last Government had eight years
to address these concerns, and did nothing; this Government have taken
action. I am today proposing additional safeguards to rectify these
problems and increase the protections offered to those wanted for
extradition, particularly British citizens.</hs_Para>

hon. Members have explained  how European arrest warrants have
been issued disproportionately for very minor offences. I will address
this by amending the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill,
which is in Committee, to ensure that an arrest warrant can be refused
for minor crimes. This should stop cases like that of Patrick Connor,
who was extradited because he and two friends were found in possession
of four counterfeit banknotes.</hs_Para>

work with other states to enforce their fines and ensure that in
future, where possible, the European investigation order is used
instead of the European arrest warrant. This would allow police forces
and prosecutors to share evidence and information without requiring the
extradition of a suspect at the investigative stage.</hs_Para>

Members have expressed concerns about lengthy and avoidable pre-trial
detention. I will amend our Extradition Act 2003 to ensure that people
in the UK can be extradited under the European arrest warrant only when
the requesting state has already made a decision to charge and a
decision to try, unless that person’s presence is required in
that jurisdiction for those decisions to be made. Many Members,
particularly 
<?notus-xml column=179?>my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T12:40:53"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Enfield North (Nick de Bois), will recall the case of
Andrew Symeou, who spent 10 months in pre-trial detention, and a
further nine months on bail, in Greece, only to be acquitted. The
change that I am introducing would have allowed Andrew Symeou to raise,
in his extradition hearing, the issue of whether a decision to charge
him and a decision to try him had been taken. It would likely have
prevented his extradition at the stage he was surrendered—and,
quite possibly, altogether. We will also implement the European
supervision order to make it easier for people like Mr Symeou to be
bailed back to the UK.</hs_Para>

Members are concerned about people being extradited for conduct that is
not criminal in British law. I will amend our law to make it clear that
in cases where part of the conduct took place in the UK, and is not
criminal here, the judge must refuse extradition for that conduct. I
also intend to make better use of existing safeguards to provide
further protections. I will ensure that people who consent to
extradition do not lose their right not to be prosecuted for other
offences, reducing costs and delays. We propose that the prisoner
transfer framework decision be used to its fullest extent, so that UK
citizens extradited and convicted can be returned to serve their
sentence
here.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070952000225" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/debtext/130709-0001.htm#13070952000225">Where
a UK national has been convicted and sentenced abroad, for example in
their absence, and is now the subject of a European arrest warrant, we
will ask, with their permission, for the warrant to be withdrawn, and
will use the prisoner transfer arrangements instead. This change could
have prevented the extraditions of Michael Binnington and Luke
Atkinson, who were sent to Cyprus only to be returned to the UK six
months later.</hs_Para>

other extraditions occurring at all, I intend either to allow the
temporary transfer of a consenting person, so that they can be
interviewed by the issuing state’s authorities, or to allow
those authorities to do that through such means as video conferencing
while the person is in the UK. Where people are innocent, this should
lead to the extradition request being withdrawn. These are all changes
that can be made in UK law, and that could have been made by the
Opposition during their time in government. Co-operation on
cross-border crime is vital, but we must also safeguard the
rights  of British citizens, and the changes that we propose
will do that.</hs_Para>

conclude, I am conscious that hon. Members want to know our approach to
the new Europol regulation. I fully recognise the excellent work of
Europol and its British director, Rob Wainwright. Hon. Members may
recall Operation Golf, a joint operation led by Europol and the
Metropolitan police, which cracked down on a human trafficking gang
operating in llford, and which led to the release of 28 trafficked
children and the arrest of 126 suspects. It is for such reasons that we

all have to abide by them. There has been an increase in sham marriages
following that judgment—it related to the rights of those
married to EU nationals—and we now have to deal with that issue.
One of the reasons why we have considered these measures very carefully
is the question of the operation of the European Court of Justice. As I
have said, however, the measures that we wish to rejoin are those that
will be of benefit and I believe that they are in our national

course, enables people to be extradited rather more quickly than under
the previous arrangements. What is crucial with regard to the measures
that I have outlined today, and those that I will outline in the
amendments that will be tabled to the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and

relevant judicial authorities.

Post Office statement issued yesterday welcomed the broad thrust of the
report’s findings and outlined three initiatives to deal with
the issues raised. First, it will set up a working party to complete
the review of cases started by Second Sight, and will consider all
47 cases brought forward by the Justice for Subpostmasters
Alliance—the JFSA—and MPs. The JFSA has been invited to
join the working party. Secondly, an independent figure will chair a
review to determine how best to adjudicate disputed cases in future.
The JFSA and other stakeholders will also be invited to take part in
this process. Finally, a new branch user forum will provide a channel
for sub-postmasters and others to raise issues at the highest level on
business processes, training and support. The company will take forward
the proposals as an urgent priority. I commend this statement to the

supported in every way possible. A recent National Federation of
SubPostmasters survey found that operating costs were rising while
personal drawings were falling, and that one in four sub-postmasters
take no salary from their businesses. Most sub-postmasters earn little
or no income from either financial or Government services, the two
areas that Ministers identify as having real growth potential for post
offices<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T13:42:24"></hs_TimeCode>. The
NFSP removed its support for the Postal Services Bill on the basis of
the abject failure of the Government to deliver the “front

Sight, the independent company employed by the Post Office to
investigate these issues, said that while there was no fundamental
problem with the Horizon system, there were bugs in the system that
resulted in it identifying defects resulting in a shortfall of up to
£9000 at 76 branches. The Post Office has recognised, however,
that the report raises questions about the training and support being

I understand that the remit of Opposition is to ask questions and to be

down. Members on both sides of the House recognise the vital role that
post offices play in our communities, that they are doing an excellent
job and that there can be a bright future for the Post Office. This
Government have stopped the decline in the numbers in the post office
network that happened under the previous Government. The hon. Gentleman
will be aware that the Post Office has won 10 out of 10 Government
contracts recently. We want more income for Post Office Ltd to come

hon. Gentleman mentioned the bugs in the system that have been reported
in the media. It is important for the House to have clarity on this,
because there are two separate issues. The Post Office itself
identified issues on two occasions: through a routine systems check and
as a result of a query from a sub-postmaster. That led to a small
number of transactions being queried across 76 branches. Post Office
was proactive in identifying and rectifying those problems so that no
sub-postmaster was out of pocket. That is a separate matter from the
issues considered in the report, and which were raised by the JFSA and
Second Sight. No system-wide software issues were found. There were
issues relating to the interface for dealing with multiple computer
systems. The training on offer, and the helpline that sub-postmasters
can call if they have a problem, were identified as areas for
improvement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T13:47:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070952000362" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/debtext/130709-0002.htm#13070952000362">The
hon. Gentleman asked specific questions on compensation. There is no
new evidence of further problems. Where the Post Office has identified
defects, sub-postmasters have already received compensation to right
underpayment. On convictions, it is up to individuals to go through the
usual judicial processes if they are concerned about the safety of a
conviction, and that can be done through the Court of Appeal. Clearly,
if any evidence were to come to light that had an impact on the safety
of convictions—I stress that that has not happened as a result
of this interim report—Post Office Ltd would have a duty to look

given its familiarity with the case so far and the fact that it enjoys
the confidence of many of those involved. It is also important to
recognise, however, that to date this system has handled more than 45
billion transactions and that there have been issues with only a tiny,
tiny number of them. As the report itself found, the vast majority of
sub-postmasters in branches were at least reasonably happy with the
Horizon system. I suspect that Members would say that, where IT systems
are concerned, “reasonably happy” is probably as good as
we are going to get. Generally, it is working well, but we need to

that these cases be looked at speedily, although I think he would also
agree that that needs to be done comprehensively, and clearly when
forensic accountancy work is going on, things can take time. We need to
be clear about what the report says about the Horizon 
<?notus-xml column=204?>system. It did not find evidence of systemic failures; that is not to
say there has never been a bug in the system, but I defy anyone to find
an IT system that has never had a bug. What is important is that when
bugs are found, they are dealt with and the problems are rectified.
What has not been found, however, is any systemic problem leading to
the issues faced by sub-postmasters, although there have been issues
with the support and training provided alongside
Horizon.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-09?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_09_PT_1/799718A14E98D0D2F9BC2BB389CB950C889A204B" __version__="1.10"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="9 July 2013">Tuesday

Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance will be taken forward by the
independent working party, but what about somebody—I have one
such case in my patch—who for very good reasons does not feature
in those 47 cases? Can that be looked at again? Secondly, what about
live cases? The statement refers to “disputed cases in

not fall within anything that has been described

Constituency MPs are absolutely

I think there is a distinction to be drawn before
assuming that convictions are therefore unsafe. It is important that we

course when new postmasters join the network. That can vary between a
little over two weeks to three weeks. The Post Office is now ensuring
that it visits new sub-postmasters after one month, and again after
three months for the new local and main operating models, to deal with
any teething issues or further questions that have arisen from their

to the helpline are also important, so that it does what it says on the
tin and is actually helpful to people who call it. One thing that has
improved the helpline is making it available for extended hours. As
other Members have mentioned, sub-postmasters work very hard for long
hours, so assistance needs to be available to them when they happen to
be doing their reconciliation at the end of the day. That is not likely
to be within office hours, so the service needs to be available after

issue of rural sub-postmasters. The communications systems depend on
communications technology, which can be more of an issue in rural
areas. Many post offices have a main phone line and also a back-up
system, perhaps using a mobile telephone. Rural areas often have
difficulties with broadband connectivity, which is why the Government
are moving ahead with plans to ensure that rural broadband is much
better spread out. The support for rural post offices is certainly
significant, and we recognise that there are many branches that need
subsidy from the Government to continue. That is why the Government are
injecting £1.34 billion into the post office network. We also
recognise that there will be a continuing need to ensure that rural
post offices are supported in providing their excellent services. They

power to require the Government to provide time for the proper scrutiny
of Government measures before they are subject to a vote? Command paper
8671, to which the Home Secretary referred in her statement, comprises
155 pages of pretty impenetrable prose, with hardly any explanation.
The command paper has considerable policy implications, but there are
many ifs and buts among the contents. I cannot see how the House can
reasonably be expected to reach a substantive conclusion on whether
signing up to the document is in the national interest unless we are
given a lot more time for its scrutiny, not only by the House but by
the Select Committees, which are appointed specifically to do the job
of scrutiny.</hs_Para>

the Chair ought to be invested with greater powers, and I do not for
one moment dissent from that proposition. The reality is that he and

are furnished with adequate material, and understanding thereof, to
enable them to participate to their satisfaction in the debate that the

reason for my seeking to introduce the Bill today is that my
constituents are undergoing a consultation on where in the borough up
to 37 Gypsy and Traveller pitches should be sited by the year 2031. It
is no exaggeration to say that many of my constituents have been
brought to tears by some of the site proposals. I also have the
privilege to be a member of Kettering borough council, which, as the
local planning authority, is doing its best within the national
planning guidelines to undertake the consultation in the most effective
way possible. However, the council has to follow national planning
regulations and, by law, it has to identify up to 37 pitches. It has no
choice in the matter. It does have some choice about where in the
borough they should be located, but it must find those sites, and some
of the proposals have been completely outrageous.</hs_Para>

purpose of my Bill is to remove any special provision for Gypsies and
Travellers from the national planning regulations. I wanted to call it
the “Gypsies and Travellers (The Same Planning rules as Everyone
Else) Bill”, because that is really what I am after, but I was
told by the parliamentary authorities that that would not accord with
parliamentary procedure. That is why the Bill has its present title,

that would be permissible under the current planning regulations. That

the “ghettoisation” of our countryside have been allowed

with their retail bank since they were very young—not so long
ago in your case, Madam Deputy Speaker. Although an aficionado of
switching and looking at different services in banking, I must confess
that I have been with the same bank since I was 14, and with no real
logic other than the inertia that afflicts many customers: we tend to
think that it is inconvenient to change bank accounts; we tend to
think, “There is not much choice, so what is the difference or
the point of shopping around?” It is this sense of a lack of
competition and lack of choice that we want to remedy with the new

institutions, will now be in a position to make secure and stable
progress. However, I do not think that there is really a parallel
between the Co-operative bank and institutions that would have
disappeared had it not been for the intervention of the taxpayer in
keeping the cash machines operating. We hear Government Members say
that the public deficit was somehow created as a result of ministerial
choices. It is sometimes forgotten that the state—the
taxpayer—had to intervene to rescue the banks. Thank goodness
that happened, but it left us with a phenomenal problem with which we
are still struggling years later.</hs_Para>

Leslie:</Member></B> Absolutely. Those are the very issues that should
be in the Bill, but it is a pretty thin measure. We are still waiting,
apparently endlessly, for the Government to decide to populate it at
some point with the recommendations of the hon. Member for Chichester
(Mr Tyrie) and the Parliamentary Commission on Banking
Standards.</hs_Para>

support for mutuality and greater diversity in the banking sector, and
that is why the new clause refers to competition. We do not just want
more plcs to enter the market; we want institutions of many different
types, including mutuals, to be given a chance to compete for business.
My hon. Friend’s Co-op bank, for example, might wish to have
that greater choice were it available. The new clause was largely
inspired by the recommendations of the parliamentary commission, whose
most recent publication made it very clear that the sector suffers from
a lack of serious competition.</hs_Para>

the Consumers Association—reported recently that 55% of people
had never switched their main personal current account, and that the
larger banks had not earned their market share by dint of innovation or
the provision of competitive services but simply through “first
mover” advantage, because they had been there for such a long
time. It also reported that, sadly, customer surveys had indicated that
the big five high street banks—Lloyds, RBS, HSBC, Santander and
Barclays—consistently gave less satisfaction than others. Those
banks have a very large market share, which has increased over the last
few years. They control 85% of the current account market as opposed to
71% before the financial crisis, 67% of mortgage gross lending as
opposed to 38% before the crisis, and 61% of the savings account market
compared with 47% before the crisis. The inertia of their customers
enables those large banks to sit on a fairly stable customer base. It
has often been said that people are more likely to divorce than switch
current account, although I am sure that that does include those who
are in the Chamber today. The lack of dynamism and choice in the market
is a significant worry, and it is no wonder that it has been criticised
by the Office of Fair
Trading.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070962000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/debtext/130709-0002.htm#13070962000045">There
are major barriers to entry for new banks, which need to establish an
infrastructure to have a fair chance of competing more widely. Recent
suggestions include the adoption of utility platform sharing, and an
extension of the payments system machinery beyond the big banks. I
think that such ideas should be given serious and detailed
consideration, but they pose a challenge to institutions that own and
control payments systems, and we must think carefully about how they
can be tackled.</hs_Para>

big banks were supposed to divest themselves of branches. RBS was
supposed to float off a number of its branches to Santander, but that
did not get very far. Similarly, as my hon. Friend the Member for
Huddersfield (Mr Sheerman pointed out), Lloyds was supposed to divest
itself of many of its branches to the Co-op, and we all know what
happened in that instance. In all, 1,000 branches were supposed to be
out there creating a proper challenger bank, or at least mixing it up a
little by increasing the number of players 
<?notus-xml column=217?>in the system. That has not happened, and I have to say to the Minister
that the Treasury has not exactly covered itself in glory. I am not
claiming that it is entirely the Treasury’s fault, but I think
that it had a hand in overseeing some of the divestment strategy. I
hope that the Minister will update the House, because divestment is
very relevant to the issue of proper

Heaven knows, we have been here before. We have heard plenty of warm
words from Ministers. They have said “We will certainly consider
this, because there is a strong case in favour of it”. When it
comes to the crunch, however, if the House of Commons is to do anything
through this Bill—and we shall not be doing a lot, because so
much is being left to the other place—I think that it is worth
our trying to insert the new clause, just to keep the

Vickers report was published in 2011, Labour Members felt that
specifying 2013 would allow an appropriate time in which to assess the
issue, and, two years on from Vickers, I do not think that anything has
changed our minds in that regard. Getting that market study under way
is the very least that should be done, and the Minister needs to commit
to doing that. This is a critical point. When Members listen to what 
<?notus-xml column=218?>the Minister has to say, they must read between the lines. He will make
all sorts of warm noises and say, “The OFT has started this
process for SME customers”, but it has not done so for retail

problem. One issue for debate—on another day,

German Sparkassen system has a geographic mandate that requires those
banks to do business within a particular locality. That is a dynamic

Government amendment 5 inserts a new requirement to consider
competition issues, which seems to be slightly in tension with the

little bit of exaggeration and spin; I suspect that the banks were
heading in that direction, but I will let him off on this occasion.
This all comes down to whether that seven-day switching will radically
transform the convenience for the customer. It is all very well saying
that there will be a year or so when some transactions from the
existing current account will automatically be made into the new
account, but I do not understand why that provision has been

into an account. For example, even the little step of someone having to
tell their employer that they have a new account number and sort code

I wish to deal with new clause 10, which relates to the sale of
state-owned bank assets. We feel that before a sale takes place of
assets in the ownership of Her Majesty’s Treasury—we are
very much focused on the Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds at
the moment —the Treasury ought to set out clearly a
report discussing the manner in which the best interests of the
taxpayer will be protected in the sale, and the expected impact that
any sale might have on competition for customers and on the rate of
economic growth. That should be accompanied by a proper appraisal of
the options for potential structural change in the banks concerned,
including: whether there should be any changes to the division between
retail banking and investment banking in those institutions; whether
some asset classes need to 
<?notus-xml column=222?>be held back—this is sometimes characterised as a good bank/bad
bank split; and, crucially, the impact of the sale on the creation of a
regional banking network. We think that is

that. If the British public realised what has happened to the value of
that taxpayer stake in RBS, they would be appalled. Today’s
figures show that £2 billion-plus has been taken off the value
of RBS since the botched handling of the departure of the chief
executive, Stephen Hester. That mishandling forced the Chancellor to
back down from a foolhardy dash towards a fire sale, which we know was
part of the plan from the conversations that Sir Philip Hampton, the
chairman of RBS, let slip in comments to journalists around that time.
Labour Members, however, are absolutely focused on the need for the
taxpayer to get good value for money, to get our money back. That is
entirely possible. Stephen Hester revealed the flaw in the
Chancellor’s strategy for a hasty sale driven by the electoral
timetable when he gave an interview to the BBC last month. When asked

considered a sale they would decide what they want to sell and what
they do not want to sell. I do not think that what the hon. Gentleman
suggests should be a particular problem, particularly given the
taxpayer interests involved, in terms of having that report before a
sale. However, I accept that there could be circumstances in which
commercial confidentiality might apply and a line might need to be
considered. I would be happy to examine whether some aspects of that
need to be built into this concept. There is an opacity about the
Government’s strategy, and the fog engulfing the Treasury,
perhaps hiding the chaos within, is extremely thick—a real
pea-souper. I am amazed that once the Chancellor 
<?notus-xml column=223?>of the Exchequer had defenestrated the chief executive of RBS—let
us be honest, that is essentially what happened, and although the
Chancellor of the Exchequer might have protested, “It’s
nothing to do with me, guv,” with his 82% shareholding he
clearly had a hand in the decision —the Government
were surprised when the markets reacted so adversely. It is amazing
that they went down that route without thinking through who would
replace Stephen Hester as chief executive of RBS, creating a massive
amount of uncertainty about the future of the institution. We are glad
that they changed their minds and were forced to back down from the

some of the other considerations needed at this time? The Chancellor,
itching as ever to achieve his political ends, has turned his focus on
Lloyds and getting that stake out of the door. It might be easier to do
that with Lloyds, but we need some reassurance that the
taxpayers’ best interests will come first, not the political

Leadsom:</Member></B> I am delighted to be able to speak about this
Bill on banking reform, which is so crucial to the future success of
the British economy. All that time ago, Adam Smith said in “The
Wealth of Nations” that for free enterprise to exist one needed
both free entry and free exit of market players. Over the past 20
years, we have had neither in banking. Failing banks have certainly not
been allowed to exit the market, hence all the problems with
“too big to fail” and the massive taxpayer bail-outs. New
players have also not been able to enter the market, as there have been
enormous barriers to entry, and my new clause is an attempt to
establish a real game-changer once and for all for the fate of
competition in our banking sector, to enable new entrants to come into
the market.</hs_Para>

know that the Government have already done a huge amount of work to
change the plight for would-be banks. For example, we already know that
the new Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct
Authority have made it easier for new banks to apply for a banking
licence. Previously, there were enormous regulatory hurdles to entering
the market for new banks, but now it has become slightly easier because
they can get a banking licence that is conditional on their being able
to recruit the right people and so on. They do not have to spend
millions of pounds up front to evidence the fact that they can be
competent as a bank.</hs_Para>

regulatory barriers to entry are gradually coming down, but an
incredibly significant point that has not been addressed until now
concerns the competition barriers to entry for new players in the
market. The Government have made great strides in that regard,
not just through the Vickers commission and the
recommendations on seven-day switching, which will be a game-changer in
enabling individuals and businesses to switch between banks, creating
the competition that has been so lacking, but through some of the
structural reforms they have announced more recently and the amendments
to this Bill.</hs_Para>

I was elected to Parliament in 2010, one of the first things that my
colleagues on the Treasury Committee —who are almost all in the
Chamber today—and I did was consider the proposal from the
Payments Council to get rid of cheques. We discovered in our evidence
sessions that the proposal came purely from the banks. It was
convenient only for them and absolutely was not convenient for the
millions of people in this country who rely on cheques to settle bills,
to pay their window cleaner or newsagent or to pay the neighbour who
picked up their shopping for them. Millions of people still needed
cheques, but it was very clear that the Payments Council planned to get
rid of them for the convenience of the banks that owned and ran it. For
me, that was the road to Damascus moment; I realised that the banking
sector is the last great closed shop. The Payments Council, owned and
run by the banks, governs the payments system, the big banks are the
clearing banks through which every new challenger bank must go, and the
payments infrastructure, VocaLink, is also owned and governed by the
big banks.</hs_Para>

decades, the Payments Council has been able to permit or deny
innovation in the payments industry. The big banks have been able not
to allow challenger banks direct access to the payments system and have
required them to go through the clearers, charging them up to 10 times
more for accessing the payments system than they have been paying
themselves. The first significant decision on which I want to
congratulate the Government is that to consult on a new independent
payments regulator. That is key to breaking open the banking sector and
enabling new competition and transparency. It will be interesting to
see just what has changed after the new regulator’s first few
months of operation; it will be fundamentally transforming.</hs_Para>

for decades there has been a key barrier to competition in the banking
system: the inability to move bank accounts freely and easily. People
might be sick and tired of their bank. The Treasury Committee took
evidence on opinion polls that suggested that 
<?notus-xml column=225?>certain banks had negative values when it came to whether customers
would recommend them to a friend. People would say, “No,
whatever you do, don’t go to my bank.” It is
unusual to have such utterly negative recommendation levels between
friends for a supplier. Even the energy sector fails to achieve such
low levels of recommendations between friends. Something is clearly
desperately lacking in customer service.</hs_Para>

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T15:08:56"></hs_TimeCode>also heard some
pretty shocking statistics about the failure of certain key banks to
respond to customer service inquiries, to manage their call centres
properly and to deal with complaints when they happen. It has taken all
these banking scandals—payment protection insurance mis-selling,
the bank swaps mis-selling and various other scandals—before the
weight of evidence became enough for regulators to take action. Clearly
the banks have not been good at policing themselves, and clearly it has
been extraordinarily difficult for individuals and businesses to vote
with their feet and
move.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070962000096" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/debtext/130709-0002.htm#13070962000096">The
difficulty is not only the decision to move bank; the person making
that decision also faces having to make arrangements as regards their

not just whether a person can be bothered to change and go through all
that hassle; very often, because of the consolidation that has taken
place over the past 20 years, banks will force that situation on a
consumer. A colleague told me in the Lobby the other day that their
bank had just notified them that they have to change their bank account
number, credit cards, debit cards, and
cheque-books—everything—regardless of the fact that they
do not want to do that, because the bank decided, off its own bat, to
send them to another brand name. Of course, there is no compensation,
or any way to get the bank to help the person to make all the

things having gone wrong. Perhaps the seven-day switching process will

clearer in the course of my comments. Certainly, in terms of barriers
to entry, the lack of competition and switching—in other words,
people’s inertia—has 
<?notus-xml column=226?>meant that banks simply have not had to compete on customer service.
They have not had to fight to keep their customers. As those of us who
have been in business know, there are times when we have lain awake at
night, wondering how to stop our customers from leaving us tomorrow;
that is the big motivator, whereas in the past it was how to nick a
tiny bit of market share from one of the big players. The fundamental
point is: “How do I hang on to my customers?” Customer
retention is always the biggest challenge for every business, where
there is free and open competition. That is what bank account
portability would
ensure.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070962000102" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/debtext/130709-0002.htm#13070962000102">If

instructs VocaLink, and VocaLink makes the payment, with bank number
portability the consumer’s bank account number, sort code and
payment instructions would be held within VocaLink. Instead of a
two-step process with the bank at the front end, there would be a
one-step process, in which the consumer communicated with VocaLink, and

Leadsom:</Member></B> Yes. The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right, and
he has certainly been a keen supporter of bank number portability, as
have many hon. Members in the Chamber today. The payments regulator
that the Government are consulting on is the first step to achieving 
<?notus-xml column=227?>transparency. The next step is empowering that regulator to do something
to enforce bank number portability when it finds, as I am sure that it
will, that to date there has been a completely deliberate attempt to
restrict competition in the banking
system.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070962000109" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/debtext/130709-0002.htm#13070962000109">The
big banks have said that bank account number portability would cost an
absolute fortune, yet the technology already exists. Some people have
asked whether it would not be an enormous risk to data integrity if the
consumer’s bank account number, sort code and payments
instructions were held by VocaLink, but in reality, all the
consumer’s details are held by the bank, which passes
them all on to VocaLink, so there are double risks to data integrity at
the moment. Holding those account details in VocaLink would reduce,
rather than increase, the
risk.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070962000110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/debtext/130709-0002.htm#13070962000110">People
also say that other banks cannot access VocaLink’s payments
infrastructure directly, because all the banks that clear direct have
mutually to underwrite each other’s payments. The smaller
challenger banks cannot possibly afford to underwrite the payments of
the bigger banks. However, we could easily solve that; already, in
various exchanges, banks pre-fund payments. If a bank’s balance
were too low, and it was running short of cash with which to meet its
outgoing payments, it would be called, intra-day, for more cash. That
problem is easily solvable, and the reason why it has not been solved
is that that is simply not in the big banks’
interests.</hs_Para>

been said that the proposal would surely be incredibly complicated from
an IT point of view, but VocaLink has already set up bank accounts for
the Department for Work and Pensions, because a lot of the
Department’s benefits customers do not have bank accounts.
VocaLink is already able to manage customer account details for DWP
customers, so the technology already exists. I simply do not accept the
idea that there would be eye-watering costs. Chief executives of big
banks have literally said it would cost trillions—absolutely
vast sums—but I challenge them to provide any scrap of evidence
that shows that is the case, and that their refusal is not down to
their desire to restrict access to new
players.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070962000112" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/debtext/130709-0002.htm#13070962000112">The
advantages of bank account number portability are, of course, the
elimination of barriers to entry, and increased competition as a
result. One of the big problems for new entrants is that it is so
difficult to gain customer share, because people will not move bank
accounts. With bank account number portability, if I, as a customer,
was sick and tired of my bank, I could move tomorrow, the day after,
and the day after that, if I was not getting good service, and it would
not be any skin off my nose; it would be perfectly easy to do, and it
would be the banks’ problem. That would be an enormous change in
the competitive environment.</hs_Para>

there would be far greater consumer choice. Bank account number
portability would encourage the likes of Tesco Bank and Marks &amp;
Spencer Financial Services—any big, multinational
conglomerate—to go into the money business; it would become yet
another product line. That in itself would eliminate some of the
problems of “too big to fail”, because there
would be many more smaller players, which would
have many product lines, and therefore would not have all
their eggs in one
basket.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-09?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_09_PT_1/2FB1B7B6799EF84C49EE3301E92D64EA4175539B" __version__="1.9"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="9 July 2013">Tuesday

small businesses the change would be revolutionary. At present one of
the biggest problems for small businesses is that the big banks require
that as well as their company 
<?notus-xml column=228?>accounts, small business people have their personal
accounts and mortgage with the same big bank and do all their foreign
exchange, overdraft, loans and other transactions through that bank. It
is incredibly difficult for a small business to move accounts because
of the complexity of all their suppliers and all the people they are
trying to trade with. The barriers to entry for them are perhaps even
greater than they are for us as individuals. Again, being able to take
their bank account number with them would change the position
dramatically<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070962000116" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/debtext/130709-0002.htm#13070962000116">Another
huge advantage that is not often talked about is that since
the 1990s, when I was running Barclays bank’s team, an enormous
consolidation has taken place. There used to be 44 big banks in the UK;
there are now about 22 banks of any size. The consolidation meant that
during the 1990s many banks took over other banks, broker- dealers,
small fund managers and so on, so they have an enormous number of
legacy systems. They have managed to string them together over the
years, but bank fraud in this country alone is huge. Changing the
payment system would dramatically reduce the incidence of bank fraud.
Intellect, the IT trade body, has said that the change could reduce the
incidence of bank fraud by up to £30 billion a
year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T15:21:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070962000117" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/debtext/130709-0002.htm#13070962000117">Finally,
another key advantage of bank account number portability is resolution.
Andy Haldane, the Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, has gone on
record as saying that it would be the solution when the day comes that
a big bank fails again. We have, of course, put in as many steps as we
can. Basel III will make great strides towards ensuring that banks
cannot fail again. We have created our new regulators. We have ensured
that banks have proper leverage and proper capital. All those measures
are designed to ensure that banks cannot fail again, but we know that
banks will always fail. That is the reality in a western developed
market economy such as ours. We saw only too recently the problems with
Northern Rock, when people were desperate to take their money out. The
answer to resolution is for the Bank of England to be able to say,
“You have failed. We are now taking all your accounts and
putting them with survivor
banks<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T15:22:05"></hs_TimeCode>.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070962000118" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/debtext/130709-0002.htm#13070962000118">There
is a huge amount going for bank account number portability, above and
beyond the seven-day switching process. My new clause calls for the
Government to ensure, within 12 months of Royal Assent, a full
cost-benefit analysis of bank account number portability. Should the
findings be that this is a good idea, and should it produce the kind of
benefits that I have just described, the regulator should be empowered
to implement bank account number portability. I welcome the
Government’s assurances that they will move in that direction.
On that basis I will not press my new clause to a Division, but I urge
the Government to keep up the momentum and ensure that before too long

and social objectives, to make a profit and to support the local
economy. Professional bankers take responsibility for day-to-day
running of the banks and if they make incompetent lending decisions,
they are more likely to get sacked than their counterparts in giant
commercial banks. Local stakeholders, including local politicians,
business leaders, employees and customer representatives, sit on a
supervisory board. That is just one example of the sort of local

I welcome the findings of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking
Standards, I worry that the commission was somewhat seduced by the
assumption that RBS should be returned to the private sector in one

that “publicly-owned” does not mean state-run. The German
public saving banks are managed by bankers, not politicians, but they
are run to serve the interests of the local economy and of citizens,
rather than those of remote shareholders. Managers 
<?notus-xml column=230?>are held much more accountable for incompetent lending than are private
sector managers who drove their businesses to bankruptcy while

is important to understand also that local stakeholder banks are not
unprofessional. The banks studied by the New Economics Foundation make
a solid profit to ensure their own viability, and their first priority
is always to make sure that the loan is repaid. Because they are not
trying to make 22% return on equity, which is RBS’s current
profitability on UK retail business, they are quite happy with 8%, so
they can afford to meet their social purpose. If the Government are
serious about becoming a champion of SMEs and regional prosperity, at

the Member for South Northamptonshire (Andrea Leadsom). She has waged a
Boadicea-like war to bring about account portability, and I have been

hon. Friend’s point about how the regulator has given way a bit
on regulatory barriers to entry. Although I would not say it has moved
substantially, it has made it easier for challenger banks to enter the
marketplace. Two or three years ago, any potential challenger coming to
the marketplace looked to spend between £300,000 and a potential
£25 million just to get to the regulator’s front door and
open a formal dialogue to get a banking licence. That is now changing,
and the regulator has come up with a new process that makes it a great
deal easier. None the less, smaller banks have certain problems due to
ongoing expectations that give an advantage to the bigger banks. Those
bigger banks have greater granularity with their account holders, and
can therefore consider more sophisticated risk-weighting 
<?notus-xml column=231?>models for their assets. Smaller banks do not have
those IT advantages and the cost of their asset book rises with greater
capital requirements, which is still a problem.</hs_Para>

to the substantial points, when considering effective competition
within the marketplace we must remember the importance of a
well-educated consumer. I am pleased that the Government have already
responded on that—yesterday the Secretary of State for Education
announced the new curriculum, which includes financial literacy, and I
pay tribute to his wisdom in realising that that is one of the greatest
engines of social mobility. In any sophisticated society such as ours,
it is important that those we are educating can deal with the most
basic measure of the economy we live in—looking after their own
money. That has been achieved through the hard work of organisations
such as the Personal Finance Education Group and the all-party group on
financial education for young people, and it is a very good
thing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070962000133" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/debtext/130709-0002.htm#13070962000133">Financial
education, understanding and literacy are core to driving competition.
It is no good giving people a multiple choice of banks they can use if
they do not understand the products being presented. When considering
standards within banks, it is important that the marketplace, as well
as the regulator, holds those banks’ feet to the fire to ensure
they are performing well, providing a good service and delivering
trust, which is crucial to restoring a properly functioning
banking market in the
UK.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070962000134" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/debtext/130709-0002.htm#13070962000134">On
account number portability, in September this year seven-day switching
will start. The banks have come to us proudly and said that they have
spent £700 million implementing that system, but in
essence it is less a switching service and more a redirection service
that lasts a year—more of the chewing gum and Sellotape we heard
about earlier. The measure of success for the seven-day switching
service is expected to be how many people switch, but I do not think it
will pass that test because I do not expect many people to switch their
accounts. It comes down to the fundamental problem that there are still
barriers to entry for new entrants, which leaves a small number of
banks in the marketplace. Most people cannot see the difference between
one bank and another, and even if they can, they do not necessarily
understand what it is. In their mind, the risk of an uncertain future
with a different bank far outweighs the benefits of finding a better
service and challenging the bank to be more efficient.</hs_Para>

for account number portability in new clause 14, which the Government
have already agreed is a good thing, are important and will make it
simple for new banks to enter the marketplace and steal market share
from existing banks. The provision has the advantage of being
pro-competition—we have already heard strong discussions about
that—and there are number of other important issues alongside
that. First, in this world where we would like a lot more transparency,
the new Financial Policy Committee is considering the state of the
financial system. That will help it understand what is going on in
terms of transparency, and bring the visible part of the system within

that resolution of failing banks is incredibly important. Part of the
Bill’s raison d’être, and indeed that of all the
work done by Vickers and 
<?notus-xml column=232?>everyone who has worked on this since the crisis of 2007-08,
is to try to ensure that people affected by failing banks do not lose
their livelihood or face a financial crisis, so a simple resolution of
a failing bank is incredibly important. Under the proposals, although
an individual might see on television that there has been a run on
their bank and that it is collapsing, the next morning they would
simply wake up to discover that their bank account had automatically
been transferred to another bank. The systems would continue to work,
so their pay would be received on their behalf, their standing orders
would still be paid and their house would not be repossessed because
they had not paid their mortgage. More importantly, if they do not like
the new bank they had been sent to, a couple of days later they could
move to a better bank that they felt more comfortable with. Resolution
is therefore incredibly
important.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070962000137" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/debtext/130709-0002.htm#13070962000137"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T15:34:56"></hs_TimeCode>The
other incredibly important point is that some banks have legacy IT
systems that have been around for a huge number of years. Parts of
these IT systems can date back to the punch cards of the 1950s and
1960s. In a recent conversation with someone who has done a certain
amount of work in one of the larger state-owned banks, I happened to
make a throwaway comment about the old IT systems. He responded,
“Oh yeah, absolutely.” He explained that he had been
looking at some of the software surrounding the small and medium-sized
enterprise accounts and had noted that one of the software models had a
converter sitting alongside it for converting pounds, shillings and
pence into decimals. That must be at least 42 years old, as
decimalisation was in 1971.</hs_Para>

banks’ IT spend is on holding old systems together. If we take
into account the fact that it is timely because at some point all the
banks will need to update their systems, and if we consider resolution,
transparency and competition, we will come up with a pretty convincing

£10 billion, but they are dead against any sort of

cheaper. That is why it is incredibly important that the Government

the smaller banks that are looking to enter the marketplace have to use
a piggyback system with the big clearers. For example, C. Hoare &amp;
Co., which has been around for 341 years and is still a private bank,
uses RBS for its clearing. To that extent, the larger banks are
providing a service, but ultimately it is causing a great problem for
them. Over the past two years I have met about 20 potential challengers
looking to enter the marketplace, and certainly it is largely the
regulatory barriers to entry that have caused the problem.</hs_Para>

the challenger banks are going to be running current accounts. Some of
the larger ones, such as Metro Bank and Virgin Money, are 100% behind
having full account number portability and recognise—I think
that this is one tribute to them—not only that that will be an
opportunity for them to attract accounts from existing banks, but that
they will have to work incredibly hard to meet the challenge of a more
sophisticated consumer in order to keep those accounts once they have

clause 10 deals with securing the best interests of the taxpayer as
regards the state-owned banks and their future. If the best interests
of the taxpayer were in the Government’s mind in recent weeks in
their stewardship of RBS, that has been shown in a very peculiar way.
This story does not begin with the departure of the chief executive. It
begins before that with a briefing from the Minister’s
Department about the share price in which it said that the previous
Government had overpaid for the shares, and the briefing tried to set
the scene for a pre-election fire sale of the bank that would have
short-changed the taxpayer. I am glad to say that despite that
briefing, the Government seem to be edging away from that strategy.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T15:40:42"></hs_TimeCode>If there were
holding out hope that the banking commission would have given them
comfort on that front, it did not turn out like that, and rightly so,
because it would have been wrong to give a running commentary on the
share price for an institution. An institution’s share price
should be determined by the market, based on its future
prospects<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T15:40:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070962000147" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/debtext/130709-0002.htm#13070962000147">After
the briefing, we then had the unseemly departure of the chief executive
at the Government’s hands. Most people saw him as doing a good
job of reducing the risks on the bank’s grossly overblown
balance sheet and trying to get it back into a healthier position, in
the best interests of the taxpayer. Not only was he bundled out before
he had completed that task, but this was done without any proper
succession plan being put in place. Over the period of a month, we have
had political briefing about the bank’s share price and the
announced departure of the chief executive with no successor in place,
and, as a result, a loss of investor confidence in the
Government’s future strategy for the bank. That is 
<?notus-xml column=234?>no way to exercise stewardship of arguably one of the most important
banks in the country. It has undermined the Government’s
reputation as regards these state-owned assets and done harm and damage
to the bank. I hope that in future the best interests of, and best
value for, the taxpayer will be uppermost in the Minister’s mind
rather than the politically motivated dabbling that we have seen in
recent weeks.</hs_Para>

the Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie). At the heart of this is
how much banks care about reputational loss; the hon. Lady referred to
that. If the banks were in a normal business environment and
there were a big IT failure or another failure of conduct such as
mis-selling or LIBOR interest rate fixing, they would care because they
would worry that their customers would walk, but they are not in a
normal business environment. Banks seem to be immune to, and careless

the banking commission’s deliberations, a parallel was drawn
with the car industry. When a fault appears in a model of one of the
big-brand car makers, they will very quickly issue a recall notice to
ask the customer to come in and have the fault fixed at no
expense and at a time that is convenient to them. Car companies do that
because they care about their reputation and want that customer to buy
a car from them the next time they get one.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T15:43:47"></hs_TimeCode> same logic
does not apply in banking, because the same forces of easy departure do
not apply. There are two sides to this story. It is not all about the
easy transfer of accounts, although that is important; it is also about
what one would be transferring to and from. There is little point in
creating a perfect exit system if the choice is merely between three or
four offers that are all much the same anyway. There is inertia on both
sides. We need more competition among the banks as well as an easier
system of transferring

not really that keen and said, “It’s too much
hassle. Why bother? It won’t be any different.” I said,
“Suppose you could do it in the same way that you
change your mobile phone, where you take your SIM card-equivalent and
plug it into another machine.” At that point they all said,
“Oh, that would be wonderful. What a good idea. Is it

experience drove home to me that the relationship between banks and
their customers has been the reverse of what it should be. We go cap in
hand and say, “Will you please take my account?” It ought
to be the other way around. The banks should be coming cap in hand to
us saying, “Please can I have your business?” New clause
14 goes to the heart of that dilemma. All right hon. and hon. Members
who have spoken have made the point that the new clause is
not a silver bullet and that many other measures are required, but it
would be one of the key enablers of that change in the relationship,
along with the payments regulator and other things that might be done.
Ultimately<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T15:51:34"></hs_TimeCode>, we
need banks to be genuinely fearful of losing business—at the
moment they are not, because they know that people cannot go anywhere
else —and genuinely to want to win business. The commission has
made progress on that and new clause 14 is very much a part

new clause 10, there was a lot of debate in the commission about the
good bank/bad bank split. We ended up with a central point that we all
agreed to, but a number of us wanted to go more in one direction.
However, whether a good bank/bad bank split is a good idea is a
completely different issue from what should be done afterwards. If one
takes the view that a good bank/bad bank split is not needed, one can
still consider all the points that have been put forward, including the
many things the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas)
said could be done to enhance regional banking and credit unions. All

my mind the good bank/bad bank argument is separate to what one does
with a bank going forward. I happen to be somebody who believes that a
good bank/bad bank split is right for the simple reason that if we take
the flakier assets out of the bank and put them in a run-off bank,
therefore liberating the capital being used in the balance sheet to
support it, capital is then available in the good bank to be lent to
SMEs and individuals. It is a simple mechanism for getting more capital
flowing through, but I would make the point that it is not inextricably
linked<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T15:55:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070962000170" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/debtext/130709-0003.htm#13070962000170">Following

is that United Kingdom Financial Investments Ltd has not been the most

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T16:05:04"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Hexham (Guy Opperman) reported on a meeting that he
organised in Gateshead. I am pleased to tell the hon. Lady that a
senior director of the Sparkassen, Dr Thomas Keidel, was at that
meeting. He very much commended the Sparkassen model in Germany as
something that could be emulated in this country. In fact, when one of
the delegates objected that it was very much part of the German system
and culture, which might be difficult to transplant to this
country, Dr Keidel immediately pointed out that the German system was
explicitly modelled on the UK system before it was abandoned in this
country. I am therefore optimistic that what is proposed should be
possible.</hs_Para>

if community interest tax relief was set at a proper rate. I recognise
that the Treasury has carried out a consultation. I am not asking the

Second Reading, the Committee scrutinised the Bill for more than 40

effort to build consensus. Having considered all the options, the
Vickers commission made a compelling case for a ring fence separating
the riskier investment banking side of banks from personal and business
lending. Ring-fencing, an ICB argument, will better insulate
retail banks against global shocks and make banks easier to resolve in

Bill, the Government went further than its own
recommendations. The parliamentary commission, in its December report,
also called for the power to be available to force the separation of a
ring-fenced bank into its component parts if that bank attempted to
game the system or to undermine the ring fence. The so-called

have refused to act on so far. They have not risen to the challenge on
the leverage ratio to drive the reforms that are needed from a UK
perspective. Instead, they want to wait for international and European
Union agreement to resolve the issue. They have fallen short of what is
required for proper electrification of the ring fence separating retail
and investment banking activities. That should have been backed up with
a reserve power for full separation of the sector as a whole if
ring-fencing proves ineffective. We hope that it will be effective, but

particular—to look not only at a split between good banks and
bad banks, but at whether there is a case for changes in retail and
investment banking or in relation to regional banking, but they
rejected that. They have not gone for reform of 
<?notus-xml column=258?>the governance of the Bank of England to turn the court into a proper

Where does it leave us, if we look at the big picture? There is a
debate about the Government’s failure to electrify the ring
fence, although as I recall, the financial crisis started with
Northern Rock and Lehman Brothers, where the ring fence
would have made no difference whatever. What are we trying
to address?</hs_Para>

no idea what to do with RBS, from who is running it and the
Government’s cack-handed handling of Mr Hester’s
departure, to what its role should be. Should RBS exist? Should it be
broken up? How should it be broken up? Can it be broken up? How could
competition emanate from breaking it up? We hear the word competition
all the time. I was a signatory to the extremely modest bank account
portability amendment that, rightly, was tabled. The structure of
banking, however, remains pretty much as was. There is significantly
less competition than there was 10 years ago. Building societies have
been consolidated and about a third have vanished.</hs_Para>

consequence of the British LIBOR scandal, we have lost out to New York,
which has played its political hand far more astutely than the
Government and has grabbed business from this country. Frankfurt and
Paris will be lining up to do the same. We are dealing with
international banks, and the Government’s insular look at what
should be done, presuming that British solutions will add to British
competition, is a misnomer. We face problems with transparency in the
UK dependencies, which, unlike any other country, we can influence.
They remain totally opaque, specifically in relation to banking and
subsidiaries—there is nothing there.

banking agreements, the Government are hiding even from the modest
proposals emanating from Brussels, of all places. This is not going to
solve our problems. Competition has not moved forward, and there is no
evidence that it will. The Government have an aspiration, but no
strategy, for competition, so we remain with none. The problem of
oligarchies running investment banking worldwide has not changed
either; it remains as was—a fundamental weakness in the banking

fundamentally, we have failed to create a concept of tiered risk for
consumers to give them a choice. It has worked before. The classic
example is a simple one, but a real one: the premium bond. When the
premium bond was introduced, people knew that it was totally
guaranteed; they knew it was not the best way of investing, but they
bought them because they were absolutely guaranteed. We do not do that
with our savings now. We have not created the options that would let
our constituents say, “We’ll put X amount in here,
knowing we’ll get a lower return than elsewhere, because the
Government will give an absolute guarantee. And we can put Y amount in
a middle-risk option, where there are some guarantees to certain
levels, and we’ll put Z amount into something with great
returns, but explicitly no Government guarantee.”

the issues surrounding transparency, and the public concern about the
opaque nature of political funding in Northern Ireland, it is important
to take this opportunity to make it clear that we want maximum
transparency for the public there. We want the kind of transparency
that the rest of the United Kingdom already enjoys, but which, for
security reasons, we have been unable to enjoy until now.</hs_Para>

me, this is a matter not only of amendments 7 and 8, which I have
tabled. I also want to refer to the other amendments in this group.
Amendment 2 differs from those amendments, in that it seeks to set in
stone the lifting of the veil of secrecy on party political donations
in Northern Ireland by October 2014. It would not entirely remove the
Government’s ability to extend the period further in an
emergency. The Bill could, for example, include an order-making power
to ensure that the Government could come back to the House in an
emergency and reinstate the existing provisions, but they would need to
have a substantive reason for doing so and they would have to bring
their argument to the House and gain its support.</hs_Para>

put on record at Second Reading, and I want to do so again today, that
this is not about being cavalier or dismissive about the security
situation in Northern Ireland. Nor is it about dismissing the potential
threat to those who donate to political parties. It is about accepting
that that should not automatically, as of right, outweigh the
public’s right to scrutinise donations to political parties. If
we lift the bar and allow donations over £7,500 to be published,
in line with the rest of the United Kingdom, people will factor in that
decision when deciding whether to make such donations. Given that all
the political parties have said that they get very few donations of
that size, the proposal would not impede the normal democratic
fundraising capacity of the Northern Ireland parties.</hs_Para>

is also important to confidence and trust that the public should
believe that their elected representatives are not available for sale.
The only way to convince people of that is to maximise
transparency around these issues. No political party can defend itself
against that charge while the secrecy continues to exist, because the
information will not be in the public domain and available for
scrutiny. My own party reveals such information voluntarily, and we
encourage other parties to do so, but I believe that as of October
2014, we should be moving towards a more normalised situation for
donations. The onus should be on donors to decide whether they wish to
donate, knowing that their donation will be made public.</hs_Para>

shall listen carefully to what my colleagues in the Democratic Unionist
party say about amendment 6. My understanding is that their intention
is to remove entirely the possibility of donations to the Northern
Ireland political parties from the Republic of Ireland. I cannot
support that, and I want to explain why. Northern Ireland’s
unique circumstances are reflected not only in our constitutional
arrangements but in the fact that some parties operate on a Northern
Ireland-only basis, some on a UK-wide basis and others on an
all-Ireland basis. Taking that into account, I believe that it would be
unfair completely to close the door to donations from the Republic of
Ireland. A situation could be created in which parties that operate on
an all-UK basis could receive donations from Dundee, Devon and Derby,
while those that operate on a Northern Ireland-only basis would be
unable to receive donations from Donegal or Dublin. I think that would
be unfair.</hs_Para>

have a degree of sympathy, however, with the concerns expressed by the
Democratic Unionist party on Second Reading about the potential for
overseas donors to put money through the Republic of Ireland,
essentially circumventing the rules on foreign donations. Indeed, I
supported the Select Committee recommendation in paragraph 44 where we
set out our concerns about that. Although we stopped short of
recommending that all donations from the Republic of Ireland be
stopped, we did recommend that the Secretary of State should seek to
include provisions in the Bill that would close that particular
loophole. I would be happy to support measures to do that, but I do not
feel that it would be just or right to support measures that would
simply put a bar on any donations from the Irish Republic, even if
those people are resident and are donating to a party that operates on
a Northern Ireland basis. That would not be fair or just.</hs_Para>

encourage all Members to consider amendments 7 and 8. Some might not
agree with amendment 2, but I do not believe that the hands of the
Secretary of State are in any way tied with respect to security
judgments. I believe that amendments 7 and 8 will ensure clarity for
donors, who will know that any money above £7,500 donated from
January onwards will be subject to publication at whatever point in the
future the Secretary of State decides that it is safe to declare the
information. Clarity will be provided for members of the public who
will know that we are moving in the direction of full transparency, in
the same way as any other region of the UK. This draws the line under
what has been a very tortured issue for a very long time. I hope that
when the opportunity arises, Members will vote in favour of increasing
transparency on these

to follow the hon. Lady’s speech, and I am grateful to her for
supporting the amendment that I proposed—one that is obviously
consistent with the recommendations of the Select Committee on the
matter of transparency for larger political donations. This
recommendation was not disputed in the Committee and there was no vote
or dissenting voice, as can be seen in the report. Looking back over
the evidence given to the Committee by every Northern Ireland political
party, it becomes clear that there is little evidence that the 
<?notus-xml column=268?>parties are receiving many donations above this specified amount, so
it<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> is not as if

will have to put to party officials. I have never had the

issue before us today is how to find a balance between transparency and
the security threat. It is right that the Committee should have a say
on that today. We should be reflecting on the fact that it is 15 years
since the Good Friday agreement, and on how much progress has been
made. The G8 summit in Northern Ireland was held without a hitch; and
we had the Queen’s jubilee tour last year. I had the pleasure of
being there to see it, and it was amazing to see that Her Majesty did
not need to go around with all the bullet-proof glass of the past. That
shows all the progress we have made, yet we seem to be saying that 15

largest donations made to political parties.</hs_Para>

the parties agree that that is a rare event, but there must come a
point at which the level of a donation is such that members of the

should be a threshold beyond which the public are able to see what
donations are being received, so that they can be sure that no
influence is being bought.</hs_Para>

fair, that they are not for sale, and that they do not change their

Northern Ireland are quite as confident of that as I am, but it is for
them to be cynical. Their view on the subject may not have been greatly
enhanced by a BBC programme that was shown in Northern Ireland last
Thursday evening, and which I believe has prompted some doubt about the

be able to publish that information? What criteria will the Government

surely he agrees that such people can choose whether to donate a large
amount to a party. If my amendment were passed, they could still donate
£7,499 every year without their names being published. Surely he
agrees that a donation can reach such a level that the donor must
accept that it should be subject to transparency, because of the amount
of influence that that donor might be exerting. The amendment provides
that, in just over 14 months’ time, any donation that exceeds
£7,500 will be made public. That would give an individual
14 months in which to make any large donation to a party
that he or she wished to make—without the information being

absolute security must be balanced against the need for transparency,

business man was clearly willing to donate. I think that there is a
risk at that level. That is why I did not table an

donor would still have 14 months in which to make any donations they
wanted to make and have them not made public. I suspect that would get
the political parties through the 2015 general election, and that if
they planned things carefully, they could get enough funds to get
through the 2016 Assembly elections, so there would be no detriment to
party funding until perhaps the 2020 elections in terms of the need for
very large donations. That would give everyone a large amount of time

therefore ask the Minister to set out why the Government are apparently

Ireland Members obviously understand Northern Ireland politics better

nominates a candidate or who stands for a council are published. If we
have not had any evidence that there is a real security threat to
people participating in those aspects of Northern Ireland democracy,
why do we have this threat in respect of donations? It is worth asking

the same way as some of us on this side of the House chose to wear the
uniform of the Crown, and served in Northern Ireland. That is a choice
we made. The donors do not necessarily make a choice to have their
names and addresses and businesses all known. That is the difference.
The difference is between those who make these choices and those who
donate and do not want to make anybody else aware of that. Derbyshire
is not like South Down. Amber Valley is not like Belfast. They are two
different places—there are different situations and different

should not have their details published, as that would not be their
understanding of what would happen. My argument is that if they choose
to make a large donation after 1 October 2014, they would be doing so
on the understanding that they will be named—they would be
choosing to be in that situation. I have no desire to force someone
into a position that is not what they understood it to be, as it would

those risks, as they are clearly far greater than those in my

We need to be in a situation where there is sufficient normality in
Northern Ireland to be able to publish details of these donations. I am
not convinced that we have not reached that point now and that for
large donations it would not be the right way in which to tip that
delicate balance, especially when we are not getting credible evidence
from anybody that there is a real threat or that any past incidents
would give us real cause for concern.
Perhaps<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T17:51:41"></hs_TimeCode> that

the current balance of the arguments, I think we should be publishing

position to do that in respect of smaller donations, but let us make
that change. Let us say that we have progressed far enough, 15 or
16 years on from that historic agreement, to think that the
situation in Northern Ireland is strong enough for us to be able to
publish details of those large donations. Let us go for transparency
for the whole political process, and let us show that it is clean and

comment on the other proposals in the group.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T17:52:20"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Amber Valley (Nigel Mills) put a legitimate point of view, one that
had support in the Select Committee but has not found favour with the
Government, so I look forward to hearing the Minister speak on it. It
is also worth making the general comment in relation to all these
matters that the Bill did go through pre-legislative scrutiny. That is
not to say that it cannot be improved or that we cannot debate it and
tease out the various issues—that is what we are here to do. The
hon. Gentleman referred to recent programmes and, of course, we also
have to bear in mind the recent “Panorama” programme and
<I>The Sunday Times </I>exposure of issues relating to Back-Benchers
here and members of the other place. All these issues are very
pertinent and need to be examined, too.</hs_Para>

amendment 6 would repeal section 71B of the Political Parties,
Elections and Referendums Act 2000. Political parties in Northern
Ireland currently follow different rules from parties in Great Britain.
Many people in the UK—UK taxpayers and voters—might be
slightly surprised that a different set of rules applies on donations
to people who can be elected to the House of Commons to make laws for
the whole of the United Kingdom if they are in political parties in one
part of the UK. The 2000 Act was passed to prevent foreign
influence through donations being made without transparency, openness
and all the rest of it and to ensure that donations were made by
legitimate donors—donors who reside in the United Kingdom or who
have locus in the UK, because, after all, the political parties to
which they are donating are making laws for the UK. By logic,
therefore, the same rules should apply across the UK to all the
political parties represented in this House. That is what the amendment
seeks to achieve.</hs_Para>

Great Britain, donations are permissible only from individuals or
bodies in the United Kingdom. Northern Ireland parties, exceptionally,
are allowed also to receive donations and loans from the Irish
Republic. The amendment would end that exemption and put Northern
Ireland on the same footing as the rest of the United Kingdom. One
argument that is made over and over by many people, quite validly and
properly, is that Northern Ireland should be brought into line with the
rest of the United Kingdom. Usually, that argument is applied to the
question of transparency and the revelation of the identities of
donors—I shall come to that in a short while—but it never
seems to be raised in the context of this glaring loophole, which
preserves a special position, effectively for the benefit of
nationalist parties. Let us be frank: that is why it was brought in
originally and why it was lobbied for.</hs_Para>

<?notus-xml column=273?>and the way in which she advanced it. Her concern was more to do with
the loophole whereby donations come not so much from citizens or
organisations in the Republic but from individuals or companies who are
used as a conduit for political donations to parties in Northern
Ireland from outside the Irish Republic—from the United States,
or wherever. That is the real problem. It was identified by the Select
Committee, which recommended that the loophole be closed.</hs_Para>

purpose of our amendment is to highlight that glaring loophole. We
cannot have an exception that allows donations to come in from abroad
and thereby allows them to come in from even further afield than
intended—from America, Australia, Canada, other parts of the
European Union or wherever else. That issue must be addressed. It is
entirely unacceptable, when we talk about transparency, openness and
all the rest of it, that in Northern Ireland parties that are
represented or may be represented in this House could be funded by
bodies, individuals and organisations in other parts of the world yet
we would never be able to find out because of this exception.</hs_Para>

appeal to the Minister to consider the issue, to consider very
carefully not just what we have said but what the Select Committee has

closed. If we are trying to move forward and bring the law on donations
gradually and cautiously into line, we must do it across the board, not

precisely the remit of section 71B of the Political Parties, Elections

asks for clarification; I think the position is pretty clear. The
position of those who would see themselves as Irish, or who hold an
Irish passport and live in the United Kingdom, would not be affected at
all. The exception allowed for in the 2000 Act as amended allows people
who do not reside in the United Kingdom, but who do reside and have a
residence qualification in the Irish Republic, to donate to Northern
Ireland parties. We are saying that that is a back door route; the
donations may be from individuals, companies and organisations in the
Irish Republic, but that money can come from wherever—there is
no regulation whatsoever. That is why we have tabled the

risk as those who put themselves forward as political representatives
and stand for political parties. I suppose that one reason why they
might choose to be a donor, rather than a candidate, is that they do
not want to attract the sort of public attention that being a full or
part-time public representative brings in Northern Ireland. They want
to be involved in the political process, to support it and to have
their political interests advanced and their views reflected, but they
do not necessarily want to get involved in politics directly. However,
even being a donor can attract problems for those people. There is a
difference between being a donor and standing for election as a
political representative. Not everybody wants to be a political
activist. I think that there is a significant difference in the level

hon. Member for Belfast East (Naomi Long), I sympathise with the
argument that if we stick unquestioningly to the date of October 2014
there is a danger that the same excuse will be given that the security
situation does not permit us to move to more transparent arrangements.
It is as if the date has been picked almost as a gesture to
pseudo-transparency and the hon. Lady is testing that by proposing that
it be brought forward. I sympathise with that, but January 2014 would
be cutting it a bit fine, given that I assume the Bill will only get to
the Lords this
autumn.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070981000070" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/debtext/130709-0004.htm#13070981000070">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T18:26:17"></hs_TimeCode>
believe, however, that there is a case for bringing the date forward
from October 2014. Bills are often enacted at the beginning of the
financial year and I see no reason why that should not also be the case
with this Bill. Members might point out that there are elections due
next year, but I would have thought that a starting date of the
beginning of the financial year would adequately and competently
address the problem. I certainly do not think that the starting date
should be after next year’s two intended elections, because that
would make it look as though we were legislating with them in mind and
almost allowing last orders for
donations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070981000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/debtext/130709-0004.htm#13070981000071">If<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T18:27:20"></hs_TimeCode>

Second Reading, and the Minister has told us in an intervention today,
that there is no intention 
<?notus-xml column=280?>retrospectively to reveal donations, even those made in recent years. A
signal has to be sent, however, that there will be a date from which a

it. That needs to be made clear and explicit.
That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T18:28:58"></hs_TimeCode> is what
amendment 2 calls for and I support it, because I do not
think the public believe political parties when we tell them that

cannot give them an unambiguous commencement date for transparency.

I indicated on Second Reading, I am sensitive to the many risks and

a point when the public feel that the arguments about security are
overdone and are an excuse for secrecy. They are not sure whether

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T18:30:33"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Belfast South (Dr McDonnell) pointed out in
evidence to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, when people are
known to have given to one party, it makes them susceptible to
approaches from other parties. I am not sure that that fully answers
the question, if the point is that we will know that somebody gave
£1,000 to X party one week and £2,000 to us the next. A
lot of that information seems to circulate and get out in Northern
Ireland anyway. Many people have impressions, reliable or not, of who
are the significant donors to various
parties.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070981000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/debtext/130709-0004.htm#13070981000075">People<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T18:30:12"></hs_TimeCode>

several parties. They have their own reasons, justifications and
rationales for doing so.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T18:32:12"></hs_TimeCode> is therefore
not the case that everybody is paralysed about doing
anything that shows support for or engagement in political

also said on Second Reading that transparency is not needed just so
that people can see who is supporting the election costs of particular
parties and might therefore have influence on them; it really matters
when parties are in a position to take or influence key decisions. The
case for transparency has become more compelling in the context of
devolution, because many parties take many different decisions. Indeed,
parties not only take decisions, but have the ability to prevent
Ministers of other parties from taking decisions. Those powers of veto
can be exercised on behalf of vested interests as much as they can in
the interests of Ministers’ Executive powers or people’s
powers at Assembly or local council level. Of course, the councils will
be taking on more powers, including over planning. That makes these
matters more

Members have referred to the recent television programme and the issues
that have arisen from it. On Second Reading, I put it on the record
that my party colleague, Alex Attwood, took the initiative when he
became the Environment Minister for Northern Ireland of saying that he
would tell officials if he was aware that the person behind a planning
application or the person who made a significant objection to a
planning application was a donor to his party, so that the information
could be recorded and the officials could handle the matter at a
sufficient distance from the Minister. The officials made the point
that that had not happened before and that it was not necessarily
required, but in his view it was required. When we now hear stories,
impressions and accusations ricocheting around in relation to companies
and political parties and who may be on donor lists, the public concern
is palpable. We cannot in this House ignore that. The parties in
Northern Ireland, even those who have defended extending security cover
and security sensitivity, cannot ignore that. When there are so many
questions, people cannot take as the answer, “Well, there is
still a compelling need for secrecy and we cannot afford transparency

it is not a compelling point. He informs his officials and the matter
is handled in a particular way, but that does not put anybody at any
risk. I do not believe that Alex Attwood is inadvertently trying to
find a way around the provisions and the whole question of protecting
things on a retrospective basis; it is about him as a Minister being
honest with his officials and with the responsibility entrusted to him
to exercise good, clear, honest and independent judgment. It is also
about allowing his officials to do that as well, because many of the
issues that have arisen in recent days involve concerns that Ministers
are intruding into what officials are doing—that Ministers are
being overactive in their Departments in relation to matters being
handled at an official level. Questions arise about who meets Ministers
and whether they record and declare those meetings fully, and whether
they account for those meetings in response to questions in Committees.
When those questions are being asked, we need to address transparency
requirements.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-09?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_09_PT_1/D1308096FE51D4ED740BB9FC4A2917E98E03CE48" __version__="1.8"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="9 July 2013">Tuesday

remedy the situation: the Executive and the Assembly will have to
address tightening the ministerial code on ministerial meetings and

just relate to planning decisions, and recent events relate to
significant public contracts and public appointments. There have been a
lot of questions on whether public appointments in Northern Ireland
always follow the standard they are meant to follow. Many people would
anecdotally suggest that there is too much coincidence and pattern in
some public appointments.</hs_Para>

are all reasons why we need more transparency. The fact that Northern
Ireland is a small place is often used as a reason why we cannot have
too much transparency. When I was a Minister, I would have made it
known to a civil servant if a relative of mine was appointed to
something. I would not have made the appointment, but it would have
been for me to take official note of it. I wanted to disclose that,
rather than have somebody else find out later on. Where relatives might
have had a perceived interest in a particular project, or even a rival
project, I would again have made a point of always declaring it. Of
course, I was often told by civil servants, “Look, you
can’t do that every time. Northern Ireland is too small a place.
You can hardly walk down a street without bumping into people. You
couldn’t throw a stone without hitting somebody that you know or
are related to.” <I>[</I><I>Laughter.</I><I>]</I> That is not
particularly good advice and is not the way I would usually want to
make contact with people—even I might tweet first before doing
that. The smallness of Northern Ireland can become an excuse for not
having proper standards of transparency. That smallness is one of the
reasons why it is necessary. The danger is that slippage in one area

our opposition to amendment 6 is about putting things on a level
playing field for all the parties in Northern Ireland, whether
nationalist, Unionist or neither. As political realignment hopefully
takes shape over the years to come, there will be all sorts of shifts
in how parties present themselves, on either an all-Ireland or a
wider-UK basis, and how far their nationalism or Unionism is
emphasised. That is why donations should be available for parties from
throughout the UK and from throughout the island of Ireland. That seems

Durkan:</Member></B> The right hon. Gentleman raises a point that
throws up the conundrum that, although we are trying to legislate for
Northern Ireland in broad conformity with UK legislation as it is
applied for parties here, because of the circumstances in Northern
Ireland, the exception is to allow donations from the south. Then there
is the discrepancy in the donations rules for people in the south,
whereby they can donate under one set of rules to parties in the south
and under another set to parties in the north. Perhaps there is a case
for saying that we should try to arrive at some conformity on donations
across the island of Ireland, or that donations from the south of
Ireland should conform to the southern Irish rules as well. I do not
have a problem with trying to finesse some of these issues so that we
are not left with too many obvious conundrums.

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T18:51:25"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Amber Valley (Nigel Mills), uses the word
“may”, rather than “shall”, which is in
keeping with the rest of the clause that he is seeking to amend. The
Select Committee feels that we should move forward in this respect, and
that we should try to normalise politics in Northern Ireland. I know
that that was the ambition of the previous Secretary of State and the
previous Minister, and it is fair to say that it is also the ambition
of the current holders of those positions. It has been our guiding
principle. Each and every political party that the Committee spoke to
during the course of the inquiry approved of moving towards greater
transparency.</hs_Para>

to Northern Ireland, to understand that fact. Further to my earlier
intervention on
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T18:52:39"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Belfast North (Mr Dodds), a question that has frequently
been asked is: why should the arrangements be different for donors and
for those who participate in the elections? The right hon. Gentleman
gave an explanation for why people might want to be donors but not
candidates, and I understand that, but I am still not clear why a donor
should be at greater risk or under a greater threat than someone who is
standing for office for a political party. I would have thought that it
was the other way round. People who support a candidate, largely by
signing nomination papers, would surely expose themselves to the same
risk.</hs_Para>

has been pointed out that if a business makes a donation, it could put
them at a commercial disadvantage, but it is up to the business to make
that decision. There is a Co-operative store close to my office in
Tewkesbury. The Co-op has supported the Labour party for many years,
and I have to make the decision whether to go and buy a carton of milk
and a newspaper from that shop. It happens to be close to my office and
very convenient, so I do that. I do not think that businesses should be
able to hide behind the argument of a security risk in order to protect
their business interests. If they make a donation to a particular party
in Northern Ireland or elsewhere in Great Britain, they
should take that commercial risk. That should be part of the normal run
of
politics.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070981000101" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/debtext/130709-0004.htm#13070981000101">I
am somewhat intrigued by the substantive clause inasmuch as it allows
the Secretary of State to increase transparency, but does not allow her
to reduce it. Having looked very closely at the provisions, I am still
slightly confused on this point. If the Secretary of State increases
transparency, can she reduce it at some later date? In other words, she
cannot reduce transparency from where it stands now, but can she reduce
it if she has increased it in the future?</hs_Para>

State increases transparency, but in the year after that, the security
situation—heaven forbid—got worse, so that she had to
come back to introduce primary legislation to change that position. In

that a mistake cannot be made in this respect and that there has to be
a clear indication from the person or organisation that made the

seek clarification from the Minister on those

for Amber Valley (Nigel Mills), and to put a different perspective on
it. First, however, I wish to say that I have had a number of
discussions with the hon. Gentleman and that we have served in the
Finance Bill Committee together, as we have on delegated legislation
Committees. I know that his interest is sincerely held and it is one

one-size-fits-all legislation. It cannot happen; it is not like for
like. Those who say that the people should stand up to intimidation
show only the fact that they do not care or perhaps do not understand
that people in Northern Ireland still live a life that carries a degree
of anxiety—not just in historical cases, but in issues that are

to deadlines. Although I fully understand and agree with the necessity
for transparency that has been put forward, this cannot be put before
the security concerns of people and businesses, which are real and

have to say—I hate to say it, as well—that extortion of a
sectarian nature is not a thing of the past when it comes to Northern
Ireland. It still happens today; incidents are taking place. There is a
very real possibility that if a business is seen to be donating to
political parties, it might come under pressure to donate to other
groups, perhaps those of an unsavoury nature. As
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T18:59:05"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Belfast North (Mr Dodds) said to the Committee,
businesses can feel that they have been boycotted by customers whom
they have had for years. There is a real issue for those people; it is
not an exaggeration or a remote ideal. Is this what is intended by the
legislation before us
tonight?<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T18:59:23"></hs_TimeCode> I do
not believe so. I do not believe that the Bill is intended to scare off
people who wish to contribute to a party. However, that will be a
side-effect of it. People will fear that their homes, their businesses
or, indeed, their families will be at risk, and that cannot be ignored
by any Member in any part of the House.</hs_Para>

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T19:04:53"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Belfast North (Mr Dodds) because like my party colleague,
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T19:05:01"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan), I believe we live in the island of
Ireland. I believe that fervently as a democratic Irish nationalist,
but notwithstanding that, I represent a border constituency, and many
people at the southern end of it daily travel to places of employment
in County Louth. They pay taxes sometimes in both the north of Ireland
and the Republic of Ireland. They also have their children educated in
the north, and they buy goods and services in the south and the north.
There is that exchange of ideas and people. They view people in County
Louth, albeit it is in the south of Ireland—in the Republic of
Ireland, a different jurisdiction—as their neighbours and
friends. In those circumstances, with that exchange of people and
ideas, I cannot support this amendment. I am sure DUP Members will
perfectly understand where the parliamentary party of the SDLP is
coming from in that respect.</hs_Para>

Pound:</Member></B> We have heard a great deal this evening about the
threats and dangers that could possibly be attracted to party political
donors. It is perhaps salutary to mention that if such threats exist to
those who donate to political parties, credit should be given to those
who have the courage to participate fully in the democratic process as
candidates and elected representatives, and perhaps we in this House do
not give enough credit to those who sit with us in this Chamber and who
take the most extraordinary risks in conditions that are frequently
beyond the imagining of us on this side of the water. Many right hon.
and hon. Members sitting here tonight have had very close personal
experiences in that regard, so when we talk about the threat to donors
let us also salute the courage of those who participate fully in the
democratic
process<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T19:09:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070988000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/debtext/130709-0004.htm#13070988000022">May
I, in these brief remarks, say that I thought that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T19:09:49"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Belfast North (Mr Dodds) showed his fine—I was going
to say almost Jesuitical subtlety but he probably would not thank me
for that—analysis of the situation when he referred to the need
to advance incrementally and organically? It is one thing to legislate,
but we cannot legislate for human behaviour; we cannot demand that
people’s behaviour and instincts change, and that society and
culture change, because a piece of law has been approved in this House.
A cultural change, an organic change, has to take place, and that is,
of necessity, a slow process; it is an incremental process. None of us
disagrees with the desirability of the destination; we all want to be
in that place. It is the road map and the route we are talking about
today. In the particular circumstances of politics in Northern Ireland,
proceeding festina lente—I hope hon. Members will forgive me a
spot of Latin—should be our watchword on this occasion. In
recognition of that, the proceeding slowly and cautiously option is by
far the best one. I look forward to hearing from the Minister, possibly
also on the subject of transparency of the Conservative party in

Penning:</Member></B> It is a pleasure to serve on
this Committee of the whole House under your chairmanship,
Mr Hollobone. As usual, we have had a wide-ranging debate on
the provisions. I wish to make two personal comments. First, may I
apologise on behalf of the Secretary of State, who would have been here
but for the fact that, as Opposition Members know, it is right and
proper that she is in the Province this evening as there are important
matters to be dealt with there? It is right and proper that I
acknowledge that she would have been here and she particularly wanted
to deal with clauses 1 and 2. May I also say a personal thank you to
right hon. and hon. friends in the House who have sent me notes and
stopped me in the corridors following the tragic loss that my family
have had in the past couple of days? The comradeship of this House has
helped me through, especially as I was giving evidence to the Select
Committee when my father-in-law passed away.</hs_Para>

debate has taken place with the perfect tone, and people watching this
debate, particularly if they are doing so in Northern
Ireland—I hope they are and I hope the BBC covers it
properly—will be impressed. We probably all disagree about many
of the issues; one of my colleagues came up to me saying, “Who
agrees on what here?” We all agree that Northern
Ireland has come a huge distance in the past 15 years but still
has quite a long way to go. I would love to be able to
stand here and say that I can agree with amendments 7, 8
and 2, but I cannot.</hs_Para>

office I hold means that I see things that I had hoped I would never
see, and there are things I cannot repeat on the Floor of this House.
May I pay tribute, as the shadow Minister did, to those who stand for
office in Northern Ireland, whether in this House or any other elected
body, because they stick their head about the parapet? As so many in
this House, in the Assembly and in local government know, that very
often puts them and their families under threat. We heard on Second
Reading about the terrible atrocities of the past. Sadly, some of those
threats remain today. Of course I add the caveat that we have come an
awful long way but, as I said on Second Reading, I have to look daily
at protection for people—close protection weapons, home
protection and so on. Some of these people are elected but the vast
majority are just going about their normal work to protect us.
Sometimes they are not even in the public sector. I know we will never
be in a perfect situation in which there is no threat to anybody, but
while there is a threat I must be very careful to ensure that those who
wish to donate and their loved ones are not put at risk by revealing
their identities. Clauses 1 and 2 move us forward, slowly but surely,
as we have for the past 15 years, and I thank the shadow
Minister for supporting me in that regard. As I said, we would all love
to be in a completely different position. I know that some hon. Members
do not agree with me, and I completely respect
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T19:15:17"></hs_TimeCode> and their
view<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T19:15:17"></hs_TimeCode>, but the

the following day, as all good Ministers should—as all good
Members should, to be honest—and I was speaking metaphorically.
I was not speaking about an actual physical individual, because of
course that would be a crazy situation. We would never, as hon. Members
have said, get into a position where there was no threat to anybody.
Let me clarify: I was speaking in general terms, rather than

me touch on the threat. My job is not only to ensure, along with the
Electoral Commission, that the electoral system in Northern Ireland
runs properly but to ensure the national security of Northern Ireland.
There might be concerns about individual businesses, and I think that
this applies to businesses that give donations to any political party
in the UK—we have talked about the Co-op—and they suffer
any consequences, but that is completely separate from the intimidation
and personal threats I see daily.</hs_Para>

accept that there need to be discussions between the Government in the
south, us, and all the political parties on how we can get to a
slightly better position. I very much take on board the point that the
Good Friday agreement set out that there is a different situation in
Northern Ireland when it comes to donations and political parties. Of

Long:</Member></B> I thank hon. Members for their contributions. When
we discuss this issue, it is natural that we focus heavily on the
threat to donors from terrorism. I do not dismiss that, and I do not
dismiss the point that the threat level is severe. However, no
compelling evidence was presented to the Select Committee during our
inquiry to show that the threat specifically targeted donors. People
remain willing to sign councillors’ nomination
papers—people who do not want to lift their head above the
parapet and be elected representatives, but who are willing to have
that information
published.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070988000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/debtext/130709-0004.htm#13070988000036">The
Chairman of the Select Committee highlighted clearly that a boycott
could happen in any part of the United Kingdom, and that that is not a
compelling reason for the current arrangements, so we need to be
cautious about conflating those two things. However, although we
naturally focus heavily on the security threat, we must also focus
heavily on the wider threat to the political process that the lack of
transparency is becoming in Northern Ireland. The suspicion that
politics operates for the benefit of those with the means to buy
influence is utterly corrosive to the democratic process. It taints all
of us as politicians, and it puts the institutions under threat, as the
public disengage from politics as a result of that
perception.</hs_Para>

when that information should be made public—she currently has
that power—but make it clear that anyone making a donation after
January 2014 will eventually have that fact made public when the
Secretary of State and the Minister of State are confident that it is
safe to do so, in the light of all the information that they see and we
ordinary Members of Parliament do not. There is no compelling argument
against amendments 7 and 8; they are supported by the Electoral
Commission, and I would like to press them to a
vote<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T19:23:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Long:</Member></B> I agree entirely. There is a serious risk if people
no longer trust their politicians and no longer trust their
institutions to act in the public interest. The only way we can
overcome that is by clearing the matter up. No party can easily defend
itself while this information remains secret. I am willing to accept
the Secretary of State maintaining the discretion as to when the
information will be published, but I see no risk to anyone from a
decision being made now that makes donors and parties aware that
anything donated after January will be made public, when the Minister
of State and the Secretary of State are convinced that it is safe to do
so<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070988000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/debtext/130709-0004.htm#13070988000042"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Dodds" PimsId="2983" UID="13070988000478" xid="171" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/debtext/130709-0004.htm#13070988000478">Mr
Dodds:</Member></B> To be absolutely clear, what the hon. Lady is
talking about is bringing forward the date from October to January.
That would not have any effect on any donations up to now or any
donations before January next year, so in relation to the wider issues
and the context in which we are speaking about this, the measure would
take effect only from next year. Is that

Long:</Member></B> That is absolutely correct. I made it clear on
Second Reading that I would be in favour of any measure that
retrospectively exposed donors to publication. I believe that would be
unjust while there is a legal question about whether they had the
expectation that donations made in the prescribed period would not be
made public. At a very personal level, they understood that to be the
case. If we are to have honour and integrity in politics, that should
extend to people’s understanding of agreements that have been
made, so I would not favour retrospective exposure. Only donations made
after January would be affected and that would come about only after
the Secretary of State had ruled that it was safe to do so. I therefore
wish to press the matter to a

amendments brief. I welcome the fact that the Government have acted on
their promise to ensure that double-jobbing between MLAs and MPs will
now be brought to an end. I also recognise that, as a result of
discussions in the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, the Government
have moved to include within that provision Members of Dail Eireann so
that TDs, too, will not be able to hold a seat in the Assembly. I think
that it is right that they have done so and welcome that move.

that the noise blotted out all the praise that I was heaping on the

areas where they have not been quite so generous. However, I do
appreciate that these issues are being addressed. I very much support

provisions are being proposed for a very good reason. Serving in two
legislatures involves the physical challenge of being in two places at
once. The conflict in sitting times between the House of Commons and
the Northern Ireland Assembly means that Members who wished to be here
today for this business would have to be absent from the Assembly,
where they could be questioning Ministers and holding them to account.
There is significant evidence that that creates a democratic deficit
either there or
here<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T19:41:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070988000388" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/debtext/130709-0004.htm#13070988000388">The
problem is not restricted purely to Members who sit in the House of
Commons. I recognise that the House of Lords is not structured in the
same way as the Commons. Its Members do not have an electoral mandate
and therefore do not have the same demands on their time with regard to
constituency business. However, as a revising Chamber with a primary
focus on legislation and scrutiny, it is hugely important that its
Members are free to dedicate themselves to that task without the

is not only about distance but about simply having the time to commit
to doing the job that one is supposed to be doing. The House of Lords
plays an important role in acting as a revising Chamber for this House.
Someone who is a peer and also an MLA will not be able to commit
themselves fully to either body, and that is unfortunate. The situation
is exacerbated by the direct conflict between the sitting times of the
Assembly and the House of Lords, particularly on Mondays and Tuesdays
but also extending into the rest of the week, when people would be on
committee business in the Assembly. The Assembly committees are
extremely powerful instruments, and it is therefore important that
Members play a full and active role in them.</hs_Para>

also recognise that remuneration for the work of a peer is different,
which reflects the fact that many peers have careers outside Parliament

I made it clear on Second Reading that I was content for this matter to
be resolved in the context of wider reform of the House of Lords, and
it was initially indicated that that would be the case when we
discussed this during and after the Bill’s consultation period.
However, given that House of Lords reform has not progressed and looks
unlikely to do so in, let us say, the short term, it is important that
the Government revisit the possibility of taking action in this Bill in
order to ensure that Members of the House of the Lords and those who
are elevated to it do not continue to sit in the Northern Ireland

Mills:</Member></B> It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Lady and I
agree with most of what she said. Indeed, when the Northern Ireland
Affairs Committee considered the Bill we welcomed the
Government’s decision to legislate to abolish double-jobbing
between this place and the Northern Ireland Assembly, and we suggested
that if the Government were going to go down the route of legislating
on one lot of double-jobbing, they should do so for all manner of
double-jobbing in order to be consistent. It is welcome that the
Government listened to the Committee on the issue of Members of the
Irish Parliament. If it is right to block Members of this Parliament
from being Members of the Assembly, it would have been iniquitous to
not also block Members of the Irish Parliament. That is a welcome
change<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T19:49:10"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T19:49:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070988000400" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/debtext/130709-0004.htm#13070988000400">We
accept the need to legislate to end double-jobbing between the
Parliament in London and the Assembly in Belfast, but I find it
difficult to understand why the Government think there is no need to
end it in the context of the European Parliament in Brussels. I see
from the Government response to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee
report that they see no need for that because no concern has been
raised.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070988000401" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/debtext/130709-0004.htm#13070988000401">The
Government consider that if that was done, it should apply across the
United Kingdom and not just in Northern Ireland. However, the same
argument would apply to ending double-jobbing between this place and
the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly, but the Government are
proposing legislation only for Northern Ireland. I believe that
legislation is planned for Wales, but I am not sure of the position on
Scotland.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070988000402" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/debtext/130709-0004.htm#13070988000402">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T19:50:32"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T19:50:32"></hs_TimeCode>
is therefore hard to see the logic of legislating to stop Members of
Parliament sitting in the Assembly, but not to stop Members of the
European Parliament sitting there. Surely if we think that that is
wrong, we should legislate on it as a matter of principle and say that
people can choose whether they sit in the Assembly or another
Parliament, but they cannot do both. That is the simple logic behind

the provisions on Members of Oireachtas Eireann being Members of the
Assembly date back to a situation involving a prominent and senior
member of my party, Seamus Mallon, who was deputy leader of the SDLP.
In the 1980s, his membership of the Northern Ireland Assembly was
challenged on the basis that he was also a Member of Seanad Eireann. Of
course, when my party stood in the election to the Assembly
in 1982, we made it clear that we would not take our seats and would
not sign on for salaries, allowances or anything else. It is therefore
not comparable to Members of Sinn Fein not taking their seats here, but
taking allowances. When Seamus Mallon was subsequently appointed to the
Seanad, a member of the Ulster Unionist party saw fit to make a legal
challenge to force a by-election so that a Unionist could take the seat
in an Assembly that had no real
powers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070988000406" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/debtext/130709-0004.htm#13070988000406">On<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T19:53:52"></hs_TimeCode>
the back of that controversy, Sinn Fein made the case in the early
years of the peace process for a gratuitous piece of legislation that
was put through this House, which provided that Members of either House
of the Oireachtas could be MPs and/or Members of the Northern Ireland
Assembly. Sinn Fein was the only party that sought that piece of
legislation. That was because, in building the party and selling itself
to its supporters, it wanted to use its heavy hitters as abstentionist
MPs and as candidates for the Dail. It was entirely a confection to
support Sinn Fein’s ambitions and pretentions in building the
party and the movement. This House was convinced to legislate on that
basis. Of course, Sinn Fein has not activated the change it sought, and
rightly so. Whenever its more prominent elected representatives in the
north decided to seek election in the south, they did so on the basis
of giving up their seats in the north. They too seemed to accept the
standard of one Member, one Chamber. We should therefore ensure that
when there is an opportunity to legislate, we should take it.</hs_Para>

then arises about why somebody should be allowed to sit in another
Chamber simply because they are not elected and have no mandate. The
fact that they are there on an unelected basis does not make their dual
membership of two different legislative Chambers any more acceptable
than it would be for somebody who had been elected to both Chambers.
Indeed, we have heard the Democratic Unionist party make the argument
that there is more legitimacy if someone is elected to two Chambers,
because the public, in electing that person, know that they are in two
Chambers and knowingly give them that mandate. In many ways, the least
defensible position is to say that someone can be an elected Member of
one Chamber and an unelected Member of another at the same

but I understand that it applies more specifically to membership of
this House—to national Parliaments, as opposed to regional or
other territorial Assemblies. In practice, when the parties in Northern
Ireland have run Members of the Assembly as candidates for the European
Parliament in recent times, they have usually done so on the basis of a

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T20:07:25"></hs_TimeCode>with others

times I think it pushes the boundaries a little to suggest that there
is huge public opposition to the concept of dual mandates. When I was
elected for two terms in the Assembly, I was a Member of Parliament,
but I was elected—I do not share this for any reason other than
to illustrate my point—with the highest number of first
preference votes of any candidate in the Assembly elections on both
occasions. No one voted for me on the basis that they did not know that
I was already a Member of Parliament, yet they deemed it appropriate to
elect me to a second Chamber. The idea that the public were always
entirely opposed to dual mandates is therefore spurious, because the
facts do not support it.</hs_Para>

Northern Ireland, we now have very few Members who hold a dual mandate
between this House and the Northern Ireland Assembly, and by the next

this issue would be way down my list of priorities for inclusion in the

Government have already legislated—as, I think, the Assembly
might have done—to ensure that a Member of this House who is
also a Member of the Northern Ireland Assembly receives no pay for
holding the office of Assembly Member and has a much reduced office
costs allowance. There is already provision to deal with the issue. The

would like to say on behalf of the Democratic Unionist party that we
oppose the amendment that would exclude Members of the House of Lords
from the opportunity of serving in the Northern Ireland Assembly, and
we have valid reasons for doing so. The House of Lords is an appointed
second Chamber in the United Kingdom Parliament. In making appointments
to it, there is a desire to achieve a degree of regional
representation. I happen to think that it is to the benefit of
devolution to have a connection between this Parliament and the
devolved legislatures. I accept that it is not preferable for that to
involve Members of this House, because we are elected and there is the
question of the dual mandate and because certain issues can arise at
constituency level.</hs_Para>

bind the United Kingdom together, and to recognise the special position

should we not have in the House of Lords legislators from the devolved
regions of the United Kingdom? We do not accept the need to amend the

hon. Gentleman’s Assembly Committee attendance record was good,
but we should look at the disparity between the average voting records
of those in this House who do not have a dual mandate and those who do.
According to “The Public Whip”, the average voting record
of those of us who do not hold a dual mandate is 413 to 414, compared
with 259 to 260 for those who do have a dual mandate. The Assembly
might not suffer, but the attendance of those Members in this House
seems to do so. I am not suggesting that that is the only metric we

the people of East Londonderry decided that they wanted someone other

well in debates. In all those issues, we have to strike a balance. What

the argument goes that we are legislating to prevent dual mandates for
the House of Commons because we want to prevent it happening in the

illustrated the role of Members of the House of Lords. While they have
clear legislative responsibilities, they also do very in-depth work. We
can cast our minds back to the work done in respect of the Welfare

forth between us. Lords come from many varied backgrounds, but they do
their work<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T20:24:50"></hs_TimeCode>. The

between Members of this House and Members of the Assembly, our party
made it clear some time ago that we would be bringing this matter to
the point that by 2015, as was recommended, dual mandates would be
ended. We are working towards that, and it needs to be made very clear
in this Committee tonight that this Bill does not end dual mandates;
the parties in Northern Ireland are ending dual mandates, and they are
doing so for the reasons that have been advanced, which are that we
have now moved forward to a position where politics is much more
stable, and the Assembly and the Executive are up and running. We are
therefore in a very different position from the one we were in only a
short time ago, when dual mandates were not only preferable, but
essential, for the reasons laid out very clearly by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T20:27:36"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Lagan Valley (Mr Donaldson) and because of the
leading political figures in this House who were playing the

stress and strain in terms of the work load, but still carried out an

Dodds:</Member></B> Yes, that is the point that I was making and it is
important to put it on the record. We are talking about the
difficulties of having a double mandate, but I recall that back in the
late 1970s and during most of the 1980s the original three MEPs from
Northern Ireland, Ian Paisley, John Hume and John Taylor, had three
mandates. Nobody is going to say to me that they did not do a very good
job for Northern Ireland in Europe. I know that there was a different
context and a different set-up then, but they worked very well
together. I had some experience of that through working with Ian
Paisley in the European Parliament, and I know that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T20:30:44"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Foyle (Mark Durkan) will know about it from first-hand experience
of working with John Hume. That arrangement was necessary and they did
an immensely powerful job for Northern Ireland. Indeed, I recall one of
those MEPs, not the one from my party, saying that on one occasion he
managed to speak in Strasbourg in the morning, in the Belfast Assembly
in the afternoon and in the House of Commons in the evening. I asked
him whether he used the same speech, but it was not a single
transferable speech. Those were different days and we accept that we
have moved forward, but it is important to put on the record where we
are coming from.</hs_Para>

with <hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T20:31:26"></hs_TimeCode>the issue
of the House of Lords. The explanatory notes talk about “dual
mandates” and people prevented from being a Member of both this
House and the Assembly, as is right and proper. What mandate does a
Member of the House of Lords have? They do not have any mandate. We
have a mandate because we are elected, but a Member of the House of
Lords has none because they are appointed. So this legislation does not
apply to the House of Lords because it is in a different position. If
the House of Lords were elected, there would be a strong argument for
saying 
<?notus-xml column=310?>that we should be legislating to prevent dual membership there, but it
is not elected and it is different. Indeed, that was one of the reasons
why people opposed reforming the House of Lords, because to do so would
put it on the same level as, or make it equivalent to, this House, and
that would threaten the authority of this House. So this matter is
summed up in the very phraseology used about ending “dual
mandates”. It is right and proper to do that in respect of the
House of Commons, but Members of the House of Lords do not
have a mandate. They have a legislative role, but they do not have a

Friend the Member for Lagan Valley, there is a difference.
Interestingly, when the Secretary of State for Wales made his
announcement in March, he did not include a bar on membership of the
House of Lords and the Welsh Assembly; he confined it to the House of
Commons. So for all those reasons, the Government are taking the right

and is being pursued. The Bill is not necessarily the vehicle or the
means by which it should be pursued, but the Minister should rest
assured that, as we talk about dual mandates and about representation
and people being fit for jobs and about the jobs they are or are not
doing, there remains the outstanding scandal of all—the Members
of Parliament who are elected, who get money to run their parliamentary
business and who get representative money for which they do not have to
account in the way that we do as parliamentarians and that they can use
for party political purposes. That is an issue that the House still

chairmanship for the first time this evening. Yet again, we have had an
interesting and wide-ranging debate—some of it within the scope
of the Northern Ireland Office’s remit and some outside it.
Perhaps I can address straight away one of the areas of debate we have
had this evening because, although I fully respect
the view, it falls outside the scope of the Bill
and of my 
<?notus-xml column=311?>portfolio. The question of whether an MLA can sit in the European
Parliament is a matter for the Cabinet Office and the UK Government as
a whole. My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T20:36:41"></hs_TimeCode> hon.

Member for Belfast North (Mr Dodds). My personal view, as well as that
of the Government, is that there is a difference between a person
elected to this House with a mandate—the words in the
explanatory notes were put there for a reason—and a Member of
the House of Lords. Members of the House of Lords do not have a
mandate: they are not elected; they do not have a constituency; they do
not have constituents. However, the Government’s view is not
fixed and if, when the Bill passes to the other place, the House of
Lords has a view on that, we will consider what comes back to us. At
present, the reason behind the change is to do with mandates and not to
do with whether Members are in another
Chamber<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T20:38:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

electorate have decided to do. The electorate elect people to this
House and to the Legislative Assembly. I pay tribute to those who had
more than a dual mandate when there was a need for people to put their
heads above the parapet and stand for office when things were
enormously difficult in Northern Ireland. We have moved on. We accept
that MLAs should not be able to stand for the lower House in the
Republic, but we do think, at present, that they should be able to sit

Long:</Member></B> I think the argument regarding dual mandates in the
House of Commons and the Assembly has been fought and, largely, won.
People may well say that the public do not mind double-jobbing, but it
was a live issue in the 2010 elections, which is why all parties made
the commitment publicly in their manifestos, before those elections,
that they would not maintain dual mandates. People were elected on the
expectation that they would leave the Assembly during this term.
Everyone has said that that is the point that we want to get to. I know
why I feel the need for legislation, but I do not know why the
Government do. Perhaps it is because every time we discuss the matter,
even those who say that they are in favour of such legislation in
principle continue to put up quite a spirited defence of
double-jobbing—and are still here to do so, three years after
the last Westminster election and two years after the last Assembly
election. However, I would not want to speak for the Government on that
point. It is important that the Government, having made a commitment to
legislate on this subject, follow through on that.</hs_Para>

amendments that I have tabled, the issue for me is whether we are
applying the rule consistently.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T20:42:11"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for North Down (Lady Hermon) made a compelling point: the concern when
the issue was raised was not simply about dual mandates, although that
became a shorthand for it; it was about serving in two legislatures and
the challenge that presents with regard to people being able to do both
jobs properly. There is a further point, in that in the House of Lords,
the expectation is that people are not fettered or influenced by
constituency responsibility. However, if they have that responsibility
because they have an elected mandate in another legislature, they are
no longer free in that way. That distinguishes elected posts from other
forms of employment outside the House of Lords in an important,
fundamental
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T20:42:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070991000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/debtext/130709-0004.htm#13070991000032"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mark Durkan" PimsId="3056" UID="13070991000322" xid="916" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/debtext/130709-0004.htm#13070991000322">Mark

because its Members are not elected, and because of various other
constitutional attributes it seems to have. Only Unionists or others

Dodds:</Member></B><B> </B>The purpose of clause 6 is to move the
decision on the reduction in the size of the Northern Ireland Assembly
from the category of excepted matter to that of reserved matters, which
I think has received reasonable assent in Northern Ireland. The purpose
of amendments 4 and 5, which stand in my name and those of
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T20:58:38"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
and hon. Friends, is simply to move into the category of reserved
matters, as opposed to excepted matters, decisions relating to the
appointment of the Executive and the way it is formed. Given that the
number of MLAs will be reduced, we propose that 
<?notus-xml column=316?>all matters pertaining to the appointment of the Executive, its
composition and make-up and the way the First and Deputy First
Ministers are elected, and matters pertaining to opposition in the
Assembly, should also be reserved matters. We believe that this would
allow any political agreement negotiated by parties in Northern Ireland
to be legislated for in the Assembly. It would give the Assembly the
tools not only to discuss these matters, which do need to be discussed
by the parties in Northern Ireland, but to agree them, of course by
cross-community vote and by the normal mechanisms that require that to
happen in the Northern Ireland Assembly. That would act as a bit of an
incentive to allow and promote greater debate in relation to these
matters.</hs_Para>

simply that we should move these issues into the category of reserved

has been an interesting debate. Perhaps, in referring to clause stand
part, I could reminisce a little about why the Assembly has a
membership that many believe is rather large, at 108. We could compare
that with, for example, the Welsh Assembly. Wales has a population
roughly double that of Northern Ireland but its Assembly has roughly
half the number of Members of the Assembly in Belfast. There is a
reason for that. It came about, as it so happened, on Maundy Thursday
1998 at 3 o’clock in the morning or thereabouts, when we struck
an agreement with the parties—although of course at that stage
the DUP was not involved; I think they were getting rather cold
marching to Stormont in the snow.</hs_Para>

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T21:02:47"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan) will recall, the initial belief was
that there should be a membership of 95, but in fact it went up
to 108.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T21:04:30"></hs_TimeCode> final figure
was reached quite quickly by the then Prime Minister, and we as
Ministers, on the basis that although the idea of having five Members
per constituency, making a total of 95, had some merit, increasing it
to six would give smaller parties that had been involved in the talks
on the peace process the opportunity to be represented in the
Assembly—the Women’s Coalition, the Progressive Unionist
Party and others. That was sensible. It related to the fact that we
already had ready-made constituencies in Northern Ireland that could be
used as the basis of the boundaries for the new Northern Ireland
Assembly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T21:03:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070991000279" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/debtext/130709-0004.htm#13070991000279">In
the previous debate we heard interesting reference to how things have
moved on. I believe that if we had not had people in the Northern
Ireland peace process 
<?notus-xml column=317?>and political process who did not have a dual mandate, those processes
would not have happened, because those people brought an invaluable
wisdom and a richness of experience to the talks. Incidentally, I am
not persuaded that we should be legislating about who should or should
not be allowed to stand for the House of Commons or for the Assembly,
but that is another issue, and we have just dealt with it. The point is
that those decisions were made at the time to ensure that the process
went on. I think that the 108 figure was right for the time, because it
did what it had to do. Now that times have moved on, however, it seems
to me that we should ask whether that figure is an encumbrance. Is it
too big? Is it too expensive? Does it work? I think that this is a
matter for the political parties in Northern Ireland to decide, as
opposed to this
place<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T21:04:59"></hs_TimeCode>. It should
be the Northern Ireland Assembly that decides whether it should be

when the Government tried a year or so ago to change the boundaries of
our parliamentary constituencies they completely forgot about the
knock-on effect it would have on Northern Ireland. Happily, that
measure has disappeared, but it would have had a profound effect on the

6<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T21:05:51"></hs_TimeCode>, but I issue
one caveat. I understand—had I read the Bill more thoroughly I
would know whether this is the case—that the Secretary of State
will have to endorse such an agreement. I think that is right, because
the Good Friday agreement, the St Andrews agreements and the entire
peace process were guaranteed by the Irish and British Governments and
the Irish and British Parliaments, so that is another important factor.
I will only be convinced, however, when the Secretary of State or the
Minister, in response to this or any future debate, make it absolutely
clear that no such changes should be made unless they achieve the
consensus of all the parties in Northern Ireland as to what the figure
should

understand that the Assembly has a mechanism—the Assembly
Commission, which is representative of all parties—that could
initially consider any representations. Whatever happens, the decision

6 deals with possible changes to the size of the Assembly and the right
hon. Gentleman has explained why it ended up at its current size. He
has corroborated many of the points that I made on Second Reading about
how the figure of 108 was arrived at. The decision was made ultimately
by the British Government. Some of us favoured a top-up scheme, but I
remember the right hon. Gentleman and the then Prime Minister telling
us during the night and early morning that the 
<?notus-xml column=318?>reason why they saw the option of six Members per
constituency as offering the best chance of accommodating smaller
parties was that if they went with the option of a top-up of 10 it
would be too complicated for them to work out all the different
permutations of top-ups. That was significant at that stage of the
negotiations. We need to understand why that decision was taken. The
right hon. Gentleman has rightly said that it can be revised and
reviewed; indeed, the review mechanism of the agreement itself allows
for
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T21:08:53"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T21:08:55"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T21:08:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070991000285" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/debtext/130709-0004.htm#13070991000285">I

sensitivities involved in decisions about the size of the Assembly. A

the number of seats per constituency. The parties could abuse that
power. That is why it is right that there should be a reserved power
for the Secretary of State. However, some of us are not reassured that
the Secretary of State would use that reserved power in an alert or
effective way, because when Sinn Fein and the DUP come along, the
attitude of the Northern Ireland Office seems to be, “Whatever

the rules on inclusion so that the only parties that voted for the
First Minister and Deputy First Minister would be entitled to go into
Government. That was their plan, which thankfully we were just about
able to stop in the St Andrews agreement. Simply trusting these matters
to the lead of Sinn Fein and the DUP gives the rest of us
misgivings. We want more assurances about the role of the Secretary of
State on reserved powers that she, or any successor, would
have.</hs_Para>

That was to be part of the protections included in the Bill of Rights,

seem to be inert and indifferent to having a Bill of Rights, some of us

political representatives, including the current Secretary of State and
the former Secretary of State, have stated that there is insufficient
consensus on extending the term, while the Northern Ireland Affairs
Committee compiled evidence that clearly suggested there was
insufficient evidence and did not agree with extending the term to five
years. I understand that three parties—at the centre,
shall we say—supported extending the mandate: the Democratic

the Social Democratic and Labour party and the Ulster Unionist party
did not.</hs_Para>

believe in democracy. Members were elected to the Northern Ireland
Assembly on the basis of four, not five years. That is a very different
position from that in Scotland and Wales. In November 2011, when people
stood for election and sought mandates in Scotland and Wales, they did
so on the basis that those terms would be five years. It was very
different in Northern Ireland. I did not get that mystery unlocked on

election and an Assembly election are not held on the same day. That is
important because they are probably the two most important elections
that are held. Council elections are obviously significant, as are
elections to the European Parliament, but when we are
electing the legislature and the Executive for the Northern Ireland
Assembly and also representatives in this House, it is inevitable that
one of those elections would dominate the media and the political
debate to the exclusion of the other, to a much greater extent

That discussion was held. It was carried out in a very full

discussion about this issue than many others. A view was reached that

right hon. Member for Torfaen (Paul Murphy) will recall the tortuous
negotiations that we had, and the fact that we were determined that
there should be some sort of proportional system, be it d’Hondt
or Sainte-Laguë. We went through the various permutations, and
d’Hondt was the one that most people were familiar with, because
of their experience with the European Parliament. It was deliberately
chosen as an inclusive arrangement and to create a situation in which
parties were not in a position to vet or veto each other’s
ministerial appointments. We actually used that language in the
discussions and the negotiations; the parties did not want to be in a
position of being able to vet or veto other
appointments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T21:34:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130709102000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/debtext/130709-0005.htm#130709102000019">Nevertheless,
when it subsequently came to the arrangements for appointing a Minister
of Justice in the context of the devolution of justice and policing,
there was a departure from that principle—for all the various

the impasse ensuring that there were no more standoffs. The progress

Durkan:</Member></B> Yes, I recognise that. When these measures
originally went through, I made a point about the unequal situation and
said that the power in the hands of two particular parties in respect
of the Justice Minister’s position was potentially abusable.
That anomaly clearly needed remedying as well. We always believed that
this should be done as part of d’Hondt, and we believed that the
number of Departments could have been adjusted at the time—not
to add to the number of Departments, but to keep to the 10 that had
been approved, absorbing a Department of Justice. The parties chose to
go this way and even to add an additional Department even though their
stated position was that they wanted to reduce the number of
Departments in Northern Ireland.</hs_Para>

tick-tacking, contact and understanding between the parties in advance
of d’Hondt being formally run in the Assembly than was
originally envisaged or required at the time of the agreement. Some of
the issues are about the sensitivities around who will take
what post and what might be detonated by that. Those issues will have
to be dealt with in the context of the negotiations.</hs_Para>

view d’Hondt as the mechanism for appointing a future Minister
of Justice, as with all other Ministers, in full knowledge that that
will create a number of difficulties and uncertainties at a number of
levels—we have those problems with other ministerial
appointments in any case. There are questions this week about existing
Ministers, their appointments and the attitudes of parties towards the
rules and the spirit of the pledge of office and so forth. It is not as
though the issue of the Minister of Justice is the only sensitivity, as
there is also sensitivity about the possibility of d’Hondt
leading to the Minister of Justice post going to only one political
party. There are clearly sensitivities in relation to other matters,
which is why the position of the Policing Board and the whole Patten
architecture is so important as well. There are various proofs related
to the exercise of the powers and responsibilities of a Minister of
Justice that have been well observed and honoured in respect of the
current Minister, but they would be equally obligatory for any future
Minister appointed under d’Hondt.</hs_Para>

process, they could end up with a Ministry more than they were entitled
to under d’Hondt, and could also lose that Ministry on the whim

are proposing. The issue relates simply to the Minister’s
appointment and security of tenure. Concerns were raised by my own
party and indeed by other parties, and the Government, having listened
to other parties in the Executive, took those concerns on board and
formulated proposals which addressed them. That was helpful.</hs_Para>

that my view of how an Executive should be formed in future differs
from that of the hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan) and his party. We
have been open and honest about the fact that we would much prefer the
reforms of the Assembly to include a move away from d’Hondt and
towards the election of all Ministers by means of a cross-community
vote, because we believe that that would enhance collectiveness in the
Executive. There would have to be agreement among the Northern Ireland
parties for that to happen. I should add that I do not consider
d’Hondt to be a normal way of appointing Ministers; I consider
it to be a mechanism resulting from the Good Friday agreement which was
required to manage an abnormal political situation. I hope that, when
we seek to reform the Assembly more widely, that will be on the table
for discussion along with everything else. However, I support what the
Government are attempting to do, and oppose the attempt to change
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130709102000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/debtext/130709-0005.htm#130709102000031"><B><Member ContinuationText="Stephen Pound" PimsId="218" UID="130709102000115" xid="478" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/debtext/130709-0005.htm#130709102000115">Stephen

misquoted him when I said it was the great doctor of the Church who

Gordon Brown</B> (Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath) (Lab):</Member> I rise to
raise an issue—radiation contamination in Dalgety Bay in my Fife
constituency—that I have raised with the House on two previous
occasions: in November 2011, when I first asked Ministers to take
action; and in March this year, when I suggested that the time was now
overdue for action. I regret having to come back to the House, but I am
grateful to you, Mr Speaker, for allowing me to raise this
issue, because we now have greater evidence of the scale of the
contamination and of the risks inherent in it.</hs_Para>

are now faced with a choice, because in the next few months the
Ministry of Defence will have to make a decision, as the Scottish
Environment Protection Agency will be bound to designate this area as
the only radiation-contaminated area in the United Kingdom if action is
not taken by the MOD as soon as possible. It is an amazing fact that we
have nuclear waste sites, we have nuclear submarines and we have
weapons in different parts of the United Kingdom, but this small beach
in the heart of my constituency, which is on a walkway, the coastal
path of Fife, is liable to be named the first ever
radiation-contaminated area in the UK. I want to do everything in my
power this evening to persuade the Minister that it is within his power
and the power of his Department to stop that.</hs_Para>

Bay is already the first area of the United Kingdom where a risk
assessment study has had to be done to measure the extent of radiation
contamination and where what is called an appropriate person
report—a report under the legislation dealing with radiation
contamination—has been produced and has concluded that the
polluter of the area is indeed the Ministry of Defence. Today and
tomorrow, the Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the
Environment is meeting in London to discuss the risk assessment report.
In my view, it will reach the same conclusion as Health England: that
the area is contaminated, that action must be taken as soon as possible
and that the polluter should take responsibility for doing
so.</hs_Para>

I have raised the issue in the House for 18 months, it is
only in the past few days that I have discovered the scale of the
problem in the greatest detail, thanks to the risk assessment report
and to the appropriate person report, of which the Minister will no
doubt be aware. That makes it clear that the contamination of the beach
area in Dalgety Bay arises from the fact that starting in 1946 and for
13 years, wartime fighter planes and other planes in the possession of
the Royal Air Force were scrapped and incinerated before the ash,
including radiated parts, was dumped in the area of Dalgety Bay. In
1946 alone, 800 planes were scrapped and their parts dumped in this
area of my constituency. From 1946 to 1959, not a few planes—not
tens, or twenties, or scores—but hundreds were broken up before
their parts were incinerated and the ash, including radiated parts, was
dumped in the area.</hs_Para>

have an admission that the Ministry of Defence is not prepared to make
today—an admission that it refused to make when the responsible
persons report, naming it as a polluter, was published. That is a
memorandum from within the Government machine, from Her
Majesty’s inspectorate of pollution, making it absolutely clear

1992, a similar report was done, in which the Ministry of Defence named
Dalgety Bay as one of the polluted areas. Again, after 2000, it is
absolutely clear from the report of Mr Fred Dawson, who was the head
radiation protection officer dealing with the safety officer at the
MOD, that the Ministry of Defence was advised by him, at that time,
that it would be found liable, and that there was significant
reputational damage involved in denying liability in this

that the infill has made possible the tip at the sailing club and at

accept responsibility? It requested a lawyer’s report as well as
an expert report by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. Why,
when it was published, a few days ago, did the Ministry of
Defence

the risk assessment report, which I have read in some detail, and the
appropriate persons report, there is a year-by-year catalogue of the
actions taken by the Ministry of Defence, through the Royal Air
Force, which used the airfield for breaking up planes,
incinerated the planes, prepared the ash for dumping, and removed the
ash to the dump, which eventually became the ground on which part of
Dalgety Bay—the new town—is built. At no point is it made

this.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130709102000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/debtext/130709-0005.htm#130709102000071">Why
has the Ministry of Defence insisted on trying to pass the buck to
other people in the area who have no responsibility for this
contamination? The developers, the property owners, and the sailing
club, which has had to change its constitution to protect itself from
the fall-out from this, have all been suggested, by the Ministry of
Defence, as being potentially to blame, when it is absolutely clear
from every document we have that the Ministry of Defence is
responsible. Unfortunately, it has to accept its role as a responsible

matter is made more difficult by the response of the Ministry of
Defence to the risk assessment report by the Scottish Environment
Protection Agency. In a Ministry of Defence letter of 28 June to SEPA,
a copy of which I have been given—it is very short and rather
dismissive, I am afraid—the Ministry cites four objections,

and in 47% of the articles, there is radium-226. In 75% of the articles
discovered, there is debris from the airfield. There can be absolutely
no doubt that these are not theoretical objects, but particles that

in the House of Commons, the letters that have been
exchanged, the protests of the community council, and the evidence that
the Ministry of Defence has received, it really is beyond me that the

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T22:08:57"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Mr Brown) on securing this
debate. It is an important subject and he has expressed his views
passionately, as I would expect. He has been, if I may say so, an
assiduous Member of Parliament in his attention to this matter,
securing Adjournment debates in November 2011 and in March this year.
My right hon. Friend the Defence Secretary tells me that the right hon.
Gentleman has also had a long conversation with him, when he
covered much of the ground that he covered this evening and
which I hope to cover in the time available to me tonight.</hs_Para>

understand the right hon. Gentleman’s passion for this subject
given his long association with the area and the local community he
represents, and if he is agreeable to the notion, I look forward to
visiting Dalgety Bay before too long. We have a duty to those we
represent to present a balanced view that neither sensationalises nor
causes unnecessary anxiety, and I know the right hon. Gentleman will
want to do just that. Contrary to the impression he gave, however, the
Ministry of Defence has never sought to abdicate its legal
responsibilities, much less “pass the buck”. In fact, we
have acknowledged that in all likelihood our historical activities
introduced radium into what was Royal Naval Air Station Donibristle and
HMS Merlin. Moreover, we have demonstrated a serious commitment to
supporting the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, and expended
£825,000 to date undertaking a site investigation, as well as a
monitoring and recovery programme along the foreshore. The
right hon. Gentleman will recall the work we have undertaken in a
number of gardens belonging to his constituents where radium was
discovered, at a cost of some
£500,000<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T22:11:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130709110000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/debtext/130709-0005.htm#130709110000004">On
recent statements in the press concerning a memo allegedly from the
MOD, the document we are aware of, dated December 1990, is from Her
Majesty’s industrial pollution inspectorate to the Scottish
Office—I think that is what the right hon. Gentleman referred to
in his remarks. We have found no evidence to corroborate claims that
800 aircraft were destroyed in 1946 through burning, and the resultant
waste material—including ash—deposited on the beach or
within the headland prior to 1959. Interestingly, the memo mentions the
disposal by burial of waste arising from the scrapping of aircraft at a
location inland from the beach, which we understand may be a former
quarry. The memo also appears to acknowledge the MOD’s
willingness to assist the regulator, then Her Majesty’s
industrial pollution inspectorate—a situation not dissimilar to
today when the MOD is assisting SEPA with its statutory inspection of
the beach and adjacent shoreline.</hs_Para>

who were in touch with the inspectorate when it prepared the report in
1990? As far as the advice on the risk assessment is concerned, the
Ministry of Defence’s objections essentially come down to one
major point: it suggests that it does not believe that these sources
have been found at the level of radiation required. Yet the people who

Gentleman has had sight of the independent review by the Centre for

endorsement of SEPA’s approach and shows that many of our

of the public inadvertently ingesting an object contaminated with
radium that could cause them significant harm is less than one in

predominantly an alpha emitter, so ingestion is the key route by which
harm can occur, notwithstanding the fact that radium and its decay
products emit both beta and gamma radiation. SEPA confirmed at the last

place remain sufficient to manage the risk to the public such that the

Friday, I was at the Royal Society summer science exhibition. The Royal
Society is our oldest and, some would say, most distinguished
scientific society. Its fundamental purpose is to promote and support
excellence in science and to encourage the development and use of
science for the benefit of humanity. The Royal Society has played a
part in some of the most fundamental, significant and life-changing
discoveries in scientific history, and it continues to make outstanding
contributions to science in many research
areas<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T09:31:20"></hs_TimeCode>. I will

I may say in passing, Mr Speaker might like to visit the Royal Society
because it has a wonderful gold mace that is the mirror image of the
Mace that is carried into the Chamber. The mace was a present to the
Royal Society from Charles II. Among the Royal Society’s former
presidents are Sir Christopher Wren and Edmond Halley. The Royal
Society has a wonderful line and body of knowledge, so I set great
store by it. We must take note when the Royal Society seriously
considers herbal medicine and related methods of

was particularly struck by the Royal Society partnership grant project
with Boroughbridge high school in Harrogate under the direction of
Colin Inglis, the school’s biology tutor, and overseen by
Professor Kerr, the consultant microbiologist at Harrogate and District
NHS Foundation Trust. The project looked at several simple plants and
herbs available in our gardens, from greengrocers and from garden
centres to see what their impact could be on E. coli and other
bugs—I will focus on E. coli. Working over not a very long
period of time, the project found that E. coli growth is inhibited by
the use of thyme, lavender and geranium set in essential oils. They
said that they were able to identify the minimum inhibitory
concentration of those oils derived from herbs and plants—the
lowest concentration of essential oil that inhibits the growth of E.
coli. When I discussed that with the directing staff, they said that
the next step would be to determine the concentration that would kill
E. coli—the minimum bactericidal concentration. That simple
project in a school in Harrogate has huge ramifications, because it
shows how easily-found common herbs and plants can be used in the
furtherance of
medicine<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T09:34:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

at the Royal Society there was a panel discussion on
“Nature’s Marvellous Medicine,” and those
addressing the audience were not ill-informed: Professor Dianna Bowles,
emeritus professor in the department of biology at York university;
Professor Roderick Flower, professor of biochemical pharmacology at the
William Harvey research institute; and Professor Monique Simmonds,
director of the Kew innovation unit, where she studies the chemistry of
plants and fungi—of course, Kew Gardens is currently classifying

chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, recently said that resistance

hospital infections from bugs such as MRSA are greatly reduced, they
are being replaced by infections with other bacteria. Antibiotic use is
rising, not least in agriculture, and resistance is steadily growing in
fish and farm animals—I remember raising the matter in this
House 20 years ago or more—and there are problems with farmers,
particularly in the third world, feeding antibiotics to chickens. I
said then that such use could have catastrophic consequences, and now
we know that, in some parts of the world, cattle have been fed
antibiotics as a prophylactic, so it is no wonder that the new chief
medical officer is focusing on

suggest that one of those areas that needs to be explored is better use
of herbs and plants in medicine. In a sense, and this I not an original
phrase, we need to go back to the future to find those solutions. If I
have anything further to say about Dame Sally’s release, it is
that it does not provide any solution other than to suggest that we
need to go for more antibiotics. The problem is that some doctors are
saying that no antibiotics will work in 20 years’ time. The
Government have a catastrophe management team—that is not the
official title—and I think that issue should be added to its
list<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T09:38:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070941000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0001.htm#13070941000015">Today,
we are not specifically debating common plants that are available as
foods or in the garden. Such plants are covered by different

this country. If I may, I will set out the stall on what has happened
in recent years. We have to go back to the House of Lords Science and
Technology Committee report of 2000 that considered herbal medicine and
other medicines that are not currently used in mainstream health care.

was recommended because those herbal professionals met the agreed
criteria for statutory regulation that the Lords had come up with.
There was a risk to the public through poor practice, and they had a
voluntary regulation system and a credible evidence base. Regulation
would ensure that appropriate training was established, resulting in
competent practitioners with an understanding of the evidence base for
their therapy along with an appreciation of the limitations of the
treatments that they could provide. Safe practitioners would understand
when to refer. Effective regulation would therefore seek to safeguard
the public from incompetent practitioners and identify practitioners
suitably qualified to use a range of potent herbal remedies not
appropriate for over-the-counter sale. There are some powerful
remedies.</hs_Para>

stage in the saga is the European Union’s intervention. However,
I want to make one point at the outset before we consider European
directives. The proposal for statutory legislation pre-dates all the
arguments about European directives, such as the traditional herbal
medicinal products directive and others. The policy had broad
cross-party support, and the distinguished Lords Committee, which
included members such as Lord Walton of Detchant and Lord Baldwin, had
proposed it. Distinguished men came up with that proposal. We were
going down that route
anyway.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070941000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0001.htm#13070941000022">Then
the European Union became involved, with directives. We must address
the directives, but we are not dealing only with them; we are dealing
with a policy that was already in train. The objective of proper
regulation had been there before the European Union directive

January 2002, the Department of Health, along with the Prince’s
Foundation for Integrated Health  and the European Herbal and
Traditional Medicine Practitioners Association established the herbal
medicine regulatory working group—HMRWG. The group and
subsequent groups were chaired by Professor Mike Pitillo, a
well-respected man whom I knew and who devoted many years of his life
to the issue. His efforts were and are still appreciated by all who
knew him; sadly, Mike died in February 2010. God bless him; he put so
much into the issue on behalf of the community. The working
group’s remit was to make recommendations on the regulation of
herbal medicine practitioners and the reform of section 12(1) of the
Medicines Act 1968. In 2003, the group published its report,
“Recommendations on the Regulation of Herbal Practitioners in

the group’s work on the issue of possible reforms to the regime
of unlicensed herbal medicines supplied under section 12 represented
the first stage in the exploration process envisaged by the Government.
It needed to be seen as distinct from but complementary to the wider
European negotiations on the then proposed directive on traditional
herbal medicinal products, which related to industrially produced
traditional herbal remedies sold over the counter directly to the
public.</hs_Para>

parallel to the group was the acupuncture regulatory working group,
which I need not discuss. The HMRWG concluded that the two professions
should be regulated together, thereby addressing the high practitioner
costs of running two separate registers. The Department of Health ran a
consultation on regulation of the two professions, published in 2004 as
“Regulation of Herbal Medicine and Acupuncture: Proposals for
Statutory Regulation”. The results of the consultation were
published in February 2005 as “Statutory Regulation of Herbal

supportive. He has tabled questions and acted for his constituents on
this issue, as he always does. He is right. Three quarters of the
population of the United Kingdom have used traditional Chinese
medicine, herbal medicine, phytotherapy or one of the other disciplines
sometimes classed as complementary. There is a huge swell of people out
there who want such medicines. Going back to Dame Sally’s
remarks, people are now frightened of using antibiotics; they are
worried about overuse and that, when they really want them, they might
not be effective. We have a crisis not only of effectiveness but of
confidence. People who tend to go down the herbal medicine route have a
lot of confidence, however, because they are dealing with nature and
natural products that have been used over the years. Properly
administered, those products do not have side effects and they are not

come to the nub of what could be a huge crisis. If statutory regulation
fails to go ahead, a wide range of herbal medicines supplied by

stopped practitioners prescribing herbal medicines made by

Tredinnick:</Member></B> My hon. Friend illustrates the point. The
European directive on traditional herbal medicinal products now
prevents third-party manufactured herbal medicines being prescribed to
patients by practitioners, as well as individualised herbal medicines
prescribed by practitioners and manufactured by a third party. One of
the communities in the herbal medicine diaspora most affected is that
of traditional Chinese medical practitioners. The directive has already
had a negative impact on the availability of Chinese herbal medicine in
the UK and Europe. The problem lies in the fact that the directive
stipulated that, to prove traditional usage, there must be a 30-year
history of usage, of which 15 years must be in the European Union. That
can be difficult, because many Chinese medicines have been
used for thousands of years in China—Chinese medicine goes back
3,000 years at least—but not in the European Union or
the
UK<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T09:55:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070941000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0001.htm#13070941000042">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T09:56:15"></hs_TimeCode>

with China. Probably, no one envisaged what was going to happen. I will
touch on that, because I was speaking to the Foreign Secretary about it
last week. We now have a situation in which, once stocks of some
Chinese medicines run out, it will not be possible to buy many of the

of the solutions that I will propose—I know that you have an
impartial role as Chair, Mr Bone, but I have heard mention of the

finish with the Chinese problem, we are dealing with an international
issue. We are trying to develop trade with China and have just opened a
lot of trade missions there—the Department for Business,
Innovation and Skills and the Foreign Secretary are backing such
attempts—and we see it as a great area, but the Chinese are not
happy about the idea that they have western medicine in their country,
but we do not make full use of Chinese medicine over here. I have
spoken to people about that. The idea that we will have a sweeping of
the shelves of Chinese medicine will not play well in the international
domain. We have had some controversial issues—the
Government’s approach to the Dalai Lama was not overwhelmingly
well received by some people in China, although many in this country
support what has happened over there. If the Foreign Secretary has not
yet been in touch with the Minister, he might well do so, because our

somehow, we have got to an impasse. I have had some helpful
conversations, but there have been all sorts of suspicious signals and
it is no secret that some practitioners have found it hard to get to
the Department; some of the herbal medicine governing bodies have
complained that they have not had easy access. Things do not feel quite
normal, because the flow of information has not been what we might have
expected. I have been told that the problem that stalled the process

key reason why the issue has got stuck has nothing to do with health
care but is to do with the turf war and vested interests. I suspect
that there are people in the medical establishment who do not want
statutory regulation because they think it would interfere with the
status of their own profession. When I talked to the Department for
Business, Innovation and Skills about this, there seemed to be some
confusion because it thinks that we might be going down a route of more
regulation unnecessarily, but, sine qua non, there will be no herbal
sector if we do not do something about it. Not doing something is not
an option. We cannot just leave the matter as it is. I am pretty sure

this.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070941000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0001.htm#13070941000053">I

health care and vested interests. That is worrying because those vested
interests may be very powerful. Returning to what Dame Sally, the chief
medical officer, said and what I learned at the Royal Society last
Friday, I ask those vested interests to back off because antibiotics
are not working. We need to find something else and herbal medicine is
one way forward. It has been suggested that there would a legal

is a very real fear that should the legislation not go through and
should our health food shops continue to suffer from our inaction, or
from the Government’s inaction, such closures will mean that
more people will order online with no face-to-face interaction or
advice. They will not be told that they should not take certain
supplements if they are on other medications, or that two supplements
may counteract each other. The problem will not only mean fewer jobs on
high streets, but potentially more pressure on our GPs in surgeries, as
they try to figure out symptoms that may have been

many of us question the benefits of supplements, especially in the busy
lives that we lead, which often mean that we cannot eat as healthily as
we would otherwise like. However, who here knew that taking the blood
thinner warfarin with a multivitamin containing vitamin K would put
people’s health in jeopardy? The lady in the health food shop
did, and she was able to advise people who came to her about it. What
happens when there is no local shop? Will GP calls be taken up with
queries from, for example, people suffering from nausea, dizziness and
so on, who find out, after extensive and expensive tests, that when
they read in their magazine that vitamin E encourages glossy, thick
hair, they had not realised that the aforementioned symptoms could be
caused by too much vitamin E. That did not appeal to me, but if I had
thought that vitamin E would have given me glossy black hair, or even
roots, I would have bought it by the gallon. However, unfortunately,
that was not the case. When people are buying supplements in health
food shops, they ask what they are taking and are given advice.

start by reiterating my view that when people voted to join the common
market back in 1975, they never would have dreamt that the EU would
interfere in this kind of thing. However, it is absolutely crucial that
if we are going to prevent the very well-established and effective
herbal medicine products from disappearing, literally, from our shops

sector, we need to get this regulation as quickly as
possible.</hs_Para>

dislike regulation and want to see less of it. I believe that most
people have common sense; they know what is good for them and want to
do what they think is 
<?notus-xml column=12?>right. They do not need bureaucrats from the Department of Health
telling them all the time what they should and should not be taking. We
hear that all the time in so-called public health adverts, when most of
what is said is either common sense or complete nonsense. I am a great
believer in using not only herbal medicine, but natural products from
our countryside. There are so many common-sense things that most of us
grew up with—not necessarily only people brought up in the
countryside but them in particular. If someone got stung by a nettle,
they went immediately and looked for a docken leaf. We did all sorts of
things naturally, and now, very few people seem to feel that that is
what we should look to.

other issue that I want to raise is about the Health and Care
Professions Council, which I think the Minister has overall
responsibility for. It is based in my constituency and does a brilliant
job. However, recently, it seems as though the Department’s
general view on what it does and how it works has changed. We have been
trying to get sports therapists registered for a very long time.
Everyone agrees that that should happen. The HCPC, which is meant to be
the body that gives advice, has gone and said, “This must be
registered. We must do this.” Sport England wants it to happen,
as does anybody involved in sport; yet somewhere in the Department,
there is a block. I actually do not think that it is Ministers; I think
that it is officials. Officials do not care who is in government; they
do what they want to do; and they will continue to pull a line.

groups, including Consumers for Health Choice, are very clear that they
want the Secretary of State and the other Ministers to ignore the siren
call from officials and fulfil their promises. This is very simple.
When the register was announced back in February 2011, it was warmly
welcomed by virtually everyone. Consumers were pleased that the
register allowed an exception for herbal practitioners from the
traditional herbal medicinal products directive—an EU law that
became fully applicable in April 2011 and would have meant the banning
of all unregistered herbal medicinal products. People will remember the
campaign that was held across the country. All MPs got many letters of
protest from constituents and from herbal shops and health shops. At
the time, the position was that virtually all herbal medicinal products
would have been banned. A register would have allowed practitioners to
access unlicensed products, thus preserving choice in relation to safe

the Member for Bosworth said, it appears that the Department has been
thrown into a state of paralysis by the judgment on Poland. Poland was
clearly caught out trying to break the rules and, under EU regulations,
the Commission took Poland to the Luxembourg Court, which duly found
against Poland. The Polish case is not a parallel to the United Kingdom
situation. It may be a judgment on the same part of the EU legislation,
but Poland was trying to abuse article 5.1; the United
Kingdom Government said that they wanted to comply with article 5.1, by
coming up with the statutory register. If Her Majesty’s
Government believe that that judgment on Poland is the cause of their
paralysis, the Minister needs to say so today and explain why that
judgment is holding up the United Kingdom setting up a statutory

EU directive has come in; that was in April 2011. The Government said
that they would have a statutory register by the end of 2012, to
ameliorate the worst effects of the directive, yet more than two years
on, the herbal medicine industry, which Her Majesty’s Government
said that they wanted to protect, remains exposed to that EU directive.
That is simply an unacceptable situation. There will be, in all our
constituencies, small and medium-sized herbal practitioners that are
finding their livelihoods affected by an EU directive that the
Government promised they would ameliorate—two years on, they
have failed to do so. The Minister needs to explain to the House today
why we are in this sorry state and what he will do to sort it out as

distinction between those remarks and the subject of today’s
debate. I am sure that the chief medical officer would not wish her
remarks to be associated with a call for a greater use of herbal
medicine—that was clearly not outlined in her paper. Although it
is important that we always consider ways—via traditional
medical routes or otherwise—of improving people’s 
<?notus-xml column=18?>health and providing the right therapies, the paper clearly laid out the
long-standing challenges as being about antibiotic resistance, and it

way of background, it is worth highlighting that although we support
patient choice some herbal products have caused harm to consumers.
There are a number of reasons why that might happen: the herb may be
intrinsically toxic; the product may be accidentally or purposefully
contaminated by harmful materials or heavy metals; people may choose
herbal products for serious conditions when medicines with a solid
evidence base would be more appropriate; and, if herbal products are
taken together with conventional medicines, the interactions may be
unpredictable. It is right, therefore, that we support the responsible
use of medicines and have a licensing
system.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070942000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0001.htm#13070942000052">Directive

harmonise the European Union internal market and remove barriers to

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T10:44:03"></hs_TimeCode>Hon. Members
will be aware that on 16 February 2011 the Government announced their
intention to take forward the regulation of herbal medicine
practitioners and traditional Chinese medicine practitioners,

practice<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T10:44:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070942000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0001.htm#13070942000054">Herbal
products broadly fall into three categories. The first are the 310
herbal medicines that already have a marketing authorisation or a
traditional herbal registration—in other words, a product
licence. Those 310 medications are currently available for use
and  are effectively licensed. They are safe and widely used,
and have undergone all relevant testing and checks. The second
category, which is the one we are addressing today, covers products
manufactured by a third party. Such products have been illegal since
April 2011, following the implementation of the EU directive. The third
category is products made up by a practitioner on their own premises
following an individual consultation. Although such products are not
affected by the directive, some of the herbal ingredients may be
restricted by the Human Medicines Regulations
2012.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070942000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0001.htm#13070942000055">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T10:45:52"></hs_TimeCode>
previous Health Secretary’s concerns about the second
category—products manufactured by a third party—prompted
the decision to take forward statutory regulation of such products. The
Government’s intention was to allow regulated herbal
practitioners lawfully to source third-party manufactured herbal
medicines, with appropriate safeguards in place to minimise the risks 
<?notus-xml column=19?>associated with the products, but since April 2011 the European
directive has made it illegal for herbal practitioners in the UK to
source such products for their

the Member for Kettering mentioned, we have reassessed the risks. That
case actually concerned unlicensed conventional medicines being used
because they were cheaper, and although there is a clear distinction
between those products and herbal remedies we had to look at what else
the judgment said. It looked at the specials regime and, critically, it
emphasised how strictly the regime must be applied. The judgment has a
knock-on effect for what we propose for the use of herbal medicines
manufactured by third parties without a licence, and it therefore needs
careful consideration because there is a very high risk that we would
be found to be in infraction of the European directive. We therefore
need to consider further herbal products manufactured by a third party,

supports responsible businesses and ensures public safety. Since the
announcement in February 2011, the Department of Health has been
working with officials in the devolved Administrations and with the
Health and Care Professions Council to establish a statutory register
for herbal practitioners. Alongside that, we have been considering a
strengthened system for regulating medicinal products, to enable
consumers to have access to a greater range of third-party manufactured

companies going into administration of people not being able to cash in
their gift vouchers or losing their savings in schemes such as Farepak.

experience with Portsmouth FC has taught me that the victims of a
company’s administration are not always obvious. In that case,
rules that were not widely known meant that football creditors were at
the head of the queue for repayment, despite the fact that the credit
of others had been just as vital to the running of the club. Those at
the head of these queues might receive only a tiny fraction of their
investment, and those at the back nothing at all. It is devastating to
be told that, through the mismanagement of others, one will not receive
back a penny of one’s loan. How much worse is it to be told that
money one has paid over, not as a loan but in exchange for goods, will
be taken without

is a terribly unjust position in which the holders of gift cards find
themselves when the shop that issued the card goes into administration.
Such people should not be treated as ordinary creditors. A grandmother
who buys her grandchildren the once-ubiquitous WHSmith voucher for
Christmas does not regard herself as having lent Smith’s any
money. On the contrary, she has  made a purchase. Indeed, her
circumstances are just the 
<?notus-xml column=23?>opposite of a creditor’s, who might expect to receive some
interest on his loan, as her gift card is worth less and less as time
passes, due to the effects of inflation. It is as illogical to deny
gift card holders the right to redeem their vouchers as it would be to
demand that people who had bought their goods return them to the shop
to help pay off the creditors. It is from that essential point that we
must proceed today. A gift card is not a bond certificate; the money
has not been loaned to the company. Quite simply, the collection of the
product has been deferred, which is, in any case, to the advantage of
the company. That principle has already been recognised at an EU level
in respect of e-money, which is money put on to pre-paid cards or gift
cards bought through third parties. Those moneys must be kept in
segregated accounts pending the use of the cards, so that the consumer
is
protected<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T11:04:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070946000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0001.htm#13070946000009">In
Britain, that scheme is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, a
successor to the Financial Services Authority. Individual retailers may
opt in to the scheme, but, for perhaps obvious reasons, the temptation
seems to have been uniformly resisted. Although there is no mandatory
and regulated scheme for cards issued by companies independently for
use in their own shops, there appears to be no impediment to its
introduction. Already many retailers that issue their own unregulated
cards accept the regulated cards issued by third parties, such as the
One4all card, including Argos, Boots, B&amp;Q, Currys, Debenhams,
Topshop and the aforementioned WHSmith. In all, the Gift Voucher Shop,
which is responsible for the One4all card, has more than 1,500
corporate clients. Surely that is a double standard that should not be
allowed to continue. Two customers who intend to spend their vouchers
at the same shop could thus be in the absurd situation that one can
have a full refund and the other receives nothing. The matter is left
entirely to the discretion of the
administrator.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070946000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0001.htm#13070946000010">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T11:05:23"></hs_TimeCode>
is true that under the Consumer Credit Act 2006, those who bought
vouchers with credit cards are protected, but only if they bought
between £100 and £30,000 of vouchers. The problem here is
twofold: people who buy vouchers as savings, perhaps against the
expense of Christmas, are very unlikely to use credit cards; and those
who buy vouchers as gifts to put towards say the purchase of white
goods on a wedding list are unlikely to do so to the sum of
£100. Chargeback offers some protection to consumers using
certain debit cards, such as Visa, American Express and MasterCard. In
all circumstances, there is a 120-day window in which to make a claim
for a refund, and the claim must be made by the purchaser, not the
holder of the voucher. Once again, that is contingent on a given card
supplier operating the scheme, and, in all circumstances, those who
bought vouchers with cash, which is a likely scenario when smaller sums
are involved and if the people buying them are paid in cash, are
entirely

is hard to understand is why the administrator is allowed to
appropriate the money held against vouchers for the purposes of winding
up the business. As I said earlier, that is akin to telling anyone who
has previously bought something from that shop to return it without a
refund, or the practices of the most artless playground

administrators are prepared to accept vouchers, such as those for
Nicole Farhi and Blockbuster. Holders of Republic vouchers were not so
fortunate, which meant that the administrator simply took £1.2
million in advance payments. That is £1.2 million with just one
retailer. The evidence of total sales suggests that there is still a
demand for gift vouchers. Last year, more than  £4
billion was spent on their purchase and, as they are not exchangeable
for cash, one can only assume that retailers like them, too. How many
of the people who contributed to that £4 billion knew that they,
or the vouchers’ intended recipients, were so
vulnerable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T11:07:40"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070946000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0001.htm#13070946000013">Currently,
holders of gift cards are well down the order of priority for
creditors. They are on a par with Her Majesty’s Revenue and
Customs, suppliers and unsecured creditors, but behind secured
creditors, the costs of insolvency, and debts due to preferential
creditors and employees. I do not argue too much with the order of
creditors other than to say that employees should never be an
afterthought. My point is simply that gift card holders do not belong
on a list of creditors at all. It is not possible to exchange gift
vouchers for cash, which is further proof that they are not a form of
credit as there is never any prospect of getting back one’s
money. It would be bizarre if this were permitted when a company went
into administration. Rather, it should be possible to redeem
one’s vouchers. That would resolve some of the concerns of the
Association of Business Recovery Professionals about the knock-on
effects of promoting holders of vouchers up the list of preferred
creditors. R3, as it is known, is anxious that were card holders
prioritised, businesses and suppliers, which are currently with card
holders in the fifth tranche of those to be paid by administrators,
would be even worse off.</hs_Para>

I understand only too well the hardship that is borne by small
businesses that must extend credit in order to get the trade they need

creditors—those who issue secured loans—would be more

has put forward three possible solutions—a requirement to
purchase bonds against the value of issued gift cards; the ring-fencing
of the money used to buy cards until they are redeemed; and the
extension of the 2006 Act to include purchases under £100.
However, each of these solutions has problems. In the case of the first
two, they would handicap solvent businesses by restricting cash flow
and they could make administration more likely. Equally, extending the
2006 Act would come into effect only if administration procedures
began, but cash buyers would still be out in the cold.</hs_Para>

one takes all of these factors into account—the need to protect

or disadvantaging employees  
<?notus-xml column=25?>—the solution seems clear. If vouchers are allowed to be
redeemed, the administrator does not need to surrender the money that
it has on deposit through the sale of gift cards.
Instead stock, which would be very likely to be

already said that there are products out there that would do the same
thing as some of these gift vouchers and that could be exchanged for
goods at an enormous number of retailers. Clearly, if people were aware

themselves by not buying them, they would go and buy them. So she is

the gift voucher holders were allowed to redeem those vouchers in
exchange for goods, that would be done at pre-insolvency prices, which
is after all the basis on which the cards were bought. Therefore, the
impact on the administrator would be more modest than otherwise.
Furthermore, the goodwill of the card holders would be sustained. The
fact that they hold vouchers for a specific shop suggests that they
would like to buy its goods, and they are the very people on whom the
administrator would rely during a post-insolvency sale. Indeed,
treating<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T11:12:39"></hs_TimeCode> gift

do not pretend that this problem is easily solved, but it would be
helpful if the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills
recognised that there was a problem and that a solution was required. I
have raised this matter in the House and I have written a number of
times to the Minister who is here in Westminster Hall today. In one of
the replies that I received, it was even acknowledged that gift cards
are considered to be pre-payments for specific goods and services,

vouchers up the order in which creditors are paid when there is an
administration or an insolvency procedure. She has been that advocate
for very sound reasons. We all understand the distress that is caused
when a business—whether it is a major high street chain or a
smaller local company—goes into administration. People are very
disappointed if they are holding gift cards, which often have been
actual gifts to them, but those cards end up being worthless.
Clearly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T11:15:03"></hs_TimeCode>, that
situation causes upset and I understand the need and the desire to
address it.</hs_Para>

the Government are keen to try to ensure that those types of problems
do not continue. A huge amount of work has been done with
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T11:15:04"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Newport East (Jessica Morden) and others on the particular issue of

We have seen some positive moves by parts of industry that perhaps show
the way for us to find some solutions to this issue; I will discuss
them later. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T11:15:24"></hs_TimeCode>The
specific solution of moving gift-card holders up the hierarchy is not
necessarily the best solution; there may be other solutions and I hope
to explore some of them in my remarks.</hs_Para>

address the particular issue of whether we should change the order in
which creditors are paid. Both my right hon. Friend the Business
Secretary and I have listened very carefully to a range of views on
whether consumers with pre-payment cards and vouchers should be made
preferential creditors. However, the problems of doing so—some
of which my hon. Friend touched on in her speech—prove that this
is not a solution that is especially desirable for vulnerable groups,
such as employees or small and medium-sized enterprises that had
supplied goods to the business in
question<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T11:16:30"></hs_TimeCode>. Much
as I sympathise with all of the people in that situation, there are
individuals for whom there is a real responsibility to try to get as
much money back as possible. Just looking at one group in particular is
perhaps not helpful; we need to look at all the individuals who are
affected by an insolvency.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13070946000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0001.htm#13070946000027"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T11:16:55"></hs_TimeCode>Unfortunately,
as my hon. Friend said, after an insolvency, an administration or a
company not doing as well as it would have wanted to, a limited amount
of money is available. Ultimately, that business has not been
successful, and that money must be spread out among the creditors. The
question is how that pot of money should be divided up.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13070946000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0001.htm#13070946000028">Among those
seeking to be reimbursed from that limited pot of money are employees
who may have worked but not been paid their full wages; business
suppliers, many of which may be the SMEs that we all want to support in
order to help the economy, particularly in our own constituencies, and
we are well aware of the challenges that small businesses face;
financial institutions; and Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs.
The difficulty is that, with that limited pot of money, if we were to
change the preferential creditor status to improve the position of
holders of gift cards, that would necessarily make the position of
those other creditors worse. Therefore, it is a win-lose situation, not
a win-win situation.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13070946000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0001.htm#13070946000029"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T11:18:04"></hs_TimeCode>I
am particularly concerned about two of those groups—employees
and SMEs. Just like gift-card holders, business suppliers fall within
the category of unsecured creditors.  
<?notus-xml column=27?>Therefore, they often receive only a fraction of what they are owed in
these cases. That can have a particularly disproportionate impact on
their finances, and we need to ensure that that is uppermost in our
minds when we consider this issue.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T11:18:43"></hs_TimeCode>Making gift-card
holders preferential creditors could, especially if large numbers of
gift cards were issued, reduce the already scarce funds available to
those supplier businesses, which are arguably in as much need—if
not more so—of those funds to continue operating and continue
employing people. We do not want to end up with a system where more
businesses are suffering financial distress. So,
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T11:19:07"></hs_TimeCode>the suggestion
that we do something that could have a negative impact on the financial
viability of small businesses must be treated with a great deal of
caution<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T11:19:14"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T11:19:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070946000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0001.htm#13070946000030">With
employees, there is a slightly different situation, because they are
already in the pool of preferential creditors. However, if we add more
people to that pool, of course the money that is available must go
further. Employees could be in an even worse situation, in already
difficult circumstances. Of course, we feel for gift-card holders when
a high street chain goes bust, but we also feel for the employees, many
of whom have huge uncertainty and do not know whether they are going to
keep their job, whether the company will be bought out or whether some
branches will remain open. If they do not even get paid for the work
that they have already done—although some schemes enable them to
reclaim some amount towards the payment they would have
received—they end up out of pocket. That is a particular concern
when considering such a
change<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T11:20:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070946000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0001.htm#13070946000031">My
hon. Friend also mentioned secured creditors, such as banks, which do
not necessarily always elicit the most sympathy in this House or in the
wider public. However, if lenders cannot rely with confidence on the
security given by borrowers, they might become less inclined to lend in
the first place or might factor that risk into increased costs of
borrowing. As my hon. Friend said, there are already challenges in
respect of bank lending to small
businesses<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T11:20:45"></hs_TimeCode>.
Putting further hurdles in the way and burdens in place could limit
access to working capital for a business that might already be under
financial pressure and, ironically, could perhaps hasten the failure of
such a business and even its
insolvency<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T11:20:59"></hs_TimeCode>.
These issues and impacts mean that that solution is not necessarily the
right way to address the matter. My hon. Friend will not necessarily be
happy with that answer, but I hope that she understands why the
Government take that
view<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T11:21:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070946000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0001.htm#13070946000032"><B><Member ContinuationText="Penny Mordaunt" PimsId="5714" UID="13070946000057" xid="1105" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0001.htm#13070946000057">Penny

discussed this morning. For example,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T11:21:36"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

have suggested that such consumers should not be treated as creditors
and that they could receive preferential treatment in exchanging the
vouchers for goods, which is what they originally wanted to
do<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T11:21:51"></hs_TimeCode>. I am keen
that the Minister does something. There is considerable evidence that
companies are continuing to sell vouchers even though they know that

issues that my hon. Friend raised are worth pursuing, particularly
those relating to the 2006 Act. I am happy to take up some of the
suggestions raised by R3 and get back to her. That would help in some
cases, but where payments are made in cash, which is often the case for
the small amounts on gift vouchers, that protection would not
necessarily be extended. Various solutions may
assist<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T11:22:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070946000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0001.htm#13070946000035">We
have been trying to work with the industry, challenging it to do more
to deal with these issues and support these consumers. On whether goods
will be able to be bought in exchange for gift cards, of course, it is
not always the case that they cannot be. As my hon. Friend mentioned,
in many cases administrators allow vouchers to be redeemed, although
there is often an initial period of uncertainty, as in the example of
Nicole Farhi last week, as she said. This is done for sound business
reasons, where the administrator wants to preserve the goodwill of a
business if their objective is to sell it on as a going concern for the
benefit of all creditors. That can have real business
benefits<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T11:23:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070946000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0001.htm#13070946000036">One
challenge for businesses that know they are going into administration
is that they are trying to ensure that they are as viable as possible
and are maximising their business assets, which can be one reason why
gift cards and gift vouchers continue to be sold. But if some other
solutions could be put in place by industry, that may not need to be a
problem<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T11:24:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070946000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0001.htm#13070946000037">There
are four ways in which industry could be encouraged to think about how
it can further protect consumers. First, as has been mentioned, the
Electronic Money Regulations 2011 provide protection for prepayments
when made in card form. My hon. Friend mentioned the One4all card and
there is also a system operated by O2, where a card loaded up with
money is then usable at a wide range of outlets, through the card
issuer systems. It is not restricted to a single retailer or a group of
retailers. Such cards are treated differently; effectively, much more
like currency—like
cash<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T11:24:44"></hs_TimeCode>. If more
gift cards were delivered through those open loop systems, that would
be one way that the industry could help to protect
consumers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T11:24:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070946000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0001.htm#13070946000038">Secondly,
there is the good example of the Co-op, where payments made by
consumers can be held in a separate trust-protected account. The Co-op
Christmas savings has now moved to this model, which is an excellent
initiative. It deserves huge credit for doing this and recognising that
this gives their consumers extra benefit, and it is another reason for
consumers who want to save for Christmas in that way, with an
organisation or a shop such as the Co-op, to do so. It is also
important that the Co-op managed to do this quickly, without incurring
significant additional expense and within the existing constraints of
its operating systems. I encourage others to follow such a
model.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070946000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0001.htm#13070946000039">Thirdly—we
need to challenge the industry on this—gift card and voucher
issuers should consider adopting an industry code of practice, with
specific commitments on the protection of customers’
prepayments. The Trading Standards Institute has a consumer codes
approval scheme, with core principles on the protection of prepayments
and deposits. The widespread adoption  
<?notus-xml column=29?>of those principles by the industry would be a clear message to
administrators about the industry view on how consumers should expect
their prepayments to be
treated.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070946000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0001.htm#13070946000040">Fourthly,
it is also worth exploring whether industry could introduce
insurance-backed protection of prepayments. This already works well
within the package travel sector.
Such<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T11:25:49"></hs_TimeCode> options may
be part of the solution more widely within the retail sector and may be
able to protect
consumers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T11:26:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070946000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0001.htm#13070946000041">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T11:26:41"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Newport East mentioned having a warning system on gift
vouchers. This has merit, because one challenge is the lack of
information. People assume sometimes that buying a gift voucher is like
having cash, rather than, as the hon. Lady highlighted, making them a
creditor to a business. Making it clearer to consumers up front that
there is a risk, although generally that risk will be small, might mean
that consumers would think twice about buying a gift card from a
certain company, or set of companies, and might not leave it sitting in
a drawer, gathering dust for months, instead deciding to spend their
gift because there is no guarantee—it is not like having cash
sitting in their purse—and there is a level of risk with this
product<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T11:27:42"></hs_TimeCode>. Given
that there is currently a level of risk with this product, it is
appropriate that consumers should be aware of that. Informed, empowered
consumers are an important part of having a stronger economy, because
we need them to have confidence to go out there and buy products and
gifts<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T11:27:57"></hs_TimeCode>. Any
measures that can enhance that would
help<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T11:28:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070946000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0001.htm#13070946000042">We
hope that the consumer bill of rights will be introduced later this
year. Hon. Members will be aware 
<?notus-xml column=30?>that the draft was published a few weeks ago. It is, rightly,
going through pre-legislative scrutiny in this House. A range of
protections is built into the Consumer Rights Bill and the associated
consumer rights directive, which has come from Europe and will be
introduced in the UK through secondary legislation. Those protections
relate to how prominent, transparent and up-front the information that
consumers need before making decisions needs to be. Hon. Members have
mentioned warning labels, or similar information—a key
point—which should perhaps be included for
consumers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T11:28:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070946000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0001.htm#13070946000043">I

People employed on zero-hours contracts are treated differently to
employees, and as such they are second-class staff. People employed on
zero-hours contracts earn 40% less than those in fixed-hours
employment. A study by the Resolution Foundation shows that, before
tax, people on zero-hours contracts earn an average wage of just
£9 an hour, juxtaposed with £15 an hour for people with
set contract hours. Among graduates, the difference is £10 an
hour versus £20 an hour. Firms that use zero-hours contracts
have a higher ratio of low-paid staff than firms that do not use such
contracts. Zero-hours contracts have traditionally been employed in the

The Institute for Fiscal Studies has calculated that for every

credits and benefits. The Resolution Foundation has calculated that if
everyone now receiving the minimum wage received the living wage, there
would be a £2.2 billion net saving, comprised of higher income
tax and national insurance receipts. There is growing evidence that
living wages boost productivity, motivation and performance, and reduce
leaver and absentee rates, thereby offsetting the cost of the higher
wage. The people who reject that analysis are the same people who said
that the national minimum wage would lead to vastly higher levels of

point I want to impress on the Minister is that when employers treat
people on zero-hours contracts in that way and where their use is
widespread, it is likely that they are poor employers across the board.
One firm in my constituency, Cherish, provides care to elderly people
in their own homes. It breaches the minimum wage requirements because
its employees are not paid for travel time, which is often hugely
variable in my large constituency. Most of those women do not have
transport because they cannot afford it as they are not paid enough, so
they must travel long distances on several bus routes, which takes a
long time, but they are not paid a penny for that. Lunch is not
factored in and their payslips are confusing and incomplete. A whole
host of problems have been brought to me about Cherish, and when I

this Session, I have presented two private Members’ Bills to
offer greater protection to the lowest paid and most vulnerable workers
in Britain. The Gangmasters Licensing Authority (Extension of Powers)
Bill will extend the powers of the Gangmasters Licensing Authority to
enable it to regulate employment agencies in all sectors of the
economy. That is combined with my Zero Hours Contracts Bill, which will
prohibit the use of zero-hours employment contracts and end the scandal
of employers requiring workers to be available for work when there is
no guarantee of available work. I will go further than other
contributors to this debate and say that zero-hours contracts should be
banned. A contract of employment clearly implies that there is some
employment. All too often the problem with zero-hours contracts is that
people are not given any employment, yet they are required to attend
for
work.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070971000073" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0001.htm#13070971000073">I

be right that someone in a permanent job is not given a permanent and

few weeks ago, the Resolution Foundation published an excellent report
stating that those employed on zero-hours contracts receive lower gross
weekly pay, and that workplaces utilising zero-hours contracts have a
higher proportion of staff on low pay. In my constituency, zero-hours
contracts and agency workers create a two-tier work force with
permanent employees being paid better and having security of
employment, but many others are paid incredibly low wages and are
exploited from week to
week.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070971000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0001.htm#13070971000080">The
argument is that zero-hours contracts offer flexibility, but I would
argue that if those contracts are justifiable, that flexibility should
be beneficial to both employers and employees. In most cases, that is
simply not so, particularly in low-wage sectors. Workers on those
contracts have no control over the hours they work, the amount of money
they earn each week or even the breaks they take. Reports show that
care workers on zero-hours contracts are not paid for travel time or
gaps between appointments. Unison published some excellent research on
the impact on social care. I have a personal concern about that and I
urge the Minister to look at it in detail. I would have said more about
it if I had had more

contracts are just the tip of the iceberg. My hon. Friends have called
for a review of the whole culture of work in this country, particularly
as it has developed during the recession and in recent years as our
economy has flatlined. Under-employment is generally too high in all
its forms. Self-employment has been rising and bogus self-employment is
a big issue. We have particular issues with Swedish derogation
contracts that guarantee minimum hours of pay between agency
assignments to exempt people from minimum pay.</hs_Para>

look at the issues in detail in Corby. The initiative was taken in my
area, and I was not surprised to see the level of exploitation. When
visiting agencies, they found more than 70 breaches of employment law,
and HMRC put a figure of £100,000 on the money owed to local
workers in my constituency. I urge the Minister to provide proper
resources to HMRC’s minimum wage department and to support the
vital role of the Employment Agency Standards inspectorate. It protects
the most vulnerable people in my constituency and around the country.

subcontracted employers end up in employment disputes that hit the

reform, and a review will report in the autumn. However, I fear that it
is unlikely to lead to an outright ban on zero-hours contracts and that
it will not be the precursor of a much-needed agenda for promoting fair

hope that the Government will, at a minimum, recognise the indisputable
case for introducing more stringent safeguards to provide greater
certainty and security for the growing numbers who work on these
contracts. It is almost as though we have gone back in time to a scene
from “On the Waterfront”. I have witnessed people turning
up at factory gates and being chosen for a shift, while others are
turned away and told to come back the next day. Those are simply not

use of zero-hours contracts is, as many hon. Members have said,
widespread across both public and private sectors. A survey by the
Industrial Relations Service suggests that 23% of employers now include
zero hours as an employment option. In public services, the care sector
has been particularly vulnerable, with more and more such contracts.
The situation is likely to worsen further under the NHS’s new
commissioning arrangements, which do not guarantee providers with work,
so that they in turn do not guarantee work to staff. That alarming

may say the employers cannot be blamed, but I do not care who is
blamed: no one should have to suffer the indignity of a contract under
which it is possible for no work at all to be provided. In figures from
the national minimum dataset for social care, it is estimated that
150,000 domiciliary care workers alone are employed on zero-hours
contracts. Statistics released last week by the Minister of State,
Department of Health, the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb)
suggest that 307,000 people in the social care sector, or 20% of the
work force, are employed in that way. Within the North Tees and
Hartlepool NHS foundation trust alone—that is the one that
serves my area—there were 786 zero- hours or casual
contracts in operation in April 2013, 682 of which were for clinical
positions. I acknowledge that some of those may cover people with other
roles, elsewhere and within the trust, but I still think it is a
scandal that we are trying to provide care on that basis—even if
it does afford the employer flexibility to fill gaps.</hs_Para>

in the worst scenarios, zero-hours contracts can result in some of the
most vulnerable people—who care for other vulnerable
people—being unfairly treated owing to a lack of proper
protections. Recent work by the Resolution Foundation indicates that
those who are employed on zero-hours contracts work fewer hours than
those who are not, averaging 21 hours per week compared to 32 hours per
week; and there is a gap of about £6 an hour, on average,
between those who are on zero-hours contracts and those who are not.
Not only does that put employees completely at the mercy of employers,
presenting the opportunity for rogue employers to exploit workers; it
also removes any semblance of the stability and certainty that must be

imbalances operate in many workplaces, and workers who need a minimum
number of hours a week to remain financially secure often find the
uncertainty of working fluctuating numbers of hours tremendously tough.
Similarly, some find their contractual situation becomes a device
through which loyalty is used to determine future work load. In
essence, the allocation of a favourable number of hours becomes reliant
on such factors as previous flexibility and a willingness to accept all
hours offered, as well as fickle aspects such as cordial relationships
with line managers. Regardless of how good a worker someone is, if
their face does not fit, their zero-based contract may mean just
that—zero. The repercussions that are used to sanction employees
who are deemed to have stepped out of line should be better regulated

action was taken to protect the interests of workers and stop that

guarantee of any hours, and therefore, they have been named zero-hours
contracts. In many cases, workers are desperate to increase the number
of hours they work, and many of them are on very low incomes. These
contracts seem extremely exploitative and make the lives of some of the

turn to the issue of care workers. As has been mentioned, a report by
Unison found that 40% of home care workers are employed on zero-hours
contracts, and that number is thought to be on the rise. Home care
workers play an incredibly important role in our society, especially
given that we have an ever-increasing ageing population. They are
saving the state money by ensuring that elderly people can stay in
their homes and live there, rather than in a care home, and they are
ensuring that elderly people are not in hospital. I am particularly
concerned about reports suggesting that those workers are not being
paid for travel time between visits. It seems that that must be, in
some way, illegal—how can it be legal? In winding up, if the
Minister has time, I would like her to comment on that point. If they
have not been guaranteed a minimum wage for the real hours that they
are working, have their minimum wage rights been breached? Is the
employer, in such cases, in breach of the European working time
directive?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070971000129" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0002.htm#13070971000129"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T15:33:19"></hs_TimeCode>Finally,
let me say something about the public sector, because the contract is
not unique to carers. We are seeing the increasing use of such
contracts in all parts of the public sector, whether in the health
service or elsewhere. In the health service alone, workplaces using
zero-hours contracts rose from 7% in 2004 to 13% in 2011. Central
Government have also been found to be using zero-hours contracts. As
has been suggested, local government 
<?notus-xml column=49?>contracts seem to be driving the rise of these exploitative contracts.

the Minister reassure Labour Members, who are concerned about this

many of the workers who have had those contracts are low paid, and will
it consider banning the contracts? Will she say whether central
Government will take a leading role in getting rid of the contracts
from their own payroll and do something to discourage, dissuade or even
sanction local government if, when contracts are issued, conditions are

debate is timely, because the use of zero-hours contracts can be seen
in a wider context of rising inequalities. Regrettably, inequalities in
income are increasing, and the gap between rich and poor is widening.
The Government are only exacerbating that. Living standards have been
frozen, or in some cases, have declined for many lower and
middle-income workers. The mean family income in 2015 will have the
same worth as in 2002. For the first time in generations, parents are
concerned and expect that their children will be worse off than them.
The increasing use of zero-hours contracts in the private and public

worker, or self-employed. We shall set aside the fourth, new category
of someone who is an employee shareholder, as that is a different
debate altogether. If we look at those three categories, it is clear
what someone who is self-employed is. There is a whole body of case law
about what the definitions of an employee and a worker are. Many would
argue that someone on a zero-hours contract is, in fact, a worker, but
that worker needs to have some kind of mutuality of obligation, and
there cannot be a mutuality of obligation if the worker has to turn up
for work at their expense, but the employer has no need to give them
any hours. That does not seem to me to be any sort of
mutuality.</hs_Para>

contracts are currently unlawful, but mutuality of obligation is
case-law terminology and is therefore not written in statute. That is
how, over many years, the case law has built up about the definition of
employment tribunals, in terms of whether someone is in work or,

there is a definition. My

us consider some of the damaging effects. For staff, zero-hours
contracts have huge drawbacks compared with permanent regular work.
There is no guaranteed level of regular earnings that provides any
certainty with regard to meeting bills, meeting rent or planning for
the future. The need to respond to calls to attend work, frequently at
short notice, disrupts life outside work and places a particular strain
on families in terms of arranging care for dependants. The Government
have put a heavy emphasis on being family-friendly, but we have yet to
see any evidence of that. Zero-hours contracts fly in the face of the
flexible working legislation that the Minister, to be fair to her, has
pushed through and championed in government. They slightly contradict
that aspect of
employment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T15:40:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

detriment to business as well. That is why I cannot see why business
wants to use zero-hours contracts, particularly in some
of the areas that have been spoken about. There
must be reputational damage to employers who use these contracts. There
must be an inability to attract and to retain high-quality staff. There
is undoubtedly a direct correlation between continuity and the quality
of the services involved. Some hon. Members have spoken clearly about
health and social care and how continuity and quality of services are
significantly
affected<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T15:41:19"></hs_TimeCode>. A loss
of training and skills development tends to accompany zero-hours

have heard from Labour Members, Ms Dorries, the real concerns about
zero-hours contracts and the impacts that they have on family life, on
income and on people’s ability to plan their daily lives. This
is simply an issue of fairness. It cannot be right to demand that
someone travels to their place of work and then tell them that they do
not have any work. I will be very interested to see whether the
Minister will put together a body of work that looks at the mutuality
of obligation and whether this is a case in which someone is not an

unemployed.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-09?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_09_PT_1/E4A561BED3B869C143E06BDA61EB773248A4C366" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="9 July 2013">Tuesday

Over a period certainly of months and quite possibly longer, she has
been a real campaigner for and champion of these issues. It is a credit
to her that she has persevered in raising them. I very much welcome the
time and effort that she has already put into this issue and her
bringing it to the House today to give us all the opportunity to
discuss it and highlight some of the

basic terms, of course we understand that zero-hours contracts can work
well for some people, giving them flexibility in the hours that they
work. Equally, we are well aware that they do not provide the certainty
that many people feel that they need. Those people need to know what
they are going to earn, so that they can manage their finances and,
indeed, their lives. Hon. Members have given many examples this
afternoon, and the Department has received a number of letters that

Swinson:</Member></B> I take the hon. Gentleman’s point, but for
some people that flexibility is very much tied to the zero-hours
contract, because they can work a significant number of hours some
weeks and perhaps not at all other weeks. I shall give examples of
people who that arrangement might suit.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T15:59:59"></hs_TimeCode> appreciate
that there are different ways to achieve flexibility, but zero-hours
contracts are one such way, and if used properly, they do not need to
be a problem.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T15:50:42"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Sunderland Central mentioned flexibility being a one-way street,
which is a good way to put it. If there is only a one-way street, that
suggests that the contract is not equal on both sides. Genuine two-way
flexibility can work very well for employees and
employers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T15:50:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13070971000159" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0002.htm#13070971000159"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T15:51:02"></hs_TimeCode>I
was touching on some of the problems and areas where zero-hours
contracts do not work well. Perhaps an individual took on such a
contract but, because they had other work commitments, such as a
part-time job or other responsibilities, had to turn down work fairly
regularly, which leads to them not being offered work because they were
seen as inflexible. That situation is a two-way street not working as a
two-way street, which is not right.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T15:51:30"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Wigan (Lisa Nandy) raised the case of a lady who had been told that
if she did not work a particular set of hours, she would not get work
in future. The hon. Lady mentioned the rather horrendous suggestion
that the lady had to leave her children in a car park, and my heart
goes out to someone in that situation. That scenario—an implied
threat hanging over someone, if they do not take on particular
work—is not right.
On<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T15:51:10"></hs_TimeCode> a zero-hours
contract, the employee should be genuinely free to turn down
work<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T15:52:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070971000160" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0002.htm#13070971000160">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T15:51:10"></hs_TimeCode>
has been mentioned, people rely on income to prove that they can take
out a mortgage, for example, or to prove that they are able to make
regular rental payments to rent a flat, so zero-hours contracts can be
problematic, if people cannot prove that regular income. For those
reasons, officials in the Department for Business, Innovation and
Skills are looking into such contracts, to gather further information
over the summer to better understand how they work and the issues
involved. It is important that we establish what the problems are
before we change
policy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T15:52:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070971000161" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0002.htm#13070971000161">Lots
of figures have been mentioned today, particularly on the recent sharp
increase in zero-hours contracts since 2004. Those figures are
accurate, but it is important for context to point out that zero-hours
contracts are not new. Hon. Members have talked about them today as if
they are an evil invention of the current Government, but they have
been around for many years. According to the graphs from the 2000
labour force survey, the overall number of people and the percentage of
the work force using such contracts was slightly higher in 2000 than
for the same quarter in 2012. I know <I>Hansard</I> does not allow
graphs, but the graph shows that the use of zero-hours contracts was
high in 2000, gradually reduced towards 2004 and has risen since then,
with a couple of blips along the way where the graph is slightly spiky.
That is the pattern, so, although the recent increase has brought some
problems into sharp relief, these contracts are not a recent
issue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070971000162" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0002.htm#13070971000162">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T15:53:50"></hs_TimeCode>

have been outlined today, and I will shortly come to the points raised,
but it is important to challenge the assumption that such contracts are
always a bad thing. They can be helpful if an individual and an
employer genuinely want to come to an agreement about a contract. For
students, who might not be able to commit to a fixed work pattern due
to their timetables, zero-hours contracts may be helpful in giving them
good work experience. They can also be useful for semi-retired people
who want to work occasionally, but not on a fixed weekly basis.

shall turn to some specific points that Members raised. We will
obviously work alongside the DWP in the Government review, to address
the eligibility for support issues. Universal credit should make it
easier for people to get Government support based on the number of
hours they work, without, for example, the cliff edge of 16 hours, but
we need to work closely with other Departments on that.

zero-hours contracts on women. Resolution Foundation research shows

If an employee is on call at their place of work, they should be paid;
the legislation is clear. Some of the cases raised today are breaches
of legislation. I will come on to the pay and work rights helpline. The
provisions in the working time regulations on breaks proportionate to
the time spent working give some 
<?notus-xml column=56?>protection to workers. Although lunch breaks are not paid in zero-hours
contracts, that does not mean that people should not get time to take a
break at work, and the working time regulations set that out
clearly.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070971000170" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0002.htm#13070971000170">Care<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T15:58:32"></hs_TimeCode>
workers not being paid for the time spent travelling between houses was
raised. If care workers have wages deducted for that time or have to
pay for photographs, uniforms and so on, they might be working for less
than the minimum wage, particularly if they are not on a high wage. It
obviously depends on the case. Employers of people who are very well
paid may not be in breach of national minimum wage guidance and
legislation, but where employers are in breach, I urge people to
contact the pay and work rights helpline on 0800 917 2368 or search for
“pay and work rights helpline” online. HMRC can enforce
the legislation, and it takes breaches of national minimum wage
guidance and legislation seriously. It is important that such cases are
reported, because employers need to be taken to task if they are
exploiting workers.</hs_Para>

out of five people on zero-hours contracts are not looking for another

There are clearly cases where that is the case, but the figures suggest

terminate the contract in the usual way. I agree with
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T15:58:21"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

would like to take right hon. and hon. Members back in time to 1949, to
the Yangtze river of China during the Chinese civil war, and an
historic event that has taken on the name “the Yangtze
incident.” The event happened at a time when Great Britain was
at peace, but it took us to the brink of a third world war. Much has
been written about the incident, including a book that was made into a
film, with Richard Todd in the starring role. Neither the book nor the
film, however, comes anywhere near the truth of the story that is yet
to be
told<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T16:01:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070971000176" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0002.htm#13070971000176">This
is not a story about one ship, the Royal Navy frigate HMS Amethyst, and
her daring escape after three months’ incarceration by communist
forces on the Yangtze river. It is the untold story of HMS Concord, a
C-class destroyer that Commander-in-Chief, Far East Station, Admiral
Sir E. J. Patrick Brind deployed into China’s Yangtze river as
part of his endeavour to bring about the escape of HMS
Amethyst<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T16:02:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070971000177" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0002.htm#13070971000177">I
will first explain the position with regard to the civil war in China.
Government policy at the time was governed by the Moscow declaration of
December 1945, in which the United Kingdom, the United States and the
Soviet Union declared a policy of non-intervention in China’s
internal affairs. The known facts are that China was split into two
warring parties, the Communist People’s Liberation Army, led by
Mao Tse-tung, and the nationalist army, under the Kuomintang. As the
Chinese civil war raged on, the communists began to make headway on the
shores of the Yangtze river near the city of Nanking, and warned that
any foreign ships in the river would be attacked. Right hon. and hon.
Members might wonder what the importance of that is, and the answer is
simple: it endorses the fact that the Yangtze river was a known war
zone<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T16:03:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070971000178" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0002.htm#13070971000178">I
said at the outset that I would like to take us back in time. The date
was 20 April 1949. A British warship, HMS Concord, was stationed at
Nanking, to act as guard ship to the British embassy and to evacuate
staff and other British nationals if necessary. She had been there for
some time, and her relief was long overdue and her stores depleted. The
relief ship was His Majesty’s Australian Ship, Shoalhaven, which
was at Shanghai and should have relieved HMS Concord on 16 April. The
relief did not take place; the Shoalhaven was stood
down<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T16:03:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070971000179" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0002.htm#13070971000179">HMS
Amethyst, en route to Nanking up the river Yangtze to relieve the guard
ship HMS Concord, came under heavy fire from the north bank. At nearby
Rose island she ran aground, was severely damaged and suffered heavy
casualties, with more than 50 members of the crew killed, dying or
seriously injured. The captain was mortally wounded and the first
lieutenant, though wounded, took command. The communists continued to
fire at Amethyst and, to save further loss of life, about 60 lightly
wounded and uninjured crew 
<?notus-xml column=58?>members were evacuated ashore, but further evacuation stopped when those
in the water came under fire. Those put ashore eventually arrived in
Shanghai and were treated in
hospital<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T16:04:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070971000180" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0002.htm#13070971000180">At
this juncture, it should also be remembered that before all of that two
other ships, the frigate HMS Black Swan and the cruiser HMS London,
were involved, along with HMS Concord, in an attempt to assist
Amethyst’s escape. Due to the narrowness of the Yangtze river,
none of the ships was able to manoeuvre and they were, in effect,
sitting ducks for the communist field guns. All three ships suffered
heavy damage and causalities in the attempts, and it was decided that
to proceed further would be disastrous for them and their crews. The
order was given to return to
Shanghai<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T16:05:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070971000181" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0002.htm#13070971000181">On
21 April, HMS Amethyst was refloated, and on 22 April Lieutenant
Commander Kerans arrived on board from Nanking, where he was assistant
naval attaché, and took command. Amethyst remained incarcerated
for 100 days, and the fact that HMS Concord entered the Yangtze to aid
Amethyst in the aftermath of her escape has been denied. The
involvement of HMS Concord was hidden or deleted from any public or
official

Ministry of Defence denied that the ship was ever in the Yangtze. Does
the hon. Gentleman agree that Sir John Holmes’s medal review,
which acknowledges that the presence of HMS Concord is now no longer in

logbook was removed, and without evidence to the contrary nothing could
be proven, until now. Despite efforts to prevent the truth from
emerging, personal accounts of HMS Concord’s part in the events,
given by my constituent Mr William Leitch of Livingston and members of
the HMS Concord Association, provide an overwhelming insight into the
risks that Concord was subjected to when ordered into the Yangtze
river. Mr Leitch has been in touch with me on the issue over the three
years since I was elected to Parliament, and he is delighted that I am
able to have this Adjournment debate. He will no doubt be watching live

follows has always been denied by the Government, the Foreign Office
and the Admiralty. When it was obvious that negotiations for a safe
passage downriver were leading nowhere, Lieutenant Commander Kerans
informed Admiral Brind in a coded signal that he planned to break out
that evening. Admiral Brind, without reference to the Admiralty or the
Foreign Office, signalled to HMS Concord, which was patrolling in the
South China sea, to proceed upriver to meet Amethyst and, should the
Woosung forts open fire, Concord was to return fire in support of
Amethyst. When Amethyst made her escape on the night of 30 July 1949,
one other ship, the destroyer HMS Concord, entered the Chinese 
<?notus-xml column=59?>territorial waters of the Yangtze to escort and cover the ship past the
massive guns of the Woosung forts, which were the last obstacle before
reaching the open South China

duty quartermaster was ordered to go around the ship and tell everyone,
by word of mouth—not piping it over the tannoy as the sound
would carry over the water and could alert the enemy—that the
ship would up anchor and proceed upriver. The Concord was challenged by
a nationalist gunboat and ordered not to travel any further. Stopping
until the nationalist ship had left the vicinity, the Concord then
sailed past the heavily armed Woosung forts to meet Amethyst. At the
forts, Concord, on sighting Amethyst, sent the signal, “Fancy
meeting you here”, to which Amethyst
replied,</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13070971000274" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0002.htm#13070971000274">“Never,

passed the Woosung forts without their opening fire, the Concord, still
in the Yangtze river, transferred supplies and 147 tons of fuel to the
Amethyst, which had only 7 tons left. Both ships made it into the

Concord was soon met by HMS Cossack, whose captain boarded the ship,
removed its log book and took with him any evidence of the

Members may wonder why there was so much concern to hide the fact that
Concord had dashed up the Yangtze to assist Amethyst. The answer is
simple: to prevent an international incident when cold war tensions
were high. Had the Communists been aware that Concord had gone to the
aid of Amethyst and entered Chinese territorial waters, the political
consequences might have been catastrophic. Admiral Brind going public
on what amounted to a covert mission that he had authorised would
obviously upset the diplomatic apple
cart.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070971000191" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0002.htm#13070971000191">After<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T16:11:19"></hs_TimeCode>

Yangtze incident. The move to expunge any mention of Concord’s
involvement with Amethyst was going full speed ahead. Although Admiral
Brind had ordered Concord to enter the Yangtze and escort Amethyst past
the Woosung forts, he had no alternative but to comply with Ambassador
Stevenson’s instructions. Consequently, a press release was
issued and this report appeared in the <I>Evening News</I> on Saturday

is clear from the evidence that on the date and at the time that
Admiral Brind gave the order, he committed HMS Concord and the
ship’s company to a situation in which the risk to life and limb
exerted by enemy forces was significantly above what UK armed services
personnel might routinely be expected to tolerate. In recognition of
the action, the officers and ship’s company of HMS Amethyst,
together with those who served on three other Royal Navy ships that
took part in the early stages of the incident, were awarded the Yangtze

committee responsible for compiling the 1949 Yangtze campaign awards
scheme—the Sir John Holmes review—was not invited to look
into HMS Concord’s role in the incident covering the dates from
28 to 31 July 1949. In other words, officially Concord was not there. I
hope that hon. Members will appreciate how frustrating that is. The

will begin by speaking briefly about the Yangtze incident, drawing on
the official accounts from the time. On 20 April 1949, HMS Amethyst was
sailing up the river Yangtze to relieve HMS Consort, which was
stationed at Nanking as the guard ship for the British embassy during
the Chinese civil war. While en route, HMS Amethyst came under fire
from a communist gun battery. Amethyst returned fire, but shells hit
the wheelhouse and the bridge, killing or injuring everyone except the
Yeoman of Signals. The commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander
Skinner, was mortally wounded and later died
ashore<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T16:39:12"></hs_TimeCode>. The
damage to the wheelhouse had jammed the steering gear and the ship ran
aground. Unfortunately, the doctor and a sick berth attendant were also
killed when the quarterdeck was hit. HMS Amethyst continued to return
fire with the only one of her three twin-mounted guns that could be
brought to bear on the battery.</hs_Para>

receipt of Amethyst’s signal that she was aground and under
fire, HMS Consort sailed from Nanking and reached the Amethyst at 1500
hours. Consort also came under fire and sustained casualties.
Consort’s captain decided that it would be impossible to take
Amethyst in tow, and Consort continued down the Yangtze.</hs_Para>

21 April, HMS London and HMS Black Swan were ordered up the Yangtze to
aid Amethyst. Both ships came under fire at point blank range: London
was repeatedly hit and holed in her superstructure and bridge. The
Chinese pilot was killed, the navigating officer mortally wounded,
bridge communications were cut, five fires were started and numerous
casualties were sustained. The ships were ordered back down the river.
On her way down, London’s fire on the Communists was effective
but she was fired at again and suffered more
casualties.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070971000207" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0002.htm#13070971000207">On<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T16:40:28"></hs_TimeCode>

late July, Lieutenant Commander Kerans decided to break Amethyst out of
the location where she had been since 20 April and to regain the open
sea. On the evening of 30/31 July, taking the opportunity of a dark
night and a favourable tide, the ship slipped anchor

to a position ready to proceed up the river and at 0345 hours she
weighed anchor and proceeded into the river. After sailing 57 nautical

provided escort as the two ships passed down river. This manoeuvre was
successful and from the time Concord sighted Amethyst there was no

regarding several medallic issues, the Prime Minister asked Sir John

independent, comprehensive military medals review. He was supported in

raising the issue. Although I take an interest in health issues, CRPS
is new to my attention. Only today, I was contacted by a lady from
Leeds who is a sufferer, and listening to her story was very harrowing.
Is my hon. Friend surprised, as I am, that there is only one specialist
centre in the UK? That centre is in Bath, which is a long way from many
places. If CRPS is diagnosed early, there is a high chance of it going
into remission, which would be great for the NHS and, more importantly,
for the patients

Stewart:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes an important point, and I
suspect that if we spoke to all our colleagues we would find that they,
too, have been contacted by constituents with this condition. One of
the points that I will make in a few moments is on the need for greater
research and specialist services, so that the types of benefit that he

delivered.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070971000240" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0002.htm#13070971000240">Secondly,
the number of people diagnosed with the condition is unknown. Indeed,
the Department of Health has informed me that it does not hold such
records. My constituent informs me that, in 2010, he was told by NHS
Direct that just over 11,000 people had been diagnosed in the United
Kingdom. In 2012, he came across some information in the CRPS
guidelines prepared by the Royal College of Physicians that quoted
research suggesting a higher incidence of CRPS in Europe. On the back
of that, he again contacted NHS Direct, and this time he was informed
that it had been ordered to stop keeping records and to delete existing
ones, as that responsibility would be undertaken by the Office for
National Statistics. The ONS, however, replied that no such
responsibility had been passed to it. Will the Minister clarify that
issue and assure me that there is a strategy in place adequately to
capture the number of people being diagnosed with CRPS? Will he also
look into claims that specialists are failing to highlight the
seriousness of the condition, particularly its potentially degenerative
nature?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070971000241" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0002.htm#13070971000241">Thirdly,
there does not seem to be an agreed pathway within the NHS for the
treatment and care of those diagnosed with the condition. If there is,
it was not reflected in the care that my constituent received. Will the
Minister ensure that all NHS trusts and clinical commissioning groups
follow the guidelines?</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13070971000242" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0002.htm#13070971000242">Fourthly,
compared with the United States and other European countries, we are
not doing enough to research the condition with a view to finding a
cure and ensuring an improved quality of life for CRPS sufferers. While
preparing for this debate, I observed that there was more information
on the condition on US-based websites than on UK-based ones. I have
also been unable to find UK charities or support groups for CRPS.
Everyone can be proud of the fact that since the start of modem
clinical trials, 39,179 trials have been made or are in progress to
find a cure for cancer. The UK has carried out about 2,299 of them. The
UK Charity Commission 
<?notus-xml column=67?>has 976 cancer charities on record, and the NHS spent more than
£375 million between 2008 and 2012 on researching a cure for
cancer. Clearly, that is a wonderful amount of research, but during the
same period, only 76 trials on CRPS have been conducted worldwide.
Holland, with a population of just over 16.5 million, has carried out
three trials, and Switzerland, with a population of 8 million, has
carried out two. The UK has a population of more than 60 million, yet I
have been unable to locate a record of our carrying out any
trials.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070971000243" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0002.htm#13070971000243">In
addition, the NHS does not appear to have invested much in researching
CRPS. I understand that one project was carried out last year in Bath,
to which my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T17:01:47"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Friend the Member for Pudsey (Stuart Andrew) referred, but it was not
aimed specifically at finding a cure, and it was funded by an American
charity. Will the Minister look into funding for more UK research into
the condition? Specifically, will he consider my constituent’s
suggestion that a post be created within the Department of Health for a
CRPS officer to liaise with specialist clinics around the world to
collect, collate and disseminate papers and studies on the condition?
My constituent explains that it would prove useful, as it was not until
19 years after the US first stated that guanethidine blocks were
ineffective on RSD sufferers that our own specialists came to the same
conclusion.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070971000244" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0002.htm#13070971000244">I

I hope that this debate will help draw attention to this important
issue, so that more people are properly diagnosed and adequately
treated. I also hope that I have been able to do justice to the needs

hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes South (Iain Stewart) on
securing this debate on an issue of intense importance to people who
suffer from complex regional pain syndrome. The condition can be
debilitating, with a devastating effect on sufferers and their
families. I know that there are those, including my hon.
Friend’s constituent, who campaign tirelessly to raise awareness
of the condition. The description that he gave of what people go

unimaginable.</hs_Para>

to Mr Scardifield for his persistent campaigning to raise awareness. It
is highly laudable that he has chosen to campaign and maintain the
pressure for increased understanding. The experience that my hon.
Friend described—the diagnosis was missed by several clinicians,
and there was no proper care team or personal care plan—is of
concern. I am grateful to him for alerting me to the extent of the
challenge faced by his constituent. One great benefit of Adjournment
debates such as this is that they ensure that Ministers and officials
focus on a particular condition that might not otherwise get the
attention it needs. I am grateful for this opportunity. I hope that
this debate will prove informative for those here who wish to learn
more about the condition and be helpful to those affected, as 
<?notus-xml column=68?>I say more about the help and support that ought to be available for
CRPS sufferers and the research into the condition
that is currently under
way.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070971000247" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/halltext/130709h0002.htm#13070971000247">Although
it has been recognised as a medical condition for more than 100 years,
diagnosing CRPS at its earliest stages remains a problem, as my hon.
Friend rightly said, because it is often misdiagnosed or completely
undiagnosed. The explanation is threefold. First, CRPS is relatively
uncommon and patients do not routinely present to GPs with it. When the
Department looked at the representations that we have received on the
subject over the last few years, the number of individuals who have
approached us is small. The fact that the condition is relatively
uncommon and that GPs do not come across it that often creates a
problem in terms of their capacity to diagnose it accurately.</hs_Para>

range of symptoms associated with CRPS are shared with a number of
other, more common conditions, so that when patients do present, they
may not be correctly diagnosed in the first instance. Thirdly, there is
no single diagnostic test that accurately identifies the condition; a
diagnosis is made primarily by excluding other conditions with shared
symptoms that can be accurately diagnosed. Those difficulties also mean
that there are no reliable figures for the number of people living with
the condition, and estimates produced by researchers and clinicians
vary considerably, as my hon. Friend said in his speech.</hs_Para>

his concerns about having a clear picture of the number of people
affected by CRPS. I will approach NHS England to ask whether there is
any scope to improve our understanding of how many people are diagnosed
with the condition. Ultimately, I think that we can all agree that a
better understanding of the extent of the condition and the numbers
affected would be a considerable advantage. Let us explore whether it
is possible to achieve greater accuracy.</hs_Para>

the NHS outcomes framework, we will monitor the performance of the NHS
in supporting people with long-term conditions, such as CRPS, to live
as normal a life as possible and to improve their quality of life.
Improvements will be measured in three main areas: how well the NHS is
performing in supporting people to look after themselves; how well a
person is able to live as normal a life as possible; and how
successfully the NHS manages long-term conditions by looking at
unnecessary hospital admissions and excessive lengths of stay in
hospital<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-09T17:16:54"></hs_TimeCode>. The
improvement areas are mirrored in the clinical commissioning group

Government’s intention to adopt a new, more accurate definition

final report of the independent Hills review. We have also tabled
amendments to the Energy Bill to put action to address fuel poverty on

review, conducted by Professor Sir John Hills, provided us with a new
understanding of the problem of fuel poverty. Professor Hills’s
work demonstrates that fuel poverty is a long-term and structural
problem requiring an ongoing effort to mitigate it. We believe it is
right to reflect this by adopting the new measurement approach proposed
by Professor Hills, which will support a renewed focus on those with
the lowest incomes living in the worst homes. This new approach aligns
fully with the Government’s wider objectives of saving energy,
promoting growth and decarbonising the housing
sector.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13070947000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/wmstext/130709m0001.htm#13070947000052">At
the same time, we are proposing amending the statutory framework
underpinning fuel poverty. The existing fuel poverty target, contained
in the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act 2000, has the eradication
of fuel poverty as its end goal. This is  the wrong type of
target to focus on given the nature  of the problem. Nor is
such an approach compatible with the definition we are adopting. We are
therefore proposing a new target that focuses on improving the energy
efficiency of the homes of the fuel
poor.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13070947000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/wmstext/130709m0001.htm#13070947000053">I

backing to a fuel poverty target and our proposals reflect this. On
balance we believe the best way to do this is through secondary

conscious of the burdens on legitimate business, so we are also

not unduly penalise drivers who have taken properly prescribed

I can announce to the House today my decisions regarding safeguarding
phase one of HS2—the route between London and Birmingham.
Safeguarding directions protect the route of HS2 from conflicting
development, and also give many of those who own property in the
safeguarded area the right to serve a blight notice and request that
the Government purchase their property under the terms of the
compensation
code.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13070947000098" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/wmstext/130709m0001.htm#13070947000098">Between
October 2012 and January 2013 my Department consulted on issuing
safeguarding directions for phase one of HS2. In total,
3,761 responses were submitted during 
<?notus-xml column=13?>the consultation period. Following careful consideration of those
responses, I have today issued, under the Town and Country Planning
(Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2010, safeguarding
directions to local planning authorities (LPAs) along most of the route
of phase one of
HS2.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13070947000099" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/wmstext/130709m0001.htm#13070947000099">LPAs
to whom safeguarding directions apply are required to consult the named
authority—in this case High Speed Two (HS2) Limited—on
undetermined planning applications in respect of land that is within
the safeguarded area. If a LPA is minded to grant planning permission
otherwise than to give effect to HS2 Ltd’s comments then the
planning application is referred to the Secretary of State for
Transport who is able to direct a final decision on the planning
application. The purpose of safeguarding is not to prevent development
along the route of HS2, but to ensure that any development that does
take place is consistent with our plans for  the
railway.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13070947000100" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/wmstext/130709m0001.htm#13070947000100">Safeguarding
is also a trigger for statutory blight procedures under the Town and
Country Planning Act 1990. Owner-occupiers of properties within the
safeguarded area who want to move may now apply to sell their property
to the Government by serving a blight notice. If they meet the relevant
criteria they can expect to receive the unblighted open market value of
their  home, a home loss payment of 10% of the value of their
home—up to £47,000—and reasonable moving costs. We
do not expect that all properties within the safeguarded area will be
required for the railway. Compulsory purchase powers to acquire
properties needed for the railway will be set out in the hybrid Bill
and can not be exercised until that Bill has Royal
Assent.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13070947000101" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/wmstext/130709m0001.htm#13070947000101">Information

HS2, key rail routes connecting London, the midlands and the north will
soon be overwhelmed. HS2 will link eight of Britain’s 10 largest
cities, serving one in five of the UK population. But the Government
have always recognised the impact of HS2 on those living along the line
of route. Issuing safeguarding directions brings certainty to many
owner-occupiers living in the safeguarded area who can now apply to
have their homes bought. I can assure the House that we will seek to
process blight notices swiftly so that those who qualify can move as
quickly as possible.</hs_Para>

enrolment into workplace pensions represents a step change in the
pensions landscape. A crucial part of the automatic enrolment landscape
is NEST which was set up by Government to ensure all employers have
access to a high-quality, low-cost option for workplace pension

higher earners, NEST was created specifically to ensure that smaller
firms and low to moderate earners also have access to quality pension

ensure that NEST focused on this “target market” the
previous Government legislated to constrain NEST in two particular
ways—an annual contribution limit, currently £4,500 a

scheme
members.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13070947000108" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/wmstext/130709m0001.htm#13070947000108">In
summer 2010 the Department for Work and Pensions commissioned an
independent review—“Making automatic enrolment
work”—to consider whether the framework for automatic
enrolment was fit for purpose. The review concluded that the basic
architecture, including NEST, was appropriate, but that the constraints
on NEST should be lifted in
2017.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13070947000109" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/wmstext/130709m0001.htm#13070947000109">More
recently the Work and Pensions Select Committee recommended in 2012
that the constraints should be lifted at once, expressing concern that
some firms might not be able to use NEST, resulting in consumer
detriment. Government responded in late 2012 with their call for
evidence to seek views on the future of the NEST
constraints.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13070947000110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/wmstext/130709m0001.htm#13070947000110">Requiring
NEST to focus on this target market has been very successful. As a
large number of medium and smaller firms will start enrolling their
workers in the next few years, now is the time to focus on helping
these firms get ready. With its special focus on those workers with
lower earnings, NEST will be a key part of the solution as it has
thought hard about its design; it has aimed its research,
communications, use of language, investment and decumulation strategies
at its target market. It is working, and we need this to continue.
Therefore, to make sure we achieve our aim of getting people saving, we
have decided that NEST must continue to focus on its target group
without any
distractions.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13070947000111" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/wmstext/130709m0001.htm#13070947000111">The
responses to the call for evidence revealed a perception that the
restrictions placed on NEST prevent it from serving the low to moderate
earners and smaller employers it was intended for. The reality is quite
the opposite. With mandatory contributions of just 2% on a band of
earnings, with at least 1% from firms, no employer contributing at this
level or the full 8% will exceed the annual contribution
limit.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13070947000112" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/wmstext/130709m0001.htm#13070947000112">However,
we need to look to the future and ensure NEST remains influential in
the marketplace, by continuing to help drive up standards and best
practice. The minimum 
<?notus-xml column=15?>contribution will rise to a combined contribution of 5% from October
2017 and 8% from October 2018. Therefore, in line with the
recommendations of the independent “Making automatic enrolment
work” review, I intend to legislate as soon as parliamentary
time allows to lift the contribution limit from 2017. This will give
employers the certainty they need that NEST will continue to be an
appropriate scheme for them and their workers when minimum
contributions rise, or should they choose to contribute
more.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13070947000113" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/wmstext/130709m0001.htm#13070947000113">With
regard to individual transfers, we agree that NEST should be part of
the automatic transfer solution for which we are currently legislating.
Therefore we intend to lift the restrictions on individual transfers in
and out of NEST to coincide with the start of the
“pot-follows-member” regime. The ban on bulk transfers 
<?notus-xml column=16?>will remain in place until the end of the main roll out period for
automatic enrolment in April 2017, when it will then be
lifted.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13070947000114" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/wmstext/130709m0001.htm#13070947000114">We
believe that the creation of NEST has played a crucial role in the
early success of automatic enrolment. NEST has focused on its target
market and has innovated to serve the needs of those in that market. As
automatic enrolment moves on to cover medium and smaller firms we want
NEST to continue its excellent work, while signalling now that beyond
2017 NEST will be put on a similar footing to other providers in the
wider pensions

Heath:</Member></B> We are unaware of any incidents being reported of
milk being infected by TB. The TB status of herds is assessed by live
animal testing and I am advised by the Food Standards Agency (FSA),
which has responsibility for food safety and hygiene matters, that the
EU Food Hygiene Regulations state that milk from individual animals
showing positive reaction to the TB test must not be used for human
consumption. This restriction contributes to a series of controls which
aim to minimise the food safety risk. In rare undetected TB cases,
organisms of the bacterium that causes TB can be excreted in milk but
are killed by
pasteurisation.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13070993000029" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/text/130709w0001.htm#13070993000029">Common

Benyon</Member></B> <I>[holding answer 1 July 2013]:</I> The outcome of
the European Parliament's ENVI Committee vote on the F-Gas regulation
will be considered in the context of ongoing discussions in European
Environment  
<?notus-xml column=120?>Council Working Party meetings on the European Commission's proposal for
the further regulation of fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-gases). There
is some way to go in these discussions to determine the final shape of
a possible new regulation and we are yet to determine the detail of how
a number of key elements of the proposal are intended to operate
together. Therefore it is not possible at this stage to be precise
about the potential merit of each of the ENVI Committee proposals for
amendment of the Commission's
proposal.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070993000301" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/text/130709w0001.htm#13070993000301">In
broad terms, the Government supports further action on F-gases, in
particular hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), to combat rising global
emissions. In principle, we support a phase down in availability of
HFCs as one potential measure. However, many aspects of how such a
phase down could operate are still under debate and the rate at which
such a phase down could be achieved depends on a number of other
complementary measures in the Commission's
proposal.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070993000302" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/text/130709w0001.htm#13070993000302">In
particular there are a range of proposals for restricting the use of
F-gases in specified circumstances which are still under discussion. We
believe that such restrictions must be considered carefully on a
case-by-case basis. This must take into account the availability and
technical feasibility of alternatives to F-gases or the equipment in
which they are used, as well as the financial and environmental costs
and benefits of replacing them across the range of applications
concerned.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070993000303" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/text/130709w0001.htm#13070993000303">Any
new regulation should not create unnecessary administrative burdens or
place unnecessary burdens on UK business, but should facilitate the
move from the use of high global warming potential F-gases to more
environmentally friendly alternatives.</hs_Para>

Benyon:</Member></B> New drinking water regulations were introduced in
the UK in 2004 which set the standard for lead at 10 micrograms per
litre (the World Health Organisation's guide value) with effect from 25
December 2013. In advance of this date, water companies have been
required by the Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) to introduce water
treatment wherever there is a likelihood of failure of the lead
standard. Reports published by the DWI show that this action has
substantially reduced consumer exposure to lead in drinking water.
Water companies will continue to monitor for lead at consumers' taps
and when levels above the standard are found, they will give written
advice to the premises owner about the need to replace old lead
pipes.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-09?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_09_PT_1/909B06043E1D56F910AB6B47E135C04DADD9B10C" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>1</System><Sitting short-date="9 July 2013">Tuesday

Barker:</Member></B> The Government is committed to tackling fuel
poverty and ensuring that so far as reasonably practicable no household
in England lives in fuel poverty by 2016. The Department recently
published its Annual Fuel Poverty Statistics report, which showed that
in 2011 the number of households found to be living in fuel poverty in
England was 3.2 million, compared to 3.5 million in 2010. This is still
an unacceptably high number of people living in cold, damp unhealthy
conditions. Nevertheless, after a sustained period of year-on-year
growth in the number of fuel poor households, the Government is making
progress. It is clear that our determined focus on improving home
energy efficiency is proving effective in tackling fuel
poverty.</hs_Para>

consider whether the case against them should be discontinued. In

on the basis of training commitment years, which run from October to

which have elected to the tonnage tax are required to provide End of
Period Adjustment returns in respect of three four-month periods during
each year: October to January; February to May; and June to September.
The returns are due within 30 days of the end of each Period, so the

Gauke:</Member></B> Air passenger duty (APD) is paid by airlines rather
than passengers, although airlines usually pass the cost of the tax on
in ticket prices. For the purposes of administering the tax, HM Revenue
and Customs (HMRC) does not require and does not collect information on
the final purchasers of tickets, and so it is not possible to identify
the amount of APD paid by companies resident in different countries.
While HMRC does hold data on the amount of APD paid by airlines, it is
not possible to provide breakdowns of this information by country due
to taxpayer
confidentiality.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070993001547" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/text/130709w0002.htm#13070993001547">The

are paid up front to students based upon the latest information
provided to SLC about individual students' circumstances. Overpayment
generally occurs when the SLC receives information from a student or
their higher education institution that the student's financial
circumstances have changed, or that they are no longer attending their
course of study, which leads to the grant amount being re-assessed.
Figures on overpayment are reported by academic year, and the most
recently completed academic year for which figures are available is
2011/12. They show that 49,300 customers were overpaid grants amounting
to £69.1 million. These figures are subject to change as SLC
receives new information and re-assesses overpayment amounts in the
light of
this.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070993001618" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/text/130709w0002.htm#13070993001618">It
is not possible to provide a complete assessment of loan overpayments.
This is because overpayments of loan are only recorded as such until
such time as the person becomes liable to begin making repayments.
After that point, the overpaid amount is recorded as part of the loan
balance, which is generally recovered via the tax system. Figures for
borrowers who have received an overpayment of loan and who are not yet
in repayment were published in the answer I gave to the hon. Member for

attributable to alcohol. Further information on these proportions can

changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity
may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in

headcount methodology for GPs from 2010 onwards means these data are
not fully comparable with previous years, due to improvements that make
it a more stringent count of absolute staff numbers. Further

practice staff information was collected at practice level with

Information Centre seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of
missing and invalid data but responsibility for data accuracy lies with
the organisations providing the data. Methods are continually being
updated to improve data quality where changes impact on figures already

Soubry:</Member></B> The 2014 deadline for reaching foundation trust
status has done much to galvanise the national health service trust
sector and drive improvement. However, in light of the Mid
Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust Public Inquiry report, we have
allowed the NHS Trust Development Authority to agree trajectories for
NHS trusts to reach foundation trust status that go beyond 2014 on a
case by case basis. In so doing, we will ensure that the primary focus
of the NHS Trust Development Authority and of NHS trusts themselves is
on improving the quality and sustainability of services for

publishing their strategy “Taking Organ Transplantation to
2020”. The strategy builds on the Organ Donation Taskforce
recommendations and identifies new ways to make sure that as many
people as possible in the United Kingdom receive the transplant they
need. Within this strategy, actions are identified for NHSBT, the
national health service and commissioners to ensure that better support
systems and processes are in place to optimise organ donations and
transplantation. This includes ensuring that transplant centres have
capacity and surgical expertise and other clinical skills to meet the
demands for transplantation as donor numbers

the national health service to increase the number of organs available
for patients. A number of recommendations which have been implemented
are specifically aimed at ensuring hospitals have the appropriate
infrastructure in place to maximise the number of potential donors.
These include an increase in the number of highly trained specialist

donation; and the establishment of organ donation

Lewis:</Member></B> Business rates reliefs are either
mandatory—and therefore must be granted if the eligibility
criteria are met—or at the discretion of the relevant local
authority. Charitable child care providers may benefit from 80% charity
relief. Any child care provider that meets the eligibility criteria may
benefit from Small Business Rate Relief, which the Government has
doubled until April 2014. We estimate that half a million businesses
are benefiting from that doubling, with a third of a million paying no
rates at all. In addition, we have given authorities the powers to
provide local discounts which can be used to provide relief as councils
see fit. Where they do so, central Government meets 50% of the
costs.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13070993000164" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/text/130709w0003.htm#13070993000164">Disabled

with supporting Technical Guidance on flood risk, was issued on 27
March 2012. The Framework is clear that inappropriate development in
areas at risk of flooding should be avoided. Local planning authorities
should direct development away from areas at highest risk, including
floodplains, but where development is necessary, it must be
demonstrated that it is safe and will not increase flood risk
elsewhere. The supporting guidance explains how key aspects of the
policy should be

The Pensioners' Incomes Series analysis is for pensioner units, which
are defined as either single pensioners (people over state pension age)
or pensioner couples (married or cohabiting pensioners where one or
more are over state pension
age).</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">3.
The SPa is 65 for men born before 6 April 1959. For women born on or
before 5 April 1950, SPa is 60. From 6 April 2010, the SPa for women
born on or after 6 April 1950 will increase gradually between April
2010 and November 2018. Other changes are planned or have been
announced from December 2018 when the state pension age for both men
and women will start to increase to reach 66 in October 2020. Further
increases to bring the SPa to 67 are proposed to be phased in between
2026 and
2028.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">4.

additional hearing venues across HMCTS estate, and increasing the use
of Saturday sessions, HMCTS continues to respond strongly at a national
level to continue to increase the capacity of the SSCS tribunal and
reduce waiting times. Measures in place include ongoing recruitment of
additional judges and medically qualified members and the review and
continuous improvement of administrative processes both internally and
between HMCTS and DWP. All of this is having a positive effect. The

2013 civil legal aid tender was heavily oversubscribed suggesting there
remains a strong appetite to undertake legal aid work. The impact of
the proposed reduction in the fixed representation fee paid to
solicitors in public law family cases will depend on the individual
reaction of individual solicitor firms. However, the current
significant reduction in the average duration of care cases combined
with the expected further reduction in the amount of work needed on
each case as a result of reforms stemming from the Family Justice
Review suggests that the fixed representation fee no longer represents
value for money for the
taxpayer.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130709111001424" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130709/text/130709w0005.htm#130709111001424">In
addition, family public law proceedings currently represent the largest
area of expert fee spend. It is anticipated that there will be a
reduction in the need for experts resulting from reforms stemming from
the Family Justice Review. It is possible, therefore, that fewer
experts will be needed. The reaction of the market to this expected
reduction is unclear but it is also possible that there will be more
competition between experts for the reduced work that will remain
available. Overall we are currently satisfied that sufficient experts
are likely to remain in the market to satisfy expected future demand.
However, we are in the process of analysing the responses to the

victims with a valuable opportunity to tell the Parole Board how the
offence has affected them or their family, both at the time it was
committed and since, and how they think the offender's release would
affect them. The VPS can contribute to a better and more informed

from individual prison establishments in each month during the period 1
November 2012 to 30 April 2013 is set out in the following table.
Figures are not collected centrally on a weekly basis and obtaining
them would incur disproportionate cost. The table also includes total
monthly figures for the number of transfers from one prison
establishment to another during the period; however, figures
disaggregated to establishment level are not readily available and
could not be obtained without incurring disproportionate cost. Figures
for May 2013 are not yet

Tony Baldry:</Member></B> The Church of England has some 6,400 churches
with bats living in them. While small numbers of bats can easily
co-exist with church congregations, where there are large roosts the

intolerable.</hs_Para>

recognises that for an increasing number of parish churches many bat
roosts have now become so large that they are disruptive to the life of
the parish and the wider community who regularly use the building. In
these situations extensive and regular cleaning is required to allow
the church to continue to be in active public use at great expense to
the parish. Sensitive cleaning and conservation work is also required
to protect nationally important monuments and treasures from becoming
stained or corroded.</hs_Para>

Hilda’s, Ellerburn is one of the worst affected churches in the
country. In 2011 the parish took the unprecedented step of closing the
church and worshipping in a tent in the churchyard, having come to the
view that the church building was no longer a clean and
welcoming environment. This situation is not one the Church of England
would like to see replicated in other churches and it is attempting to
seek resolution through ongoing conversations with the Government and
Natural
England.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-09?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_09_PT_1/AF4979499E8FD95CA6FA38A6ECEE2E56B1E862BF" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>1</System><Sitting short-date="9 July 2013">Tuesday

Discussions about this change have been ongoing for several months and
a number of youth organisations, including the National Scrutiny Group

public letter to the Secretary of State in February 2013. A number of
these bodies, including the National Scrutiny Group, the National

Business Rates Retention Scheme. Local authority funding is not ring
fenced and so local authorities can allocate resources according to the
local context. As our statutory guidance makes clear, local authorities
are best placed to decide what services will meet local needs and
priorities and how to meet these needs within available resources.

where it is segregated from other services, is published on the
