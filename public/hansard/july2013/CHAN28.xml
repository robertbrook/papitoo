always be underground is that it adds huge cost and complexity, making

made a speech about apprenticeships. It is remarkable how many people
have started apprenticeships under this Government. On the transport
issue, we are funding feasibility studies into fixing problems on the
A1 north of Newcastle to Scotland and on the Newcastle and Gateshead A1
western bypass. We are also improving the A19 between Newcastle and
South Shields. That is a much better record than that of the Labour

had for this Parliament and are increasing the amount of capital
spending. The Opposition come to this House and oppose changes to
welfare, oppose cuts to Government programmes and oppose the efficiency
changes that we are making. They have not supported a single cut that
we have made. If they did all the things they say, there would be no
capital spending at all. That is the problem with the weakness of the
Labour Front Benchers: because they have taken no tough decisions, they
cannot support the capital spending that this country

2011, the Future Reserves 2020 Commission reported that our reserves

revitalise our reserve forces as part of Future Force 2020, reversing
the decline of the recent past, growing their trained strength to
35,000 by 2018 and investing an additional £1.8 billion in them

2020 requires substantial change. I am today publishing a White Paper

will make reserve service more attractive. It also confirms our

the Army Reserve and to kick-start that programme, I can announce today
that we will bring forward to this year, £40 million of

integration of regulars and reserves is key to Future Force 2020. That

across the armed forces. We have therefore decided to increase
reservists’ total remuneration in two ways: through the
provision for the first time of a paid annual leave entitlement in
respect of training days, and through the accrual of pension
entitlements under the new future armed forces pension scheme 2015 for
time spent on training as well as when mobilised. These two measures

Additionally, we have already implemented measures to streamline and
incentivise the process by which those leaving the regular forces can

that is already available; increase financial support for small and
medium-sized enterprises by introducing a financial award of
£500 a month per reservist when any of their reservist employees

employers. I urge them to take up this challenge. In turn, by building
on the armed forces covenant with the introduction of the corporate

collaborative relationship with employers, it is essential that the
interests of reservists should be protected. Dismissal of reservists on
the ground of their mobilised reserve service is already illegal. We
will legislate in the forthcoming defence reform Bill to ensure access
to employment tribunals in claims for unfair dismissal on the ground of

job that we are asking our reservists to do is changing, and the way in
which we organise and train them will also have to change. That will
impact on force structure, and on basing laydown. The force structures
and roles of the maritime and air reserves will remain broadly similar
to now, although increased in size and capability. The Army, however,
has had to substantially redesign its reserve component to ensure that
regular and reserve capabilities seamlessly complement each other in an
integrated structure designed for the future role. That redesigned
structure has been driven primarily by the changed function and roles
of the Army Reserve and by the need to reach critical mass for
effective sub-unit

details of the future Army Reserve structure are complex, and beyond
what could coherently be explained in an oral statement. I have

restructuring will require changes to the current basing laydown of the
Army Reserve. The TA currently operates from 334 individual sites
around the United Kingdom, including a number of locations with small
detachments of fewer than 30 personnel. Some of those sites are
seriously under-recruited. To maximise the potential for future
recruitment, the Army has determined that, as it translates its revised
structure into a basing laydown, it should take the opportunity to
rationalise 
<?notus-xml column=925?>its presence by merging small, poorly recruited sub-units into larger
sites in the same conurbation or in neighbouring communities. As part
of that exercise, the Army Reserve will open or reopen nine additional
reserve
sites<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T12:41:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070366000230" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/debtext/130703-0001.htm#13070366000230">However,
the consolidation of all poorly recruited units would have led to a
significant reduction in basing footprint and a significant loss of
presence in some, particularly rural, areas. I have decided that that
would not be appropriate as we embark on a major recruitment campaign.
We will therefore retain a significant number of small and
under-recruited sites that the Army considers could become viable
through effective recruiting. The units on those sites will be
challenged to recruit up to strength in the years
ahead<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T12:42:30"></hs_TimeCode>. Over the

agree that the public sector must lead the way. Central Government have
already set out a very generous offer to reservist employees in excess
of that which is statutorily available. We are challenging the wider
public sector to match that, and the NHS is already a very considerable
provider of reservists, but I should just clarify that public sector
employers are not eligible for the financial inducements we have

announced in the White Paper that we are today establishing a website
at which reservists can report incidences of perceived discrimination,

further action, we will take it, including considering the possibility

and seen evidence for myself—that the oral statement, or copies
thereof, is now being distributed around the Chamber, in what is an
unedifying spectacle. I have, in all sincerity and candour, to say to
the Secretary of State that, as he will know, the content of statements
is not a matter for me and I take no view of them, but the
administration of this matter has been woefully inadequate and,
frankly, utterly incompetent. I have not known a worse example during
my tenure as Speaker. I know that the Secretary of State has expressed
himself in his usual, rather understated, terms, but I hope he
genuinely does feel some sense of embarrassment and contrition at what
has been a total mishandling by his Department, for which he is solely
responsible—it is as simple as

Hammond:</Member></B> The approach to dealing with the estate and the
rationalisation of structure has not been territorial but was based on
the structure of the Army. 
<?notus-xml column=933?>Some new major units are relocating to Scotland. To answer the hon.
Gentleman’s specific questions, there are 52 reserve sites in
Scotland. Seven will be vacated and a new site will reopen, which means
a net loss of six. According to my calculation, that is a 12% reduction
in site footprint. I accept that the hon. Gentleman does not have ready
access to the information, so he cannot know this, but some of the
sites in Scotland are so incredibly poorly recruited that I think that
even he would struggle to argue for their retention. There are sites
with an establishment of 30 or 40 and a recruited strength of six,
seven, eight or 10. We clearly cannot deliver a proper offer to
Scottish reservists unless we consolidate on to sites that will deliver
a critical mass at the sub-unit level for
training.</hs_Para>

In the last statement, we heard that the Government were going to get
back to using formed sub-units, which is what reserve officers want.
This time, we have heard that we have gripped the critical mass issue
at sub-unit level, that we are resourcing equipment properly and that
we will have opportunities for employers at all levels and money for
SMEs. This is a package for the future of the reserves and the future
of our armed forces, of which we should all be

Twigg</B> (Halton) (Lab):</Member> I would be grateful to know why the
Secretary of State proposes to close the Widnes site in my
constituency. Halton has 125,000 people and I would love to know the
logic behind that decision. However, my question is as follows. Is not
the Secretary of State missing the point? He tells us that he wants
massively to increase the recruitment of reservists, but at the same
time he is closing down a number of centres around the country. How is
that logical and how does it make any sense whatsoever? He particularly
makes the point that he wants to recruit ex-members of the armed
forces. Halton is one of the best recruiting areas for the armed forces
in the country, so why would he want to close down the TA
centre?</hs_Para>

Hammond:</Member></B> Even in conurbation areas where there are numbers
of TA bases, in some cases it has been necessary to consolidate them to
reach critical mass and to provide the training offer that we have
committed to deliver to reservists. I should explain to the House that
the TA, as structured by the previous Government’s review in
2007, had an established strength of 36,500. It never resourced that
and never recruited up to that strength. We are doing two things today.
We are setting out a structure and basing lay-down that will work for
Future Force 2020 with a force of 30,000, but we are

Gerald Howarth</B> (Aldershot) (Con):</Member> Although it is
regrettable that the Secretary of State was not furnished with the
correct information to enable the House to judge these matters, is it
not the case that generally speaking with statements the devil is in
the detail? The House will need to examine all the detail set out not
only in the statement but in the White Paper. Although my right hon.
Friend the Member for North East Hampshire (Mr Arbuthnot) is absolutely
right that this is the only show in town, the Secretary of State should
be under no illusions about the fact that this is a substantial
challenge we face in cutting our regular Army to 82,000. Will the
Secretary of State assure me that he will continue to keep the House
regularly informed about the success of the recruitment so that the
conditions that he has just set out, which applied after the last
review conducted by the previous Government, do not apply to this
one?</hs_Para>

Hammond:</Member></B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend and he is
absolutely right. The complexity of such an issue requires a written
statement, which is why I have made one today. The changes to the
structure of the Army run into the hundreds—re-rollings,
relocations and amalgamations—to create an effective force, and
I pay tribute to the Army staff, who have done an enormous amount of
work in producing this structure. I urge right hon. and hon. Members to
look carefully at the detailed documents that have been provided today,
because they explain the detailed position more clearly than an oral
statement ever can. My hon. Friend challenges me to publish regular
updates. I have already said that I have previously committed to

commitment.</hs_Para>

Jeffrey M. Donaldson</B> (Lagan Valley) (DUP):</Member> We welcome the

reserve forces in Northern Ireland are among the best recruited of any
region in the United Kingdom. Indeed, 2nd Battalion the Royal Irish
Regiment is one of the best recruited reserve infantry units in the
British Army. Although we welcome the decision to reopen Kinnegar, will

Hammond:</Member></B> I am afraid I shall be repeating myself. The
right hon. Gentleman is absolutely right that Northern Ireland is one
of the best-recruited areas—in fact, most of the units in
Northern Ireland are over strength and we appreciate the commitment of
the community in Northern Ireland to reserve service. The changes to
Army structure and the delivery of efficient and effective training
require the closure of the TAC at Armagh and the opening of an
additional site. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will accept that
the transfer from Armagh to Portadown is part of the Army’s best
effort to deliver the most effective way of training, recruiting and
managing the reserve Army in Northern Ireland. We are not talking about
something for just the next couple of years but about a structure and
lay-down that we expect to endure for many decades and to form the
basis of the fully integrated Army we all want to

The fact that further cash incentives have been announced today, that
that ex-regular reservists will be on a better scale of pay than
brigadiers and that TA numbers have been falling all point to doubt
being cast on Government plans—and that is before we consider

theme—he has suggested that course of action to me on many
previous occasions. We are restructuring our armed forces to reflect
the threat they will face in the future, as identified in the strategic
defence and security review, and to respond to the fiscal challenges we
must address if we are to have a stable platform for the proper defence
of this country. I am afraid to say to my hon. Friend that although it
might be tempting to wish that we had the resources to retain the
regular Army at its historic strength while we recruit up to 30,000
trained reserves, we do not have that luxury. I think the Opposition
would acknowledge—and have implicitly acknowledged—that
reducing the size of the regular Army while increasing the size of the

change relates to a new focus on reservists’ contributions to
cyber-defence. Alongside the traditional image of the reservist, we are
looking for people who spend their week sitting in front of a screen,
perhaps working for one of the big IT companies, but who relish being
able to deploy their skills in a more operational environment. We will
specifically recruit cyber-reservists, who will not necessarily have to
have the same levels of fitness or deployability as reservists in
general if they are willing to deploy to add to our cyber-defence
capabilities at UK locations on a routine

closing: 154 Transport Regiment is to move to Bruce House Territorial
Army centre, in one of a significant number of consolidations. In most
cases, consolidations do not give rise to site closures because there
is more than one unit on a site, but in some cases, 
<?notus-xml column=937?>where a consolidation removes the last unit or all the units on a site,
logically the site closes. I emphasise again that the driver for these
changes is not to vacate sites; it is to create a structure that will
deliver the military capability we require and allow reservists to
receive the training offer that we have set out to them today. I regret
that, in some cases, that will mean that people have to travel to an
Army Reserve centre in an adjoining community, but I should mention
that reservists receive home-to-duty travel allowance and will

One of the crucial statements we made in the White Paper, and in the

of the Territorial Army. It is well recruited and plays an important
role, having made a large contribution to the campaigns in Iraq and
Afghanistan. The rationalisation of the estate across London to provide
training opportunities and optimum use of the new equipment we will be
delivering has come from the Army itself, from the bottom up, as the
best way of delivering the capability we need. I know that my hon.

10 years ago a substantial number of troops served on deployment in
Iraq with distinction. I point out that it is 250-mile round trip to
the nearest reserve base of any kind, so if Wick is closed it will
effectively mean that the inhabitants of Caithness and

that, unlike many other closing bases, Wick’s nearest

hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline and West Fife (Thomas Docherty)
has just raised a point of order about Kilmarnock being on the list of
reopened or opening sites. The only place in Scotland that is
determined as a location appears to be in Edinburgh, which is nowhere
near Kilmarnock. It seems that every Member of the House, including

seek your guidance, Mr Speaker, because I was handed a copy of the
Secretary of State’s oral statement as I arrived towards the end
of Prime Minister’s questions, which is why I did not thank him
for advance sight of it. The written statement was provided late. In
fact, I have an e-mail from the House of Commons Library confirming
that it arrived at 12.55 pm. That is well after the Secretary of State
spoke and well after I spoke. When the House of Commons Library

that it is a matter for Ministers to decide whether they wish to make
oral statements to the House. As he will be aware, the convention
whereby a Minister delivering an oral statement begins it by saying,
“With permission, Mr Speaker, I should like to make a
statement”, is just a convention and, frankly, a courtesy that
is, I think, on the whole appreciated by the House, but Ministers can
make statements to the House when they wish. The right hon. Gentleman
may wish to wait to see whether there is an offer of a statement, but
there are various parliamentary devices open to Members to deliver the
scrutiny that they think a particular measure warrants and everything
ought to be looked at on a case-by-case basis. Perhaps I can leave it

a driver gets behind the wheel they have a responsibility for their own
and other road users’ safety, but public
safety is put at risk by those who choose to drink and drive. Studies
have consistently shown that someone’s ability to drive is
impaired by having alcohol present in their blood and that the risk
increases as more alcohol is consumed. This risk to public safety has
been recognised in law for almost 90 years since the first
drink-driving offence was introduced in
1925<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T14:02:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070366000392" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/debtext/130703-0002.htm#13070366000392">The
current statutory provisions governing drink-driving make it an offence
to drive or attempt to drive while unfit through drink or with excess
levels of alcohol in the bloodstream. Currently the maximum sentence an
offender can receive is six months in prison, which is the same for a
first, second, third, fifth, sixth or even seventh offence. I believe
that that needs to change so that those who continue to reoffend will
face tougher sentences and those who persist in driving after drinking
over the legal limits will be deterred from doing
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T14:03:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070366000393" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/debtext/130703-0002.htm#13070366000393">There
has been a huge shift in the public’s attitude towards
drink-driving over the years and we should not lose sight of the
significant achievements of successive Governments in tackling this

drink-driving accidents. Thirty years later the number has
fallen to four a day, despite the volume of traffic
increasing by 80% since the 1980s. By combining

people were killed or seriously injured in drink-driving accidents in

of public expenditure, it falls to a Back Bencher to make the case on
behalf of the absent Financial Secretary. It is obviously a minor
detail that the House of Commons should be asked to approve £517
billion of public expenditure. Also, I suspect that all parties in the

made that observation on the slight absurdity of parliamentary process,
I will begin by saying a word about the approach to public expenditure
and health policy that the Health Committee, which I have the honour to
chair, has adopted since the beginning of this Parliament. We have our
differences within the Committee; it would be absurd to pretend
otherwise. We were elected from different party platforms and have
different views about how health care can best be delivered in our
society. However, from the beginning of this Parliament, we have taken
the view that there is not much point in using the Select Committee as
the platform for elaborating those differences, because there are many
other platforms where they may be amplified. We have sought consciously
to explore areas of common ground in the delivery of health and social
care, and to establish where there can be cross-party
agreement.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070366000413" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/debtext/130703-0002.htm#13070366000413">The
easy way to achieve that objective would be to avoid all the difficult
political questions. We have consciously not done that—we have
dealt with the difficult questions. We have talked about commissioning
in the context of the Health and Social Care Act 2012. We had a hearing
this morning on the developments in the Care Quality Commission. We
have not sought to avoid difficult territory, but when we are in it, we
look for areas of 
<?notus-xml column=953?>common ground. That means that we are not grandstanding on health
policy, but seeking to develop a coherent or, given what I will go on
to say, integrated view of how health care ought to develop on a

that background, it is significant that we have had a consistent and
serious view since the beginning of this Parliament on the questions
that are raised for those who work in the health and care sector by the

that the first substantive report that we issued in this Parliament was
on public expenditure.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T14:14:46"></hs_TimeCode> that report,
the Committee coined the phrase “the Nicholson
challenge”, which has passed into common parlance, to refer to
the challenge faced by the health and care system to deliver quality
care against the background of rising demand and, roughly speaking,
flat real-terms
budgets.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070366000415" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/debtext/130703-0002.htm#13070366000415">That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T14:19:44"></hs_TimeCode>

distinguished public servant, in his capacity as chief executive of the
national health service in May 2009. It was endorsed by the previous
Government. The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T14:15:02"></hs_TimeCode>

in meeting that challenge and to bring to the surface some of the

Nicholson.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070366000416" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/debtext/130703-0002.htm#13070366000416">Let<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T14:15:45"></hs_TimeCode>
us be clear what we are talking about. Since May 2009, the core issue
has been that resources are growing extremely slowly, if at all, while
demand continues to rise. One does not need a degree in mathematics to
know that if demand for health and care services rises, as it has in
this and every other country for the last 50 years, by
roughly 4% per annum and there is no new money coming into the system,
the only way in which demand can be met is by increasing the efficiency
with which the resources are used by an equivalent percentage each
year. In other words, the Nicholson challenge is how to deliver health
and care to the required standard—I will come back to that
point—4% more efficiently year on
year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T14:16:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070366000417" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/debtext/130703-0002.htm#13070366000417">I
emphasise that it is not my view, nor the Committee’s view, that
there are no political choices to be made about the level of resources
that are committed to health and care. It falls to the Government of
the day to make those choices every year when resources are voted on,
as we are doing this afternoon on the estimate of £105 billion.
That represents a political choice. However, members of the Committee
read the newspapers, understand the laws of arithmetic and understand
the broader political environment in which we live. We hear it when the
Leader of the Opposition says that an incoming Labour Government would
have to live with the spending plans of the current Government, at
least for their first year in office. That is, to put it mildly, an
exercise in expectation management by the Leader of the
Opposition.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070366000418" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/debtext/130703-0002.htm#13070366000418">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T14:18:03"></hs_TimeCode>

our view it would be unwise for the NHS to rely on any significant net
increase in annual funding in 2015-16 and beyond. Given trends in cost
and demand pressures, the only way to sustain or improve present
service levels in the NHS will be to

the way in which he is introducing this subject. He will acknowledge
that the Nicholson challenge and the need for year-on-year efficiency
gains of 4% were originally proposed under the last Labour Government.
There is therefore continuity from the previous Government, through the
coalition and on to any subsequent Government. Does he agree that the
result of the efficiency gains must not be that NHS rank and file staff
are subjected to lower regional pay and conditions, as was proposed in

hon. Friend is right that the challenge antedates the election of this
Government and that it increasingly looks beyond this Parliament, as
did last week’s public expenditure announcements. There are
specific challenges implicit in the Nicholson challenge for the
coalition and for the Opposition. To my colleagues in the Conservative
party, who sometimes ask why we have a ring fence around the national
health service, I simply say, “Understand what you are
asking.” We are already strapping ourselves to the mast
indefinitely into the future of meeting a rise in demand of 4% per
annum without substantial growth in real resources. Looking back, we
see that the national health service has delivered a 1% efficiency gain
trend rate over its first 60 years, and the national average for the
rest of the economy is 2%. We are expecting the health and
care system to deliver a 4% efficiency gain. To anyone believing that
we are likely to be able to meet demand for health and care to
acceptable standards against a background of reduced
resources—in other words, more than a 4% efficiency gain year on
year—I say, “Do the maths.” That is the challenge
to the Conservative
party.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070366000422" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/debtext/130703-0002.htm#13070366000422"><Member ContinuationText="Richard Fuller" PimsId="5734" UID="13070366001098" xid="1004" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/debtext/130703-0002.htm#13070366001098"><B>Richard

Labour Members may wish to look for ways to avoid the difficult
questions posed by the Nicholson challenge, but we need to remember
that if we were to try to meet demand without addressing any of the
efficiency questions—to take it to the other extreme—we
would need £5 billion a year of new money over and above keeping
up with inflation. That is more than 1p on income tax year on year, or
6p on income tax in the lifetime of a Parliament, to meet demand in the
health service, unless we address the Nicholson

conclusion that the Committee puts to the House is that the Nicholson

health and care has to address it. Nobody seriously believes that any
Government

simply to fund health and care, and nobody in my party seriously thinks
that we can avoid meeting demand for health and care. If we cannot
avoid meeting that demand, we have to deliver a 4% efficiency gain out
of the service merely to allow it to live within the current real
resource available to it. That is the Nicholson challenge, and it is
why the Committee—from a cross-party standpoint—has said,
from the beginning of this Parliament, that it is the most important
challenge facing the health and care

Dorrell:</Member></B> I do not wish to detain the House for the whole
of the time available for this debate, but my hon. Friend raises an
important question about how that demand is made up. The interesting
thing about the drivers of demand—rising expectations, the cost
and availability of modern medicine and the implications of an
increasingly elderly population—which each new Front-Bench
spokesman reveals as a newly discovered truth, is that they were first
discovered by Rab Butler when he became Chancellor of the Exchequer in
1951. He set up a commission to ask whether the health service was an
insupportable burden. The conclusion reached then, and by every
successive Government since, in this and in similar processes in other
countries, is that demand can be met, but it requires a serious
analysis of the nature of the demand and how resources are used
effectively to deliver it.</hs_Para>

danger in discussing health and care as if they were purely an economic
question, especially for those of us who have been employed in the

danger of sounding like a Treasury Minister and implying that the
economic questions are the only issues in this regard. I need only
offer names to the House to demonstrate that economics is not the only
issue here—Winterbourne View, Mid Staffordshire and Morecambe
Bay. Our system faces huge challenges, not just to do with economics
but in respect of the quality of service that is delivered on a daily
basis. Put simply, it is not enough just to go on delivering the
service as it is now because, too often, it fails. Implicit in the
Nicholson challenge is the requirement to face profound quality
challenges, as they exist in the system, at the same time as squaring
the financial circle I have been describing. In some quarters, it is

The 4% efficiency gain translates to £5 billion of recorded

efficiency and £850 million through pay freezes. We have not yet

community health and care can be provided efficiently to a high quality
if we retain the distinction between primary health care, community
health care and social care. Primary care is divorced from community
health care purely as a result of a political fix by Nye Bevan and the
British Medical Association in 1947. I was not born in
1947—indeed, not many Members were born in 1947. How much longer
do we have to live with the structural absurdity that was not even a
plan in 1947? It does not look like much of a plan now. Reimagining
high-quality efficient care to enable people to live longer, healthier
and fuller lives and avoid going to hospital unnecessarily is the core
challenge that the Committee believes needs to be put at the door of
policy makers in the Department of Health and in NHS England.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr Lansley), the former
Secretary of State for Health—as the agencies best placed to
develop genuine reimagination at local level of what fully integrated,
joined-up health and social care should look like. It is often
described as the Burnham plan. I am happy to endorse it, because the
Select Committee wrote it first and we did it building on the
institution created by the coalition through the Health and Social Care
Act 2012. I strongly endorse the development of the health and
wellbeing boards, and so, I believe, do my colleagues on the

up budgets and creating single commissioning budgets through the health
and wellbeing boards is only part of the answer if that single budget
then allows resources to leech away through the local authority system
without checks on the limits of the definition of the services that are
being secured. That is why our report recommends not just joined-up
budgets and the development of the health and wellbeing boards, but an
extension of the ring fence, which so many of my colleagues on the
Conservative Benches do not like, so that it covers not just NHS spend
but social care spend too. We did that because it makes no sense to
make the case for a single health and care system, and then imagine
that transfer of resource out of the NHS budget into the social care
budget as free to be spent anywhere else in the local authority
world.</hs_Para>

Friend the Secretary of State for Health that increased resources from
the NHS budget would be made available to social care, but

of institutions that grew up for a different world and a different

<?notus-xml column=958?>recommendations and analysis, which have been developed over three

context of our debate on public expenditure for health and care is, as
we have heard, not just the substantial upward cost pressure on the

which are affecting their social care budgets.
Adult social care directors tell us that £2.7 billion has been
cut from care budgets since 2011, representing a significant 20% of
those budgets. That level of cuts now means actual service reductions,
as well as increased charges for service users—a fact brought
home to me week in, week out by the cases I am now seeing in my

criteria of “moderate” until this year and has been

cover inflation this year, while nearly half said that providers in
their areas were now facing financial difficulties as a result of
savings made in fees paid to councils. In many cases, this has led to

not on the systemic transformation that social care needs if it is to
ensure sustainable services in future. Let me give an example. Of the

clear that more must be done to move from using scarce resources when
they are allocated as a sticking plaster to cover the costs. They
should instead be used to build more joined-up services. With another
£2 billion a year moving from the health budget to social care

meet eligibility criteria, which, we know now, the Government plan to
set at the “substantial” level. Secondly, they must fall
below a means-tested threshold. I understand that the upper level is to

how the figure is expressed, but the metering will take account only of
the costs that the council would pay for care. Many thousands of
families are already paying a top-up for care. Cuts to council budgets,
which I touched on earlier, will continue to depress the rate at which

Friend the Member for Charnwood (Mr Dorrell)—I used to know him
as the Member for Loughborough, which might cause some
confusion—on his speech. He is ever modest to say that the
Committee came up with the term “Nicholson challenge”. I
firmly remember that it was he who came up with it. It is absolutely to
his credit that, as a former Treasury Minister, he has focused
absolutely on the costs; and here we are today, addressing estimates

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T14:49:06"></hs_TimeCode>couple of points

the impossibility of solving the problem through public sector pay
restraint alone, and tinkering with therapies is another issue. How do
we cope with that? Tinkering with the tariffs will not solve the
problem; we have to go for a full integration of services. That issue
was well illustrated by the ghastliness of the Mid Staffs experience,
the Winterbourne experience and the Morecambe Bay
experience—those unbelievable failures in the health service.

the House, with some reconfiguration, but it has delivered enormous
opportunities. Yesterday, when the Health Secretary came to the Health
Select Committee, I was struck when he explained to us the savings that
the 2012 Act has already achieved. Although the reconfiguration is
hugely costly in itself, running to over £1 billion, the fact is

me tell the hon. Gentleman that in France, 70% of the population and
all pregnant women use homeopathy. Some doctors are trained in both
types of medicine, and they tend to prescribe fewer allopathic drugs
for their patients, which works out much cheaper. There is a lot of
research to be done on that. Homeopathy is, of course, widely used
across the world, including in the United States and in India. I think
this country has a lot of catching up to do. That is why, as I said to

By<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> chance, I
spoke in a recent meeting to Lord Wilson of Tillyorn, the last but one
Governor of Hong Kong. He brought statutory regulation of herbal
medicines into Hong Kong. He said that he did so not just because it
was better to have a properly regulated discipline that would help to
avoid the misuse of prescribing, but also because of the turf war
between the establishment and the herbal community. I think that there

focusing on the need to bear down on costs in the health service and to
shine a bright light on this phenomenally difficult challenge of
increasing demand and how we pay for it. I have suggested that while it
is brilliant to have the integration of health and social care, if we
are to satisfy the demands of people—through the different
boards under the Health and Social Care Act 2012 and through personal
budgets—we are going to have to look more seriously at the other
therapies that are available but are not regulated or brought into the
health service. The Minister really must try to grasp the importance of
herbal medicine because practitioners cannot get the supplies they need
to be able to practise as they should. I wish him well in his
endeavours.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-03?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_03_PT_1/CD53F0E10F0D5406FA511AB13E8ABCA1336AA19F" __version__="1.8"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="3 July 2013">Wednesday

hon. Member for Bosworth referred to evidence that the Secretary of

cost savings that reorganisation had brought about. However, we must
also think about some of the hidden costs of that reorganisation such
as clinicians’ time. How many clinicians carrying out a
management function in clinical commissioning groups in other providers
find that their time is not accounted for properly? What about the
opportunity cost in skills and training applied for the benefit of
patients if those clinicians are engaged in a management capacity? What
about the loss of experience for managers at every level? Some people
may have spent a number of years working in the health service and
taken an interest in structures, but we seem to be going round in
circles. We broke up what we described as large monolithic structures,
formed separate mental health trusts and separated community services.

commissioning, organising and troubleshooting—again, that point

State and his team respond that there has been a cost saving, but in
fact the vacuum had to be filled by new structures. Strategic health
authorities—an unloved institution—were swept away, but
local area teams were created. It is necessary to have a strategic
dimension to plan health care, particularly restructurings and
reorganisations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070366000482" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/debtext/130703-0002.htm#13070366000482">In
my view and, I suspect, for many Members across the House, this
top-down reorganisation—it was not initiated by people on the
ground—has impacted on front-line services and resulted in
considerable expense and disruption at a time when the NHS is facing
unprecedented pressures due to budgetary constraints and growing
demands on the service. We have seen that manifested at the coal face,
the fulcrum, in the crisis in accident and emergency departments.

to the issue in a moment. First I want to talk about integration, so I
will press on. Statistics published in <I>Public Spending
Statistics</I> in July 2012 show that real expenditure on the NHS fell
by 0.02% in 2011-12 and 0.69% in the fiscal year before that. I
understand that those are small percentages, but we are dealing with a
budget of £105 billion, including the capital element, and I
think the public would be concerned because those sums are not
insignificant. Those percentages equate to £740 million over two
years, and we should think about what that money could buy. In my area,
one of the first schemes to be cancelled when the coalition came to
power was a new hospital. It was not funded through a private finance
initiative but through Department of Health capital resources. That
hospital would have cost £464 million, but we are still waiting
for it. The figures I mentioned would have built two such

Member for Charnwood said, the NHS has been set productivity targets of
4% per year, as the Government seek to make savings of £20
billion over the lifetime of this Parliament. As the report identifies,
the Government believe that those savings can be made in part by
prioritising competition over co-operation. I find that questionable,
and we need a cost-benefit analysis of the consequences in regard to
the value for money of outsourcing. There has been a lot of criticism
of PFI schemes, and questions have been asked about whether they
provide value for money for the public purse. To date, efficiencies
have largely been achieved by freezing staff salaries and cutting the
tariffs paid to NHS providers. Neither of those is sustainable, and
both fail to meet the spirit, if not the letter, of the Nicholson
challenge<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T15:14:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070366000506" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/debtext/130703-0002.htm#13070366000506">There

mental and social care needs from home to hospital. We need a new focus
on prevention: people who are at risk of being admitted to hospital
should be identified and supported in their homes. The Select Committee
has been looking into the policies and interventions that have enabled
that to be done in other countries. We need to end costly migrations
from home to hospital, and from there to expensive care homes where, in
many cases, the individual must bear a huge financial burden. That is
good for neither the taxpayer nor the individual. The integration of

Pugh</B> (Southport) (LD):</Member> It is an honour to follow the hon.
Member for Easington (Grahame M. Morris). We all appreciate his style,
even if we do not share his conclusions and his fears. Let me also
congratulate the right hon. Member for Charnwood (Mr Dorrell) on the
Health Committee’s excellent report. Indeed, I congratulate all
the Committee’s members, who must be among the most diligent and
assiduous members of any Select Committee in the House, and many of
whom are in the Chamber
now.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070366000519" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/debtext/130703-0002.htm#13070366000519">On
the occasion of our last debate on the estimates, I made the huge
strategic mistake of trying to talk about the estimates, and was ruled
out of order for doing so. That was a schoolboy error. I shall
therefore draw a veil over the £50 billion of expenditure that
we are notionally considering, and limit myself to a few brief
observations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070366000520" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/debtext/130703-0002.htm#13070366000520">The
bottom line is that the NHS faces huge demographic and financial
problems. Having wasted two years reorganising it, we have now secured
universal agreement on what we must do. The way forward seems clear to
me, and it seems good. We must integrate care, reduce the cost burdens
on the acute sector, and remodel the acute sector to allow that to
happen. We must encourage self-management and co-management of chronic
disease. As was pointed out by the hon. Member for Easington, we must
encourage local co-operation. We must share data: that is very
important, but it has not been mentioned so far. We must pool
resources—that has been mentioned—and develop networks
for the treatment of strokes, cardiac conditions, cancer and so on. No
one disagrees in the slightest with that analysis.</hs_Para>

general support for personal health budgets, which were mentioned by
the hon. Member for Bosworth (David Tredinnick), although it is not
entirely clear whether they will complicate or solve the financial
challenges that we face. There are other no-brainers on which we
happily agree. We want to encourage medical research, and we want
better public health.</hs_Para>

clear, and there is little argument about it in the Select Committee or
in the House. What is not clear, however, is exactly how all this is
going to happen. We refer frequently to a string of laudable actions:
empowering patients, conducting pilots, providing incentives for
integration and co-operation, issuing mandates—that is rather a
new thing—setting quality standards, establishing frameworks,
and commissioning services. A word that we do not use much
however—although it was heard in the speech of the hon. Member
for Easington—is “management”. That has become
almost a discredited word. We talk about disease management, but we are
less happy to talk about system management, except 
<?notus-xml column=970?>when we talk about micro-management. The sin of non-delegation is
clearly a bad thing, but references to management tend to occur only in
that context. We boast about culling managers, but what we need now is
good executive management. If we are to implement the aims to which we
have all signed up, we shall need not more managers, but better
management and better
managers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070366000523" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/debtext/130703-0002.htm#13070366000523">Ministers,
and Governments in general—all Governments—have recently
been rather good at thinking up policies, making announcements and
changing structures, labels and names, but at times they appear to have
forgotten that the main business of Government is to govern, and to
engage in the day-to-day business of making things happen. They neglect
the day job, or become unaware of the need to carry it out. That is the
reason for the constant gap between announcement and delivery. That is
why there is all the teasing at Prime Minister’s Question Time
about programmes that are announced but not implemented.</hs_Para>

delighted when the Secretary of State sent Department of Health
officials into hospitals for work experience, so that they could
observe real-time implementation. The Under-Secretary of State himself
has real experience of hospitals, and knows what it is like to suffer
under the policy mandates of a variety of Governments. However, there
is a vacuum at the moment. There is a lack of local levers, which
prevents us from achieving the integration at local level that we want.
There is a gap in local leadership, especially when it comes to making
integration happen. There are more organisations around, but there is
less strategy control and command. As we heard from the hon. Member for
Easington, the strategic health authorities have
gone.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070366000525" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/debtext/130703-0002.htm#13070366000525">When
taken to task about problems of that kind, many
people—including, possibly, the members of the Health
Committee—cite the health and wellbeing boards, saying that they
are crucial to making it all happen and bringing it all together. I
wish them luck and I hope that they can do that, but they are a
variable mix at present. They are not kitted out or resourced to be
proper health boards. They have no genuine executive power, no budget
and no real authority.</hs_Para>

people who can get the local networks right, get the parts of the NHS

would require a budget freeze on every other Government Department for
the foreseeable future, even allowing for significant growth in our

long run, pay restraint may lead to a shortage of essential staff and,
of course, poor pay and conditions is a factor in the poor-quality
social and residential care we already see. As my hon. Friend the
Member for Worsley and Eccles South (Barbara Keeley) pointed out,
social services directors say that reductions in payments to care
providers are leading to a fall in the quality of the care they are
able to commission, and that often leads to a cycle of admissions to

would like to make one suggestion to the Minister: he should take a
look at the home from hospital care service, which I understand
operates in several parts of the country, and which was inspired by the
work of Geraldine Amos almost 40 years ago now. In Birmingham, that
service helps people move from hospital back into their own home and
community and, of course, frees up 
<?notus-xml column=972?>hospital beds. It is quite a limited service in Birmingham at present,
as it is currently financed by a grant from Birmingham city council,
and I am not sure how much longer that will last, given the pressure on
local authority budgets. That is, however, one example of how quite a
small amount of money can be used to make quite a big impact in getting
people back and settled at home, and trying to stop repeat admissions
and bed-blocking. The recent NHS Confederation survey of chairs and
chief executives revealed that 50% of respondents believed that the
financial pressures have affected waiting times and access in the past
12 months and that 70% believe that waiting times and access will be
affected by the continuing financial pressures in the next 12 months.
So it is slightly strange that we have heard so little from the
Government about how they plan to redesign services so that they are
able to unlock more sustainable efficiencies for the
future.</hs_Para>

local communities and their representatives, including local and

£50 billion there; perhaps we need to plant some money trees in
this country—and will only increase, as we all know. It has been
interesting to listen to Members on both sides of the House this

increasing—26% of adults are obese and the proportion is
rising—and our population is ageing, so that by 2030 almost 25%
of the population will be over 60. On top of that, there are advances
in medical technology and the costs thereof to deal

my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood (Mr Dorrell), that there

general taxation to fund health care is not practical in the medium to

have also heard that the introduction of competition law and its
possible implications with regard to reconfiguration is also looming
large in the national health service. Government Front Benchers might
want to look at that, because I am persuaded—I have spoken about
this on many occasions—that in future we will need fewer acute
hospitals but more community hospitals. The majority of care will
increasingly be offered closer to home, or indeed in the home, but the
clever stuff, such as the life-saving stuff shown in the television
series that the BBC is currently broadcasting on Thursdays, cannot and
will not be offered in the number of district general hospitals that we
currently have. Anybody who thinks that it can be does not understand.

not to defend the indefensible, and I think that Members on both sides

about how services are commissioned or not commissioned, and about
whether there should be top-down reorganisation, but the fundamental
question of where hospitals—acute and community
hospitals—are located should be decided nationally; otherwise we

only so much we can afford. I genuinely want a service that is based on
clinical need. I genuinely want somebody to arrive at the appropriate

key areas. First, the right hon. Member for Charnwood made some

Nicholson challenge can be achieved only by making fundamental changes
to the way in which care is delivered. It makes that argument in this

we need a fully integrated approach to commissioning—something

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T16:12:49"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Worsley and Eccles South rightly raised the concern of

second point is about the cost of the Government’s
reorganisation, about which my hon. Friends the Members for Easington
(Grahame M. Morris) and for Birmingham, Selly Oak spoke eloquently. In
the update from the Government last autumn, the overall cost was up by
33% or £400 million, making a total of £1.6 billion so
far. What is that money being spent on? A full £1 billion has
been spent on redundancy packages for managers, 1,300 of whom have
received six-figure pay-offs and 173 of whom have received pay-offs of
more than £200,000, all while the number of nursing posts has

do not want to get into that debate. I will leave it to the UK
Statistics Authority, which confirmed that spending on the NHS was
lower in real terms in 2011-12 than in 2009-10, albeit marginally. We
have seen reductions in NHS spending. Mental health spending
has been cut in real terms for two years running, cancer spending has
fallen in real terms and social care budgets have been

me now turn to the funding crisis in social care. The Library’s
analysis, which is borne out by the Local Government
Association’s statistics, shows that Government funding
reductions have forced local authorities to reduce their adult social
care budgets by £2.7 billion over the last three years. They
have had to slash services and increase charges in order to balance
their books, leaving thousands of vulnerable older and disabled people
facing a daily struggle to get the care and support they desperately
need.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070366000598" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/debtext/130703-0002.htm#13070366000598">That
is why what the Chancellor announced last week in the spending review
is at best a sticking plaster, or if I am feeling generous, a plaster

be fair, the Government have started talking Labour’s language
of integration—the right hon. Member for 
<?notus-xml column=982?>Charnwood would say that it is the Select Committee’s

what we want to see is by making fundamental system changes, which

underspend.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070366000600" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/debtext/130703-0002.htm#13070366000600">I
note that the Committee has raised concerns about the operation of the
Department of Health policy on underspends and budget exchange. The
small print of this year’s Budget revealed that the Department
of Health is expected to underspend against its 2012-13 expenditure
limit by £2.2 billion. That would be the biggest underspend of
any Department in this financial year. Page 70 of the Budget document
appears to show that none of this has been carried forward to be used
in subsequent financial years as part of the Budget exchange programme.
Perhaps the Minister could explain why—at a time when the NHS is
facing its biggest financial challenge, when 4,000 nursing posts have
been lost and when there is a crisis in A and E—they have
decided to hand the full £2.2 billion back to the Treasury. Can
the Minister also confirm that this means the underspend for 2012-13
would be 2% higher than the 1.5% figure that his Department says is
consistent with “prudent financial
management”?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070366000601" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/debtext/130703-0002.htm#13070366000601">We
think that people will struggle to understand why this money has not
been spent on the NHS. That is why we proposed that the Treasury
exceptionally allows a £1.2 billion “end-year
flexibility” carry-forward of around half of this year’s
under-spend. We would ring-fence this money for social care budgets
this year and next, to tackle the immediate crisis, with £600

being withdrawn from older people who need them, enabling more people
to stay healthy and independent in their own homes, and help families
being squeezed by rising charges for

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Dr Daniel
Poulter):</Member></B> It is a pleasure to close this debate and to
respond to my right hon. Friend the Member for Charnwood (Mr Dorrell)
and to his Committee’s report. I had the great privilege of
serving under his chairmanship before I was appointed as a Minister,
and he has been perhaps the greatest advocate of joined-up and
integrated care, both as a distinguished member of previous Governments
as Secretary of State for Health, and in all the work he has done as
Chair of the Health Committee. His work has helped to lead to the great
emphasis that the Government are placing on integrated and joined-up 
<?notus-xml column=983?>care, both through the Health and Social Care Act 2012 and in the

week.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T16:19:59"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

the 65th anniversary of the NHS. I am proud to work in the NHS and to
look after its patients. I think every Member in this House wants to
see a health service of which we can all be proud. We are proud of our
health service, but this 65th year of the NHS has also been marked by
many challenges, which were outlined in the Mid Staffs report, the
response to Morecambe Bay and in the comments on Tameside hospital made
by the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T16:20:17"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Member for Denton and Reddish (Andrew Gwynne). We have to respond to
those challenges, and the Government are taking strong steps to ensure
that we deliver and stamp out the small pockets of poor care in the
care system.</hs_Para>

we are to deliver a health service that is fit for the future, it has
to be a joined-up health and care service. We can no longer afford to
see the NHS and the social care sector as silos in their own right: we
have to have a joined-up integrated approach. It is for that reason
that we are proud to have increased the NHS budget by £12.7
billion. We are driving integration with that budget increase. We are
encouraging local authorities and the NHS to collaborate in treating
the needs of patients, and to address the problem highlighted by the
Select Committee of people being passed, like pass the parcel, from one
part of the system to another without any joined-up thinking or
integrated care. I know that Members on both sides of the House want an
end to that. In the spirit of consensus, we all want a health and care
system that truly looks after the needs of individuals and is not run
by the different financial and cultural silos of the whole.</hs_Para>

have heard strong contributions from hon. Members on both sides of the
House in what has been a consensual debate. If we are to tackle the
challenge outlined by Sir David Nicholson in 2009, when the
previous Government were in power, to make 4% efficiency savings year
on year just to stand still and to meet the increasing demand of an
ageing population and the increasing health care expectations of
patients, then we need consensus. To meet the challenge, we have to see
a fundamental service transformation and redesign. We also have to see
a far more productive NHS. Productivity gains and efficiency savings
have to be made, while the challenges outlined by the Mid Staffs case
and others are just as true today.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Witham (Priti Patel) outlined clearly the
importance of cutting back on bureaucracy and waste in the NHS where
possible. Under the Health and Social Care Act 2012,
£1.5 billion of bureaucratic savings will be put back
into front-line care on an annual basis. She was right to highlight the
importance of clinical leadership in delivering better services. There
is good evidence that clinical leadership is not just about improving
patient care. We can improve productivity through clinical leadership
by improving the procurement of services and goods in the NHS.
Procurement of services and goods makes up £20 billion of the
NHS budget. There is good evidence that strong clinical engagement and
leadership will help us to deliver greater productivity.</hs_Para>

Poulter:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right to
highlight the fact that health tourism presents challenges. We need to
look at them, which is why we have launched a consultation on exactly
how to do so. We should recognise that we hugely value the
fact—it is very beneficial to the British economy—that
students come here from overseas to train and, sometimes, to work. Part
of ensuring that they do so in a responsible manner and do not
short-change British taxpayers and British patients means making
provision for their health care needs, if necessary, and ensuring that
the NHS does not pick up the tab. That is something we have opened a
consultation on. It will report back later this year, and I am happy to
discuss the matter further with the hon. Gentleman away from this

Friend the Member for Charnwood was absolutely right to ask how we
would deliver greater productivity in the NHS and to say that pay plays
a part. Improving procurement, driving greater productivity and,
crucially, service reconfiguration all play their parts too. It is
worth highlighting the fact that the NHS needs to become more efficient
at how it manages its estates, with £3.1 billion or
so spent on NHS estates annually. There is much that can be done to
improve the energy efficiency of those estates, which is why the
Government launched a £50 million fund to support
that work. A lot also needs to be done to reduce the £2.4
billion temporary staffing bill. That is something we will be talking
about when we launch a paper later in the summer. There also needs to
be greater focus on good leadership at board level—something we
have touched on before—and engaging clinical leaders in helping
to drive productivity and improvements in patient care.</hs_Para>

is also worth outlining the role of tariffs, which were touched on in
the Committee’s report and in today’s debate, in driving
more joined-up care. It is true that tariff change in itself is not
good enough to drive improvements in patient care. Tariff change must
drive service change and transformation at the same time, driving the
more integrated care model that we all believe in. When
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T16:27:46"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr Lansley) was Secretary
of State, he initiated a review of the tariff system and looked
specifically at best practice tariffs. We are now seeing the emergence
of tariff change in a way that not 
<?notus-xml column=985?>only reduces costs, but drives service transformation. In the case of
fragile hip fractures, day case procedures—such as
cholecystectomies and similar procedures—and major trauma, we
are seeing service change and transformation being driven by improved
tariffs, which often cut across primary and secondary care.</hs_Para>

that is fit for the future, both financially and in human terms, that
will be down to major service transformation and moving towards a
system that provides integrated health and care. That is why last week
my right hon. Friend the Chancellor outlined in his statement a
£3.8 billion fund that will be shared between the NHS and local
authorities to deliver integrated services more efficiently for older
people and disabled people, ensuring that health and social care work
together to improve outcomes for local people. Importantly, the Health
Committee’s calls for health and wellbeing boards to play a
vital role in overseeing the fund is something that we envisage
becoming a reality.</hs_Para>

conclusion, we know that there are big challenges to the NHS in driving
up productivity, and we know that we have already met some of them by
cutting out, through our reforms, £1.5 billion of bureaucracy in
the NHS—money much better spent on patient care. Crucially, in
the years ahead, we will focus on the service transformation that is
required to deliver a more integrated health service, continuing to
develop those best practice tariffs that drive integration and bring
together health and social care. It is not just about finances, because
it is also about good care, which is why it is important to deliver the

pleased to have this opportunity to debate the Transport
Committee’s Rail 2020 report, which we published in January. The
report sets out our vision for the railway to the end of the decade.
Our main focus was considering the Government’s plan to achieve
efficiency savings of £3.5 billion by 2019, and its implications
for passengers and taxpayers. Currently, the railway costs the taxpayer
around £4 billion each year. These issues are highly relevant to
today’s consideration of the departmental
estimates.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070366000627" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/debtext/130703-0003.htm#13070366000627">It
is important to put today’s debate into context. In many ways,
the railway has been a success. The number of passenger journeys has
almost doubled since privatisation from 735 million in 1994-95 to 1.6
billion in 2011-12; passenger miles travelled have doubled over the
same period to 35.4 billion; and rail freight has expanded by over 60%,
with 11.5% of freight now conveyed by rail. There has been investment
in major projects such as Crossrail and Thameslink in London, with more
ongoing or planned work to electrify 800 miles of track and improve
rail services in the north with the northern

important aspect of our inquiry examined Government policy on
franchising, particularly in relation to securing value for money.

published a report on that issue earlier in the year.</hs_Para>

serious mistakes were made by officials, but there were also policy
failings for which past Ministers were ultimately responsible. The
review of franchising 
<?notus-xml column=988?>that Richard Brown undertook at the request of the Department concluded
that it was not sensible to let a 15-year contract for the west coast
franchise without a break clause. He also drew attention to the
difficulties caused by cutting back on resources while attempting to
meet an ambitious timetable. The Department has now published a new
timetable. The postponement in tendering for new franchises means a
delay of 26 years, with consequential uncertainty for the industry and
potential financial implications. I will return to that issue

poses a number of policy challenges. Increasing numbers of passengers
have led to overcrowding on some routes, and capacity constraints can
rarely be resolved quickly or cheaply. It is also important to remember
that rail investment is vital for regeneration as well as for relieving
overcrowding. The provision of rolling stock is complicated and
expensive. Fares are often too high and difficult to understand, and a
wide variety of fares are often available for the same journey, from
heavily discounted “advance purchase” tickets to very
expensive “anytime” walk-on fares. The structure of the
industry is complex, and there is suspicion that it creates
opportunities for money to leak out of the system, some of it in the

profits<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T16:36:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070366000633" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/debtext/130703-0003.htm#13070366000633">The
rail subsidy peaked at £7 billion in 2007-08, and the previous
Government asked Sir Roy McNulty to consider how to secure value for
money. His report was published in 2011. His most striking conclusion
was that there is a 40% efficiency gap between the UK railway and four
European comparators: France, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland.
Reasons given for that disparity include the fragmentation of the rail
industry, poor management, problems with franchising, and cultural
factors. He made a wide range of recommendations aimed at achieving a
30% cost reduction in the industry by
2019.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070366000634" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/debtext/130703-0003.htm#13070366000634">Although
the rail subsidy has fallen in recent years, it is higher now than in

that debt than ever before, and train operating costs have increased.
Rail subsidy is necessary. Few rail lines would be profitable on a

publish a clear statement of what the

decision to prioritise the re-tendering by 2015 of the east coast main

twice as much as Virgin gave back over a two-year period. It also gets

stated that, over the three years 2009-10 to 2011-12, the inter-city
east coast franchise produced a net return to the Department of
£563 million. The letter also stated that, over the same period,
the west coast main line made a net return of £290 million. The

franchise produced better value for money, but I am simply presenting
the facts in the letter as a contribution to the
debate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T16:42:41"></hs_TimeCode>. One
consequence of the decision has been the postponing of the re-letting

and conditions and salaries should be made in the context of a wider
programme of changes made throughout the industry and after full
consultation with trades unions. Any changes in the numbers and duties
of station staff should not be pursued solely to reduce costs, but
should reflect changes in passenger ticket-buying behaviour, and should
be designed to improve passengers’ experience at stations,
including their perception of safety. We were very concerned about the
possibility that reducing staffing at stations and on trains would make
the railway less safe, particularly at night, and would deter women and

this matter for a previous debate, as it is often claimed that our rail
fares are the highest in Europe. Certainly if we compare immediate,
walk-up, any time fares, we are comparatively more expensive, but if we
look at the whole basket of fares, we compare very favourably. I urge
the hon. Lady to look at an independent website compiled by regular
rail users called “The Man in Seat Sixty-One”. It
compares similar journeys on the continent and here, and for even very
short-time advance fares we compare very favourably, so I do not accept

I hope she will forgive me for not commenting on that. However, I agree
that there is potential for expanding rail use outwith the peaks.
Although the whole west coast main line franchise process had to be
suspended, FirstGroup’s bid submission contained an ambitious

outwith the peaks. That will help to generate more income and bring
about a shift from other modes of transport to rail.</hs_Para>

point has been made that the rail network requires subsidy to operate,
and I agree with that. Many lines would not be profitable in
themselves, but for social and environmental reasons they require
subsidy. We need to take into account not just the operating profit and
loss of an individual rail service, but the opportunity cost: the cost
to the country if that rail line did not exist and people had to travel
by car or another mode of transport. We can only imagine the congestion
on the roads around our major cities if we did not have commuter rail
lines. They might not, in themselves, be profitable, but the
environmental and financial cost of having those passengers travelling
by car or another mode of transport would just be too much to
bear.</hs_Para>

welcome the Government’s commitment to continue to subsidise

that Sir Roy McNulty and others reached in their report, which was that
we should be looking to make our network as efficient as possible, in
order to achieve his aim of a 30% reduction in the unit cost. Our
network is comparatively expensive to run compared with others. I
believe that that is a product of history, not just of one approach, be
it the franchise model or the nationalised model. It is a cost that has
been built into the system over many decades, particularly because
until relatively recently we have had a period of managed decline of
our network and what investment there has been has been made on a
“make do and mend” basis. Additional costs are hard-wired
into our system, but the system we now have is sensibly
evolving.</hs_Para>

<?notus-xml column=994?>trying to put the issue into its historical perspective, so let me put
it into real historical perspective. When John Major’s
Conservative Government privatised the railways in the 1990s, they came
to this Chamber and told right hon. and hon. Members that there would
be no subsidy. That was used as justification for selling the railways
off at a lower price. Network Rail now carries a debt of £30
billion on its balance sheet, so I hope the hon. Gentleman will take

forgive me, I will not rehash the debates of the 1990s as I am more
interested in what happens from here on. In an earlier intervention, he
made the point that the Government are seeking to return the east coast
main line to private hands as a matter of ideology. Equally, I could
argue that it is because of ideology that the Opposition want to
renationalise it. I draw the hon. Gentleman’s attention to the
conclusion of Richard Brown’s report on franchising, which
concluded that the franchising model was not fundamentally flawed and
that although the detail could sensibly be changed, the investment in

alliances are not the only form of alliance available. One or two other
examples provide evidence that such an arrangement can deliver useful

electrify the branch line to Paisley Canal on the Greater Glasgow
network was an alliance between Network Rail, First ScotRail and
Babcock engineering. They were able to electrify the branch line at a
substantially lower than expected cost and two years ahead of the

First, they should not exclude open access operators, which I think

There is concern that too tight a deal between Network Rail and the
dominant train operating company might—I put it no higher than
that—exclude open access operators. I ask the Minister to keep
an eye on that. Related to that, one of the witnesses to the inquiry
that the Transport Committee is conducting into access to ports flagged
up a concern that rail freight operators might be disadvantaged in
securing paths on busy rail lines if too deep an alliance exists.

considerable scope for encouraging more passengers on to the railway

moving staff from behind windows on to station concourses to assist
passengers; and more and more people will use their mobile phone to buy
tickets and make reservations. The Select Committee heard evidence from

I was saying, retail development is happening at smaller stations.
Denmark Hill station is a lovely Victorian building, which is being
remodelled so that, instead of a fairly horrible little ticket office
and coffee machine, there will be a swish café, making it a much
more attractive environment that will encourage people to use the
railway. There is a lot of scope in such developments. I would even
suggest that, where the Government are trying to reduce Government real
estate costs, they might consider moving services like post office
counters into railway stations. It would be a bit of joined-up
government to have public services all available in one spot. That is
just one little

a south-west perspective, we have the Great Western main line carrying
50% more passengers than it did 10 years ago. Network Rail states that
the line is full. In 2002-03, 72 million people used the line, and in
2012-13 the figure was 110 million. The Reading to Paddington trains
account for six out of 10 of the most overcrowded journeys in the UK.

freight lines—so important, although that is perhaps not always

lines, as well as intercity services, are almost at breaking point in

inform our discussion of the franchise process, which is the core of
the report. I am not going to start trading statistics, but over the
period of Railtrack, rail safety improved and we were going up the
European safety league table. The reason so much money had to be
invested—very successfully with private help—was the
years of underinvestment by a series of Governments, Conservative among
them. I disagree with the hon. Gentleman’s intervention on that
point, not least because the facts on the safety of the rail network
under privatisation speak for themselves.</hs_Para>

this franchise system to work so that rail companies can compete with
their natural competitors, the motorways and the airlines? I plead with
the Government to do as much as they can. I know that the advice they
have had recently has been to shorten slightly the long franchises that
have been planned, but the longer the franchise rail companies can get,
the better their ability to invest in rolling stock, customer service
and improving the capacity and punctuality of their services.</hs_Para>

Ipswich to London line for a long time will say that the best
improvements they have seen were under the first franchise—as I
am sure my right hon. Friend the Minister will agree—which was
quite long and had the loosest possible terms. It allowed the then
Anglia franchisee to put maximum efforts into improving performance.
The last Government did many good things in rail, but one of the bad
things was to have far too tight a control over the franchises,
stipulating to the dot and comma how the services should be delivered.
Unsurprisingly, the bidders for those franchises went in at the lowest
possible price, bidding on the specification provided by the
Government, 
<?notus-xml column=1004?>and the improvement in service flattened and, in some cases, reversed.
We need as loose a franchise framework as possible, and as long as
possible so that the private sector can invest as fully as possible in
the services without being second-guessed by the doubtless otherwise
brilliant officials at the Department for
Transport.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070366000751" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/debtext/130703-0003.htm#13070366000751">We

have tried to understand how much subsidy goes in to the great eastern

at disaggregating subsidy in granular enough detail. I have questioned
them about control period 5, but it is almost impossible to get a
decent idea of the quantity of subsidy or public investment we are
likely to get in our line, which makes it very difficult for us, as

is also important for how the franchise system develops. When
privatisation was introduced, there was only one profit-making line in
the UK and there are now many that turn a surplus.
Effectively—and I know that the Minister disagrees with me
slightly on the detail of this—fare income is transferred from
one part of the country to another. Roughly £30 of the
£74 standard fare ticket from Ipswich to London is
paid in premium which is moved, effectively, to those parts of the
country that need a subsidy. That is unfair on my constituents,
especially those who are paid the same bad wages that some people in
subsidised areas are paid. They rightly demand a social subsidy so that
they can get their rail service for less than they would

turn now to a discussion of the east of England, and I know that the
Minister has a constituency interest there and, therefore, a profound
knowledge of the area. Only two regions of England outside London are
net contributors to the UK Exchequer: the south-east and the east.
Since the 19th century, the eastern region has suffered some of the
worst levels of investment. Historically, there has been a poor level
of investment in the main line from London to Norwich, with
hand-me-down carriages and levels of service that other parts of the
country have long forgotten about. The region has contributed to the UK
economy in the past five or 10 years, but investment is
needed for that contribution to continue. The region is not demanding
new motorways or A roads, but investment is required for people to able
to get from London, Ipswich and Norwich to the midlands. That would
lead to growth that would make a significant contribution to the UK
economy.</hs_Para>

British Rail had the highest productivity of any rail system in Europe.
That was not because it was performing ideally, but because there was
so much underinvestment that it was working “miracles on a

regulator some years ago. He went beyond that to say that BR handed the
rail system over to the private sector in good order. There was

a commuter of 44 years on Thameslink and its predecessors, I love
railways. Their renaissance has been a wonderful thing and I want it to
continue. I have always thought that railways would be the transport
mode of the future, not the past. If one goes back 20 or 30 years, they
were regarded with utter cynicism by the Department for Transport. A
senior official was put on to the BR board, as was the custom in those
days. He arrived at his first meeting and said that he had come to
oversee the demise of the railways—that was the attitude.
Everybody thought that the great freedom-loving individualists would go
by car, not by this collectivist, socialist system called rail.
Nevertheless, we have seen a renaissance in the investment and use of
the railways. Indeed, just about the only way to guarantee to get to a
place on time is to go by rail.

Hopkins:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. We have seen
people travelling longer distances to work and growth in the economy,
particularly in London and the south-east, leading to much more
commuting from longer distances to take advantage of lower house prices
further from London, and so on. The amount of travelling that people
need to do has increased enormously. The only way they can do it is by
rail. I speak as someone who is sometimes asked by people, “How
long does it take you to drive to London?”, to which I say,
“I don’t know and I’ve never done
it”—why would I, from Luton to London every

since privatisation we have seen a surge in costs, not just on the
operating side, but on maintenance and track renewal. Time and again
when Labour was in office, I raised with Transport Secretaries the fact
that the costs of maintenance and track renewal had gone up by
something like four or even five times since privatisation. The reason
was largely to do with the move towards more contracting and away from
direct works. That contracting involved lots of lawyers and layer upon
layer of project management, all of which meant bureaucratic cost,
which is still the situation now. Indeed, after some time maintenance
was brought back in-house. The problem was that the bad habits
established while it was contracted out continued and the same people
who operated in the contracted-out version carried on doing the work
in-house, so there was not much difference. We have to look back to how
things operated in the days of BR, when they were done much more
efficiently.</hs_Para>

object to either, although that is another view. Obviously I welcome
the electrification plans. That is tremendous, but other things could
be done—and need to be done quickly and could be done
inexpensively—to make major improvements. As I said last week,
upgrading the east coast main line, for example, could make a
tremendous difference, even simply by doubling the viaduct at Welwyn.
At the moment, there are just two tracks over the Mimram. If there was
another viaduct, there would be four tracks and the bottleneck would be
overcome. That would cost something, but nothing like the billions we
are talking about with HS2. If we had east-west flyovers at
Peterborough and Newark, it would free up the track for fast

I mentioned last week, a 1990 test run was undertaken by BR to see how
a fast train could operate from King’s Cross to Edinburgh.
Remarkably, the line was cleared for the test run and the train ran to
Newcastle in two and a half hours, with a two-minute stop there, and
then onward to Edinburgh in three and a half hours. That showed what
could be done if the track were upgraded on a regular basis. Three and
a half hours to Edinburgh is eight minutes faster than the time HS2 is
now advertising. It is not heavily trafficked, and if we took the
freight off the east coast main line, we could—with longer
trains, more modern signalling and a bit more of an upgrade—get
much more capacity on that line very cheaply. I should mention, of
course, that King’s Cross could also serve Leeds in that way in
an hour and a half. With a 140 mph operation—the sort of speed
that is possible not throughout the line, but for much of
it—this King’s Cross to Leeds service could bring more
capacity.</hs_Para>

problem with the west coast main line is essentially the London to
Birmingham route. As I said last week, there is an easy way of
overcoming the problem by upgrading the Paddington to Birmingham Snow
Hill route through Banbury. A 125 mph operation on that line would be
relatively easy, with longer trains, a bit of upgrading and more modern
signalling. That could effectively double the capacity for getting to
Birmingham, and it would not be difficult or expensive. Paddington will
be on the Crossrail route. From the City, then, someone could travel
Crossrail to Paddington and straight through to Birmingham Snow Hill in
the centre of Birmingham, overcoming a major problem. The station
proposed for HS2 is rather further away from the centre than Snow Hill
is, so some of the advantage of that is lost. Going further north,
there is a stretch of 10 miles or so with three-track working north of
Rugby. If it were made four-track, it would overcome a bottleneck and
increase capacity going through to the north-west. As I said, things
could be done that are not expensive and they could be brought in
quickly, so that by 2020 all these things could easily be in
operation.</hs_Para>

important of all, we have to look at investment for freight. I have
personally been heavily involved in a freight scheme idea—it is
not a pecuniary interest, but a political interest—and I believe
we need new freight infrastructure. If we could get all the freight off
the existing main lines on to dedicated freight infrastructure, 
<?notus-xml column=1008?>we could solve enormous problems. Freight and passengers do not mix
well, as they have different operating speeds. Passenger trains tend to

is a scheme to overcome that problem—at least on the north-south
line linking the main conurbations. I have proposed the GB Railfreight
route, and last week I put in a submission on behalf of colleagues to
Network Rail for its consultation on freight. The GB Railfreight route
would be a dedicated line going all the way from the channel tunnel to
Glasgow, linking all the main conurbations in Britain.</hs_Para>

important thing about freight, of course, is that 80% of it goes by
lorry and trailer, not by container, so we would need to have a freight
route capable of taking lorries on trains. Without that, we will not
see the big modal shift from road to rail that we need. This scheme
proposes precisely that, taking the largest lorries on trains. This is
happening all over the continent of Europe with dedicated routes. New
tunnels are being built through the Alps that are capable of taking
through the largest sized freight. If we could run trains directly from
Rome to Birmingham or from Berlin to Glasgow without interruption by
passenger trains on a dedicated freight route capable of taking lorries
on trains, I think we would see a transformation of the links between
our regions and the continent of Europe, which would also breathe new
life into the regional economies that so many Members represent. That
scheme is a realistic proposition. It could be built quickly and
cheaply, and all it needs is a nod from the Government. I have met
previous Secretaries of State and officials from the Department for
Transport and put the case to them, and it is a realistic prospect that
I hope will be taken seriously. It has the backing of supermarkets,
hauliers and so
on.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070395000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/debtext/130703-0003.htm#13070395000028">One
important point I wish to make to the Minister is that such a scheme
would use existing track route, underutilised lines and old track bed.
Only 14 miles would be new line, and nine of those would be in a
tunnel. Two routes would have to be electrified to a sufficient gauge
to take lorries on trains: Gospel Oak to Barking, and Wigston to
Chesterfield in the midlands. If on those routes the gauge was raised
to a sufficient level and able to take full-scale lorries on trains,
the scheme would work. Those lines will be electrified—rightly
so; we welcome that—but if they could be raised to a sufficient
gauge to accommodate that sort of freight, it would be a tremendous
advantage. If that is not done and the freight scheme goes ahead later,
we will have to do the work all over again, which would be an expensive
irrationality.</hs_Para>

is what I suggest. The scheme would take up to 5 million lorry loads
off our roads every year. It would take all the north-south traffic off
the west coast main line, the east coast main line and the midlands
main line, and breathe new life into the economies of Scotland, the
north-east, the north-west and south Yorkshire. There could eventually
be a link to south Wales and Birmingham, and of course to London and
the south-east, and it would link directly to the continent of
Europe.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070395000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/debtext/130703-0003.htm#13070395000030">Trains
currently take lorries from the continent through the channel tunnel,
but they can get only as far as the terminal at Barking where they are
lifted off. They cannot get past Barking because the gauge is not
sufficient 
<?notus-xml column=1009?>to accommodate them. In a sense, the first phase of the scheme is
already operating, but we want Governments and Network Rail to grasp
hold of the idea and build the freight line that we think will
transform Britain’s transport infrastructure. I hope that what I
have said is helpful to Ministers and of interest to fellow hon.

the Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs Ellman) for her
contribution, and for the work she does as Chair of the Transport
Committee not only on rail but on all transport matters. As we have
heard, passenger numbers are growing and the amount of freight on our
railways has increased, and it is important to bear that in mind when
talking about the future structure of railways in the UK. The argument
made by the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T17:57:44"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Member for Ipswich (Ben Gummer) that those increased numbers were
somehow down to the fact that John Major got privatisation so right
stretches his ideological point a little far. As
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T17:58:01"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Luton North (Kelvin Hopkins) said, in recent years the
increase in car ownership and congestion mean that many journeys cannot
be made by road within a sensible time, and—quite

railways.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070395000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/debtext/130703-0003.htm#13070395000032">An
efficient and well structured rail system for the UK is not only
important to provide the transport links we rely on for individual
travel and freight; it is also vital for our economy, especially in
regions such as the north-east of England. That is why investment in
our railway system is so vital. We have heard a lot of talk over the
past few weeks about the capital investment projects outlined by the
Government, but over the next two years we will actually see a
reduction in the transport budget of some £300 million. A lot of
the investment projects that have been outlined are jam tomorrow, or
even jam a very long way into the future. Capital investment in our
railways now would not only improve the situation in the ways outlined
by my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T17:59:21"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Friend the Member for Luton North, it would stimulate the economy. Such

believe what I was reading. Some of the points he raised were perfectly
legitimate, however. The investment in HS2 is going to be enormous and,
I have to say, regions such as the north-east will see very little

problems that we now face. However, that should not take away from the
achievements of British Rail, including the introduction of the

on journey times and, as he said, they would achieve a modal shift as
we moved freight off the roads and on to the railways. Before we embark
on the full investment in HS2, those proposals need to be looked at

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T18:12:13"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs Ellman) raised the important
point of the transparency of the process, and there is a constituency
issue that I have been campaigning on for a number of years now: the
stretch of the east coast main line that goes through my North Durham
constituency from Chester-le-Street
into<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T18:12:28"></hs_TimeCode> Newcastle.
Chester-le-Street has now increasingly become a commuter town for
Tyneside and Teesside. It takes less than 15 minutes to travel from
Chester-le-Street into Newcastle, and if it was in south-east England
it would therefore be seen as an obvious place to commute to work from.
In the mornings and early evenings there is an hourly, and sometimes a
half-hourly, service, but throughout the rest of the day the timetable 
<?notus-xml column=1013?>is intermittent, and later in the evening when people want to travel
into Newcastle for entertainment there is a limited
service.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13070395000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/debtext/130703-0003.htm#13070395000056"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T18:13:15"></hs_TimeCode>I
pay tribute to the campaign of the stationmaster at Chester-le-Street,
Alex Nelson. He has been arguing for an hourly stopping service from
Chester-le-Street to Newcastle. We have met Northern Rail to make the
case for that, and the point it keeps making to us is that the
franchising model puts an emphasis on inter-city routes, rather than
stopping services. It is clear from the public meetings I have had
about this issue over the past few years that there is huge interest in
Chester-le-Street to ensure it gets an hourly service into Newcastle
not only at peak times, but throughout the day and at weekends. That
would serve to reduce the number of cars travelling to Newcastle and
alleviate congestion.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T18:06:59"></hs_TimeCode> need to think
about how local people can have a voice in determining issues such as
the train service from Chester-le-Street, which is not only important
for local people, but which benefits the economy of Tyneside. A study
has recently been undertaken on widening the western bypass, as we need
to get the cars off that. One of the easiest ways of doing so is to
invest in the likes of an hourly stopping service from
Chester-le-Street.</hs_Para>

I wish to discuss the wider transport picture in the north-east. I
congratulate the seven local authorities in the north-east which are
coming together in a strategic partnership to examine economic
development. Not only that, but one of their key objectives is to look
at a joined-up transport policy. This debate is about rail, but we
cannot look at that in isolation; we need to consider how it joins up
to other public transport networks, be it the buses or the Metro system
in Tyneside. It also needs to be as easy as possible for people to
transfer from one mode of transport to another. One thing I would like
the authorities to back is some kind of Oyster card, whereby people
could travel using different modes of transport in the north-eastern
region. That would make travel a lot easier, and the new authority may
well be able to push forward with such things.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T18:15:44"></hs_TimeCode>The investment
we need in our rail network is not only vital for the purpose of people
travelling; it is vital to the future economic benefit of this country

north-east.</hs_Para>

Gilmore</B> (Edinburgh East) (Lab):</Member> In recent months, I have
been spending a lot of time working on issues relating to the east
coast main line and the proposal to re-privatise it. The Backbench
Business Committee was good enough to grant a debate on that some two
weeks ago, which gave many of us an opportunity to explain why we had
severe concerns about what was happening. In a lot of these debates it
is interesting to see how we reprise a lot of our own
prejudices—we are probably all a bit guilty of that—and
we heard repeated the old mantra about British Rail’s soggy
sandwiches and drinks that were like coffee or tea. However, some of us
can also recall some pretty good things about British Rail. As a
student, I was able to send my luggage 
<?notus-xml column=1014?>in advance, door to door. None of the privatised rail companies has, at
least as yet, repeated that. When my children were going to university,
it was difficult to send their luggage. No doubt a lot of people now
drive their children there and back, but we did not do that. There are
good and bad things here. If we, on both sides of this argument,
constantly raise those issues without having a proper debate, we will
not progress things much further.</hs_Para>

advantage of the east coast line having been operated by Directly
Operated Railways in the past few years is that we have been given
something of a comparator. The Minister is fond of saying,
“There is nothing really to compare. Every area and every
franchise is different, so it is not a fair comparison.”
Nevertheless, this arrangement has given us something that is perhaps
as close as we are ever going to get to an ability to try out a
comparison. It is a pity that the Government do not seem to want to
allow it to continue so that we can see what is happening over a longer
period.</hs_Para>

today’s debate is about looking more widely at railway issues
and where they are going to be in the next few years. The things that
have exercised the Government and the Transport Committee are the
McNulty report, the cost of Britain’s railways and
McNulty’s stark conclusion that our railways cost 40% more to
run than comparable networks in Europe, many of which are state-run. If
we had still had a nationalised railway at the time of McNulty and it
had been found to be 40% more expensive, there would have been a huge
outcry from many people about how dreadful it was and how we must do
something about it. In some ways, one could start to construct the
argument that it is a sign of the failure of the entire process of
franchising and privatisation over nearly 20 years that we are in this
position. We were promised that the system would be innovative and
cheaper but that just does not seem to have happened. We should be
having some serious discussions about why.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13070395000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/debtext/130703-0003.htm#13070395000063"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T18:20:06"></hs_TimeCode>The
Transport Committee has considered the problem and tried to analyse
some of the reasons behind it. We have heard a number of suggestions
about how we could achieve the efficiencies identified by McNulty. He
considered staffing, closing ticket offices and cutting the number of
train guards, but as the Transport Committee rightly said, safety
issues must be considered, including people feeling safe when they
travel. We do not want to compromise safety and we must ask what
savings can be realised in such circumstances, particularly as McNulty
was looking for substantial savings of £3.5 billion.</hs_Para>

also suggested closer working between Network Rail and individual train
operating companies—what is now called alliancing in the
language of transport. A key driver of increased cost since
privatisation has been the fragmentation of the industry to try to
create competition when it is inherently difficult to do so with the
split between track and stations and the operation of trains. The
difficulty with alliancing is that it will not—or probably
cannot—be rolled out on routes with multiple operators. Network
Rail therefore said that from that point of view it does not expect to
save much money, so, on that basis, we must ask how it would actually
work.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13070395000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/debtext/130703-0003.htm#13070395000065"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T18:21:49"></hs_TimeCode>McNulty
also mentioned raising income from retail and we discussed that today.
There have been changes in places like the new King’s Cross
station and the new St 
<?notus-xml column=1015?>Pancras station. Sometimes, one walks into a station nowadays and
wonders whether one is in a station or a shopping centre. It can even
be quite difficult to find out where the platforms are, and people get
quite disoriented. Whether such an approach is feasible anywhere other
than in the big mainline stations must be considered with some degree
of caution. Much of people’s travelling life is spent in
relatively small stations in small places and people want to get there,
get on their train and go, rather than have a shopping experience. One
reason it works for the airlines is that people are required to arrive
at airports very early and have a lot of time on their hands. In my
view, one of the advantages of rail travel is that passengers are not
required to spend a lot of time waiting. That is not to say that the
idea is not a good one, to some extent, but the notion that we can
achieve huge income and therefore efficiencies through such an approach
is doubtful.</hs_Para>

Transport Committee states that if the efficiencies are not achieved,
we must go back and consider the whole way in which the industry is
structured to see whether that is the best way to make the railways
work for us. If the McNulty proposals that the Government are working
through do not achieve those savings, we will still have a serious
problem ahead.</hs_Para>

is good that we are here. Our predecessors 40 years ago would have been
surprised to find that we are in the Chamber discussing the railways
with such enthusiasm, as they thought they were becoming a rather niche
interest. However, there is a question about whether we are in this
position because of privatisation, as some speakers have suggested, or
whether we have seen a change all over Europe in how people travel. The
initial attractions of car transport have diminished, particularly in a
crowded island such as Britain. It must be said that much of the
investment that has gone in since privatisation and that is still going
in is from the public sector.

is not coming from the private operators, regardless of what was

is the right thing to do, but whether it is the right thing to do
through privatisation, so that we are, in effect, subsidising the
profits made—where they are made—is a completely
different question. As

Government’s review was originally due to be published in May,

lectures East Coast on punctuality. I hope that the review will now
bring forward serious proposals for reform, because at present

fares and ticketing review should be looking at. The Transport
Committee was right to call for so-called super-peak tickets to be
ruled out. They would penalise those commuters who have no choice but
to travel at peak times. I urge the Minister to go further than he had
done previously and rule out granting train operating companies the
right to redefine peak time periods. I also ask him to give the House a

London to go to Ipswich, Norwich or Chelmsford in the morning are on
empty trains and paying £74, but if they are going into London
they are of course on packed trains and paying £74. The
Government have set the peak time rules for many years, so the
franchisee cannot make an elastic arrangement to encourage people to
take the train when it is empty and discourage them when it is full. I

the McNulty report put it, we have a fare structure that is complex,
often appears illogical and is hard for the uninitiated, or even the
initiated, to understand. The answer is not new, unreasonable
super-peak fares. We fully support the development of smart ticketing
schemes, a policy closely linked to the devolution agenda. Transport
for London and Centro have demonstrated how strong local transport
authorities can successfully introduce smart card schemes, making rail
and other forms of public transport more convenient for everyday use.
We believe that regional partnerships are best placed to introduce new
schemes, drive forward integration with other modes of transport and
decide their own priorities for developing local rail
services.</hs_Para>

the pattern of dither and delay from the Department for Transport is
also affecting the devolution agenda. Were it not for its extensions to
the Northern 
<?notus-xml column=1018?>Rail and TransPennine franchises, we could have seen an earlier decision
on devolution, with the new settlement starting next year. We want to
see an ambitious model of genuine devolution, learning from the success
of continental models, that can be extended to other areas, including
the west midlands.</hs_Para>

we have already seen some reductions in local facilities. Although they
are not as high profile as the cuts to passenger services we have seen
in the past, we are concerned about ticket office closures, especially
as some seem to be going ahead by stealth, using the McNulty review as
cover. Last year, leaked e-mails from the Department for Transport
revealed that Ministers had decided to approve closures and let train
operating companies take the blame. That was an unacceptable way for
closure decisions to be taken. I hope that Ministers will take note of
the Campaign for Better Transport’s “Going Local”
report, which drew together evidence from London Overground and
Merseyrail. The evidence suggested that staffed stations and ticket
offices led to increased passenger numbers, lower levels of fare
evasion and increased passenger
satisfaction.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070395000085" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/debtext/130703-0003.htm#13070395000085">There
are simply better ways to save money than closing ticket offices. Of
course we need more efficient railways. Network Rail has delivered
substantial efficiency savings since Labour ended the disaster that was
Railtrack, and the rolling programme of electrification, which the last
Government committed to, will help reduce operating
costs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070395000086" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/debtext/130703-0003.htm#13070395000086">However,
as McNulty helps to establish, although technology can bring about
savings, the greatest challenge is fragmentation. Privatisation has
left us a system with a 40% efficiency gap as measured against European
comparators. Fragmentation has built in additional unnecessary costs at
every level and we need a serious debate about how they can be
addressed. On the Government’s response, it is too early to
quantify properly the impact of alliancing and there are real concerns
over the accountability of the Rail Delivery Group, which must not be
used as an excuse to diminish ministerial
responsibility.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070395000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/debtext/130703-0003.htm#13070395000087">We
must also be alive to the danger that through alliancing, non-dominant
operators will be excluded from decision making. That is especially
true in the case of freight operators—a danger acknowledged by
the hon. Member for Milton Keynes South (Iain Stewart). If there are
increased disputes over access rights, that will only generate a higher
administrative burden for the
regulator.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070395000088" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/debtext/130703-0003.htm#13070395000088">To
conclude, I should say that the Government have tied themselves so
closely to the stalled franchising system that they have left the
industry in stasis. Awards are being extended for up to four years at a
massive cost to the taxpayer, on top of the £51 million net
payment that the Government made to operators in the last financial
year. The paralysis caused by the collapse of franchising has hit the
supply chain’s order books, threatening jobs and skills.
Ministers have made restoring franchising a point of political pride,
even to the extent of privatising the successful east coast service,
instead of seriously examining alternatives. That is what Labour is
committed to doing, and why we are conducting a thorough review of the
rail industry that is not hampered by ideological baggage.</hs_Para>

an ageing network built in Victorian times, coupled with
underinvestment over a number of decades by successive Governments,
operating today’s railway is a task of colossal proportions, but

to the Government’s rail Command Paper, the Transport Committee
published its report on Rail 2020 in January this year. As I said
earlier, we have welcomed that report and the Select Committee’s
support for our strategy, which is focused on making the existing
structures and responsibilities in rail work better. We are not

and disruption that that would be likely to

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T18:54:24"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

will be during the summer. Passengers will continue to be able to get
help and advice from a member of staff about buying a ticket when they

Glasgow.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070395000129" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/debtext/130703-0003.htm#13070395000129">Crucial
to the debate about rail is the Department’s role in letting and
managing franchises for passenger rail services. This was discussed at
length by several hon. Members during the debate. The
Government’s firm belief is that franchising gives us the best
possible basis for doing what we want to do with rail. The most
liberalised railways in Europe have seen the highest growth in the last
15 years, with the UK and Sweden first and second
respectively.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070395000130" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/debtext/130703-0003.htm#13070395000130">The

sector innovation and experience in our railways. As hon. Members will
be aware, in March we announced a new rail franchising programme,
covering every rail franchise for the next eight years. It builds on
much of the authoritative work undertaken by Richard Brown, as I have
said. Supporting our franchising relaunch, we have now published a new
guide about how franchising competitions are run. This is information
that we want to be generally available and accessible to all. It will
give certainty to the market and to suppliers throughout the industry

contributions in this constructive debate. Underlying all the
contributions was support for the continued expansion of the railway.
Privatisation separated both ownership and operation of train and
track, and it is ironic that the solution being put forward now to deal

listened carefully to the Minister’s reply to the questions I
put, but I have a couple of other points to put to him. In relation to
franchises and securing passengers’ 
<?notus-xml column=1024?>interests, we need to know more about what weighting will be given to
securing those interests when assessing the award of franchises in the
future. I asked the Minister to say what the financial implications
would be of the cumulative 26-year delay in awarding franchises, but I
did not hear a response. I hope that we will be able to get one, as it
has implications for the industry as well as for the Department. I am

important issues and it is essential that they are resolved to enable
the railway to continue to expand and grow. We need proper franchises
that reflect value for money for passengers and the taxpayer, and we

Committee will continue to consider all these issues, which are all
ongoing and extremely important. Strong leadership is required to
resolve them, from both the industry and the Department. The aim of the

can be more efficient and fares can be brought down—at least,
the rate of fare increases can be stopped.</hs_Para>

Docherty</B> (Dunfermline and West Fife) (Lab):</Member> On a point of
order, Mr Speaker. This afternoon we saw bizarre scenes where the
Secretary of State did not have information in front of him about the
future of Territorial Army bases. You will recall that I inquired about
the future of Dunfermline TA, which was listed for closure. The
Secretary of State confirmed that that TA was closing and that they
would have to travel to an adjoining community. I have, late today,
received a letter from
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T19:01:56"></hs_TimeCode> Minister for
the Armed Forces, the right hon. Member for South Leicestershire (Mr
Robathan), saying that what will actually happen is that they will
cross a road. Given that this has caused huge distress today in
Dunfermline, is there anything you can do to encourage the Ministry of
Defence to get its stories accurate and straight, and to encourage
Ministers to come back to the House at the earliest opportunity to
clear up this whole sorry
mess?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070395000149" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/debtext/130703-0004.htm#13070395000149"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Speaker" InTheChair="True" PimsId="3965" UID="13070395000317" xid="43" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/debtext/130703-0004.htm#13070395000317">Mr
Speaker:</Member></B> The responsibility for clarity of statement rests
with every Member of the House. Obviously, where a ministerial
statement is concerned, one would hope that it would be both accurate
and clear. It is not for me to require a Minister to return to the
House on this specific matter. However, the hon. Gentleman,
through his point of order, has drawn attention to the
factual situation, which I rather imagine he will communicate
externally. Whether he wishes to communicate with others,
including those in the Ministry of Defence, in the hope that they will
wish to communicate with organs of journalistic expression I know not,
but the hon. Gentleman is doing his best to advance his
case.</hs_Para>

Docherty:</Member></B> Further to that point of order, Mr
Speaker. You will also recall that the Secretary of State undertook to
write to both you and me about the Kilmarnock confusion today. I have
checked the letter board and my e-mails, and I have had no such
communication. I do not know whether you have received any
communication, but the Scottish media have been briefed on the
situation. I am curious to know whether the Secretary of State bothered
to contact you, as he undertook to do so

Speaker:</Member></B> I have not been contacted by the Secretary of
State in the course of the afternoon. What I would like to say to the
hon. Gentleman is that I stand by the remarks that I made,
and which I think were echoed by others in respect of the handling of
this matter today. It was clearly very unsatisfactory. If the hon.
Gentleman is in his place tomorrow at business questions,
and if his senior and responsible position in the team does not
preclude him from participation in business questions, he may find that
there are words uttered that will assuage even his very considerably
wounded feelings on this matter. I think we will leave it there for
now.</hs_Para>

want to congratulate and thank all the volunteers who work in food
banks, especially in County Durham, many of whom I have known for a
long time and can proudly count among my friends. I wanted to hold this
debate to raise what I believe to be a growing crisis in our
communities. It is a hidden crisis, because the recipients of food
parcels do not, in the main, want to talk about their needs. They are
embarrassed and can be cowed by their experiences—they do not
appear on “The Jeremy Kyle Show”. How can we be surprised
that they feel that way, when their Government refer to them as
shirkers and demonise their predicament, even though almost 20% of
those who use food banks in County Durham are in
work?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070395000168" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/debtext/130703-0004.htm#13070395000168">I
have no doubt that the Minister will say in his response that the
number of people using food banks in 2005-06 stood, according to the
Trussell Trust, at something like 2,800 and rose to 40,000 four years
later. The Minister may well talk about it now, but he did not talk
about it then. I do not know whether he will mention that by 2012-13,
that figure had grown to a staggering 350,000—up from 128,000
the year before. This figure does not include independent food banks,
of which there are a growing number. A report produced for Church
Action on Poverty and Oxfam by Niall Cooper and Sarah Dumpleton is
entitled “Walking the breadline”, and it puts the number
at nearly 500,000.</hs_Para>

Minister may also say that the previous Labour Government refused to
allow Jobcentre Plus to refer people to the local food bank, and that
this Government 
<?notus-xml column=1029?>have reversed that decision. I will say two things on that. First, when
Labour was in power there were only about 50 food banks—50 too
many, in my book—but today there are more than 300, so there
will be a better chance of finding a food bank today than back then,
which is a sad reflection on 21st-century Britain. Secondly, I will
take no lessons from the Conservative party about Labour’s
record on poverty: we introduced the minimum wage and the Conservatives
opposed it; and we introduced tax credits and Sure Start. Those are all
things to be proud of, and they were all opposed by the
Conservatives.</hs_Para>

Government are referring people in need to food banks because there are
more people in need and there are more food banks to refer them to. In
2011, the Trussell Trust had one food bank in the north-east, located
in Durham—in the Labour years there were no food banks in the
north-east of England—and in that year, food was distributed to
741 people. Today, there are 10 major centres in the north-east. In the

would respectfully say to the Minister that, as there are now 500,000
of our fellow citizens using food banks, I believe the time has come to
monitor food bank usage. The increase could be down to supply, but it
is certainly down to demand. Why is it that the three main reasons 
<?notus-xml column=1032?>for people using food banks are delay in benefit receipt, benefit
changes and low incomes? Domestic violence and homelessness are other
reasons for usage. Surely a responsible Government would start revising
their approach to welfare reform by using the data acquired from food
banks to help to close the holes in the welfare safety net that are so
obviously opening

Church Action on Poverty and Oxfam in their report “Walking the

such an inquiry? The report also called for regular publication by the

I hope he will be reassured to know that we do not think that they form
part of the welfare system. We do not measure their use, but we do
“signpost” people to them, just as we might direct people
to any charity that provides help and support. I should add, however,
that we know from the Trussell Trust’s own figures that only 2%
of people say that they were directed to a food bank by Jobcentre
Plus.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070395000203" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/debtext/130703-0004.htm#13070395000203">Under
the current benefits system, it is not obvious to people that working
will make them better off. The problem lies not with claimants, but
with the system. Our reforms will, over time, deliver dynamic benefits
as more people are encouraged to work and to increase their earnings.
As all the evidence shows, work is the best route out of poverty for
individuals and households. Universal credit is a seamless “in
and out of work” benefit which will make it easier for people to
move into work. Because people should know that work pays and earning
more pays more, incentives are built into the system to encourage them
to move from low incomes to higher ones. Over the next few months, we
shall be identifying ways in which we can help people to increase their
earnings and reduce their dependence on the welfare state, thus giving
them more dignity and boosting their self-esteem.</hs_Para>

credit will make 3 million households better off and will lift a
quarter of a million children out of poverty, because we are putting
more money into the system. The hon. Gentleman asked about family
poverty. Statistics relating to households with
below-average incomes show that the number of children in
workless poor families has fallen by 100,000 over the past
year.</hs_Para>

making work pay, however, we must ensure that benefit payments are
directed towards those who need them most, that they provide a fair
deal for the taxpayer, and that they restore fiscal responsibility to
our finances. The reforms that we have introduced are already helping
more people to move into work. In the last year alone, there has been a
6% fall in the number of claimants of jobseeker’s allowance in
County Durham, and the figure for young people is even better:
14% fewer are claiming the allowance.</hs_Para>

programme in County Durham is helping people to find sustained
employment. Of the 12,000 who have joined the programme in County
Durham, 1,200 have secured jobs, and four out of five of those have

support is provided in two forms. The first is settlement grants, where
the applicant must have applied for a budgeting loan or advance from
DWP if they are eligible to do so and have been declined. This aims to
help people to remain in the community or move back into the community
after a period in supported or unsettled accommodation. Awards are only
available for items such as beds, bedding, furniture, white goods and
kitchen equipment. The second is daily living expenses, to help to meet
immediate short-term needs for goods or services that arise because of
a disaster or unforeseen circumstances. Awards are only available for
food, baby consumables, clothing, heating and travel, and for a maximum
of seven days’ support. At a meeting last week County Durham
local authority confirmed it was receiving about 50 to 60 applications
a week, much less than the 250 to 300 per week it had anticipated.

Trussell Trust is making is that the situation is down to benefit
delay, but the point I am making is that we have speeded up the
processing of benefits, so there is a mismatch. There has been an issue
to address in the Sunderland benefits centre, but that has been tackled
in respect of jobseeker’s allowance. In the north-east, the
Sunderland benefits centre is processing claims faster than the
national target, so there is a disconnect at a local level between what
is being said by the Trussell Trust and others, and what the statistics
show. We publish the figures for processing times and for sanctions, so
that hon. Members can see them.</hs_Para>

conclusion, we are seeing a process of benefit reform that is helping
the north-east; it is getting people off benefit and into work. We see
that in the Work programme, in the falling levels of incapacity benefit
claims and in what is happening with JSA claims. We are trying to
tackle a processing backlog in County Durham, but what we are seeing
generally is that we are processing benefits far faster than we were in
April 2010, and Labour Members should welcome that. Our reforms are the
long-term solution to the welfare issue, as they ensure that we give
people the dignity and self-esteem that comes from being in
employment.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13070395000266" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/debtext/130703-0004.htm#13070395000266">7.36

the proposed route. The effect on the midlands, coming on top of the
toll road and the extension to the A5, is damage to much ancient
woodland. The Government must recognise
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070358000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/halltext/130703h0001.htm#13070358000032"><B><Member ContinuationText="Michael Fabricant" PimsId="3173" UID="13070358000225" xid="194" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/halltext/130703h0001.htm#13070358000225">Michael

May, I tabled a question asking my right hon. Friend the Secretary of
State for his own assessment of the impact of the proposed HS2 route on
ancient woodland. The response that I received in the <I>Official
</I><I>Report</I> on  6 June at column 1224W seemed, sadly, to
indicate a belief in Government that such destruction is a price worth
paying. It also noted that certain mitigation measures were being
proposed, including the construction of a tunnel to avoid one ancient
wood and movement of a line to minimise land take within another. That
is simply not good enough. When we consider the vast sums of public
money being committed we realise that the damage is inordinately large.
As a minimum, mitigation should be proportionate and applied
comprehensively for any ancient woodland lost or damaged as a result of
the project. That should be based on the Lawton principles on habitat
networks and landscape scale impact already enshrined in the
Government’s widely welcomed natural environment White Paper of
2011. If, as it is claimed, HS2 is meant to be a world-class transport
project, it should demonstrate world-class practice when it comes to
the avoidance of damage and the showcasing of the very best practice in
mitigation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T09:43:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070358000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/halltext/130703h0001.htm#13070358000034">Further

the route is an attempt to do that, but of course in southern
Staffordshire it is not possible, because of the need to link to the

transported into a greenwood and back in time. It is one of the most
beautiful woods that can be imagined, with dips and cherry trees that
have been there for years. There are birds, insects and flowers, and I
just missed the best season, because the wood had bluebells before I

my constituency to reinstate habitat continuity in the area. However,
ancient woodland at Sibley’s coppice would be destroyed to
create that cut-and-cover green tunnel, and the avoidance of ecological
impact is almost impossible. Strip planting schemes are proposed that
purport to replace the loss of our ancient woodland, but the habitats
of certain animals and organisms cannot be joined up across a road.

accuracy; I can answer only from my own experience. In Mantle’s
wood, for example, we have the most magnificent cherry trees, which are
native to the Chilterns. One can see that they have been there for
years by the huge size of their trunks, their shininess and the rings
on their bark. They are absolutely magnificent. It is a mixed wood;
there are even oaks and beeches growing there. In the Chilterns and our
area of outstanding natural beauty, we were famous for making beechwood
furniture. I imagine that there will be some commonality across the
country, but each wood is bound to have a unique and different nature,

ecosystems have evolved in such a way that any replacement with new

A Brett tunnel plan, with a gap at Durham farm for engineering and
environmental reasons, is being proposed on behalf of Conserve the
Chilterns and Countryside and the Chiltern Ridges HS2 Action Group. It
would protect all the ancient woodland in the Chilterns for future
generations to enjoy. I want him to assure me today that he will
examine the proposal seriously and not rule it out on grounds of cost,
because the cost to our environment will be even greater. I want the
Government to ensure that that is covered by the final environmental
statement, when that is deposited along with the hybrid Bill. That is
in the Minister’s gift, because the current consultation on the
draft environmental statement is being carried out by HS2 Ltd, so it is
not a statutory consultation, but a gratuitous one—perhaps that
is why the document is so poor. The real environmental statement must
be produced by the Department for Transport and it must be deposited
with the hybrid Bill. I understand that it will run to at least 50,000
pages, but I want an undertaking from the Minister today that it will
run to 50,001 and include the full tunnelling option that would protect
the

HS2 goes ahead, and goes ahead on a straight line, without the route
being varied and without greater tunnelling, I ask the Minister to look
at the mitigation ratios that I was discussing earlier, because 2:1 is
not enough; 30:1 is more like it. What is more, I want the finance for
that to be protected—I am not stupid. The project has already
gone up in cost by £10 billion and has one of the largest
contingency funds in living memory. The costing has been got wrong at
almost every turn, and at every stage, by clever consultants, by the
Department and by HS2 Ltd. Mistakes have been made in calculating the
spoil coming out of tunnels and in the business case. Dare I say it,
mistakes might even have been made in calculating the traffic on the
west coast main line. When money is squeezed, the first thing to go is
promises to protect the environment. That is all too
easy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T10:15:39"></hs_TimeCode>, and I have
seen that process happen along the London underground line in my
constituency. Trees and foliage were cleared to keep the line safe; on
one side they were replaced by soil full of local flora and fauna, but
the money ran out, so a spray thing was used for the other side
instead. Anyone walking along the line can see the meadows and the
wildlife coming back on one side along that Chiltern railway line,
which is so beautiful, while on the other side, where the cheaper
material has been used, it is like a desert. I have written to London
Underground asking it to ensure that it continues the
planting<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T10:16:31"></hs_TimeCode>. I
therefore have practical experience of the fact that when the

new line can help the UK to meet its 2050 carbon reduction targets
under the Climate Change Act 2008 by attracting new passengers to the
railways and by providing the additional capacity that freight and

tackling carbon emissions would want to see that success continue.
Without additional capacity, however, the risk is that freight
operators will have to be turned away in future.

woodland could be transplanted to an adjacent site, a process known as
translocation. We must be clear that ancient woodland cannot be moved,
but some animal species and soil can be moved or translocated, although
the consequences of moving soil from ancient woodland are, sadly,
poorly understood. Any trees that are moved will be coppiced, radically
altering their appearance and risking the death of individual trees
during the moving process. Although some constituent parts of the
woodland may be salvaged, the original biodiversity cannot be recreated
and is lost for ever. Natural England has said that translocation
might, if carried out as a last resort when loss of the original
habitat is completely unavoidable, form part of a package of
compensation measures. In other words, translocation may have a part to
play, but we must be honest about its
limitations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070358000101" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/halltext/130703h0001.htm#13070358000101">The

the Government will be able to set limits of deviation restricting the
extent to which alterations may be made during that process. We ask for
careful thought to be given to how ancient woodland might be affected

air quality also threaten woodland. The line can bring real
environmental benefits, but only if other policy decisions are taken,

exactly the sort of issue that could be addressed in the long-awaited

conclude, we have lost half our ancient woodland since the 1930s,

regret, and both the Government and HS2 Ltd must present an absolutely
watertight case when they propose the disruption or destruction of
ancient woodland sites. I promise hon. Members and the wider public

I believe HS2 to be in the national interest, we know that it is sadly
not possible to build a railway without any effect on the environment.
When designing the route, we must carefully weigh important
considerations 
<?notus-xml column=257?>such as wildlife habitats against other concerns, such as protecting as
many people’s homes as possible. We must ensure that any
environmental effects are reduced as far as possible and also look for
opportunities to benefit the environment along the way.</hs_Para>

the environmental effects of the project. In February 2011, we
consulted on the appraisal of sustainability. As hon. Members said, we
are now consulting on a more detailed draft environmental statement.
That is an unprecedented level of consultation to ensure that we do the
right thing by the environment.</hs_Para>

I said, in September last year, I made a private visit—driving
from the M25 up to Warwickshire—to see exactly what the impact
of the line of route would be on not only the environment, including
woodlands and water, but some of the communities, villages and houses
near the route. It was extremely important that I could visualise that

struck me was that all too often, when the Government or some other
organisation produces a recommendation, that is their view of what
should happen. More often than not, when people come up with
improvements, fine tuning, or even criticism to it, those who have
drawn up the proposal feel threatened, dig their heels in, and take an
attitude that what they want is right and what anyone else wants to
change, modify or reject is wrong. Hard and fast positions are taken,
so no one is prepared to budge. Going along that line of route, I was
impressed by proposals that had come in to fine tune or change the line
of route slightly, or associated proposals, and the way in which HS2
Ltd has been prepared to work with groups and local communities to make
improvements. We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T10:36:27"></hs_TimeCode>
have not had the unfortunate situation that happens all too often

is fair to say that a number of changes—and, to my mind,
improvements—have been made to alleviate problems for not only
the environment, but individuals, their communities and their
properties. However, I also accept that one will never be 100% able to
meet the wishes and requests of people who want changes, because it is
just not possible to do so, given the project’s sheer scale. One
has to reach a judgment on what is in the national interest and what
must go forward, because it is in the national interest, while at the

some of the meetings that have taken place in her constituency, and I

address the concerns of several of her constituents, because we believe
that it is important that there is a proper dialogue between
communities and HS2 Ltd, and that people work together. Even if people
do not necessarily agree with the project, that is the important thing.

repeatedly refused to do so. May I ask him one more time? He
appreciates the complexity of these matters and the imperfect nature of
the document. Given their resources, many people are struggling to
respond to a project of this nature—the environmental
organisations are stretched to the limit. Will he please once more see
whether he can extend the consultation period by four weeks? That would
be the right thing to do, because many of our conservation
organisations are stretched to the limit by this project and they need
to put proper responses into ensuring that our environment is
protected. He is causing damage by not extending the consultation

respond to her important point about the Brett tunnel option. She asked
whether we will reconsider whether the tunnel could be extended beyond
where it is proposed to end. HS2 Ltd has looked at the matter again and
found that an extension will not offer more benefits than the current
option, not least because 
<?notus-xml column=262?>to extend the tunnel beyond the wood, we would need a ventilation tunnel
in the middle of the wood, given the safety requirements for tunnels of
certain lengths, and I believe that that would be far more
environmentally damaging than the current proposals.</hs_Para>

now come to the specific points raised by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T10:55:14"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Lichfield at the end of his speech. He asked whether my
Department will look further at how the loss of ancient woodland can be
minimised. The answer is emphatically yes. HS2 Ltd is constantly
looking at the route and refining the mitigation that can be applied,
and that will continue up until the hybrid Bill process. He asked what
assessment has been made of how many hectares of ancient woodland will
be lost. HS2 Ltd’s proposals, as they stand, identify fewer than
36 hectares of ancient woodland lost for phase 1, including the land
needed for the construction phases of the route. That will be confirmed
in the environmental statement that comes before Parliament later this
year. It is too early in the design of phase 2 to give accurate figures
on the potential loss, but 17 ancient woodland sites are directly
affected by it. For some of those sites, the impact is at or near the
margins of the wood, and there is scope for reducing the impact as the
design progresses. I hope he is reassured on that.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend also asked how much of the total cost of HS2 will be spent
on avoiding the loss of woodland and creating new woodland as part of
the mitigation process. I hope that he will be pleased to learn that
the rough estimate—he will understand why there is only a rough
estimate at this stage—is between £10 million and
£20 million. We have not finalised the ancient woodland

environmental organisations more fully. I assure him that DEFRA,
Natural England and the Environment Agency are fully engaged in phase 1

communities will have in any mitigation planning. HS2 Ltd engages with
local authorities through the planning forum and local people are
engaged through the community forums and the current round of
consultations. Their views will continue to be considered throughout
the development of the designs for HS2. I reiterate that it is
important that people respond to the consultations and engage fully in

unsustainable figure, but perhaps what concerns me most is the fact
that more than 16,000 of the proposed homes are to be placed on more
than 1,400 acres of York’s green belt. In trying to fulfil what
can only be described as over-inflated targets, the council not only
proposes radically to alter the make-up of a number of communities in
my constituency by extending them dramatically but to develop two
entirely new towns on York’s already deeply congested road
network—the Minister has witnessed that congestion at first
hand.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070358000160" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/halltext/130703h0001.htm#13070358000160">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T11:05:05"></hs_TimeCode>
one of the proposed towns, which is known as Winthorpe in the draft
local plan, more than 5,500 new homes have been proposed on nearly 500
acres of prime agricultural land. Although it is not a conservation
zone per se, the land is home to an array of important wildlife,
including protected water voles. In addition, the council has proposed
a 4,000-home town on more than 300 acres to the north of the city,
again on high-grade food-producing land. Sadly, however, that has not
fulfilled the council’s hungry appetite for devouring green-belt
land, and in many areas of my constituency it has sectioned off
hundreds more acres, which are deceptively termed “safeguarded
land”. At first glance, one might think that the land was
safeguarded from development, but sadly it is safeguarded for future
development, in the longer term. The terminology in the NPPF regarding
safeguarded land is, sadly, causing confusion, and could be used by
local authorities such as City of York council to brush proposals under

public, including in any so-called public

total, the land safeguarded for future development in York—land
taken out of the green belt—stands at just short of 1,000 acres,
which means that the full development burden on York’s green
belt from the draft local plan amounts to well over 2,000 acres, as I
have mentioned. Sadly, that is not all that City of York council has
proposed for the green belt. Adding insult to injury for all those who
care passionately about protecting York’s picturesque rural
setting, the council had proposed 40 potential sites for wind farms,
encircling the city. York is evidently the first local authority to go
down that route in its local plan, and one has to wonder why, because
if the plan is realised it will be hugely damaging for York and for
those who live in and around the city. In essence, the wind farms could
change the character and setting of the city beyond all recognition.
The proposals could also have a sustained negative impact on the local
tourism industry, with York’s standing as a beautiful, cultural
and historic holiday destination sadly
diminishing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070358000162" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/halltext/130703h0001.htm#13070358000162">Perhaps
what has caused most controversy in my constituency are the proposals

me, they are astonished by the locations put forward, all of which are
on green-belt land. That is against Government guidance, in which
Traveller sites 
<?notus-xml column=266?>on green-belt land are deemed inappropriate developments. In the
award-winning village of Dunnington, where a 15-pitch Traveller site

such a site on the green gateway into the village will, without a

village. If the council gets its way, Knapton will become home to 20
travelling showpeople families. The guidance states that each
showpeople pitch must be 0.25 sq km, which would mean that Knapton

important brownfield sites, yet—this is where we part

significantly increased the housing burden on the green belt, but what
really worries me is that it also

NPPF states that local plans should be “aspirational but
realistic”. The council’s draft local plan fulfils the

base what I describe as its over-ambitious housing targets on
completely unrealistic job growth forecasts that suggest that York will
create close to 1,000 jobs a year for the next 15 to 20 years. I am
optimistic about York’s economic prospects, and I work closely
with my hon. Friend on delivering that, but the figures suggested by
the council are off the mark. The York job market has contracted over
the past eight years, which calls into question the way in which the
council has linked job growth to housing need. That must be closely
examined.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070358000170" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/halltext/130703h0001.htm#13070358000170">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T11:14:42"></hs_TimeCode>

small historic city, in which local infrastructure is under strain. To

any one site, York will be surrounded by construction sites for years

the while, the council has no guarantee that it will secure the
necessary investment in our infrastructure. Its policy very much puts

reduce the figures in the local plan to a more sustainable and

faces the future of the human race. The importance of productive
agricultural land in helping to secure food supply is rightly
recognised in the NPPF. In York’s green belt, 30% of the land is
grade 1 or grade 2, and it is some of the best and most versatile land.

environmentally sensitive farming. York’s environment is
certainly worth protecting, with 3% of the green belt registered as

me start by clarifying green belt policy in the national planning

the policies in the regional strategy for Yorkshire and Humberside to
ensure that protection for the green

that there is now a local plan process under way in York—it is

looking more closely at applications for Traveller sites in the green

than we have in the past, because we are concerned about the balance of
policy, as set out in the NPPF. We recognise that there is a need to
provide sites for Travellers, as there is a need to provide housing for
all members of the community, but it must be properly balanced against
the protections for the green belt. We do have a concern that, in

In the past few days, the coalition has announced its intention to
crack down on payday lenders. I am pleased that it is credit unions

communities are coming together to preserve stores that offer valuable
services to a town or village, such as a local bakery. Food stores that
can no longer cope with high rents or costs and therefore have to leave
the local high street are being replaced not by new commercial
businesses buying vacant units on the high street, but by local people
who know at first hand how valuable local stores are to the communities
in which they live. Some 6% of commercial village shops are being taken
on by groups of residents who are determined to ensure that shop
closures do not leave a gap in their community. These stores
are not only having an effect on local life, but making a significant
contribution to the UK

Co-operative Group has a work force of almost 100,000 people, which
makes it one of the largest private employers in the UK. In 2012,
community shops had a combined turnover of £49 million and more

enterprise. The Plunkett Foundation reports that there are more

there are helping national charities. Such

it says to me that they can fill the gap. Quite simply, people have to
trust something, and if they do not trust businesses, banks or
whatever, they can trust local co-operative organisations. In society,
even outside co-operatives, it is important that people have trust,
because without trust, people cannot believe in anything, and that
brings about anarchy. However, if trust is still there for co-ops, it
shows that they can fill the void so, quite simply, we have an

investing in infrastructure is the way to stimulate and grow the

the Government are building new homes, it means that people are in work
and that building firms can bid for contracts, and it also helps to
bridge the gap that is starting to develop between supply and demand. I

I grew up in the south Wales valleys, we lived on an L-shaped street.
On Monday nights we would see a white car come over the top—an
XR3i, for hon. Members who remember those souped-up cars. I
can remember a woman getting out of the car, and all the doors were
slammed shut. All the kids were pulled in from the street. It was the
woman from the Provident. My mother claimed that she smelled of cheap
Estée Lauder perfume. I do not know what Estée Lauder
smells like, but my mother said it was cheap. That woman would knock on
someone’s door and shout, “You owe me
£400”. That was wrong, but everybody in our street
thought that person owed £400. “I’ll get you next
week, love”, she used to
say.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T14:45:02"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070370000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/halltext/130703h0001.htm#13070370000036">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T14:45:49"></hs_TimeCode>

on one key benefit of co-operatives, which is their values. He also
reminds me of my own childhood. I remember that Sid, who ran the Co-op
at the bottom of the road ran a book based on trust. Every so often, my
dad would settle up. Occasionally, we hid in the kitchen from Tommy the
milkman, because mum had not got enough money to pay him that week. In
the end the accounts were settled, because the Co-op was part of our
community and there was a relationship of trust between
us<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T14:46:03"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T14:46:04"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T14:46:04"></hs_TimeCode>.

communities, including mine, and those in my hon. Friend’s
constituency. When we grew up in those communities, there was a level
of trust. We trusted one another. We knew one another and we grew up in
communities where we knew everybody. It sounds romantic to say it now,
but we did know our next-door neighbour. I knew everybody in the street

important thing is that the co-operatives brought about trust and a
sense of values and ethics, which we do not see in society very often.
That is why it is important for people to support their local
co-operative, such as the one run by Sid at the end of the street, who
had a savings club for Christmas. My hon. Friend says that his family

Co-operative bank—along with other mutuals—is the only
bank that did not take a bail-out from the Government. If we have
learned anything from the financial crash of 2008, it is that the
language we use can have a serious effect on consumer confidence. I do
not think any of us will forget the queues outside Northern Rock on
that Saturday, which all came from a few misjudged words. The

have spoken previously about expanding the role of 
<?notus-xml column=278?>credit unions, which do not have to lend solely to individuals; they can

when they were bailed out, but the mutual sector did not use any money

years, yet it lasted only 10 years as a bank. I hope that the Minister

co-operative economy is the eighth largest globally. We are clearly
doing something right, but with more than 1 million co-operatives in

more. There is growing consensus on the factors that serve business
excellence—a clear mission, better customer service and, above

has a variety of Co-operative Group stores, travel agents and banks, as
would be expected, but it also has a number of smaller co-operatives
that have an impact on the economy and the community. I particularly
want to mention Sunshine Care. Local authority care workers, all women,
came out of the local council in 2009 and came together to establish a
home care co-operative. I have met those ladies over the years from
before they started to where they are now, three or four years later.
They have been through some really tough times and challenges in
establishing their co-operative.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T14:59:40"></hs_TimeCode> spoke to one
of the founding members, Christine Bailey, just before this debate, and
I asked her how the co-operative is progressing. It now has 34 staff,
which is fantastic, and it provides 600 care hours a week to
older people. Ideally, older people would want services delivered by
people coming into their home to be delivered by a mutual—by
those women who have come together to develop this fantastic
co-operative.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070370000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/halltext/130703h0001.htm#13070370000058">Sunshine
Care is<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T14:57:39"></hs_TimeCode> great.
As Christine says, there are no directors creaming money off the top of
the organisation, so everything the organisation earns goes right back
to the workers, who each have a stake—they get voting rights
after working for the organisation for six months. Sunshine Care is
also a Cabinet Office pathfinder, and the ladies who work for it are

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T14:59:02"></hs_TimeCode> Minister for
the Cabinet Office, the right hon. Member for Horsham (Mr Maude) gave
evidence to the Committee. Although I got a good sense that the

the economy, I am a bit concerned about the Government’s
response to some of the Committee’s recommendations. There are
opportunities for the Cabinet Office, the Department for Communities

promoting

hon. Friend the Member for Islwyn (Chris Evans) for securing this
important debate. In his speech, he not only highlighted some of the
best practice in co-operatives but made a strong argument about how
many current public policy problems in this country could be addressed
by taking a more co-operative approach. In particular, I thank him for
mentioning co-op housing and my Co-operative Housing Tenure Bill, which
I believe has huge potential to address some of the housing challenges

great pride that I sit in Parliament as a Labour and Co-operative MP. I
am fortunate to represent a constituency steeped in the co-operative
tradition. The first co-operative store in my constituency was opened
in Mossley in 1856, and to this day there is a Co-op store on the same
site. The co-op movement was active in parts of my area well before the
Labour party even existed, and my constituency, of course, is only a
stone’s throw away from the co-operative movement’s
spiritual home in Rochdale. It would be wrong to claim that the values
championed by the co-op movement—democracy, openness, trust and
social responsibility—are characteristic only of areas such as
mine or south Wales, because the modern co-op movement is
nationwide, but it is not mere coincidence that we started
it.</hs_Para>

things not just as an amusing historical preamble to my speech, but
because it is extremely important, particularly for those of us on this
side of the political divide, to remember and stay true to the
political tradition that the co-operative movement represents. For many
reasons, not least the success of the 1945 Labour Government in
creating national institutions such as the NHS, which celebrates its
65th birthday this week, the Labour party in modern times has
prioritised a statist, top-down view of politics, but we should never
forget to combine that with the earlier tradition of bottom-up,
grassroots and community
campaigning.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070370000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/halltext/130703h0001.htm#13070370000066">It
is interesting that in recent years, through the work of the
co-operative movement and through things such as community organising
and living wage campaigns, we have begun to get back in touch with that
tradition, which is good. We should recognise that at times, domination
by the state can be as detrimental as domination by the market. The
co-operative movement is a fine example of something that has always
been balanced between the two.</hs_Para>

obviously still in a difficult economic situation, facilitated by the
failure of the Government’s plans to get things going at any
level. I am of the firm belief that co-operatives are vital to the
economy of this country, not just for their economic value but for
their social benefits. More than 15 million people in the
UK—nearly a quarter of the population—are members of a
co-operative. That is no small number. It is a sign to all of us that
there is more to be explored in co-operatives and the value that they
can
bring.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070370000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/halltext/130703h0001.htm#13070370000068">I
want to discuss how co-ops can have a positive impact on our economy
and the social fabric of our communities. It is timely that in a week
when the Government have organised a summit with the heads of payday

value of credit unions, which offer a brilliant example of how
co-operative values can have a positive effect on local
economies.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070370000069" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/halltext/130703h0001.htm#13070370000069">More
than 1 million people in the UK use credit unions. Research
by Salford university on behalf of Leeds city council found that for
every £1 the council invested in credit unions, there was a
£10 benefit in retained income for the local economy. Manchester
credit union, which serves people in my constituency, can trace part of
its roots to the Hattersley area, which I represent. Today it has more
than 10,000 members lending out more than £4 million a year. In
a few weeks, Cash Box, a local credit union in Hyde, will open its

credit unions account for only a small proportion of the total consumer
lending market. Given that their average annual percentage rate is

that the Government have relaxed the rules on how credit unions can
operate, allowing them to reach out to more of the community, but to
echo the point made previously, I regret the Government’s
refusal to accept the Co-operative party’s amendments to the
Financial Services Bill, which would have helped promote mutuals and
create a more competitive financial services industry. In a climate

second point involves the relatively new idea of co-operative councils
and how they may be able to offer a new, innovative way of procuring
local services to meet the needs of local communities in difficult
financial circumstances. I read the Select Committee on Communities and
Local Government report from 2012, “Mutual and Co-operative
Approaches to Delivering Local Services”, particularly the
evidence given by Lord Glasman, who said that giving users a stake in
public services ensures that they feel that they are at the heart of
local government, and that making people feel involved strengthens
their relationship with their local economy.</hs_Para>

and mutual models help councils facilitate long-term jobs and
investment and help ensure that long-term social benefit is prioritised

councils that have signed up to the co-operative council network
already pay their staff a living wage, which is clearly of huge benefit
to local economies.</hs_Para>

a recent Co-ops UK report shows that the co-operative movement in this
country is still growing, we would all say that the Government could do
more to encourage that development. The Government talk a good game on
mutuals, but in reality, many of their proposals for public services
are joint venture spin-offs with private partners. Those may have
merit, but they should not use the language and clothes of the
co-operative movement unless that is truly what they are. The example
often given is the behavioural unit in the Cabinet Office known as the
nudge unit. It is often cited as a flagship Government mutual, but most
of us, as well as most people in Co-ops UK and the Co-operative party,
would barely consider it a mutual at
all.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070370000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/halltext/130703h0002.htm#13070370000079">As

unions that lend to families to the running of core services and bigger
ideas such as co-operative housing, which has been mentioned. The
positive economic and social impact of co-ops should be celebrated,

ensure that we never again get ourselves into the situation that we got

my hon. Friend rightly highlighted what
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T15:09:50"></hs_TimeCode> Secretary of
State for Energy and Climate Change said about the need for a
co-operative energy revolution. It was a cause of some frustration
during consideration of the Energy Bill that we were unable to convince
him to turn his words into action on a community energy strategy and
regarding the threshold for the feed-in tariff for community energy
projects. My hon. Friend talked about the extent to which people have
an interest in energy, and feel a sense of ownership towards it, as a
result of community energy projects. There are a number of such
projects across the country, but most are relatively small, and if we
are to develop them further, we need to change the threshold.</hs_Para>

the Secretary of State was asked about that during the Bill’s
pre-legislative scrutiny, he said, “There aren’t any
community energy projects above 5 MW.” Well, that is because
that is the threshold, so his argument is self-defeating.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T15:10:58"></hs_TimeCode>Earlier in the
debate, I was looking at the amendments that the Government have tabled
to the Energy Bill in the House of Lords—obviously, I was
listening intently to what everybody was saying, but I was
multitasking—and I am pleased to say that there is one that will
increase the threshold for community energy projects from 5 MW to 10
MW. Those of us who sought to persuade them can reflect on the fact
that our argument was well made and will have an impact, unless the
Government decide to vote against their own amendment. The change will
be a significant step towards helping to meet the challenge that was
rightly identified earlier in the debate.</hs_Para>

also want to touch briefly on housing and housing co-operatives. I am
pleased and proud to have the West Whitlawburn housing co-operative in
my constituency. Obviously the Minister is familiar with Rochdale, but
I would not necessarily expect him to be familiar with parts of
Cambuslang, in my constituency. On all the neighbourhood statistics
available, Whitlawburn is among the most economically deprived
neighbourhoods in Scotland. Figures on health conditions, educational
attainment, employment and income are collected slightly differently in
England—and, I presume, in Wales—but Whitlawburn would
probably also come pretty high up any list measuring those things
across the UK.</hs_Para>

years ago, the West Whitlawburn bit of the housing estate in
Whitlawburn became a co-operative, and there is a striking contrast
between the standard of the housing in that co-operative, given the
capital and energy-efficiency improvements that have been made, and the
standard of the other housing, which is literally across the road. That
is partly because of the real impetus that has come from those who came
together to form the co-operative, which is about not only the
mechanisms involved in driving investment but, just as importantly, the
attitude and ethos that have become apparent. Just last week, along
with a colleague from 
<?notus-xml column=284?>the Scottish Parliament, the local MSP James
Kelly, I was pleased to be able to talk to the members of the
very engaged management committee, who are all tenants and members of
the co-operative. They take their work very seriously, and their
attitude is all about what they can do to improve housing in their
co-operative and to maintain that improvement, as opposed to expecting
somebody else to do things for them. That makes an important point
about the ethos of co-operatives.</hs_Para>

area is relatively small, however, and the co-operative is not immune
from the impact of Government policies. The bedroom tax or the spare
room subsidy—whatever label the Minister uses—is having a
considerable impact in West Whitlawburn, where 67% of tenants are on
housing benefit. The housing association has found—it has been
able to do so because it is relatively small— that 30%
of its tenants, or 200 people, are affected by that measure. Its
housing stock consists mostly of accommodation with two or three
bedrooms, and there is a problem of people needing to move from three
bedrooms to two, or from two bedrooms to one. People of pensionable age
are not impacted, however, so we have the bizarre situation of the
housing association almost considering seeing whether people who are in
receipt of state pension and live in one or two-bedroom accommodation
will swap with working-age tenants living three or two-bedroom
accommodation. The policy will have a significant impact on the housing
co-operative as a result of rent arrears. The co-operative does not
want to evict its members—nobody wants that—but the
financial effects of the policy could have a significant impact on what
it is trying to do.</hs_Para>

third issue I want to touch on is football supporters’ trusts,
which are an important form of mutual activity. People will be aware
that the trusts were born out of the co-operative movement with the
support of Supporters Direct. There are now several supporters’
trusts throughout the country, and there are good examples of trusts
that are completely or partly in control of running clubs in Wimbledon,
Portsmouth, Swansea and Manchester. In other cases, football
supporters’ trusts are trying to take a role in running clubs,
including Heart of Midlothian in Scotland. In every case,
supporters’ trusts have tried to take a role in the ownership
and running of clubs when those clubs have been in crisis and everyone
else has walked away.</hs_Para>

want to draw the Minister’s attention
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T15:16:16"></hs_TimeCode>to the example
of the trust in Swansea, given its economic impact. Swansea was
basically a bankrupt club, and it was sold on for £1. The
supporters’ trust was formed and took a role in the
club’s ownership, and it has been an integral part of the club
since then. Over a couple of seasons, the club has gone from 90th out
of 92 in the league to being an established premiership club. It has
won the league cup, and it will be playing in Europe next season. All
that involved a role for supporter ownership and supporter control,
which is a form of
co-op<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T15:16:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070370000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/halltext/130703h0002.htm#13070370000089">There
have been many debates about football governance—I have spoken
in most of them—so I do not want to repeat any points about
that, but I do want to talk about clubs’ economic impact.
Football clubs have a significant local economic impact—directly
and indirectly. When Hull was first promoted to the premiership, people
there would have talked about the impact on the city of visiting
supporters and the attention that comes with having a top-level club.
The same happened when 
<?notus-xml column=285?>Blackpool was in the premiership, and the same has happened with
Swansea. However, when clubs are driven and run by people who are
involved in the local community, they are more inclined to ensure that
some of their spending power and economic activity benefits that
community. Trusts reinforce local economic activity, so they should be
encouraged, treasured and nurtured.</hs_Para>

this is not part of the Economic Secretary’s brief, he will know

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T15:17:57"></hs_TimeCode> Minister for
Sport, the right hon. Member for Faversham and Mid Kent (Hugh
Robertson), has mentioned that commitment a number of times, and he has
tried to persuade football authorities to act on it, although I think
we are getting towards the end of that road, given the intransigence of
the authorities. If the coalition wants that commitment to come to
fruition, it might have to take action by forcing the football
authorities to do what they seem not to want to do. The coalition
should encourage fan involvement for the good reason that it will not
only sustain football clubs, but encourage the economic activity that
happens when trusts are involved in the management structure, as we can
see from the examples I cited. I hope that the Economic Secretary will

Members have made many claims regarding the strong co-operative
traditions of their constituencies, and I do not dispute the fact that
Rochdale is the home of the co-operative movement. I can say, however,
that my constituency, with its previous boundaries—you, Mr
Hollobone, will understand this, because the Kettering and Corby
constituencies were combined at that time—elected the first ever
Co-operative MP. Alf Waterson was elected in 1918. Samuel Perry, the
father of the tennis legend Fred Perry, was subsequently elected to be
the Co-operative MP several times. Samuel Perry was a key mover in
joining the forces of the Labour and co-operative movements around the
UK<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T15:20:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070370000095" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/halltext/130703h0002.htm#13070370000095">The
driving forces behind the radicalism of people in my constituency, in
electing the first Co-operative MP, were the chapels, the boot and shoe
workers and, in particular, the blast furnace men’s union at
Corby, which adopted Alf Waterson as its candidate. The political
movement was connected to an economic movement at the time, as ordinary
working people in Northamptonshire came together through co-operatives
to try to make a better life for themselves. Their values still hold
true today in the co-operative movement—values of self-help,
self-responsibility, democracy, equality, equity and
solidarity.</hs_Para>

interest on that account, and as a Labour and Co-operative

guidelines by which all co-operatives today put their values into
practice. Those seven principles are voluntary and open membership;
democratic member control; member economic participation, empowering
those members; autonomy and independence; education, training and

are many benefits to the way in which co-operatives put their values
into practice today, in addition to what we might see as core economic
benefits. There are thousands of community initiatives around the
country, including some in my area. The co-operative movement in the UK
has been a leading force for sustainability. There is a significant
focus in the Co-operative retail group at the moment on reducing waste.
The movement has been a leading force in promoting fair trade in
Britain, and I am pleased to say that fair trade sales in
co-operatives are rising year on year. Indeed, the Co-operative helps
us to celebrate Fairtrade fortnight across the
UK<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T15:22:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070370000098" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/halltext/130703h0002.htm#13070370000098">The
co-operative movement has championed staff volunteering. Co-operatives
UK, which is one part of the movement in the UK, estimates that the
staff time it donates each year is worth about £1.7 million.
There are programmes such as the Skills4Schools campaign, which helps
to promote numeracy in primary schools and financial literacy in
secondary schools. The initiative Farm to Work has led to thousands of
primary schoolchildren visiting co-operatives at working farms. There
are many ways in which the values of education, training and
information are still at the heart of the co-operative movement.
Co-operatives are engaged in the education system not only through
Skills4Schools but in many other ways. I am pleased with the increase
in the number of schools opting to become co-operative trust schools
and co-operative
academies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T15:23:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070370000099" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/halltext/130703h0002.htm#13070370000099">Today’s
focus is, rightly, as we seek to get the economy growing again, on the
economic benefits of co-operatives. The number of entrepreneurs,
employers and communities in the UK that own and control their
businesses through co-operative enterprise has reached an all-time
high, with a record 15.4 million membership of co-operatives. That is
an increase of 36% since 2008 and 13.6% in the past year. The number of
co-operative businesses in the UK has also risen by 28% since
2008 or the onset of the recession. The recent report published by
Co-operatives UK, entitled “Homegrown: The Co-operative Economy
2013”, shows that co-operatives have a £37 billion
turnover in the UK economy.</hs_Para>

might wonder why co-operatives have grown, at a time when
little seems to be growing in this country. I think that it is because
of the tough economic trading conditions, which have encouraged more
and more Britons to turn to co-operatives to take greater control of
their destinies and grow their own way out of recession. The
Co-operatives UK report highlights the fact that co-operative shops had
a combined turnover of £50 million in 2012, with more
than 50,000 members. Those who have chosen the co-operative option, who
are growing their own co-operative enterprises, include entrepreneurs, 
<?notus-xml column=287?>employers who share ownership of their firms, communities, customers and
even sports fans, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T15:25:09"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Rutherglen and Hamilton West (Tom Greatrex) highlighted,
who want to own and run their clubs. The growing appeal of sharing
ownership, profits and control in line with the traditional
values—democratic member control, voluntary and open membership,
and autonomy and independence—has, in a diverse co-operative
economy, brought about community pubs, foster care and child care
providers, and multi-million pound co-operatives such as Co-operative
Energy. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T15:25:43"></hs_TimeCode>In the
energy setting, in addition to Co-operative Energy, we want many more
mutual, local community co-operatives. That is why I support the strong
points that my hon. Friends have made about amendments to the Energy
Bill. I hope that the Government will now see sense on that matter,

a proportion of their money locally. The estimates, using the
benchmarks that are accepted around the world for examining the value
of business in local economies, are that co-operatives generate an
additional £40 for the local economy for every £100 spent
by a customer. Overall, that means that co-operatives, rather than
generating profits for outside investors or national or even global
suppliers, generate £100 million for local

offer real potential to capture land values—for example,

something we ought to look at. Using the mutual models, benefits such

purchasing their own home. In particular, under flexible models of
share ownership, people can buy equity shares in the overall housing

that happens over the time that they are in the housing. That is much

important for us in the co-op movement—those of us who have

seems that the debate requires us to put on record the co-operative
history of our constituencies. I am afraid that Walthamstow
cannot—unusually—claim to be first in this matter. We can

co-operative values and how they
work<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T15:36:04"></hs_TimeCode>. Why has
the co-op economy grown by nearly 20% in the past five or six
years compared with what we have seen in our national
economy? In Walthamstow, we would argue that it is precisely because of
the mindset that co-operativism brings with it—the idea that we
work for a broader set of values, and that what we do together, through
democratic participation, can reap rewards well beyond mere financial
profits. I am disappointed that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T15:36:33"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Hereford and South Herefordshire (Jesse Norman), the founder of the
Conservative co-op movement, is not present in the Chamber, because we

A fantastic study from Lincoln shows that co-operatives bring about a
multiplier effect that is around six times that of ordinary
organisations in a community, so they bring resources into an area. The
co-op mindset brings unparalleled creativity to thinking, and I urge
the Minister to look at the work of some of our co-op councils. On a
recent visit to Oldham, I was particularly struck by the
council’s work on debt and financial difficulties. The co-op
council negotiated a 30% discount on bus passes for those who joined
the credit union. The scheme has been a fantastic success: the number
of people joining the credit union has increased massively, thus
increasing the amount of money available to lend, while the scheme has
been cost-neutral for the bus company and has helped to get the city
moving, so it is win, win for everyone. Such creative thinking takes
place when our bottom line is the people we serve, meaning that we see
people as part of the co-op, rather than just customers. The danger of
looking only at employee co-ops—the John Lewis model—that
we miss out on the vital impact of working with the users of our
services<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T15:37:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070370000121" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/halltext/130703h0002.htm#13070370000121">I
am also struck by the work that is being done in Lambeth. My community
in Walthamstow has a big problem with gangs, and the work that Lambeth
is doing on youth services and co-ops is fantastic, as is the response
from the local community, so I encourage the Minister to look at that.
I also encourage him to go to see the energy co-op in Brixton. I am
sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Rutherglen and Hamilton West
(Tom Greatrex) was talking about such co-ops earlier, as well as about
the work of Supporters Direct and especially the “Show Wonga the
Red Card” campaign. Whether on housing, social care or energy,
co-op solutions are bringing a new creativity to all our public
services that is benefiting users and reducing
costs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070370000122" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/halltext/130703h0002.htm#13070370000122">We
know that the market alone cannot provide, which is the problem that we
have with payday lenders. As you suggested, Mr Hollobone, I cannot go
through the debate without talking about that problem, because the
market is failing consumers. Co-op solutions are providing the answers
in communities such as Walthamstow, where we have 18 of those lenders
on our high street alone. I encourage the Minister to think again about
his opposition to a cap on the cost of credit, because only when the
cost of credit is capped and we examine how to lend to people
responsibly, as social finance models and credit unions do, will a
difference be
made.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070370000123" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/halltext/130703h0002.htm#13070370000123">We
need co-operative thinking not only in the credit union movement and on
payday lending—we need the cap and an expansion in affordable
credit—but in our 
<?notus-xml column=291?>social care. The Minister should look at Nottingham
Circle’s adult social care or at co-operative schools. When we
work together as a society, and as the co-op movement is ingrained in
us from the grass roots up, we deliver the kind of future in which
everyone can prosper. When we do not work in such ways, we can learn a
lesson from New Harmony, which was the fantastic co-op that was set up
by Robert Owen in America, but that fell apart after 25 years because
although it had the co-operative model, it did not have the co-op

like to respond to the issues raised by hon. Members, and I will try my

many hon. Members will be aware, the Government’s approach to
mutuals was set out in the coalition agreement, where we committed to
“promote mutuals” and “foster diversity” in
the UK economy. That commitment, made in the Government’s
founding document, underscores the importance that we attach to the
sector. I would like to talk this afternoon about the contribution that
the co-operative and mutual sectors make to the economy, and, I hope,
to reassure all hon. Members of our determination to support them in
their efforts.</hs_Para>

however, I turn to the Co-operative Group itself, as raised
by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T15:51:14"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T15:51:15"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Islwyn and other hon. Members. As the hon. Gentleman
will be aware, the Co-op is at the forefront of the mutuals sector,
with more than 4,800 retail trading outlets and an annual turnover of
more than £13 billion. Clearly, the Co-operative 
<?notus-xml column=294?>bank is an important part of the Co-operative Group.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T15:51:36"></hs_TimeCode>I was pleased to
see last month that the group has committed to strengthening the
bank’s position, including through a commitment to inject
capital. It would not be appropriate for me to say more, other than
that the group is rightly taking action and strengthening its banking
arm through that
recapitalisation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T15:52:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070370000141" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/halltext/130703h0002.htm#13070370000141">I
turn to the co-operative sector as a whole. The Government have made it
clear that the co-operative sector is of great importance to the UK
economy. That case was made especially well by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T15:52:14"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Corby (Andy Sawford). In fact, co-operatives are ingrained in our
culture. As we have heard, the first recorded co-op in the world was
set up in Scotland in 1761. Building on those foundations, the birth of
the modern co-operative movement can be credited to the Rochdale
pioneers, no less, in the mid-19th century, as we heard so well from
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T15:52:45"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Rochdale (Simon Danczuk). He correctly said that I am a Rochdale
boy, and it is something that fills me with great pride. There are
people in this world who do not know where Rochdale is—however
shocking that sounds—but when they are told that it is the home
of the co-operative movement, they immediately recognise the
town’s importance. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would
agree.</hs_Para>

those humble beginnings, a thriving co-operative sector has blossomed.
The UK now has more than 6,000 independent co-ops, and there is a co-op
in every single postcode area. Those organisations provide valuable
services across a wide variety of industries, including agriculture,
finance and energy production. However, we should also remember that
although co-operatives focus on serving their members, they are also
businesses. The co-op sector in the UK had an overall turnover of well
over £36 billion in 2012, which is why, in line with the
Government’s commitment to promote mutuals, we have taken steps
to support the sector and to enable it to thrive
further<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T15:53:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070370000143" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/halltext/130703h0002.htm#13070370000143">Last
January, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister announced the
co-operatives consolidation Bill, which will be introduced to
Parliament in December this year. Although the Bill will not contain
any new legislation, it will put all co-op legislation in one
place, reducing complexity and making it easier for new co-operatives
to be set up. I know that that will be welcomed by the co-operative
movement.</hs_Para>

addition, we will consult very shortly on a further package of measures
to support the co-op sector, including making insolvency procedures

rescued.

hon. Member for Rutherglen and Hamilton West (Tom Greatrex) rightly
raised the issue of football supporters’ trusts. As he will
know, the Football Association is concerned about the inability of
those trusts to go into administration. The changes that we propose in
the consultation will hopefully help to satisfy that requirement, and
help that sector of mutuals—football supporters’ trusts
and others—to thrive further.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T15:55:04"></hs_TimeCode>We will also
consult on raising the amount of withdrawable share capital that an
individual member can invest in one society, so that co-ops can more
easily raise capital from their members.</hs_Para>

very important subsection of co-ops, as we heard, is the credit union
sector, which provides a mutually owned option for customers looking to
save, take out loans, or, in some cases, to get current accounts and

eloquently, including

a number of specific measures to support the sector. Most visibly, the
Department for Work and Pensions co-ordinated a recent feasibility
study to examine the future of credit unions. It was announced only
last week that the Government will take forward the study’s
findings. That includes the Department for Work and Pensions making a
further investment of up to £38 million over the next three
years in credit unions, with the aim of supporting the credit union
sector to provide sustainable financial services for up to 1 million
additional people.</hs_Para>

feasibility study also proposed raising the maximum interest rate that
a credit union can charge to 3% a month. The Government have announced
that we will take that proposal forward, and it will apply from April
2014. That will enable credit unions to break even on the low-value,
short-term loans that are the most expensive to issue, and to become
more stable over the long term.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T15:56:53"></hs_TimeCode>That will be an
alternative, as we have heard from some hon. Members today, to other
avenues for borrowing for short-term loans, such as payday
loans.</hs_Para>

credit unions doing short-term lending. If he recognises that credit

the interests of time, I must plough on. If we are to consider the
wider mutuals sector, we should also consider building societies, which
remain another key focus for the Government. We set out our approach to
applying the recommendations of the Independent Commission on Banking
on building societies in “The future of building
societies” consultation paper. The consultation closed last
year, and we are now considering how best to treat building societies
in line with our aims. We will set out our proposed approach in due
course.</hs_Para>

other questions were asked, and before I conclude, I will try to answer
some of them as best I can. A number of hon. Members raised the
issue of co-ops in the energy sector. The Department of Energy and
Climate Change published a call for evidence on community energy in
June 2013, and it will publish a community energy strategy for autumn
2013. That highlights the Government’s commitment to supporting
community energy projects.</hs_Para>

hon. Members raised the issue of housing. I agree that the co-operative
sector has an important role to play in housing, particularly because,
between 1997 and 2010, we saw a decline in social housing in our

sector can make a contribution to turning that around, and it will
benefit from Government funds that have already been made available, in
particular, for affordable housing.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Islwyn raised the issue of Northern Rock. We believe
that the sale was in the best interests of the taxpayer, securing the
long-term future of Northern Rock plc and increasing competition in the

advice that the Government received from United Kingdom Financial
Investments Ltd and independent advisers, having considered all bids

in the interests of time, I will just address one more issue
about the use of the name “co-op”, which was a good point
made by the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T15:59:21"></hs_TimeCode> hon.

your chairmanship, Mr Hollobone, for what I believe is the first time.
During this short debate, I want to make the case to the Minister that
the Government should introduce measures to amend selective licensing
of private landlords in order to allow local authorities to tackle
poor-quality rented housing. They should do so by amending the Housing
Act 2004 to create a third reason to bring forward a licensing scheme,
adding to that of low demand and/or antisocial behaviour. I am talking
about changes that will allow local authorities to add new licence
conditions if they so
choose<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T16:01:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070370000158" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/halltext/130703h0002.htm#13070370000158">At
the moment, there is a huge problem, which is recognised by hon.
Members on both sides of the House. Chronically poor housing
persists, and in some areas, such as Haslingden and Hyndburn—my
constituency—in huge concentrations. Local authorities are not
fully able to enforce the housing standards enshrined in the
2004 Act—notably, the housing health and safety rating system.
In itself, that is an inadequate standard that does little to tackle
anything but the absolute worst of
conditions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070370000159" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/halltext/130703h0002.htm#13070370000159">Most<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T16:01:49"></hs_TimeCode>
local authorities faced with concentrations of poor housing do not have
the resources to inspect, report, prosecute and enforce housing

of selective licensing schemes, enforcement of decency standards as

authority. That would bring the private rented sector into the 21st
century. The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T16:02:11"></hs_TimeCode>
Local Government Association has come out in support of that approach,
and a large number of local authorities support the extension of the

market. That approach would, by the very nature of a selective
licensing scheme, focus on areas of particularly poor housing and,
crucially, it would meet the original aim of the Act—to improve

landlords, to the extent that people are conscious of what I will
describe as “landlorded” areas, where renting but more
particularly buying is avoided. In my constituency, 15% of the stock is
privately rented—that is the old figure; the percentage is
rising, as it is nationally—compared with the national figure of
11%. However, when we zoom in on the poorer areas, we find much higher

find that the accreditation schemes go some of the way and encourage
those who wish to participate and to provide a tenanted property of a
decent standard, but the rogues or poor landlords or long-distance
landlords do not want to be accredited and do not participate in such
schemes and they are the people who are the target of any
action to try to improve a neighbourhood, a particular property or the
conditions for an individual or a family. Accreditation schemes have a
role to play and can offer advantages, such as discounts in the
licensing scheme; accreditations are often a passport to a reduced
licence fee. There we have a reason to have an accreditation scheme,
and such a scheme does encourage higher standards. But when it comes to
minimum standards, we have to go further. One sits above the

shall now deal with the effect that poor-quality homes have on the
housing market, which is an important and neglected aspect of this
matter. Poor-quality housing is one of the most visible social problems
where it is prevalent, and unfortunately in many areas there are large
concentrations of extremely poor privately rented properties. As well
as the individual tragedy for the young family or particularly the
young children in those properties being forced to live in unacceptable
conditions, poor landlords cause wider degeneration issues. Streets and
neighbourhoods quickly go into decline. While the south of the country
and other high-demand areas are suffering a housing crisis of
under-supply and high rents, low-demand areas are suffering an
altogether different housing crisis—a crisis of substandard
accommodation and unwanted properties to let, which are often
abandoned. It is the mark of a civilised society that landlords provide
tenants, and crucially their children, with basic elements to a
property, such as double-glazed windows, a decent heating system, good
insulation, safe electrics, and a reasonably modern kitchen and
bathroom, which we would all expect in a property in which we
lived.</hs_Para>

Low-demand areas turn quickly into streets full of voids, as in my

for Pendle and other hon. Members. Streets are effectively abandoned,
which brings down the whole neighbourhood for a generation. The old
ways of regeneration through Government grants have gone, for the time
being. We must accept the economic times in which we live, and such a
licensing scheme is an answer to that reality—a change for the
future.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070370000170" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/halltext/130703h0002.htm#13070370000170">Standards<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T16:10:37"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T16:19:58"></hs_TimeCode>

the original purpose of the powers, as defined in the 2004
Act<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T16:10:40"></hs_TimeCode>. Poor
housing standards are hugely damaging to the housing market in an area.
They result in people living in areas they no longer wish to be in,
lead to negative equity for innocent owner-occupier neighbours, and
explain in part why one in 13 properties stands empty in my
constituency. There needs to be recognition that undesirable,
poor-quality private sector housing is a cause, as well a symptom, of
low demand and weak markets. Making such a change would complement the
original aims of selective licensing. The Minister might be able to
point to many examples where that is not the case, but I would make a
powerful case—one that I am sure he would accept—that in
too many areas poor standards are a reality and local authorities
should be allowed to licence landlords and bring housing up to a
reasonable standard. I hope that he will not respond by simply
restating that local authorities 
<?notus-xml column=300?>already have such legal powers; he must recognise
that there are problems in the private rented sector that are not being
resolved in the existing
framework.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070370000171" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/halltext/130703h0002.htm#13070370000171">These<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T16:12:06"></hs_TimeCode>
are austere times, when Government programmes for deprived
neighbourhoods have all but run dry. Driving up conditions through
selective licensing could rebalance housing markets and provide
prospective residents and tenants with greater confidence.
Cash-strapped town halls need new, more value-driven solutions to the
problems of poor housing; a modified 2004 Act might just provide them.
Selective licensing was brought in to deal specifically with the
problems of declining neighbourhoods, and now it must be extended to
meet that
ambition.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070370000172" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/halltext/130703h0002.htm#13070370000172">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T16:12:33"></hs_TimeCode>
conclusion, the private rented sector cannot be seen in isolation from
the wider housing market and owner-occupation. Aspiration cannot be
removed from whole neighbourhoods. Tenanted families should have the
right to a property we ourselves would call a home: double-glazed
windows; a decent heating system; good insulation; safe electrics; and
a modern kitchen and bathroom. If we make a very small change in the
law, we could begin to tackle endemic poor standards in the private
rented sector, which would, importantly, give the young children of the
future the hope of a better life—a decent life—away from
squalor and, more crucially, begin seriously to tackle low demand and

the hon. Gentleman knows, the private rented sector is an important
part of our housing market. Some 3.8 million households live in the
sector, which has seen a huge increase from including 9% of all
households in 1988 to about 17% now. The Government actively support
that growth. Our “build to rent” fund will support new
high-quality, large-scale development for private rent. Notwithstanding
the problems he raises, most private sector tenants are happy with
their home and the services they receive: the English housing survey
found that 84% were satisfied with their accommodation, compared with
77% of local authority tenants. The average tenancy has extended, and
now lasts for about two years; nearly 20% of tenants have lived in the
same property for more than five years. Importantly, the same survey
found that 91% of tenancies were ended by the tenant, rather than the
landlord. It is pleasing to note that rents are stable. The latest
figures from the Office for National Statistics show that over the past
year rental increases were below inflation: in England, they rose by
1.3%, while in London, the figure was higher at 2.2%, but still below
inflation.</hs_Para>

know the hon. Gentleman and many members of his party have been keen to
push for a national register of landlords. The Government have rejected
that proposal, not least because it would cost some £330 million
over 10 years—costs that would be passed on to tenants. He
rightly raised concerns about some landlords, and I am aware that a
minority of landlords fail to meet their 
<?notus-xml column=301?>basic responsibilities: they neglect their properties and exploit their
tenants by placing them in unsafe and unsuitable living conditions. We
should focus our attention on them; a point he rightly raised today.
Frankly, those landlords have no place in the sector and we are
determined to take firm action to crack down on them, which is why
earlier today we announced that £3 million of funding would be
made available to support local authorities dealing with particularly
acute and intractable problems caused by rogue landlords. I am sure
that we will discuss access to that funding with the hon.
Gentleman.</hs_Para>

many properties in the hon. Gentleman’s constituency are old,
frequently in poor condition and, as he said, expensive to heat. Such
homes can be less desirable than more modern buildings, and therefore
more difficult to rent out, so the properties stand empty for long
periods, blighting the local area. Of course, where a property is in a
dangerous state of disrepair and there is a risk of harm to the
occupants, the local authority should make use of the powers under the
2004 Act to take enforcement action. I discussed that with the hon.
Gentleman when we met last month. In some areas, where demand
is low, landlords need support to improve empty homes and bring
them up to modern standards, which is why my Department gave a grant of
£9.4 million to the Pennine partnership, which includes his
constituency, to help refurbish and bring empty properties back into

hon. Gentleman has rightly acknowledged that local authorities have a
range of powers with which to tackle problems with poor housing, of
which selective licensing is just one. He also rightly said that, at
the moment, selective licensing can be introduced only when a local
authority is able to demonstrate that a particular area suffers from
low housing demand or has a significant and persistent problem with
antisocial behaviour. Selective licensing is not, of course, the only
solution. It is important to remember that local authorities have other
options open to them. One such option, which we strongly support, is to
introduce a voluntary licensing scheme for landlords, which can, and
does, help to raise standards across the board.

we are looking for a distinctive British contribution to the world

what has happened with disabled rights. Britain has genuinely been in
the lead on disabled rights, and that has involved all parties. In
1970, Alf Morris introduced the first disability legislation in the
world; he was the first Minister for the disabled. In 1995, the
Conservative Government introduced the first disability discrimination
legislation, and it was a Lib Dem and Conservative coalition that
brought in the equalities legislation. That is something of which all

the contribution that disabled people make to our society, which we

great remaining challenge to Britain—the final
frontier—is in transport. Sadly, transport has not quite reached
the level that has been achieved in other public service provision. The
rights for disabled people that were originally laid out in 1970 have
not been fully realised in the field of transport, and that is becoming
increasingly important. For example, the number of disabled people
using trains has gone up by 55% or more in the past five years. About

High Speed 2, partly to accelerate people’s journey times,
disabled people up and down the country face much longer journey times
because of the necessity of travelling on—for example, from
Goring to another station—to get from one platform to another.

parking spaces for disabled people, but only a massive footbridge
between the platforms. Whereas disabled people can park there, they
cannot actually get from one platform to the other. Does he agree that

have a more serious and general point that is worth raising with the

for Gilsland and smaller remote stations is one of metrics and
measurement, and about how the Government assess which stations to
prioritise. Understandably, they tend to focus on footfall as a way of
prioritising stations, but that misses many things. It misses the fact
that a remote rural station suffers from general transport issues, such
as fuel poverty and a lack of bus
services.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070370000211" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/halltext/130703h0002.htm#13070370000211">Remote<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T16:37:00"></hs_TimeCode>
rural areas tend to have issues relating to an ageing
population—demographic issues—that are not necessarily
captured by the Government’s form of measurement. For example,
the absolute number of people getting off at Penrith station is not
that dramatic, but the number of people aged over 65 in my constituency
will double in the next 10 years, so that the majority of people in my
constituency will be over 65 in 10 years’ time. They may not
have disabled cards, but to come down 45 steps with a 35 kg suitcase

if a seriously disabled person is in a wheelchair at Penrith station,
unless they travel up to Carlisle, they have to make a formal
request—there are 14 formal requests a day and scores more that
are not formally made in advance—which involves them being

back to the bigger strategic point that the Minister has had a grip on

are talking about to have the right kind of facilities available for
disabled people are relatively trivial compared with this enormous bet
that the Government are making and that the Opposition voted for on the
future of rail travel. If we are spending £43 billion on a

disabled access? A constituent of mine uses a mobility scooter, and I
was told by Northern Rail that because it has 13 different types of
train, most with ramps that are steeper than eight degrees and
therefore in its eyes unsafe to use, she has to be accompanied by
someone to fold and lift her scooter on to each individual train. In
other parts of the country, train operating companies have come up with
solutions to that. Does my hon. Friend agree that train operators
should try to find a consistent common approach to the issue of access

Stewart:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes two important points. The
first is about the inconsistency between operators, which is something
that we have experienced very personally in Penrith. The apparently
winning bidder for the west coast franchise committed to install a lift
at Penrith station. When that franchise collapsed, having got a written
commitment from the chief executive of that group, we ended up going
back to Virgin and no such commitment is emerging. Virgin says that it
has no interest in the work because it has only four or five years to
run on its franchise. That has been a great disappointment for us and
illustrates my hon. Friend’s point.</hs_Para>

bigger point, and the more important one, is that disabled access at
the train station—in other words lifts—is only the
beginning and not the end of the conversation. There are any number of
other things to be considered. Some of them are to do with changes 
<?notus-xml column=309?>in technology available to disabled people, the
increasing use of mobility scooters and the importance of being able to
get them on and off trains and the height of the platforms—in
many cases, the platforms are built at the wrong height for people to
be able to get off the train. Those may be expensive interventions but
they certainly need to be part of our objectives.</hs_Para>

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T16:44:41"></hs_TimeCode>the objective is
access to disabled lavatories on board trains. Recently, one of my

conclude, this is a matter of which Britain should be proud. All Back

recent years, expectations about accessibility have changed, both among

The success of our transport networks in providing accessible journeys

achieved. Unfortunately, however, many of our mainline railway stations
date from Victorian times, and those 19th century stations were not
built with the needs of 21st century passengers in mind, which has left
us with the huge task of opening up the rail network to disabled

the point that
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T16:54:05"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Penrith and The Border made about remote rural stations.
We also want the industry to take account of factors such as improving
inter-urban journeys and the availability of third-party match funding,
which can be used to weight business cases for individual station
projects. The views of local authorities are also important when
considering these matters, so they will be taken into

want to tie in access improvements with other projects to help to
deliver efficiency savings by combining costs, including project
management costs. For example, last November I opened a joint national
stations improvement programme and Access for All project—two
different funding streams—at Horsham station, which was worth
more than £4 million of Government and local authority funding.
This excellent project shows exactly what can be achieved when
different stakeholders co-ordinate their plans to deliver a better

would expect a number of stations that were close to being included in
the current Access for All programme to be nominated again this time

where Network Rail has already been looking at options for providing
step-free
access<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T16:55:03"></hs_TimeCode>. I know
that the station is one of the few on the west coast main line without
a proper accessible route, and that it is an important interchange with
National Express coaches and bus services to other parts of the Lake
district. All those factors will make Penrith a strong candidate for
inclusion in the Access 
<?notus-xml column=312?>for All programme, although I obviously cannot guarantee that it will be
included<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T16:55:21"></hs_TimeCode>.
Although Network Rail is busy considering the matter, I would expect
Virgin, the train company involved, to be frankly a little more
sympathetic than appears to have been the case to date. I expect the
industry to complete the nomination process by the end of this year,
which would enable us to be in a position to announce the successful
stations by April 2014, the beginning of the next rail control

important to remember that improved access can often be achieved using
relatively small amounts of funding, combined with innovative thinking
by the industry, so the Access for All programme includes an annual
small schemes fund of around £7 million a year. That money is
allocated between the train operating companies, based on the number of
stations they manage and how busy those stations are. Since 2006, more
than £100 million of investment, including contributions from
the train operators themselves and from local authorities, has seen
projects delivered at more than 1,100 stations, which is almost half

projects have been supported, including: better provision of accessible
toilets; customer information systems, which have now been installed at
more than 80% of our national stations; blue badge parking spaces; and
features such as induction loops at ticket offices to help those with
hearing impairments. The work has removed barriers to travel for many
disabled people, and these are real examples of projects that are

Army Reserve will need to be restructured. The Territorial
Army’s current structure was put in place in 2007 and based on

simply to supplement the Regular Army in times of national conflict
but, as part of an integrated whole force, will be ready and able to
deploy routinely at sub-unit level, and in some circumstances, as
formed units. To deliver this effect, the Regular Army and the Army
Reserve will, for the first time outside of the two world wars, be
fully integrated within a single chain of command. Army Reserve units,
like their regular counterparts, will be distributed in varying
proportions across the adaptable force brigades, the specialist
brigades forming force troops and, to a lesser extent, the reaction
force brigades. Most importantly, this structure will be properly

of existing Yeomanry sub-units across Scotland and Northern Ireland. To
better reflect its new geographical focus, it is planned to rename this
headquarters; “The Scottish and North Irish Yeomanry”. A,
C and D Squadrons of the RMLY will remain in their current geographical
locations (respectively Dudley, Chester and Wigan), but will come under
command of other Yeomanry regiment headquarters, improving their

capitalise on existing areas of specialist skills in the national
workforce, the Army has determined that it should increase and
rationalise the presence of the Army Reserve in urban areas, by merging
small, and/or poorly recruited sub-units, into larger sites 
already occupied by other units in local or neighbouring communities.
As well as improving recruitment opportunities the greater
concentration of reserve units in fewer locations, and their increased

policy for England and Wales. I set out the Government’s vision
of a national trust for the waterways that included the British
Waterways and Environment Agency (EA) navigations. I said that there
would be a phased approach to the delivery of this vision. In phase 1,
the functions, liabilities and assets of British Waterways in England
and Wales would transfer into a new charity, and in phase 2 the EA
navigations would transfer in 2015-16. I made it clear that the
transfer would only take place if sufficient funding could be found in
the next spending review to enable the charity to take on the
liabilities associated with EA’s navigations, and that a
transfer would be subject to the agreement of the charity’s
trustees.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13070355000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/wmstext/130703m0001.htm#13070355000041">British
Waterways’ functions, assets and liabilities in England and

fiscal situation remains challenging and as a result DEFRA must
identify additional savings in 2015-16 to help deal with the deficit.
Initial scoping work on transfer costs which was undertaken during the
new waterways charity project indicates that the transfer of EA
navigations is unlikely to be affordable in the current climate. The
Government have therefore decided that the review planned for 2013-14
to consider options for the transfer will be postponed until
DEFRA’s finances improve and there is a realistic prospect of
the transfer being affordable and that it can take place on terms which
would enable CRT’s trustees to manage the additional liabilities
involved.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13070355000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/wmstext/130703m0001.htm#13070355000043">I
realise that this decision will come as a disappointment to all those
with an interest in our inland waterways who share the
Government’s view that a transfer to CRT offers the most
sustainable long-term future for EA’s navigations. The
Government, however, remain fully committed to transferring the EA
navigations when the economic circumstances allow us to do so. The
Government will review the position after the next spending period and
will make a further announcement at that time on the timing of the
transfer.</hs_Para>

Immigration Bill will make it more difficult for illegal migrants to
live in the UK unlawfully and ensure that legal migrants make a fair

first consultation is on proposals to better regulate migrant access to
health services in the UK and will run for eight weeks. We are
responding to public concern that the current rules regulating non-EEA
migrant access to publicly funded health care services are both overly
generous, particularly when compared with wider international practice,
and poorly applied. These current weaknesses result in the UK taxpayer
unfairly bearing the health care costs of temporary non-EEA migrants,
who will not make the same financial contribution to our health care
systems as permanent residents over their working lives in the UK, and
short-term visitors and illegal migrants who access free health
services when they should be subject to treatment
charges.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13070355000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/wmstext/130703m0001.htm#13070355000059">This

second consultation launched today concerns proposals to prohibit
illegal migrants from renting accommodation in the UK and will run for
seven weeks. This forms part of the Government’s wider drive to
prevent illegal migration, including by removing the means by which
migrants can live in the UK unlawfully. Our intention to take action in
this area was signalled by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister in
his speech on immigration on 25 March, and the inclusion of related

Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) undertook a thorough and
comprehensive scientific review which focused on the medical and social
harms of khat consumption. The ACMD report gives considerable insight
into the complexity of this matter and, based on the available
evidence, it came to a reasonable conclusion in its recommendation to
Government. Although it recommended that khat should not be controlled,
the ACMD acknowledges that there is an absence of robust evidence in a
number of areas and that there are broader factors for the Government
to consider when making their decision. The decision to bring khat
under control is finely balanced and takes into account the expert
scientific advice and these broader
concerns.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13070355000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/wmstext/130703m0001.htm#13070355000064">The
whole of northern Europe—most recently the
Netherlands—and the majority of other EU member states have
controlled khat, as well as most of the G8 countries including Canada
and the USA. In all these cases khat’s exportation, importation,
supply and its possession or use has been banned. Failure to take
decisive action and change the UK’s legislative position on khat
would place the UK at a serious risk of becoming a single, regional hub
for the illegal onward trafficking of khat to these countries. Seizures
of khat transiting the UK en route to the Netherlands have already been
increasing in size and frequency since the Dutch ban earlier this year.
The ACMD report recognised the likelihood that some khat is being
re-exported to countries where it is illegal. The ACMD could not
determine the scale of this activity based on the available evidence
and acknowledged that this concern forms part of Government
consideration of the
matter.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13070355000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/wmstext/130703m0001.htm#13070355000065">Khat
continues to feature prominently amongst the health and social harms,
such as low attainment and family breakdown, cited by
affected communities and the police and local authorities working with
them. The ACMD 
<?notus-xml column=57?>acknowledged that there was insufficient evidence to enable the ACMD to
advise if khat use was a cause or a symptom of social harms. The
Government are concerned that we risk underestimating the actual harms
of khat in our communities owing to the limitations of the evidence
base available to the ACMD. To ensure a proportionate and robust
policing response, the Government will introduce an escalation
framework for the possession of khat for personal use, similar to that

contraceptive information, services and supplies by 2020. At the summit
more than 20 developing

supporting governments, civil society, the UN and other partners in

credit is about making work pay, so that everyone becomes better off
when they move into work, or when they start working longer hours. By
removing the distinction between being in work and out of work, by
ensuring that there is a clear financial return for each extra hour

expected to increase the income of the poorest workers, increase
employment, reduce poverty and to start to break of the cycle of
workless households in succeeding generations.</hs_Para>

descriptions, from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme's

that injury. Therefore, The Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority
(CICA) does not hold a breakdown of received or rejected applications
by type of injury. When people apply for criminal injuries compensation
they are asking CICA to assess what happened to them, decide whether
they are eligible for compensation and, if so, how much. I have placed

The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons
for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were
dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more
offences it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed.

offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty
is the most
severe.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left"><Sup>3</Sup>
Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate
and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have
been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the
courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to
ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are
taken into account when those data are
used.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left"><Sup>4</Sup>

the courts to determine which punitive element is appropriate and

Wright:</Member></B> The use of cautions is at its lowest level for
more than five years, as is the number of cautions issued to those who
have a previous criminal record. However, the public and victims have a
right to expect that people who commit serious crimes should be brought
before a court. On 3 April 2013 the Ministry of Justice launched a
review into the use of cautions focused on the use of cautions for
serious offences and persistent offenders. Among other things, the
review is examining whether there are some offences for which the use
of simple cautions is generally inappropriate, the reasons why multiple
cautions are given to some criminals and the difference in the use of
cautions by police force areas. The review is a significant step to
ensuring that cautions are used correctly, in the interests of justice,
and command the confidence of the public. We will announce our plans
shortly.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070396000692" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/text/130703w0002.htm#13070396000692">The
decision whether to offer a caution is an operational matter for the
police and in some circumstances the CPS depending on the circumstances
of the offence and offender. Court will always be the right place for
serious and contested cases and those involving prolific offenders.
However, there will be a number of difficult cases, including those
where both victim and perpetrator are children, or where victims and
witnesses are reluctant to give evidence, where the police may
decide that administering a caution is a preferable option to there
being no record of the offence committed.</hs_Para>

approximately £250,000 for training programmes in Bahrain, and
also included Bahrain in regional projects. Included within this total
is a youth engagement project for £17,000, capacity building for
a community reconciliation project up to £195,000, and a project
to introduce the Ministry of Interior to UK best practice in community
policing. We have spent £13,000 this financial year so far, and

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) uses recruitment agencies to
attract a wide range of applicants to ensure its work force is as
diverse and highly skilled as possible. For specialist recruitment
campaigns, agencies are better placed to target applicants with the
most relevant skills within that sector. A competitive tendering
process is run to select an agency for external recruitment campaigns.
This has proven to be more cost-effective than in-house recruitment.
FCO officials are currently collating the information spent by the
Department on recruitment agency fees. I will write to my hon. Friend

requirements for undergraduate programmes are set by training
providers. We have toughened the ITT entry requirements, so that since
1 September 2012 all applicants to initial teacher training courses
have had to pass the professional skills tests in literacy and numeracy
before starting the course. We have raised the pass mark to make the
tests more rigorous, and candidates are limited to two resits. We have
also carried out a fundamental review of the skills tests and new,
tougher tests will be introduced from autumn
2013.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070398000173" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/text/130703w0003.htm#13070398000173">In
2012/13 we introduced a bursary system which awards higher bursaries to
trainees with good degrees. Under the new bursary system, ITT
candidates holding third class and pass or ordinary degrees are no
longer eligible for funding. In the subjects to which it is hardest to
recruit teachers we offer: a bursary of £20,000 for trainees
with first class degrees; £15,000 for those with upper second
class degrees; and £12,000 for those with lower second class
degrees. For other subjects we offer: £9,000 for trainees with
first class degrees; and £4,000 for trainees with upper second
class degrees. This approach will help to raise the status of teaching
as a career choice and incentivise the best graduates to become
teachers.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13070398000029" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/text/130703w0003.htm#13070398000029">Truancy

support levels have changed over time under the RO, plants receive a
different number of ROCs per MWh of generation depending on when they
joined the scheme. Table 6.3 in Energy Trends presents total ROCs
awarded and total generation for each cohort and can be found

the RO is a market-based support mechanism, the actual value of a ROC
to a generator will depend on the supply and demand for ROCs during a
given obligation period, and the individual arrangements reached
between generators and the supplier or other person to whom they sell
their ROCs. DECC do not hold information on purchase power agreements

confidential.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070398000359" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130703/text/130703w0003.htm#13070398000359">For
Government accounting purposes DECC assume that the obligation is set
correctly (i.e. at the level of generation plus 10% headroom).
Therefore, the value of a ROC to an electricity supplier is assumed to
be the buyout price (which a supplier can pay to discharge its
obligation) plus 10% (headroom). The buyout price is set by Ofgem, in
2012-13 it was £40.71; historic rates can be found on Ofgem's

about the National Scholarship Programme (NSP) submitted to HEFCE by

delivered in the form of fee waivers, £21 million through cash

evaluation has shown that there is a low awareness of the NSP. In
addition, it was found to have limited impact on students' decision
making because funding is not generally guaranteed at the point of
application to university. From 2015/16, the Government will refocus
the National Scholarship Programme to support postgraduate students
from disadvantaged backgrounds. The £50 million fund will be
administered by the Higher Education Funding Council for England
(HEFCE). HEFCE will allocate the money competitively to higher
education institutions, and will attract additional scholarship funding
from the private sector or from the institutions' own

Address File (PAF) available to anyone who wishes to uses it on
reasonable terms. This obligation is regulated by Ofcom and will apply
regardless of ownership of Royal Mail. On 14 June Royal Mail announced
a package of measures to improve access, including a forthcoming
consultation to simplify radically the licensing and pricing regime. In
addition, Ofcom recently consulted on the licensing regime and will
publish its conclusions shortly. Government and Royal Mail have
previously announced the intention to introduce a PAF Public Sector
Licence to cover all uses of PAF by the public sector. The forthcoming
Royal Mail consultation and the resulting regime will inform the PAF

An FCE is a continuous period of admitted patient care under one
consultant within one health care provider. FCEs are counted against
the year in which they end. Figures do not represent the number of
different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care
within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same
year.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>2. Office of Population Censuses
and Surveys Classification of Interventions and Procedures 4.6 coding

where the procedure (or intervention) was recorded in any of the 24 (12
from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and four prior to 2002-03) procedure fields in
a HES record. A record is only included once in each count, even if the
procedure is recorded in more than one procedure field of the record.
Note that more procedures are carried out than episodes with a main or
secondary procedure. For example, patients undergoing a
‘cataract operation’ would tend to have at least two
procedures—removal of the faulty lens and the fitting of a new
one—counted in a single
episode.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>4. HES figures are available
from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be
interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage
(particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of
independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in
national health service practice. For example, changes in activity may
be due to</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>changes in the provision of
care.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>5. The primary diagnosis is the

reason why the patient was admitted to
hospital.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>6. HES are compiled from data
sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England and
from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by
the English NHS. Health and Social Care Information Centre liaises
closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete
and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies. While this brings
about improvement over time, some shortcomings
remain.</hs_TableFooter></entry></row></tfoot></tgroup></table>

UK National Screening Committee advises Ministers and the national
health service in all four countries about all aspects of screening
policy and supports implementation. Using research evidence, pilot
programmes and economic evaluation, it assesses the evidence against a
set of internationally recognised criteria. The UK National Screening
Committee reviewed the evidence for screening Group B Streptococcus
carriage in pregnancy in November 2012 and recommended that antenatal
screening for Group B Streptococcus carriage should not be offered,
because there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that the benefits
to be gained from screening and treating those carrying the organism
with intravenous antibiotics during labour would outweigh the
harms.</hs_Para>
