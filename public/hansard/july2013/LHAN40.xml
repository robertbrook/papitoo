like to make a personal statement. In my speech at the Second Reading
of the Littering from Vehicles Bill on Friday, I unintentionally
suggested that I might have been provided with the personal data of
motorists by the DVLA. I should like to confirm that I have not at any
time asked for, or been given, from the DVLA any information which is
not in the public domain. In particular, I have not been given the
names of keepers of vehicles. I much regret that my speech, made
without text or notes, should have given rise to press speculation to
the contrary, and I apologise to the
House.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question">

five A* to C statistics, including English and maths, 65% of pupils at
Catholic schools achieve five A* to C grades, as opposed to non-faith

community cohesion. Under the draft citizenship curriculum, pupils will
be taught about diverse national, regional, religious and ethnic
identities in the UK and the need for mutual respect and understanding.
Schools are also free to teach pupils about such issues in PSHE. All
state-funded schools are also required by law to teach a broad and
balanced curriculum that promotes the spiritual, moral, social and
cultural development of pupils, and Ofsted’s inspection
framework includes a focus on

are close to their immediate pension point. As we reduce the size of

the correct balance of those skills and experience across rank

important question. The majority of service personnel make a successful
transition to civilian life. All service leavers are entitled to some
form of resettlement assistance. The Career Transition Partnership has
proved successful in assisting service leavers to find work and a
recent defence statistics survey shows that of the service leavers in
2011-12 who have a known employment outcome, around 85% are employed
within six months of leaving the Armed Forces. Our resettlement
arrangements are kept constantly under review to ensure the needs of
service leavers are
met.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307221000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0001.htm#1307221000034"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Hughes of Woodside" PimsId="1055" UID="1307221000244" xid="1276" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0001.htm#1307221000244">Lord

Astor of Hever:</Member></B> My Lords, I did say that only 1.2% are
affected. The redundancy schemes recognise those who miss out on
immediate incomes by paying them significant enhanced tax-free
redundancy compensation lump sums. Those who leave before the
qualification point will get preserved pensions and further tax-free
lump sums at the age of 60 or 65, depending on the pension scheme they
are in. Armed 
<?notus-xml column=1042?>Forces pensions remain among the most generous in the public or private
sector. We recognise the unique role and sacrifice of the military,

indicator of the state of morale because the Army has deliberately set
out to maximise applications. Recruiting for the Armed Forces remains
buoyant.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307221000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0001.htm#1307221000038"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Elystan-Morgan" PimsId="3108" UID="1307221000248" xid="1811" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0001.htm#1307221000248">Lord

Astor of Hever:</Member></B> My Lords, because of the complexity of
pensions calculations, establishing the exact number of Army personnel
who fall into this category would require manual analysis of the
records of those selected for redundancy. This could be undertaken only
at disproportionate cost. However, to ensure the redundancy programme
is fair, selection criteria have been published by each service and,
while rank and seniority are reflected in selection criteria, length of
reckonable service is not. This means that individuals might be made
redundant either just before or just after the length of service at
which they qualify for an immediate pension. Redundancy criteria are
based on the future needs of the Army. Exempting personnel because of
proximity to pension point would be contrary to this principle and
would mean selecting others
instead.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307221000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0001.htm#1307221000040"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Grocott" PimsId="3672" UID="1307221000250" xid="1629" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0001.htm#1307221000250">Lord

the Minister’s answers is one of considerable concern. It is no
answer to the serious example spelt out in detail by my noble friend
Lord Touhig, which seems to show a grave injustice, to say that this
grave injustice applies to only 1.2% of the people affected. It is a
grave injustice to them and, at the very least, I would appeal to the

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, although detailed ownership
figures are not held, much of the UK’s infrastructure is foreign
owned. More broadly, as a nation the UK has a pipeline of more than
£310 billion of potential infrastructure projects
over the next five to 10 years. Investment will need to come from a
variety of sources, foreign as well as domestic. The UK welcomes all
investors, irrespective of nationality, particularly those bringing
additional capital into the UK, provided that they meet our corporate
governance standards and do not represent an unacceptable national
security
risk.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307221000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0001.htm#1307221000058"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Harris of Haringey" PimsId="853" UID="1307221000268" xid="1743" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0001.htm#1307221000268">Lord

does not know what proportion of our national infrastructure is owned
by foreign interests, but he does acknowledge that most of it is. Our
ports are owned by Dubai, the BT network is controlled by  the
Chinese and London’s electricity is supplied by the French. Does

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> There are several points there. To
say that the BT network is controlled by the Chinese is, to say the
least, a considerable exaggeration. The issue of the dependence on the
supply of equipment from China is a rather different one, and that, as
noble Lords will know, is the subject of a recent ISC report. British
sovereignty has traditionally and in recent years been debated much
more in terms of threat to English common law, and the existential
threat which Brussels and the European courts are thought to provide to
Britain, than in terms of the threat from foreign investment. I should
welcome the noble Lord banging on about one rather than the

response to that report a few days ago, announcing that they will
instigate a review of the Huawei cell, which is the issue very much at
stake here. I emphasise that we are talking about a global supply chain
in which there are, at most, two potential suppliers of some of the
highly sophisticated equipment available—I believe that the
other is Swedish. The dependence which we all have on each other for
critical national infrastructure in telecommunications is a great deal
more complicated than we previously understood. However, Vodafone owns
a number of large mobile networks in other countries which are part of
their critical national infrastructures, so this is not a

Bill as it stands is a collaborative piece. I have listened with great
interest to the concerns of noble Lords and responded to the pressure
points. Since the Bill was introduced we have been able to renegotiate
the rate of payment to 75%, which is in no small part thanks to the
pressure exerted by this House. We have pledged to explore the creation
of an oversight committee to ensure that the scheme may operate in the
most efficient and just way, an idea that I cannot claim credit for.
For that, and indeed much more, I must thank the noble Lord, Lord
McKenzie, and the noble Baroness, Lady Sherlock. The noble Lord and the
noble Baroness have been kind enough to give their time frequently and
I am grateful for their supportive approach and their
expertise.</hs_para>

to the issue of scheme management, we have announced that the scheme

confident that the scheme that will be set up as a result of this Bill
will be the best it can be and will offer financial support to those
who, through no fault of their own, have contracted this terrible
disease yet cannot sue for damages. This represents a substantial
achievement and, once again, one for which I cannot claim all the
credit; so I thank noble Lords. My particular thanks go to those who
have given so much of their time to contribute to the comprehensive

discussed at length, and I know that many noble Lords feel strongly
about it, was research into mesothelioma. As noble Lords will remember,
I mentioned that when negotiating the terms of this Bill, I really hit
a brick wall at every turn regarding research. A great debt of thanks
must therefore go to the noble Lord, Lord Alton, for raising the
awareness of the lack of research in this area and, although we
disagreed on the mechanism, the pressure of his amendment has helped
me, jointly with my noble friend Lord Howe, to form a strategy for how
we might encourage proposals for high-quality research into
mesothelioma. On Report last week, my noble friend Lord Howe outlined
this strategy, and I thank the noble Earl once again for his support
and collaboration on that point. The momentum in this area created by
his efforts and the efforts of this House should not be
underestimated.</hs_para>

amendment for today and I apologise to the House for its tardiness. The
amendment is minor and technical in nature and we will come to it in a
moment, but I will quickly say that further thanks are due, this time
to the noble Lord, Lord Browne. The purpose of the amendment is simply
to add further clarification to Clause 2. It was the noble
Lord’s careful scrutiny of that clause that alerted us to a
possible source of confusion. The amendment was deemed necessary in
cases where an individual had tried but failed to bring a claim against
a relevant employer but, where any other relevant employer existed, the
individual must attempt to bring a claim against that employer also
before being able to come to the scheme. It has always been the policy
intention that this scheme must be one of last resort and that all
other avenues should be exhausted first. The object of the amendment is
only to avoid any misinterpretation of Clause
2.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307221000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0001.htm#1307221000083">Before I

them. The Bill represents substantial progress in rectifying this

he promised to write. That was because he found himself—I think
I quote him properly—“in deep legal territory”, or
he was concerned that he might find himself in deep legal territory. He
promised to write, and on 7 June he did so. He dismissed my concerns
again, but I persisted. Thanks to the engagement of the Bill team, in

will not take up the House’s time by going into these in detail,
but I remain unconvinced that even an amended paragraph (c) of Clause
2(1) is necessary, except in the most remote, hypothetical
circumstances. I commend the ingenuity of those supporting the Minister
in trying to find sets of circumstances which justify the words in the
first draft of the Bill. In my view, the justifications which I was
given were either wrong or showed a repeated misunderstanding of the
interaction of other parts of Clause 2 with that very paragraph or, as
we got deeper into the weeds in this, a misunderstanding of the
relationship between Clause 10 and Clause 2, and then a
misunderstanding of the relationship between Clause 2 and its
provisions, and the draft set of rules which we were then given. I
presume they will now form the template for the regulations which will
set out the
scheme.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307221000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0001.htm#1307221000088">At<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-22T15:29:22"></hs_TimeCode>
every point at which a justification was made for the wording there was
an inconsistency, which I pointed out. However, having said that, the
clarification which the Minister gave in his letter of 7 June that the
phrase “the relevant employer” in Clause 2(1)(c) was a
reference to the same “a relevant employer” in paragraph
(a) of the same subsection, perhaps deals with the issue, at least to
some extent. If the Minister finds some way of putting that explanation
on the record, it may be sufficient to see off my concerns in the short
term. In any event, at this stage I do not intend to persist, now that
the paragraph has been divided and
recast.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307221000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0001.htm#1307221000089">Amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-22T15:29:22"></hs_TimeCode>
1, which would put new paragraph (ca) in Clause 2(1), and Amendment 3,
which would put new paragraph (ba) in Clause 3(1), are improvements. I
support them without any qualification because they deal directly with
my concerns about cases where an employee had multiple employers. It is
a simple necessity that at the time of application the
employee-applicant, or an eligible dependant, must be unable to bring

will apply to the scheme—in other words, what were the draft
rules that we were given copies of. I went through the draft rules in
detail after I received this amendment and could find no references at
all to any such circumstances. It seems therefore that a very important
part of the structure of this scheme has not been subject to any form
of parliamentary scrutiny. I hope that this will be corrected when the
Bill goes to the other place. If this provision is necessary, the
circumstances that are to be in the scheme ought to be shown to

important point that has arisen from my engagement beyond Parliament
with the Bill team is that during my conversations and in
correspondence with those advising the Minister it was explained to me
that it was the Government’s intention that, when a person was
diagnosed with diffuse mesothelioma on or after 25 July 2012 but before
the Bill comes into force as an Act, application to the scheme would
have to be made and received by the scheme administrator not later than
three years after the date on which it comes into force, not three
years from 25 July 2012. That would be a very welcome relaxation of the
limitation rules, given the nature of this dreadful disease and how
quickly it can become fatal.</hs_para>

rules make no mention of that relaxation and there is no such
relaxation anywhere in the Bill. However, there is a very specific
relaxation in draft rule 7, where a person has died on or after
25 July 2012 and the claim is made by an eligible dependant.
That very significant concession is known to me and is now known to all
Members of your Lordships’ House. It requires some parliamentary
acknowledgement or commitment, at the very least. More than that, it

Howarth of Newport:</Member></B> My Lords, if it is in order to make
some brief remarks in the debate on these amendments which go a little
wide of them, as the Minister has just done, I will do so now rather
than on the Motion that this Bill do now pass. In the absence of the
noble Countess, Lady Mar, I will take a chance and hope to have the
indulgence of the House. In our proceedings on the Bill, we have
considered very closely the predicament of people who have suffered the
tragic misfortune of contracting mesothelioma. This predicament has
elicited strong feelings of sympathy all around your Lordships’
House. It is the role of your Lordships’ House to advise our
elected colleagues in another place and I would like to reflect for
just a moment on what the essence of that advice should be.</hs_para>

attempting to deal with the consequences of what should certainly be
regarded as a major scandal. Of course, among employer’s
liability insurers there are many honourable and conscientious people,
but in their ranks there have also been, I regret to say, a significant
number who have been deeply dishonourable and reckless. Some of the
employer’s liability insurers have behaved as badly as the worst
of the bankers and the worst of the touts of mortgage loans did in the
run-up to the crisis of 2008.</hs_para>

latency of mesothelioma and the three to four decades that the disease
takes to incubate, there was scope for genuine administrative
confusion, but a significant proportion of insurers have managed to
lose the documentation that would have enabled mesothelioma sufferers
to make a claim against their employer, or their employer’s
successor, and perhaps to make their case in the civil courts. Within
that number, it is very clear that there were also significant numbers
of insurers who wilfully destroyed that documentation. Such negligence
and criminality in relation to people who are doomed to suffer from
this most horrible illness and to die of it seems peculiarly cynical
and, I would say, depraved. There has been the inhumanity of that but
there is also another fundamental issue at stake; the proper
administration of contracts is fundamental to the functioning of a
free-enterprise economy and to the maintenance of trust in
society.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1307221000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0001.htm#1307221000096">We
have all admired and applauded the Minister who, building on the
initiative of my noble friend Lord McKenzie of Luton, negotiated with
employer’s liability insurers the scheme that this Bill would
legislate. The Minister and his officials have invariably been helpful
to us, and he was most generous in his remarks just now about noble
Lords who have participated in these proceedings. As he said, it has
been a collaborative process. We recognise and thank him for the
improvements that he has made to this scheme during the passage of the
Bill—the raising of the rate of payment to 75%; his agreement
that details of the scheme should be brought in by regulation; his
acceptance of the principle of an oversight committee; and his decision
that the scheme should go out to open tender. I am sure that he will
continue to give attention to the significant issues raised just now by
my noble friend Lord Browne. The noble Earl, Lord Howe, made a very
constructive set of proposals in response to the noble Lord, Lord
Alton, on how to facilitate and fund further research into
mesothelioma.</hs_para>

Minister has had, and one that we entirely understand, is that having
conducted his negotiation with the industry and reached an agreement
with it, he has found it very difficult to budge from the exact terms
of that agreement. I do not think that Parliament is bound by the terms
of an agreement negotiated between the Government and the industry.
Indeed, it is the responsibility of Parliament to improve the scheme
further if we can in the public interest. There is therefore a small
number of issues which we should commend to our colleagues in the House
of Commons for their further consideration. I hope that they will want
to look again at the rate of payment and the date for eligibility. I
very much hope that they will want to look at the plight of people who
are at the moment excluded from the scope of the scheme, such 
<?notus-xml column=1054?>as members of the households of people who were employed and exposed to
asbestos, where the employee has not so far contracted the disease but
the household member, perhaps someone who did the household laundry and
washed the contaminated overalls brought back from the workplace, has
contracted it. People in that situation are not covered by the scheme.
The self-employed too, even if self-employment was something of a
technicality, will not be eligible to benefit. I hope also that the
Government will after all agree that there should be an annual report
on the progress of the scheme to assist Parliament in its necessary
further vigilance in the interests of mesothelioma victims.</hs_para>

been fearful that if such refinements to the scheme were to be brought
in by way of amendments to the Bill, the insurance industry would take
away its bat and ball and revert to its customary position of taking
legal action to prevent the Government from requiring it to do what in
decency and justice it ought to do. Of course, we do not want to see
any delays to the implementation of the Bill. I hope that Members of
the House of Commons will take the view that a legal case by the
employers against minor improvements of this kind to the Bill would be
very weak indeed, given that they have accepted the principle that
there ought to be a scheme of this kind which they should fund. My
noble friend Lord McKenzie of Luton has demonstrated that the costs of
such improvements would be affordable, and I do not believe that the
employer’s liability insurers would be so shameless as to go to
court to try to prevent these modest further improvements and further
advance of justice for mesothelioma victims.</hs_para>

at this stage of the debate but, having listened to the noble Lord,
Lord Howarth, I feel compelled to do so on behalf of the insurance
industry, as he has made a serious allegation of fundamental dishonesty
within it. I remind the House that I myself have stood trial in the USA
on a charge that would have got me 24 years in the slammer, and was
acquitted. At issue was the integrity and honesty of the British
insurance industry, for which I signed the audit certificate that led
to the ultimate creation of Equitas. The noble Lord should remember
that we are a very public arena, and that there are many in the world
with other motives who will look to get any crumb of comfort that they
can to mount an action that would lead to a financial advantage for
them.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1307221000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0001.htm#1307221000101">The
issue on which I was arraigned in the Justice Courts in New York was
that, with the fundamental insolvency of Lloyd’s of London
totally at issue, I had signed an audit certificate that said it was
solvent when it was not. I had seven days’ non-stop
interrogation on the subject, but I won. I would like to go on the
record to this gathering, for the outside world as well, about why I
won so that we may not find that we are undermining the integrity and
financial security of the insurance industry on which this scheme will
depend.

signed an audit certificate to say that Lloyd’s of London was
solvent and could meet all its liabilities, at a time when most people
believed that it could not. I relied upon Section 18(1) of the
Insolvency Act, which by the greatest irony I wrote when I was
assistant to Sir Kenneth Cork in drafting it. The Act makes very
specific statements about what justifies a claim for solvency, and I
claimed that those conditions were met in the case of Lloyd’s.
The ultimate proof that it was is the fact that Equitas, whose creation
by Lloyd’s of London I chaired, has been sold to Warren Buffett
for an enormous amount of money, with a guarantee that he will fulfil
Equitas’s entire liabilities. In the process, he will pick up
about £3 billion in pocket money for himself, and good luck to
him.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307221000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0001.htm#1307221000103">The events
of those days cast a very long shadow. The noble Lord, Lord Howarth,
may be right in his comment that there was dishonesty in the loss of
documentation and the avoidance of liability by those devious means,
but there is no question of integrity in the industry with which we are
dealing. It is adequately funded and has adequate backing, and it is
completely solvent for the discharge of all the liabilities that we
want to meet, including those that we are discussing in the Bill. It
would be an outrageous act of complete disregard for the facts of
history and the integrity of the industry if we were to cast any doubts
on its ability to stand behind its liabilities. The issue is that there
are these liabilities but there are the reserves in the world for
them—you just have to find the key to unlock them, and the Bill
is a wonderful part of the process of doing that. There is no question
of the integrity of the industry regarding its
solvency.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307221000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0001.htm#1307221000104"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Howarth of Newport" PimsId="4870" UID="1307221000295" xid="1872" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0001.htm#1307221000295">Lord

something about a horrendous disease which, as we know, takes more than
2,000 lives every year in this country and which official figures
predict will take a further 56,000 lives. As I mentioned on Report last

combating mesothelioma. We could not possibly remove asbestos from
every public building and private home in the land, and people will
contract mesothelioma for years to come through exposure to asbestos.
The answer is surely to find out why this disease, which we have known
about since 1930 and which has this horrendous hibernation period,
affects people in the way it does and whether there is a way to combat
it. Obviously the fact that it hibernates for so long suggests that
there might be ways to neutralise it. This is surely where we should
put our resources in the
future<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-22T15:50:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

appreciate all the work that the noble Lord, Lord Browne, has done to
get to this point. He referred to remote and hypothetical places where

the new provisions now proposed as Clause 2(1)(ca) and
Clause 3(1)(ba). The hypothetical, or rather remote situation, is the
following. A company at the time of a person’s exposure did not
have employer’s liability insurance—it was behaving
negligently—and subsequently, when that person had left that
company’s employment, it secured employer’s liability in
order to become compliant. As this is written, that would mean that
there could be a possible—or not possible—claim against
that employer’s liability insurance, which was subsequent to
that person’s period of employment. That very remote case leads
me to wonder about the omission of those words from the second part of
each of those clauses and whether they need to be inserted, or rather
made clear. Of course, maybe this could occur in the regulations that
may follow from the rules of the scheme that pursue

will quickly say a few words about the Bill. As regards the
achievements that noble Lords have made in this House and the work they
have done towards the changes that have been made to the Bill, in each
of those three or four key issues there has been a change and a degree
of success which we ought to recognise. I will first address
independence and oversight, which was raised by noble Lords from all
sides of this Chamber. They are both very important: the first ensures
that the people who manage the process do not rule the way it operates,
and the second ensures that there is a degree of observation of how it
is run by all those who are, if you like, the actors on the stage who
are affected by this dreadful
disease.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307221000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0001.htm#1307221000119">The
second issue is that of research. The noble Lord, Lord Alton, has
already referred to the work which is being done by the two Ministers
present today, my noble friends Lord Howe and Lord Freud. Clearly,
there are differences of view as to how that might
happen—statutory versus non-statutory. That is probably the way
this House deals with issues: they have been raised, and although the
solutions may not be the same ones that noble Lords wanted, they are,
none the less, an approach to doing research into this
disease.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307221000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0001.htm#1307221000120">One
way in which we can keep track of what is happening in this area is by
scrutiny of Ministers. It is not a matter of whether the Minister who
follows is a good Minister—to rephrase the words of the noble
Lord, Lord Alton—but of being able to hold Ministers to account.
That is what Parliament can and should do. These things should not be
kept from the public eye. I am sure that, in years to come, noble Lords
will pursue this issue strongly with Ministers of whatever persuasion,
from whichever part of the House they come, in order to ensure that we
better understand this dreadful disease and how it can be treated and
ameliorated. It is important also to take an international approach and
work with those who suffer from this dreadful disease in other parts of
the world.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307221000121" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0001.htm#1307221000121">The
third area that has been of importance to your Lordships’ House
during the course of the Bill is the level of compensation. Clearly, a
major issue at the 
<?notus-xml column=1059?>beginning was the percentage of civil damages that was to be given,
according to a ratio or tariff. Noble Lords sought to raise the bar.
There was some success, and, given the public interest in these
matters, clearly on one side you wish to ensure as much compensation as
you can, quite rightly, for sufferers who cannot trace their employer
or their employer’s insurance company. However, you do not want
to put another burden on companies that are not responsible for what
happened, which would in turn pass on the costs to customers, who would
have to pay them. We may not have reached the right balance but I pay
tribute to  the Minister for moving the bar upwards against
all the pressure he was put under during the passage of the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307221000122" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0001.htm#1307221000122">There are
ways in which the Bill can become a model for dealing with other forms
of industrial illness relating to asbestos, and with other industrial
diseases. The situations may not be exactly the same because,
appropriately, this measure is directed at a unique and terminal
illness that is dreadful in every aspect. However, it may be that we
can derive other models from some of the work that has been done in the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307221000123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0001.htm#1307221000123">Finally,
I congratulate the Minister on his personal commitment. Many noble
Lords will know that he has personally taken this as a challenge that
he will see to its conclusion. The job was started by the previous
Government, and the noble Lord has obviously taken it a step forward
from where it was left by that Government. I pay tribute to the
starting point. However, to see it to its completion, having undertaken
what must have been horrendous negotiations with people who were not
responsible but who had to pay for the people who were responsible and
had disappeared off the scene, cannot have been easy. When eventually
the fly on the wall in those meeting rooms publishes its memoirs, I am
sure that we will be able to see the level of pressure brought by the
Minister. From these Benches, I congratulate him and say that it was a
job well done. We have taken a step that will lead us in future to deal
with problems associated with this disease in an appropriate way. I
hope that we will see an early start to implementation, so that people
will no longer have to wait for compensation in cases where their
former employer, or its insurance company, has gone out of
business.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-22?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_22_PT_1/328608346796A927EF905374A754ECB0CA53D604" __version__="1.9"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 22 July 2013">Monday,

could address two matters that were raised last week, one by the noble
Earl, Lord Howe, and one by him. First, I think it is true to say that
during the proceedings a cocktail of suggestions were made by the noble
Earl, Lord Howe, as to how research could be opened up, extended and
encouraged. Secondly, I believe that it was the noble Lord, Lord
Wigley, who sought from the noble Earl an undertaking to look at a
reporting mechanism so that we might have some way of following
progress. Can the Minister say when he feels that it will be possible
to initiate this process, and can he keep us informed of the progress
being made with regard to the research, which is so critical for the

Lipsey:</Member></B> My Lords, I think all five of the non-governmental
amendments in this group are down to me, so I crave the
Committee’s forgiveness if I am not the soul of brevity on this
occasion. All the amendments refer to the Government’s proposed
universal deferred payment
scheme.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307221000137" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0001.htm#1307221000137">I start
by reminding the Committee of the background to this scheme. Its
origins lie in the proposal made by a minority of the royal commission
of 1999. We—my noble friend Lord Joffe and I—were
concerned with one clear defect of the means-tested system. It meant
that people were forced to sell their homes to pay for care. The
<I>Daily </I><I>Mail </I>banged on about this practically every week,
and it was right—I never thought that those words would escape
my lips—to do so. However, we also felt that it would be wrong
that people needing care could simply hang onto their homes and
eventually bequeath them to their families without spending any of the
capital that those homes represented to pay for their own care.
Therefore, we proposed deferred payments—local authority loans
secured against the value of people’s homes and repayable only
when the home was sold, often after the person had
died<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-22T16:10:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307221000138" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0001.htm#1307221000138">Every
politician<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-22T16:10:54"></hs_TimeCode> that
I have ever discussed this with sees this as a no-brainer.
Unfortunately, officials at both local and national levels over the
years—I do not of course make this charge against any officials
on the current Bill—have taken a rather different view. They
could not understand why anyone would hang onto their house when they
were living in a care home and they did not want to see valuable homes
left empty. The emotional side occasionally escaped
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-22T16:11:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307221000139" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0001.htm#1307221000139">The
Labour Government nevertheless brought in a scheme to allow deferred
payment, but it was essentially sabotaged. A decision was made that no
interest should be paid on the loans, and that gave local authorities a
financial incentive not to make them. Then many
local  
<?notus-xml column=1063?>authorities refused to put schemes in place. If they were challenged in
the courts, they lost, but how many people wanted to mount such
challenges? Or they denied individual applicants who could succeed only
if they showed stamina and determination and lived long enough to see
them

result is that the deferred payment scheme has been, if not a complete
failure, not by any means a success. There are about 8,000 deferred
loans outstanding, which is around 2% of the number of people in care
and maybe twice that for self-funders. Most of the schemes are
short-lasting in practice. The old person takes out a deferred loan and
maybe they hope they will get home after a spell a little longer than
the 12 weeks allowed in law to make a decision. Eventually
they see that they will not be able to return to their own homes and
the deferred loan is brought to an end. It performs a very useful
function for the old person in giving them time to think, but the
schemes are fairly
short-lasting<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-22T16:12:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307221000141" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0001.htm#1307221000141">I
am delighted that the Government have decided to complete the work that

of a suggestion in the Bill that people should in some circumstances
require third-party guarantees on the loans as well as their being
secured against the value of the home. That is belt and braces and I do
not see why families should be providing braces when there is a
perfectly good belt in place. It would particularly apply when the
deferred payment is secured on where somebody else—perhaps the
old person’s son or daughter—lives. At the moment, case
law provides that a local authority cannot in those circumstances force
the sale of a property in order to redeem a mortgage on that property
when somebody else lives there. However, if a guarantee was sought from
the co-owner, the guarantor could be in a position where they are
expected to repay the individual’s care costs based on an
unrealisable value of half of the property they live in. This provision
may put off people who would otherwise have taken advantage of the
scheme and I ask the Minister to look at it

92ZZX concerns the administrative difficulties in the scheme for local
authorities. At the moment, it seems that each local authority will
have to design and implement its own scheme which, as well as being
extremely wasteful, will lead to lousy schemes  as well as good
ones. The amendment requires the Government to design a model scheme
and to provide 
<?notus-xml column=1064?>with it the associated software to local authorities, otherwise the
deferred loan may become a new kind of
postcode lottery, where what you get depends on where you live and not
on your
needs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-22T16:15:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307221000145" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0001.htm#1307221000145">Amendment
92ZZY requires that loans are made available not only to pay care home
fees but to pay for private sector point-of-need insurance policies.
Even with the cap in place, care fees can be
expensive—individuals have to find not only hotel costs but the
excess over what a local authority will pay for them in a care
home—and point-of-need insurance policies are a form of
protection against this if it goes on for a long time. They are
policies that you take out when you go into a home and they go on
paying out for however long you are in there. They are a sensible way
for people to manage this expense. I believe that, over time, the
standard recommendation of independent regulators and financial
advisers for self-funders going into residential care will become,
“You need this or you are still at risk, even with a
cap<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-22T16:16:38"></hs_TimeCode>”.
However, they are expensive and, as their home is the main asset that
many old people have, it is important that the local authority lends
against its value under the deferred payment scheme to fund the
purchase of such policies. If it does not, people will have a choice:
either take out a point-of-need insurance policy, which means you have
to sell your home; or do not sell your home but you cannot then have a
point-of-need
policy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-22T16:16:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307221000146" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0001.htm#1307221000146">Finally,
and perhaps most important, Amendment 92ZZZ, in my name and that of my
noble friend Lord Warner, a member of the Dilnot inquiry, seeks to
defer the start of the deferred payment scheme from 2015 to 2016.

highly complex.</hs_para>

issues which arise. Will a citizen be allowed to choose a care home
even if it costs more than a local authority usually pays, and to what
level? Is there a perverse incentive for local authorities to put
citizens into a residential setting because the loan will be paid for
by the DoH, whereas care at home would be a burden on the local
authority? Who will value the home? Who will pay the cost of the
valuation? Who is responsible for maintaining the home when the person
is in care? Can it be let? By whom, to whom and at what rent? What
about owners with dementia; who will sign the deferred payment
agreement? If there is not a power of attorney in place, what happens
then? Who pays if the house is burgled, squatted, burnt down? Whose
responsibility is it to insure the property? Who provides financial

there is another huge decisive advantage in deferring the new scheme
until 2016 in that it will then come in simultaneously with the cap.
The two schemes are intimately related and they need to start at the
same time so that people can look at their position holistically. It
might make sense for someone to take out a deferred loan in 2015 when
they are 
<?notus-xml column=1065?>available, but it will not make sense for the same person to
take it out in 2016 when there is a cap coming into
play. Really, the difficulties of comprehension defy imagination. You
are talking about older people, some of whom will not be as mentally
agile as they were in their younger days, and you are trying to explain
to them two schemes, both extremely complex and with ramifications for
their and their families’ futures that are very complicated to
understand. At the end of it all, you have to explain that these are
coming into effect at completely different times. It really is an
unnecessary complication—“Election day looms, so

very much with the purpose of my noble friend’s Amendment 92ZZX.
When the Dilnot report proposed the idea of a deferred payment scheme,
it was to be a national scheme that was totally consistent with the
minimum national criteria threshold and portability. I have to say that
we envisaged it coming into operation at the same time as the cap. The
Government’s proposal of universal payment arrangements is
certainly consistent with our approach but it leaves unanswered the
question of whether you want to administer such a scheme through 152
local authorities.</hs_para>

for a central scheme or latching the management of a such a scheme on
to some existing agency. I think that the arguments are relatively
evenly balanced. My noble friend has come up with one way of doing it,
which is a model scheme that would be required to be adopted by most
local authorities. The worst of all worlds would be not to take hold of
this issue and leave it to a marketplace of 152 different bodies
without much guidance or assistance with compatibility of IT and issues
of that kind. We need to hear from the Government how they intend to
ensure that this scheme is operated consistently by 152 local
authorities. I personally do not have an axe to grind one way or
another but I fear that if the Bill is left as it is, we may end up
with a bit of a mess, with a wide range of diversity among the
different local authorities.</hs_para>

of the first part of my noble friend’s Amendment 92ZZY. I shall
be very interested to hear the Minister’s response. The second
part raises a wider issue, which I still think we need to give more
consideration to. There was considerable concern during the Dilnot
inquiry about access to sound, independent financial advice, not just
in relation to a deferred payment scheme but to some of the other
financial products or major financial decisions on paying for care that
people would be taking—often at a time of crisis in a
family’s life. People would not necessarily be as clear-headed
as they might otherwise be. There would be a lot of emotion, and it was
important that people could feel confident about getting impartial
advice. My sense is that as these major changes come closer, the
financial services industry itself might well prefer some stronger
statutory safeguards on accessing quality financial advice, if only to
protect it from accusations that people had been misled.</hs_para>

be made. The new consultation document, at more than 100 pages, which

time to get sorted out. It is another powerful argument for not rushing
our fences and trying to get this all in place by April 2015. We need
some convincing chapter and verse from the Minister on readiness,

I share the view of the noble Lord, Lord Warner, that the potential
effects will vary according to demography. In certain boroughs, the
overall balance of the population and its longevity will mean that this
has a greater impact than elsewhere. For example, in Greater London,
the impact will be completely different in the London Borough of Newham

it should be deferred, perhaps as the noble Lord, Lord Warner,

I would not necessarily support my noble friend on the specification of

instance, on the question asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, we
could see large differences emerge between different local authorities.
That would be unfortunate, and I would be interested to hear from the

of the insurance market. I again ask the Minister to reassure the House
that he is confident that the insurance industry is prepared to come to
market with suitable products. I know that he commented on this last
week, but there remains some doubt about whether insurance companies
really wish to operate in this market. Given that the whole thesis of
Dilnot is that capping cost would lead to the development of an
insurance market, this is something that we need to debate fully and be
reassured

brings me back to the second part of Amendment 92ZZY, which is the
issue of regulated independent financial advice being made available to
a person considering taking out a deferred payment. Surely the Minister
will have been convinced by now that the financial consequences of
decisions made by people in relation to the provisions in this Bill
will be momentous. I would have hoped that by now he would recognise
that the assurance that can be given through independent financial
advice would be an important safeguard. Unless we have that, I fear
that many people will have to make very difficult decisions, involving
potentially large sums of money, without the necessary advice. That
would detract from the generally consensual way in which we need to go
forward. I hope that the Minister will perhaps have some good news for

Campbell-Savours:</Member></B> My Lords, I intervene briefly to ask the
Minister a rather pedantic question. Subsections in Clause 35 all use
the word “may”. There is no actual requirement for the
Government to introduce regulations and therefore for local authorities
to be placed in a position whereby they can charge. Why has it been
left open, rather than using the word “shall”? If we
could take the wording as meaning “shall”, can we assume
that each further instance of the word “may”—that
is to
say:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="1307225000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0001.htm#1307225000066">“The

part of a whole package? Or, if “may” does mean
“may”, might only individual parts of this clause be
introduced, as opposed to the whole clause? For example, subsection (2)
states
that:</hs_parafo><hs_quote UID="1307225000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0001.htm#1307225000067">“The

to be flexible? I am seeking to establish whether, if this is all
going to happen and we should read
“shall” for “may”, all the subsections of
Clause 35 will be implemented and that isolated subsections
will not be introduced in the regulations? That might create

we are exploring in our consultation is the possibility of situations
in which the authority cannot secure its debt through a legal charge on

Lipsey, expressed doubts about this provision and wondered whether the
proposals in the Bill may put people off taking out a deferred payment
plan. Our guiding principle here is that we want as many people as
possible to benefit from deferred payments, but it is equally important
that local authorities are able to secure their debt.</hs_para>

deferred payments have been secured by registering with the Land
Registry a legal charge on the person’s land, but this might not
always be possible or offer sufficient security to allow the authority
to recover its costs. Examples of this might include when a charge
cannot be secured by registration with the Land Registry or where there
is reasonable doubt about the person’s ability to afford the
care home of their choice over the longer term, but we are consulting
on whether there are situations in which offering a deferred payment is
particularly challenging and, if so, on what a constructive way forward
might be. That might include use of a different form of guarantee such
as a solicitor’s agreement or the involvement of a third party.
It is important that the Bill contains this flexibility so that when we
design deferred payments to accommodate all situations that might
arise, individuals’ preferences about the type of security that
they wish to offer can be built in. I hope that this will persuade the
noble Lord to withdraw his amendment, at least for the time

a predictable level but, as the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, might have
sensed—the noble Lord, Lord Warner, may have alerted him to
this—I am concerned that setting the rate in the Bill before we
have finalised other aspects of the scheme is premature. We will
announce the proposed interest rate following the consultation and
decisions on the wider design of the scheme. This will be set out in
the regulations that we will consult upon in 2014. It will be a
nationally set, maximum interest rate and local authorities will not

what he said about equity release as an alternative to deferred
payments. There seem to me to be two absolutely insuperable objects to
that working. One is that you could not have both a deferred mortgage
and an equity release on the same property. You cannot have two things
secured. More importantly, you cannot get equity release on a house
that is empty. The rules of the Equity Release Council—I am on
its advisory board—do not permit that. That is not a possible
solution to the problem which I put

Howe:</Member></B> I have received advice that, technically, that is
not so, but I am more than happy to engage the noble Lord in discussion
after this debate. It would largely depend on the availability of a
deferred scheme, agreed to by a local authority. It would also largely
depend on the quantum of the debt that was already in existence. Of
course, setting aside this particular issue, there could be a property
on which there was pre-existing debt of a considerable size. It would
largely be for the local authority to judge in individual cases whether
it was in a position to offer a deferred payment scheme, looking at the
facts of the case. I do not think one can make generalised remarks
about this. We think that technically it is possible for an equity
release scheme to exist alongside a deferred payment loan. As I say, I

whether deciding what arrangements suit the individual is a matter for
the Government, or

interest rate, it would surely be up to the individual to decide
whether they wished to avail of whatever facility was being offered to
them. I do not it see that it is necessary to go down the path that the
noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, is suggesting, whereby a local authority

hope, on balance, that the Committee will agree—is that it would
be unfair to persist with the current system for longer than is needed.
The timetable we have set out has other advantages. The 2015

support and safeguarding and means that, whenever a local authority
makes a decision about an adult, it must promote the adult’s

skipped past the whole issue of 152 schemes rather rapidly in his
answers and brushed aside most questions. Have the Government actually
considered a national scheme, which was one of my questions? Does the
Minister realise that only a small number of local authorities are
actually running deferred payment schemes? It is a very small
proportion of the total. The overwhelming majority of them have no
experience whatever of running a deferred payment scheme; very few of
them are used to valuing assets. These are all new complexities, but
the Government are not going to be producing their draft regulations
until 2014, by the Minister’s own admission. This is a recipe
for a total shambles.</hs_para>

That includes a national maximum interest rate. I suggest to the noble

all-singing, all-dancing, nationally mandated deferred payment scheme.
We want to build on the good work already going on out there. The noble
Lord made a fair point that only a minority of local authorities
currently operate deferred payment schemes. Of those that do, many
provide us with a very good basis on which to build and share knowledge
with other local authorities. That can start now before the regulations
are drawn up. We can and will start work with local authorities to

was that the Government produce a model scheme that those who wished to
could adopt. It might have some bits that could be added on or taken
away as local options within the national scheme, but it would at least
stop work being done 152 times over. As my noble friend Lord Warner
pointed out, some people are working with this stuff for the first time

an assurance that I—and I hope my Front Bench will do the
same—will not accuse him of a U-turn if later on he finds that
it is not sensible. A syndrome in government that comes up time and
time again is that a Government announce a timetable and, when it is
quite clear it cannot be met, go on fighting like made to preserve
their original timetable. I shall not say the words “unified
benefit”, but I easily could. This does not make any sense. We
are all after the same thing here, and if the Minister

this—that it cannot sensibly be met, let him say so openly and

final point emerges partly from what we were just talking about: things
on which the Government will possibly think again. The noble Lord very
generously said that there are lots of things on which he will want to
engage in discussions; at one stage he said, “at least not for
the time being”, and has made many remarks of that kind. I will
make a purely practical point. It is 22 July and the House will return
to the Bill relatively early in October, although I do not know when,
and many noble Lords are planning to be away for parts of that period.
All of us want to resolve as many of these issues as we possibly can
without the need for confrontation or debate in this House or, heaven
forefend, Divisions, if they can be avoided. Therefore it is rather
important that we all reflect on how we can set up a mechanism so that
we can continue over this period to discuss the outstanding issues. I
know that the Minister will reflect, but he and his officials may want
to have discussions with some of us who are involved, so  that
by the time that we get to Report we will have made use of this
Committee stage and found a way to

its duty or it delays in doing so. The Local Government Ombudsman told
the Joint Committee on the draft Care and Support Bill that failures
may occur, which could have a major impact on the provision of care and
the person’s experience. As noble Lords will know, the process
of assessment and care planning can be arduous and lengthy. It would be
far better for the first authority, which has the relevant experience,
to continue to meet the person’s needs if the second authority

I shall speak to Amendment 92ZZAFA in this group, which is a more
narrowly targeted amendment. It is not unrelated to the amendments
tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, but it is more targeted.
It would amend Clause 38, which deals with where a person’s
ordinary residence is. Ordinary residence rules under the National
Assistance Act 1948 established which local authority has a duty to
fund a person’s care and support, particularly when they are
living in a residential care setting outside their original local
authority area and in another local authority. These rules are often
disputed by local authorities, and every year hundreds of disabled
people are caught in the middle of these disputes, which are mainly
about financial responsibility, of course.</hs_para>

residence disputes are not merely academic; they affect the 
<?notus-xml column=1081?>liability of local authorities, as I have said, but more particularly,
they profoundly affect people’s lives. People who rely on
significant care and support in their daily lives can change where they
live only when all the arrangements are in place. As the noble
Baroness, Lady Campbell, has powerfully demonstrated, they cannot
afford to take the risk of a local authority refusing or delaying
payment of their care, so people’s independence is put at risk
and sometimes severely compromised. For example, there are people like
Peter who, after three happy and productive years at a specialist
college, wants to stay in the area to look for a job. He plans to live
with two fellow students in supported accommodation, but he is under
pressure from his home local authority to go back home. There is Lucy
who has profound physical and learning difficulties. She requires
24-hour care and has been living out of area in residential care in
London. She is ready to live more independently and a voluntary sector
care provider is supporting her to move nearer her family on the south
coast. However, her plans are in limbo because of disputes about
funding her care

Voluntary Organisations Disability Group—an umbrella

describe different care settings by defining what constitutes

Specifically, I understand that regulations will include extra-care
housing, supported living, and shared lives schemes, but the starting
point should be the need for care rather than the specific type of
accommodation. The type of care and the range of settings in which it
is provided are developing quite rapidly. It would therefore be more

for dispute. Some types of accommodation, such as a residential home,
clearly have a care element but with others the picture is far less
clear. For example, there is considerable diversity of definition about
what constitutes domiciliary care as compared with supported living and
what the differences are. This just indicates the sort of issues that
need to be addressed if continuing disputes are to be avoided. These
regulations provide an opportunity to attend the needless consignment

has been pressure on the Welsh Government from Age Cymru and others

whether there is any full Barnett consequential accruing to Wales from

noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, on her amendments and on her persuasive
advocacy in this area. We debated the issue of equivalent services at
Second Reading and the noble Earl said in his response that he felt
that when people move from one local authority to another their
circumstances are, in many cases, likely to change and that after a
move it would not always be appropriate for them to have services
equivalent to those that they had
before<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-22T17:42:28"></hs_TimeCode>. However,
the noble Baroness has answered this point—her amendment has
moved on—and she is not asking for an equivalence of services
but an equivalence of outcome. That is a very important difference that
noble Lords ought to mark. It is a persuasive
case<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-22T17:43:01"></hs_TimeCode>. Of course
it is not possible to say that a new local authority must provide
exactly the same services in the same way, but it must be right to
strive to ensure that the outcome for the person who has moved is the
same<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-22T17:43:11"></hs_TimeCode>. I have a

92ZZAB seeks to ensure that the adult remains informed during the

assessment as soon as it has established the adult’s intention
to move. This requires interaction with the adult from an early stage
and thus provides the opportunity to inform them of progress. We intend

the noble Baroness is not seeking equivalent services and that this is
different from outcomes, a point emphasised also by the noble Lord,
Lord Hunt. Of course, when a person moves it is possible that their
needs for care and support may change; for example, if they move closer
to their family. The noble Baroness is right to focus on
outcomes and we recognise that in the Bill. For example,
Clause 25(1)(d) would include all the matters identified by the person,
including the outcomes they want to achieve. We very much sympathise
with these points and indeed have already revised the provisions

92ZZADA, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, proposes that we
replicate Clause 36(10) for carers. I will explain why this

proposals for funding reform, which we discussed earlier in Committee.
It requires the second local authority to inform the person receiving
care and support if the cost of their eligible needs is different from
that provided by the first authority. This relates to the
individual’s care account and it is right that the authority
informs the person if the amount that counts towards their cap on care
costs has changed. However, carers will not have a care account as they
are not 
<?notus-xml column=1087?>eligible for a cap on costs and there is therefore no need to require
the second authority to inform them of any change in the cost of
meeting their eligible

service user is not moving but the carer is moving home to another
authority, these provisions will not apply. The carer is still
providing care in the original authority and it will continue to be
responsible for meeting their care

92ZZAF, in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, would require
the first authority to continue to meet any needs until it has
satisfied itself that the second authority has met its duty in Clause
37(1). The noble Baroness explained why she felt this was important.
The continuity duty in Clause 37(1) applies from the day of
arrival in the new area. From that point, it is the new
authority’s responsibility to meet the adult’s needs, and
the first authority’s previous duties are discharged. There
should not be a gap in these arrangements. In particular, the
requirement on the second authority to assess the adult before they
move is intended to ensure that the necessary preparation has been
undertaken so that there is no delay. Therefore, this amendment should
not be necessary. Moreover, there is a risk that such a provision could
act as a disincentive on the second authority to meet its obligations
in a timely manner, although I heard what the noble Baroness said in
regard to that. We will develop statutory guidance to support local
authorities in exercising these new duties. That guidance offers a
further opportunity to clarify expectations and ensure that no gap
occurs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307229000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0002.htm#1307229000033">Amendments

92ZZAGH amends the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 so that a local
authority in Scotland can recover from a health and social care trust
in Northern Ireland any expenditure it incurs in the provision of
accommodation or services under Part II of that Act for a person
ordinarily resident in the area of the trust, in the same way as is
already the case if it incurs expenditure for the same reasons for a
person who is ordinarily resident in England or Wales. It also amends
the 1968 Act so that if there is any overlap between the dispute
resolution mechanism in that Act and the procedure in Schedule 1 to the
Bill, the provisions in the Bill will
prevail.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307229000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0002.htm#1307229000042">Amendments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-22T18:01:19"></hs_TimeCode>
92ZZAGB to 92ZZAGG and 92ZZAGJ and 92ZZAGK ensure that the provisions
of Schedule 1 apply to all residential placements made by
Welsh local authorities. Paragraph 2(1) of the Schedule currently
applies only to placements to be made by Welsh authorities under Clause
21 of the Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Bill once it is
enacted. This amendment, which has been agreed by our counterparts in
the Welsh Government, ensures that it also applies to placements to be
made under Clause 22 of that Bill. It will prevent the possibility that
Welsh authorities could place individuals in accommodation in England
under Clause 22, and then cease to have responsibility for
the individuals’
care.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307229000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0002.htm#1307229000043">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-22T18:02:12"></hs_TimeCode>

92AZA to 92AZE, 105W, 106A, 106B, 106C and 108—deal with cases
of provider failure in relation to cross-border placements. Under
Clause 47, local authorities in England are required to step in
temporarily and meet the needs of people whose provider has failed in
their geographic area. This means that the responsibility to ensure
continuity of care falls on the local authority most able to meet
needs, not necessarily the same local authority who made the
arrangements with the failed provider to meet the needs of the adult.
In fulfilling this duty, a local authority must co-operate with any
local authority that made arrangements with the failed provider. It
will be able to recoup costs from that
authority.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307229000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0002.htm#1307229000044">We

I turn to Amendment 92ZZAFA of the noble Lord, Lord Low. Clause 38 is
intended to have effect only if an adult is receiving care and support
in a 
<?notus-xml column=1090?>residential setting. The intention behind it is to ensure that if a
local authority makes such a placement in accommodation in the area of
another authority, the original authority remains responsible for
funding the person’s care. We understand the noble Lord’s
desire to clarify the types of accommodation relevant to this clause.
The intention is to specify in regulations the responsibility for
out-of-area placements in settings other than care homes. As he said,
local authorities can currently fall into dispute over such placements,
and the regulations should resolve this problem. I reassure him that
the Government will consult on the regulations referred to in this
clause.</hs_para>

concerned about the effect of such disputes. I point out that the
Government have issued extensive guidance and statutory directions to
assist local authorities in making decisions about ordinary residence.
Unfortunately there will be occasions when two or more authorities do
not agree on where a person should be considered ordinarily resident.
The statutory directions make clear that all genuine disputes must be
referred to the Secretary of State within four months, so that there is
no excuse for authorities deliberately to stall the process in order to
postpone meeting their financial
responsibility.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307229000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0002.htm#1307229000047">The
noble Lord has flagged some useful elements. He was explicitly
addressing regulations in much of what he said. It is extremely useful
to hear from him. I can reassure him that we are extending the settings
to which ordinary residence is deemed to apply beyond care homes alone.
We shall consult on how best to ensure the regulations are
comprehensive and flexible enough to deal with future changes in the
provision of healthcare and support. I am sure that his comments will
be noted. I thank him and other noble Lords for their contributions. As
ever, we have had a very well informed debate. I hope that I have

I am worried about whether clarifications on the exchange of

reassurance that services will be provided from day one. I understand
that the Government are still working on and clarifying some of the

now understand what “outcomes” means. However, clarifying
in guidance does not yet reassure me, because I have many examples of
services users and their local authorities and good social workers
being in contact with the second authority. They know what is coming

vociferous than any service user. 
<?notus-xml column=1091?>Thus I do not feel that there is an adequate safety net allowing the
disabled person and their carer to be confident that the bills will be

Currently, only financial abuse is defined. The rationale might be that
others types of abuse are better understood and will be set out in the

amendment would add in the different types of abuse as listed in the
<I>No Secrets</I> guidance; for example, physical, sexual,
psychological, neglect and so on. It also includes an

turn to Amendment 92ZZAH. Clause 41 is not clear about where the abuse

small addition here would make it explicit that we are talking not just

otherwise.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1307229000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0002.htm#1307229000059">I
turn to Amendment 92ZF. The Bill introduces a duty on the local
authority to make inquiries when it suspects that an adult is at risk
of, or experiencing, abuse or neglect. However, there is no duty on
other agencies to report to the local authority when they suspect that
an adult is at risk of, or experiencing, abuse or neglect. This is a
gap. Currently, guidance provides information to help agencies make a
judgment about whether they should refer concerns to the local
authority. There are also requirements on providers to notify CQC of
concerns and to have suitable arrangements in place to ensure that
people are safe, but this does not go far enough. There must be a duty
on all relevant partners of the local authority, including providers of
relevant services such as social care, health and housing, to report to
the local authority when they think that an adult is at risk of abuse
or neglect. The Welsh Bill includes such a duty, and we could do worse
than replicating it. Indeed, in the Welsh Bill there is a whole clause

Bill quite rightly allows safeguarding boards the ability to decide how
to meet its objectives. Amendment 92ZC suggests that it is crucial that
regulation and guidance set standards for investigations. It would
require the Secretary of State to set out in regulation and guidance
the thresholds for investigation together with the process. Such a move
would bring much needed clarity for agencies as to roles and
responsibilities as well as faith in the safeguarding system for
families.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307229000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0002.htm#1307229000061">Currently,
it is not always clear what is and is not a safeguarding concern. For

reported, it is crucial that there is a proportionate response. The
threshold for investigation currently differs greatly between local
areas. A safeguarding panel in one area, with a limited understanding
of restraint, may not take a concern seriously whereas another local
area may take action. There is also a lack of connection between
agencies. The serious case review into Winterbourne View found that
there had been plenty of warnings that something was seriously 
<?notus-xml column=1096?>wrong: 40 safeguarding alerts, 29 incidents where the police were
involved and 78 attendances at A&amp;E. However, information did not
flow between agencies: action was not taken. Essentially, they all
believed that someone else was looking. Roles and responsibilities must

compiled by each board should not only include findings of reviews but
what actions have been taken to implement recommendations from the
reviews. It is crucial that we learn from failings and that practices
change. Secondly, I would like to request that the Secretary of State
be added to the list of those who must be sent a copy of the

Greengross:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall speak to several amendments
in this group. I strongly welcome the clauses in the Care Bill that
relate to adult safeguarding. It is right that the abuse of vulnerable
adults should be placed on a statutory footing, alongside domestic
abuse and child abuse. However, these clauses primarily address a
minimum safeguarding infrastructure, and in the main seek to meet the
requirements of professionals. My proposed amendments focus on the
needs of
victims.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307229000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0002.htm#1307229000067">The
prevalence study into elder abuse, funded in part by the Department of
Health and published in 2007, indicated that at least 500,000 older
people experience abuse at home; abuse that is, sadly, often
perpetrated by family members and others whom the victim should be able
to trust. Research by the charity Action on Elder Abuse—I
declare an interest as one of its founders—indicates that fewer
than 10% of the victims come to the attention of adult safeguarding
systems. We clearly must do better than that. However, we must also
recognise that there are more victims than just the older person. No
matter what the circumstances, when someone's mother or father or
sister or brother is abused or neglected, it is not unusual for
relatives to blame themselves—to feel that somehow they should
have known or should have done something. Even when they could not have
done so, there are many more victims of elder abuse than just the older
person. We know that many victims of 
<?notus-xml column=1097?>elder abuse are elderly people who are attacked by their son or
daughter, perhaps because of a long history of domestic violence.
However, they are very reluctant to call the attention of the police or
anyone to those crimes because they see themselves as having failed as
parents.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307229000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0002.htm#1307229000068">The
amendments go to the heart of what is most cruel about elder abuse. Too
many older people are locked away in back rooms, imprisoned by those
who choose to exploit them, and unable to seek assistance. Theirs is a
silent scream that we must hear, and to which we must respond. We
cannot allow abusers the right to deny access to their victims. We must
ensure that we do everything possible to find and support the 90% of
older victims who currently are unsupported, and we must encourage
agencies to work together, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hollins, has
said, to report their concerns about possible victims. We must also
ensure that those who ill treat or neglect vulnerable people are held
to account, because victims and their families deserve to know that

time-consuming, costly and not widely used in such circumstances. The
Law Commission report noted the gap in the law relating to protecting
adults at risk who were being ill treated or neglected but who were not

workers who whistleblow on bad practice within their organisations are
not always properly protected. The Public Interest

aware that a range of service providers, from banks to shops, from
online businesses to public authorities, have difficulty when faced
with one of these attorneys. A solicitor acting for the person in need
of care sets up the power of attorney and holds all the certification.
The person with the power is normally given a number of certified
copies of the warrant to use in fulfilling the role. However, there
seems to be conflict in the minds of many service suppliers between the
need to comply with requests from the holder of power of attorney and
the need to protect their original customer under the rules of the Data
Protection Act. There was an example of a major chain which
acknowledged a request to stop a credit/debit card and then, three
years later, billed the customer for a three-year subscription. The
warrant holder could not resolve the position because the enterprise
would neither contact the solicitor direct nor accept a certified copy
of the warrant. A number of letters and a great many telephone calls
were used to remedy the situation. Then there was the example of the
high street bank that lost two certified copies of a single
warrant—to say nothing of the media company, the card protection
company and a different bank, all of which have refused to deal with
someone with power of
attorney.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307229000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0002.htm#1307229000081">People
in care suffering, for example, from dementia, rely heavily on those
who act for them. Difficulties of the kind just outlined take a lot of
time and effort to resolve. There is a high cost, too, which is
particularly important when the warrant holder is neither being paid
nor charging expenses. I am especially concerned about the plight of
the spouses of those in care. They are often elderly, physically infirm
and hard up. They are often unaccustomed to opposing the will of large
organisations, nor do they necessarily know their way around
officialdom. Warrant holders who are unrelated to the person in care
have severe problems also, in that they may be ignored simply because
they are no relation. Alternatively, how does someone with power of
attorney cope with demands for family top-up fees from a care home
where the managers will not accept that there is 
<?notus-xml column=1100?>no family? Warrant holders have a statutory responsibility and must be
scrupulous in their dealings. Businesses will not understand situations
that create unnecessary
difficulty.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307229000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0002.htm#1307229000082">My
Amendment 92ZFB refers to care homes and fees. The Bill already
concerns itself with the funding of care homes, and the Care Quality
Commission has recently been given explicit responsibility to ensure

concern is with residents’ funding, to which I can find no
reference in the Bill. Indeed, if I have missed it, the Minister will
no doubt point me to it.</hs_para>

complaints about how care home residents and those with power of
attorney on behalf of such residents, are billed, bamboozled and in
some cases bullied. Examples that I have been told about include
over-invoicing which, when challenged, has resulted not in an apology
and a credit note but a computer printout, without headings to any of
the columns, and no possibility of agreement on the overdue balance.
Requests for credit notes are ignored, and the resident or the person
acting on their behalf cannot therefore maintain normal books. Mistakes
by the local authority are visited upon residents in the form of extra
charges that are not cancelled when the original error is corrected.
The Care Quality Commission refuses to get involved, I understand, on
the grounds that it has no duty to examine residents’ funding.
The local authority had come upon similar problems before, but had no
power to intervene. Board members of the newly constituted clinical
commissioning group advised that the only thing to do was query the
figures, ensure the local authority payments were up to date, and never
give in.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307229000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0002.htm#1307229000084">It

procedures to be followed to ensure accurate billing for services
rendered, so that residents and their carers may be certain of their

indication of when, in the latter stages of the Bill, the Government
might decide whether they will enact some of these changes. The
Government’s own consultation document acknowledges that there
is a loophole in the system, allowing providers responsible for
appalling failures in care to escape prosecution. This is what our

approaches taken by the care provider were a contributory factor in the
abuse or neglect, a new offence is created, allowing prosecution of a
registered care provider. This does not undermine the individual

Low of Dalston:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall speak to Amendment 92AA,
which is at the end of this group. It concerns what is potentially one
of the most powerful instruments for protecting people against neglect
and abuse: the Human Rights Act. Amendment 92AA would insert a new
clause after Clause 46 to make all providers of social care services
regulated by the CQC subject to Section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.
The Act applies to all public authorities and to other bodies when they
are performing functions of a public nature. Under Section 6 such
bodies are under a duty to act in a way which is compatible with the
human rights protected by the Act. This duty does not simply arise as a
result of litigation in the courts or dispute resolution, but means
that human rights are part and parcel of the development and delivery
of public
services.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072215000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0002.htm#13072215000003">However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-22T18:45:21"></hs_TimeCode>,
as a result of the case of YL v Birmingham City Council in 2007, a
loophole opened up which meant that care home services provided by
private and third sector organisations under a contract with the local
authority were not considered to fall within the definition of public
function under the Human Rights Act. This decision, that private and
third sector care home providers were not directly bound by the Human
Rights Act, meant that thousands of service users had no direct legal
remedy to hold their providers to account for abuse, neglect or
undignified treatment. Though the public body commissioning services
remained 
<?notus-xml column=1103?>bound by the Human Rights Act, this was of little practical value to the
individual on the receiving end of poor or abusive
treatment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072215000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0002.htm#13072215000004">Following<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-22T18:45:21"></hs_TimeCode>
a sustained campaign the then-Labour Government, with cross-party
support, accepted that the loophole created by the YL decision needed
to be closed. Section 145 was included in the Health and Social Care
Act 2008 to clarify that residential care services provided or arranged
by local authorities are covered by the Human Rights Act. The operative
words are “provided or arranged”. If the noble Earl is
responding to this debate, he will no doubt remember giving his support
to the amendment from the opposition Front Bench.</hs_para>

organisations are concerned, however, that the Bill risks returning the
situation in England and Wales to that at the time of the YL decision.
Section 145 of the Health and Social Care Act refers specifically to
those placed in residential care under Sections 21(1)(a) and 26 of the
National Assistance Act 1948. However, it is expected that these
sections will now be repealed under Clause 107, meaning that Section
145 will no longer have anything to bite on. This amendment seeks
clarification from the Government as to how they propose to deal with
this and an assurance that there will be no regression in human rights
protection.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072215000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0002.htm#13072215000006">However,
this is not the only point. The organisations supporting this amendment
have long been concerned that Section 145 of the Health and Social Care
Act does not cover all care service users or even all residential care
service users. Rather, as I have said, it protects only people placed
in residential care under the National Assistance Act 1948. Having
accepted the argument that primary legislation was required to clarify
that Parliament intended the Human Rights Act to extend to residential
care services provided by private and third sector organisations under
a contract with a local authority, it is anomalous not to treat
residential care provided under other legislation and domiciliary care
in the same way.</hs_para>

the system for arranging care to be introduced by the Bill weaken the
protection. The Bill introduces a single system for arranging care,
whether it takes place in a residential setting or the
recipient’s own home. Under these proposals, where people are
deemed eligible for care but are found after means testing to be
responsible for paying part or all of the cost of that care, they will
be able to request that the local authority arranges their care but may
have to pay it to do so. This new system is likely to reduce the
coverage of the Human Rights Act because people who are entitled to
local authority care in their own home but have to pay for it will no
longer be automatically protected by the Act unless they request that
the local authority arranges their care. Many will not make such a
request, either because they will not be able to afford to pay for
having the local authority arrange their care on top of the cost of the
care itself, or because they will simply not be able to cope with the
bureaucratic hassle.</hs_para>

are those who argue, as their Lordships did in YL, that the right
approach for protecting human rights is not an extension of the Human
Rights Act. An alternative, often suggested, is that regulation can be
better used to target specific issues. The CQC is under a duty to have
due regard to the need to protect the human rights of those using care
services in performing its functions, which include inspecting all care
homes and registered home care providers. It is argued that this gives
self-funders human rights protection, but without a credible prospect
of litigation against the care provider itself, there is reduced
pressure on it to respect and safeguard the human rights of service
users.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13072215000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0002.htm#13072215000015">I
fully accept that bringing all regulated social care services within
the scope of Section 6 of the Human Rights Act will not alone solve the
problems of undignified care and human rights abuses in care settings.
Improved regulation, additional safeguarding legislation and better
training must also play their part. However, the evidence continues to
mount that without direct application of the Human Rights Act and the
proactive approach to promoting and protecting rights that it demands,
abuse, neglect and undignified treatment are commonplace currencies.
The status quo is not acceptable. The proposed amendment offers a
simple, effective and lasting solution to this long-standing problem.
The Human Rights Act can provide an essential safety net for social
care recipients who find themselves in highly vulnerable situations.
The Government must not deny them this

Hodgson of Astley Abbotts:</Member></B> This is my first intervention
on this Bill. It is not an area of government policy in which I have
historically taken a lot of interest so I am some way outside my
comfort zone. However, when I saw that my noble friend Lady Byford had
put down two amendments about financial records and appropriate
billing, both areas I have taken an interest in, I felt I should

glance over at the speaking note prepared for the Front Bench on
Amendment 92ZFA, I would see the words, “Resist on the grounds
that this is unnecessary and the clause already provides for
it”. That may be so, but if you read the Explanatory Note to
Clause 41 carefully, at paragraph 230, I am not sure that it actually
places a duty on the local authority to follow up complaints where they
are made by external parties, such as one holding a power of attorney,
as my noble friend mentioned in her opening remarks. If would be
helpful if my noble friend on the Front Bench could give some
reassurance on this point and also for the record confirm, as I am sure
must be the case, that people holding powers of attorney are

into the Bill by Amendment 92ZFB is a much more significant
development. If the Minister’s officials were to call for and
examine a range of the invoices sent to individual residents or
patients by different companies for the provision of care services, she
would see a considerable variation in the quality and, above all, the
clarity of how the charges are laid out and calculated. To be fair to
the companies, it is not easy to do because it becomes quite complex,
quite quickly. For example, local authority rebate periods do not
always coincide neatly with the charging periods of the individual care
homes. Then there are the charges for extras over and above normal
care. In the vast majority of cases these are entirely legitimate but,
if you look at the records and the way they are laid out, all too often
they are not clearly itemised and often a one-line entry,
“Additional Charges” on an invoice received perhaps a
month later makes it very hard to verify the accuracy or otherwise of
the charge.</hs_para>

forefront of our mind the fact that these invoices are addressed to
elderly people who perhaps are more easily confused or may be
browbeaten. In particular, if they have no relatives or representatives
to help them, they may be over-ready to accept the invoices at face
value and pay them. I particularly support my noble friend’s
amendment because it seems to address three important objectives.
First, it encourages the emergence of best practice among care homes
and the way they lay out their charges. Secondly, it helps individuals
and their families understand what is being charged and whether it is
accurate. Thirdly, and possibly most cynically, it reduces any
temptation to pad invoices with additional items. I do not suppose for
a moment that the precise wording of this amendment meets the standards
required by parliamentary draftsmen. However, I hope when my noble

Pannick:</Member></B> My Lords, I add my support to Amendment 92AA to
which the noble Lord, Lord Low of Dalston, spoke so powerfully a few
minutes ago. I declare an interest—or, more accurately, a
regret—in that I represented YL in the Appellate Committee of
your Lordships’ House and failed to persuade a majority of that
committee that those who operate care homes under a contract with a
local authority are performing a public function for the purposes of
the Human Rights Act and therefore are obliged to comply with 
<?notus-xml column=1107?>human rights principles. The complexity of the legal issues was such
that the much lamented Lord Bingham of Cornhill and the noble and
learned Baroness, Lady Hale of Richmond, both dissented from the views
of the three judges in the
majority.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072215000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0002.htm#13072215000021">As
the noble Lord, Lord Low, has mentioned, Section 145 of the Health and
Social Care Act 2008 addressed the issue by bringing some care home
providers directly within the scope of the Human Rights Act, providing
direct legal protection for residents of such homes. However, important
gaps in the law remain. Duties under the Human Rights Act are not owed
by the person who provides residential care to persons who pay for it
themselves—that is, when the local authority is not
paying—and the provider of care services, when that provider is
not a local authority, has no duties under the Human Rights Act when
providing care in a person’s own
home.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072215000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0002.htm#13072215000022">I share
the concerns of the noble Lord, Lord Low, that, in the light of the
changes to be introduced by this Bill, it is important that the law
should clearly address liability under the Human Rights Act. I agree
with the noble Lord, Lord Low, who made a very powerful case, that the
vulnerability of the person receiving care, and the risk of abuse, mean
that the law should now impose duties on the provider under the Human
Rights Act in all these circumstances to encourage the maintenance of
high standards and provide a direct remedy for the victim in
appropriate cases. It is really no answer for the Government to say, as
they have previously indicated, that it is undesirable in principle to
specify the scope of the Human Rights Act in relation to public
functions. The YL judgment already does that in a deeply unsatisfactory
and narrow manner.</hs_para>

that improved regulation and proper training will play an important
part in protecting the interests of those receiving care. However, I
ask the Minister to accept that the principles and the remedies under

of those receiving it. I hope we will receive a positive response from
the Minister this evening to the amendment from the noble Lord, Lord

Warner:</Member></B> My Lords, I follow the noble Lord, Lord Pannick,
with some trepidation but I do so as a member of the Joint Select
Committee that recommended a change to the Bill along the lines asked
for so eloquently by the noble Lord, Lord Low. I remind the Minister of
an individual case which demonstrates the lacunae in the current
legislation. It was the case of a lady over 90, who wholly self-funded
in a private nursing home. This lady expressed her views—I
suspect rather trenchantly—about assisted dying. She did not ask
them to do anything about assisted dying but merely offered her
views—though probably, as I say, quite trenchantly—but
the home owner and members of staff took great exception to those
views. She was pretty much immediately given four weeks’ notice
to quit. We are talking about an elderly person who was very
vulnerable. Her son took counsel’s opinion, which 
<?notus-xml column=1108?>seemed to be remarkably similar to the views expressed by the noble
Lord, Lord Pannick. We are faced with a situation where you can fall
down on two grounds: on the grounds that you are in a privately
provided home, and on the grounds that you are a self-funder. Whatever
the arguments, and we have been over this ground several times in this
House, the reality is that vague requirements on the CQC to observe the
requirements of the Human Rights Act do not safeguard elderly people in
the kind of case that I have posited.</hs_para>

again, which is why, when the Joint Committee looked at this issue, we
took advice from our adviser, who is legally qualified. If I may remind

Government have to move away from the rather brushing-off response that
they gave to the Joint Committee’s recommendation and think

context. I welcome the work that the Government have done on the
safeguarding clauses. Those of us who work in this area find that
extremely helpful. However, the tone of today’s discussion has

look at trends. There is not a single provider that would object to
being controlled by the Human Rights Act; I think that we all see

Patel of Bradford:</Member></B> My Lords, I had not intended to speak
on these amendments, but they present something of a dichotomy in one
of the areas in the Bill, particularly Amendment 92ZFC from the noble
Baroness, Lady Greengross, on the powers of access. Last year I was
invited by the manager of the local Bradford safeguarding social work
team, a Mr Robert Strachan, who had already thought about this issue
and had had extensive consultation with some of his colleagues, social
work professionals and strategic managers in Bradford. He told me that
opinions varied. At that time, no one had had a problem pulling
together a protection plan for a vulnerable adult within the existing
legislation, although people felt, when they were pushed to the limit,
that such a power could be quite useful. I was gently persuaded by
that.</hs_para>

when talking to Mind, the mental health charity, which has recently
done an extensive consultation with its network, I found that it
believes that this power is disproportionate and unnecessary. Its
members have been clear that they would consider it intrusive and
contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights, and that this
would undermine the trust between social workers and service users.
Mind has sought the views of its network of people with experience of
mental health problems, and was clearly told that there is a mistaken
but prevalent belief that people with mental health problems do not
have the capacity to make decisions about their own safety. Because of
that, many have had negative experiences of intervention, compulsion
and detention, all of which reduce choice and control and can undermine
trust in statutory authorities. Mind argues
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-22T19:17:01"></hs_TimeCode>that introducing
powers of access for social workers is likely to further undermine
trust in statutory authorities and lead to extremely difficult working
relationships between social workers and service providers. I am of
course sympathetic to these views. However, I am also extremely
sympathetic to the views expressed in the arguments from the noble
Baroness, Lady Greengross, so I am a little

only way in which I can look at this is by case example. Let us assume
that an elderly lady is being cared for by her son, who has some
behavioural problems, like the case that we recently had in Bradford
where the grandson actually killed his grandmother. Neighbours report
their concerns to social services, who dutifully go around and visit.
However, they never get further than clacking the front door; the son
tells them that everything is fine and he is looking after his mother.
Further reports of shouting and banging reach the 
<?notus-xml column=1110?>authorities via the neighbours, but still they are refused permission to
enter and see the older lady. What do you do? The police have no powers
of entry but clearly there are some major concerns. How, therefore, to
proceed and establish even that the lady is dead or alive? Powers of
entry, in such extreme circumstances, would allow professionals to
access the house and see the person, as in cases involving domestic
violence or children. I would therefore be broadly inclined to support
the powers, which would add something that is not currently in
place.</hs_para>

the trick would be in the execution of those powers. For example, it
would not be sufficient merely to gain entry. What would you do
next—convey the lady to a place of safety or take the son away?
If you did not, you would be exposing the victim to further and
sustained abuse. This would need thinking through carefully. The
question of how the powers would be controlled and executed would be
difficult but not insurmountable. I look forward to the

an awful case in the papers. People’s reactions to it vary
enormously. When people are polled on their views about this, the
phrasing of the questions in any consultation can have a profound
impact. Were we faced with a question that said: “Would you like
social workers to have the power to intrude into your house?”,
most of us would say no, but if we were asked, “Do you think
that somebody ought to be able to look out for people who are extremely
vulnerable and may not be able to get out and tell anybody?”, we
would say yes. That goes straight to the consultation that the
Government have already held, and the reason for some of its findings.
Professionals who have had experience of dealing with people and
operating under the law have said that they think there needs to be a
greater degree of protection, albeit with brakes and conditions, such
as the necessity of getting the agreement of a JP—not just
social workers barging in because they feel like it.</hs_para>

amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, get the right

because of something the

importance: the largest percentage of people who abuse vulnerable
elderly adults are family members. The consequence of that is that very
often people who are being abused are highly reluctant to do anything
about it because they fear that there will be repercussions against
their family members. That is why it is necessary to have a bit more
legal force behind some of this than we would otherwise think we
should, and I think that, on balance, the noble Baroness’s

learning disabilities—particularly people with mild or moderate
learning disabilities who may not meet the eligibility criteria for

with a learning disability, moved in with them and concerns have been

about family carers; it is a mate crime. It is the sort of crime of
which Steven Hoskin was a victim. He was subsequently murdered.
Somebody moves in, and the local authority is unable to speak to the

Lord Rix—who I am sorry cannot be in his place today—put
forward a strong case for ensuring that safeguarding is explicit in the
Bill alongside the other duties of prevention relating to adults and
carers. We gave strong support to that. The focus on safeguarding
vulnerable adults should not just be on protection once abuse or
neglect has taken place. Local authorities, and agencies on their
behalf, should also be obliged and guided proactively to prevent abuse
occurring in the first
place.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072221000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0002.htm#13072221000011">We
welcome placing safeguarding on a statutory footing in the Bill and the
establishment of statutory safeguarding adults boards. This builds on
legislation, regulations and advice on principles and frameworks for
safeguarding adults and children that Labour established up to 2009 and
which the Government are taking forward in the Bill. We were, however,
always cautious about bringing adult and children’s safeguarding
together under one structure as some councils have done. Adult and
children’s safeguarding issues are not the same, and I would be
grateful if the Minister will comment on the Government’s
approach to this in future.</hs_para>

particularly important in the light of the appalling neglect and abuse
that happened to people with learning difficulties at Winterbourne
View. In this vein, the intention behind Amendment 92ZF to place a duty

92ZFC, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, puts forward a
comprehensive case for the power of access by a third party to private

the Government’s recent consultation response on this issue
shows, there is both strong support and strong opposition among local
authorities, NHS trusts, the health and social care professions and
patients and user organisations on this sensitive and complex issue,
although we have to remember that the consultation response was
relatively low in terms of local authority and NHS trust participation

is clear that there is a significant gap in the current legislation for
dealing with third-party denial of access to some of the most
vulnerable adults—women subject to abuse by violent partners or
a person with a learning disability being bullied by a friend who has
moved into their home—which the Bill needs to take the
opportunity to address. The noble Baroness’s amendment is
strongly supported, by among, others the Equality and Human Rights
Commission, the College of Social Work, Mencap and Age UK and sets out
a tight framework and the limitations and restrictions that would
apply. Local authorities would have to apply to the courts and
demonstrate reasonable cause for suspecting that someone is in danger
of abuse. The Equality and Human Rights Commission argues, as have
noble Lords, that alongside the proposed duty of local authorities to
make inquiries set out in Amendment 92ZFD, the power of access will
enable more intervention in response to allegations or suspicions of
abuse or neglect and get the balance right, as the noble Baroness, Lady
Barker, said. The critical point 
<?notus-xml column=1113?>of the power of access is to enable the local authority to access the
person and speak to them alone to assess the situation. It is not about
entering someone’s house for no good reason. It is a last-resort

the Lords Delegated Powers Committee that the Bill does not define what
is meant by “business failure” or “market

and hold the organisation and its senior management

applies regardless of location. I am happy to confirm that this is the
case. Clause 41 will require a local authority to make inquiries or

importance, which is why those principles are enshrined in the Bill,
beginning with Clause 1, on promoting individual well-being. If a
person does not have capacity to take part in a safeguarding inquiry
concerning them, the local authority should involve any person
appointed to act on their behalf, or, where there is no such a person,
the local authority must itself act in the person’s best
interests. We believe that statutory guidance is the best place to
cover this in more detail, with practical examples to illustrate the
point. As regards the second amendment, on defining abuse, we have
taken the approach of relying on the natural meaning of

suspected abuse or neglect regardless of the motivation

important point links to Amendment 92ZFA, in the name of my noble

in this case it focuses on financial abuse. The local authority must
make inquiries in respect of safeguarding concerns, no matter how they

turn to other amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hollins,

recognise this gap and have placed adult safeguarding reviews on a
statutory footing for the first time. Paragraph 4 of Schedule 2 sets
out detailed requirements for the annual reports of boards. In
particular, the report must include the findings of all reviews and

on safeguarding adult boards to publish their annual reports. The

support services, many of whom are very vulnerable to abuse and
exploitation. We discussed this in detail recently in your
Lordships’ House, on 13 March 2012, during the passage of the
Health and Social Care Act 2012. The matter was debated extensively and
voted on, and the Government won the vote with a substantial majority.
We are not aware of anything having changed in the past nine months
that would cause us to change our
position.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13072221000282" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0002.htm#13072221000282">7.45

Northover:</Member></B> That is a very interesting point. This is a
very serious area. We want to make sure that the Human Rights Act
applies in the way that we think it does, and in the way that the noble
Lord’s Government brought in and thought that it did apply. I
have a feeling that this is an issue that we will revisit. I remember
the discussions last year on this between the noble Lord, Lord Low, my
noble and learned friend Lord Mackay and others. I would not be at all

important point here is to protect people, to make sure that the law
protects them and to do nothing that undermines the effect of the Human
Rights Act in other areas. The Government’s position has been
that all providers of publicly arranged health and social care
services, including those in the private and voluntary sectors, should
consider themselves to be bound by the duty imposed by Section 6 of the
Human Rights Act 1998 not to act in a way that is incompatible with the
convention rights. The CQC, as the regulator, is subject to the HRA,
which may give rise to a positive obligation to ensure that individuals
are protected from treatment that is contrary to their convention
rights. As noble Lords will know, the Ministry of Justice is concerned
that every time you add a provision, you may inadvertently have an
effect on the umbrella application of the
Act.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072221000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0002.htm#13072221000042">The noble

I assure the noble Lord that there will be a consequential amendment to

Amendment 92ZFE, we agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross,
that people who perpetrate or allow abuse and neglect must face serious
consequences, including prosecution where an offence has been
committed. This should also be read in the light of the discussion on
the Human Rights Act. The Bill does not seek to duplicate existing law.
Civil law currently provides redress for cases of neglect, and criminal
law prohibits assault, which would include much of what is sought in
this amendment. We therefore believe that there are already adequate
provisions in place to deal with such
cases.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072221000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0002.htm#13072221000045">My
noble friend Lady Barker spoke of the potential creation of a new

legislation that protects those with capacity, and there are powers

Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 and the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, and
the police also have wide

capacity, there is an existing offence of ill treatment or neglect by a

turn to Amendment 92ZK, in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady
Greengross. We all want local authorities to foster an open and honest
culture in which employees feel able to express genuine
concerns without fear of repercussions. However, we do not feel that
this amendment is necessary. As I think we would all agree, the law on
its own cannot change organisational culture. We need to work with and
through local authorities to consider what barriers exist to the type
of open and honest environment that we want to see. This is something
that we have debated a great deal and there has been much emphasis on
leadership. However, legislation can have an effective role in setting
parameters and reinforcing expectations, which in turn impact on
culture. In this regard, the Government have already confirmed their
intention to introduce an explicit duty of candour on providers of
health and care and support. This will be introduced as a CQC
registration requirement and will mean that providers will have to
ensure that staff and clinicians are open with patients and service
users where there are failings in
care.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072221000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0002.htm#13072221000048">I turn
to the need to be able to gain access to a person suspected of
experiencing abuse or neglect where that access is denied by a third
party. The Government carried out a full consultation on a
potential power of entry, very similar to the access order
proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, in Amendment 92ZFC. We
received no compelling evidence to warrant such a power and, indeed,
there was and remains considerable opposition to it from members of the
public and some third-sector organisations. We have heard some of the
concerns expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Patel, and the contrary view
expressed by my noble friend Lady Barker and the noble Baroness, Lady
Wheeler. We recognise that this is a sensitive and complex area of
work, but we believe that understanding what positive work by skilled
professionals can achieve and promoting that is a more desirable,
effective and sustainable route to take. As with all the new duties and
powers in the Bill, we will pay close attention to implementation and
address any issues that
arise.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072221000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0002.htm#13072221000049">Perhaps
I may mention to the noble Baroness, Lady Wheeler, that, although the
consultation has ended, we have continued to get written correspondence
from both members of the public and third-sector
organisations petitioning the Government not to introduce a
power of entry. They are particularly concerned that such a power would
be used as a quick fix that would neither resolve the
problem nor improve good professional practice where the
intention is to try to build trusting
relationships. From what noble Lords have said, it is very clear that
trying

individual can be very challenging in such

issue that I felt she did not fully address is the need to clarify
thresholds for reporting abuse. I am also disappointed with her
response to the amendment proposing a power of access, which I strongly
support for its relevance to people with learning disabilities. Going
by the feelings that have been expressed in the Committee, I think that
a number of people would welcome an opportunity to discuss some of
these matters a little further and perhaps to bring them back on

Lords, before starting my speech it would be remiss of me if I did not
pay tribute to the late Lord Newton. He was passionate about
administrative justice and provided rigour and challenge in your
Lordships’ House to the proposals contained in the Public Bodies
Act. We will all feel his presence and spirit with us in today’s

purpose of this draft order is to abolish the Administrative Justice
and Tribunals Council using powers provided in the Public Bodies Act
2011. Before setting out further details on the order, I will briefly
explain some of the background. The AJTC is an advisory,
non-departmental public body, not a tribunal or any other form of
judicial body. It does not exercise powers that relate to judicial
independence or judicial decision-making. It was created before much of
the reform of recent years was implemented—crucially before a
unified tribunal structure was put in
place<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-22T20:02:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072221000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0002.htm#13072221000056">The
Government announced proposed reforms to public bodies on 14 October
2010. It was considered that the oversight of the administrative
justice system and development of policy was properly a function of
government, and also that the AJTC’s oversight functions with
regard to tribunals were no longer required, given the governance and
oversight arrangements that exist within HMCTS. The AJTC was therefore
included for abolition in the Public Bodies Bill. A public
consultation, including the proposal to abolish the AJTC, was launched
on 12 July 2011 and closed on 11 October 2011. The Government’s
response to the consultation was published on 15 December 2011. After
considering all the responses to the consultation, the decision was
that the AJTC should be abolished. Following further policy development
and discussions with the devolved Administrations during 2012, the
draft order was laid before Parliament on 18 December 2012.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13072221000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0002.htm#13072221000057">Noble Lords will no
doubt be aware of the scrutiny given to this draft order by both the
Justice Committee in the other place and the Secondary Legislation
Scrutiny Committee in this House. The Secondary Legislation Scrutiny
Committee has fulfilled its role in that regard with its customary
thoroughness, but that is not to say that I am in agreement with all
its conclusions. Section 8 of the Public Bodies Act provides certain
criteria that Ministers must consider have been met when making an
order under the Act. Taking each of these in turn will give a full
account of how the order meets the requirements of the Act.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13072221000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0002.htm#13072221000058">On<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-22T20:09:24"></hs_TimeCode>
efficiency, abolishing the AJTC will remove duplication of functions
and ensure that the state provides only what is necessary to support
the administrative justice and tribunals system.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-22T20:04:48"></hs_TimeCode> reforms of
recent years mean that the vast majority of the system is now
administered by HMCTS and so is managed independently of the
departments whose decisions are being challenged. I believe that this
is a 
<?notus-xml column=1127?>vital point. I know that in a debate on the Public Bodies Bill the noble
Lord, Lord Pannick, expressed concern that the Government are often
defendants in tribunal proceedings. This in no way
compromises the independence of the tribunals judiciary which
determines cases impartially and acts independently. This independence
is also reflected in the governance of HMCTS which has an independent,
non-executive chair and has two judicial representatives on its board.
It also has a dual reporting line to both the Lord Chancellor and the
Lord Chief
Justice<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-22T20:05:29"></hs_TimeCode>. For
those limited number of bodies that are outside the oversight of HMCTS,
Ministry of Justice officials already work with the relevant
departments, the bodies themselves and others to identify and share
good practice as well as tackle areas of concern. This is an approach
that works well. It is solution focused and one that the department is
keen to build
on<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-22T20:05:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072221000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0002.htm#13072221000059">The
<I>Administrative Justice and Tribunals Strategic Work Programme</I>,
published in December 2012, sets out the areas on which the Government
will focus until 2015. Objectives include improving initial
decision-making by government and making systems and processes more
accessible and proportionate for users. The noble Lord, Lord Borrie,
commented at Report that there will no longer be a group coming
together and discussing important issues of administrative justice. The
Government listened to such concerns and in May 2012 established the
Administrative Justice Advisory Group, which provides an expert and
critical forum to review the system from a user perspective against the
strategic work programme. The advisory group supports and guides this
by informing policy development from the perspective of users of the
system. For instance, members from the group contributed to the
development of the strategic work programme ahead of its publication.
The group is also able to form sub-groups to look at specific issues,
such as improving user guidance. To date the advisory group has been
chaired by a director from the MoJ. Having reflected on concerns raised
by your Lordships’ Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee, my
right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Justice has decided
to appoint an independent chair to the advisory group on abolition of
the AJTC. Whoever fills the post will have responsibility for ensuring
the group’s collaboration to give robust, evidence-based
challenge; building consensus and ensuring that the different
representative bodies work together; galvanising action to inform
improvements to the system in line with the MoJ’s principles of
efficiency, fairness and accessibility; providing strong leadership to
the group and representing its views to Parliament; and ensuring that
the group delivers on its aims and objectives, as set out in its terms

economy, those opposed to abolition have cited the modest or
insubstantial savings involved and questioned the estimates provided by
the ministry. Let me be clear on both counts: the AJTC currently costs
£700,000 per year to operate. While this represents a reduction
from its 2010-11 budget of £1.2 million, it is still a
significant amount of money at this time. Based on a revised closure
date of late August, which allows for a four-week orderly close-down
period following parliamentary approval to the order, we estimate gross

<?notus-xml column=1128?>savings of around £1.2 million across the remainder of 2013-14
and 2014-15. Costs of closure are estimated to be around £0.6
million over the same period. This includes £300,000 for
possible redundancies at the AJTC and £300,000 for
reimbursements to the Scottish and Welsh Governments for the creation
of interim non-statutory bodies to replace the AJTC in Scotland and
Wales. This means net savings of around £0.6 million
over the rest of this spending review period and, of course, this would
represent a long-term saving well beyond the spending period. No
further costs are estimated from our successor arrangements. The
advisory group is supported using existing resources within the policy
group in MoJ. The costs of recruiting and remunerating the independent
chair of the AJAG are negligible—some £10,000 to
£15,000—and will be met from the budget required to
implement policy changes.</hs_para>

appropriate accountability to Ministers. The abolition of the AJTC will
not result in any loss of accountability. Ministers are, and will
remain, ultimately accountable for the administrative justice system
and for HMCTS as an executive agency of MoJ. HMCTS is responsible for
the performance of the unified system. A minority of tribunals sit
outside HMCTS and remain accountable to Ministers through their
respective departmental channels. MoJ will re-examine the case for
bringing these remaining existing tribunals into the unified tribunal
system. Where they are not brought into the unified system, MoJ will
still, as it does now, keep their administration and performance under
review.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072221000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0002.htm#13072221000062">On the
removal or loss of protections, rights and freedoms, the abolition of
the AJTC will not result in the removal of any necessary protection and
no person will be prevented from exercising a right or freedom that
they might reasonably expect to continue to exercise. Abolition does
not prevent anyone from accessing a tribunal or an ombudsman to
vindicate or protect their rights or freedoms. Tribunal users can still
make their voices heard by raising concerns with their elected
representatives or through the user groups that exist in most HMCTS
tribunal jurisdictions. Concerns may also be raised by their elected
representatives with the Parliamentary and Health Service
Ombudsman.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072221000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0002.htm#13072221000063">I
stress that no part of the administrative justice system currently
included under the AJTC’s overview remit will be left out under
the new arrangements, including those tribunals and bodies currently
outside the unified tribunal system. There is no “hiatus”
in oversight as has been mentioned in scrutiny reports. HMCTS’s
governance structure, with its strong judicial representation, provides
a clear level of protection to the public in respect of its oversight
of the unified tribunal system.</hs_para>

have an important role to play in scrutinising the work of the
department. In his response to the Public Administration Select
Committee report on the future oversight of administrative justice in
May 2012, the Lord Chancellor agreed, following the AJTC’s
abolition, to report annually to the Public Administration Select
Committee on the following: details of the resourcing of the
department’s administrative justice function; actions taken by
Ministers and officials to improve the operation of the system; details
of how 
<?notus-xml column=1129?>the views of users of the administrative justice system have been sought
and addressed; and details of work undertaken with other
departments, devolved Administrations and local government to improve
administrative justice for the citizen. Parliament will therefore have
the means of ensuring that the Government are held to account for
oversight in this area and provide a further layer of protection for
the public.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072221000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0002.htm#13072221000065">It
is important to have had this opportunity to set out in some detail the
Government’s plans for oversight of the administrative justice
and tribunals system following abolition of the AJTC. What we propose
is about delivering real improvements, based on ministerial priorities
and on evidence gathered by capable and experienced officials working
with colleagues and experts from other departments and from across the
system. We disagree that oversight has always to take place at
arm’s length from Ministers and departments. It is absolutely in
the interest of government to reduce demand on the system, get
decisions right first time and make the system accessible and
proportionate to users. This, I think, we are doing. I commend this

revealed what I think is the abiding problem of the Labour Party when
looking at these matters: savings are always trivial and can be
dismissed; always look for the firewall of a committee to get between a
Minister and responsibility; and, if in doubt, appoint a consultant or,
even better, a tsar. It is a philosophical difference between us. I
really do believe that this is where responsibility lies and that the
effective oversight he called for should be oversight in Parliament by
parliamentarians to Ministers at the Dispatch Box. We will have to
disagree on some of these matters, but I will try to answer a number of
the points that he

the Minister’s argument. Indeed, one could go on to examine
further the problems with a system administered by HMCTS, not least in
the context that that organisation itself will presumably be subject to
some reorganisation or privatisation of some of its functions. I do not
accept that that can offer an independent service, nor that independent
agency is superfluous. It is very important for public confidence that
there should be an independent body as effective as the council and its
predecessor have been. However, it is clear that the Government are

Patel of Bradford:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall also speak to
Amendment 92AZ. I welcome the aspects of the Bill that are aimed at
securing the sustainability of the social care sector and social care
provision. It is particularly important to put measures in place
setting out the action to be taken to protect people from the negative
impacts of business failure in adult social care. However, I have some
concerns about the key clauses that relate to provider failure and
market oversight. I refer specifically to Clauses 47 to 54, 
<?notus-xml column=1136?>which specify the criteria for the application of market oversight,
determine whether criteria apply to a care provider and cover the
assessment of financial sustainability of care
providers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-22T21:01:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072221000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0003.htm#13072221000100">Amendment
92AY focuses on the financial regulation of providers. The Bill
currently allocates to the Care Quality Commission responsibility for
maintaining quality care services, mitigating risk to business
sustainability and ensuring continuity of care for any person who
receives care services. These steps will include obtaining regular
financial and relevant performance information, working with the
provider to develop a sustainability plan to manage any risk to the
organisation’s ongoing sustainability, using powers to
commission an independent business review to help the provider to
return to financial stability and requiring information from the
provider to enable the CQC to support local authorities to manage
provider
failure<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-22T21:02:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that all providers of care and support services should be subject to
thorough financial checks which may indicate that a care organisation
might be unable to fulfil its obligations as a provider of services in
the future. However, plans to allocate responsibility for financial
regulation to the CQC appear to be poorly thought through and Monitor,
as the current financial regulator for health services, should assume
this role. The pressures facing the CQC as part of its expanded remit
for regulating quality across the health and social care sectors have
already been eloquently highlighted in previous debates on this Bill by
many noble Lords, including the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, and my
noble friends Lord Hunt and Lord
Campbell-Savours.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072221000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0003.htm#13072221000102">We
are all aware that the CQC is undergoing significant structural change
and it does not have the capacity and organisational expertise to take
on responsibility for assessing the financial stability of care
providers. This is being proposed because of the belief that service
users would benefit from having a single regulator, specifically the
CQC, to oversee care and support services and provide an overall
assessment of performance, combining quality and financial data. I am
also aware that the Francis report highlighted the importance of
simplifying the quality and financial regulation regime for health
providers to eradicate overlap and minimise the gaps between the
functions of the different organisations and regulators. This included
changes to the current division of regulatory responsibilities between
Monitor and the Care Quality
Commission.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072221000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0003.htm#13072221000103">However,
the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, in a previous debate, specifically
highlighted the key concerns—which I share—about giving
the CQC additional responsibilities for financial assessment. He
stated, and I agree, that the CQC is not prepared for these additional
responsibilities. I would question whether it has the specialist staff,
skills, experience and, most importantly, expertise required to decide
whether care providers have financial
sustainability<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-22T21:04:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

demands it faces, the CQC will also be pressured into developing a
rushed financial accountability system, without proper consultation and
checks and balances. These additional responsibilities for financial
regulation place added pressure on an organisation that is already
undergoing significant change and faces a greatly increased workload as
part 
<?notus-xml column=1137?>of its expanded duties for quality assurance. The development of a
poor-quality financial accountability system will only affect its
credibility further and I therefore question the rationale for
designating the CQC as a financial regulator for the care and support
sector<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-22T21:05:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Health and Social Care Act 2012, Monitor became the economic regulator
to promote effective and efficient providers of health and care,
promote competition, regulate prices and safeguard the continuity of
services. Monitor can license providers, work with NHS England to set
prices for NHS-funded services, prevent anti-competitive behaviour and
work with commissioners to ensure continuity of services when providers
get into financial difficulty. I would therefore argue that Monitor
already has its own robust financial oversight regime for healthcare
providers that can be adapted and applied to the social care sector;
and the Government should use these existing powers as a means to
effectively regulate the sector in the future. My amendment to Clause
52, on the assessment of financial sustainability of care providers,
simply replaces the CQC with Monitor. I hope that the noble Earl will
agree that this is a sensible and helpful
amendment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072221000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0003.htm#13072221000106">I
now turn to Amendment 92AZ on the accountability of commissioners. As
many noble Lords have commented throughout the Committee stage, the
focus in the Bill on greater integration between health and social care
services is to be welcomed. As services between health and social care
become more integrated, it is essential that the plans of local
authorities face the same levels of scrutiny as clinical commissioning
groups and have clear lines of local and national
accountability.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072221000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0003.htm#13072221000107">However,
there is at present no effective regime in place to oversee and monitor
the standard of local authorities’ commissioning of care and
support services. The annual performance assessments
previously undertaken by the Care Quality Commission to evaluate the
quality of councils’ commissioning of adult social care services
were scrapped in 2010. Of course, the Minister may argue that the
scrutiny of commissioning plans is now covered under the provisions of
the Health and Social Care Act 2012 and that additional oversight is
not therefore
required.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072221000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0003.htm#13072221000108">I
know that that Act contains a number of duties that focus on aligning
the plans of clinical commissioning groups and health and well-being
boards to ensure that clinical commissioning groups take into account
the joint strategic needs assessments when preparing their
commissioning plans. Equally, I am also aware that health and
well-being boards are expected to have a key role in bringing together
local authorities, clinical commissioning groups and local Healthwatch
to assess the health and care needs of local populations through joint
strategic needs assessments and joint health and well-being
strategies.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072221000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0003.htm#13072221000109">However,
recent cases such as those at Winterbourne View and Southern Cross have
demonstrated the devastating impact on vulnerable people when
commissioners, commissioning systems and processes are found wanting.
Winterbourne View was set up as an assessment, treatment and
rehabilitation centre for people with learning disabilities and autism,
but 
<?notus-xml column=1138?>the review into Winterbourne View found that it had “strayed
far” from this purpose and stated that the commissioners, as
well as the owners, Castlebeck, were to blame for this. The primary
care trust commissioners who placed people at Winterbourne View did not
set performance targets for the company or effectively check the
progress of patients, despite being charged an average of £3,500
a week for places. Their reviews were clearly flawed, completely
ineffective and did not bring to light either concerns about the
quality of assessment and treatment or the detail of abusive practices.
Strategic health authorities also did not effectively
performance-manage primary care trusts in their commissioning of
placements for this client group. The review concluded that closed
establishments such as Winterbourne View would benefit from a more
prescriptive approach. This includes far more effective planning
processes, and performance management and monitoring systems by
commissioners.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072221000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0003.htm#13072221000110">That
is why I am proposing a new clause that focuses on the accountability
of commissioning organisations that would give NHS England a duty to
scrutinise the commissioning plans of local authorities for adult
social care services to ensure that they are upholding the safety and
care of vulnerable people, and the efficient and effective operation of
a market. Equally, notwithstanding my previous comments, I would be
content if the noble Earl thought that the CQC rather than NHS England
would be able to provide that scrutiny. I beg to

Warner:</Member></B> My Lords, I intervene briefly to make a couple of
observations and put a question to the Minister on this set of
amendments. I must confess that I am not thrilled by the idea of NHS
England being asked to supervise the commissioning of local
authorities. I think that it may struggle to supervise the
commissioning of 211 clinical commissioning groups, or however many we
have this week, without our turning it loose on 152 local authorities
as well. There must be some doubts about whether it is the right body
to supervise local authority
commissioning.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072221000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0003.htm#13072221000112">My<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>

makes a very fair point in asking where we will get some sort of
overview of the quality of local authority commissioning. It may not be
NHS England, but we could perhaps have some idea of the
Government’s thinking on how they will be satisfied that the
commissioning is of a reasonable standard across 152 local authorities.
If the Minister could tell us this evening which quality assurance
mechanism the Government have in mind, that would be a useful
insight.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072221000113" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0003.htm#13072221000113">The
other point was about whether it should be Monitor rather than the CQC.
This is an area where I have struggled quite a lot, because I think
that there is a problem with what is going on with the financing of
adult social care. Who actually bankrolls the providers in this sector?
I question whether, without a lot more expertise, either Monitor or CQC
are well placed to penetrate some of the private equity models of
financing adult social care provision. These models are being brought
in almost as we
speak.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072221000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0003.htm#13072221000114">The<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
financial complexities of this sector are very considerable. The
providers of residential and nursing home care within the adult social
care sector have 
<?notus-xml column=1139?>moved on a long way since my days in local government as a director of
social services. People are assembling packages of money to buy groups
of homes, and they put groups of homes together in what is often
basically a hedge fund or private equity-type process, essentially
consolidating providers in this sector. The days of mom and pop homes
seem to be passing quite quickly, as the sector tries to secure greater
financial capability to respond to the buffets of a market
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072221000115" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0003.htm#13072221000115">In
this extraordinarily complicated market, it is not clear to me how the
Government will equip any regulator—or help it equip
itself—to secure the expertise to actually raise the money to
buy and merge groups of residential and nursing home providers. It is
not a very transparent system. Either CQC or Monitor will require a lot
of expertise. It will have to go into territory into which few of us
are equipped to go, and find out what is actually going on, if we are
not to have another Southern Cross
experience.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072221000116" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0003.htm#13072221000116">I<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
suggest that the risks of that happening again are becoming greater as
the funding systems for these organisations become less transparent.
They are not publicly quoted companies, and in many cases they are
hidden behind a rather mysterious cloak of financial allocations.
Without making adverse comments, I suggest we look at what happened
with Four Seasons, which was taken over by Terra Firma. Where are the
loyalties? Are the loyalties of that organisation to the people
receiving care, or are they to the people who are creating the funds
for the purchase of that organisation? I would like some reassurance
that CQC or Monitor—I do not feel strongly doctrinal, one way or
the other—will have the expertise to penetrate some of these
rather opaque organisations that are now involved in funding providers

Mackay of Clashfern:</Member></B> My Lords, when this issue was
discussed previously I had the feeling that Monitor had at least some
claim to having the kind of expertise which goes some distance in this
area whereas, as far as I could understand it,
CQC did not seem to. I entirely agree with the noble Lord, Lord Warner,
that what either of them has at the moment is probably unequal to the
task of seeking out exactly what is going on and seeing how great the
risks are. It is pretty obvious that to understand the risks in these
financial transactions is a very difficult task. We have seen examples,
not particularly in this area but in others, where serious risks have
emerged which were not suspected until very close to the time of their
emergence.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13072221000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0003.htm#13072221000118">I
also agree with the view that one great factor in the care regime is
the number of local authorities that are to be involved. Some degree of
understanding at least the variation across these 152 authorities is
essential. During the workings of the Joint Committee, I was impressed
by the skill of some of the local authority representatives we had
before us but they were in quite a particular position in relation to
their work. I am not sure that their knowledge, expertise and feel for
the situation necessarily goes right across the sector. I do not at all
decry the valuable work that local authorities 
<?notus-xml column=1140?>do but the variety of tasks assigned to them is very great and the care

Hunt of Kings Heath:</Member></B> My Lords, this is an important debate
and the collapse of Southern Cross has brought it home to us how the
risk of financial failure is likely to be a continuing problem in this
sector. That is why it is important to understand whether the
regulatory regime that the Government are proposing will be robust
enough and whether it will have access to the kind of information that
will enable the regulator to take a view on the viability of those
companies which seek to do business in this
area.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072221000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0003.htm#13072221000120">We are
going back partly to our earlier debates when we discussed the new
failure regime. At that time, I referred to the Department of Health
factsheet that we were given, which said that the new failure regime
will give regulators clear roles in tackling failure. However, I do not
think that is actually so in practice. According to the department, the
Care Quality Commission will focus on exposing problems and requiring
action while Monitor and the NHS Trust Development Authority, which
deal with non-foundation trusts, will focus on intervening if a poorly
performing provider is unable to resolve the situation by working with
commissioners. As we have heard today, the CQC retains enforcement
powers for social care, general practice and independent sector
providers. This whole picture is very confusing and in his Mid

complexity can contribute to system failings.</hs_para>

relation to safety and quality, they simply carry out the instructions
of the CQC or have to go through the same process to satisfy themselves
as public bodies with specific statutory duties—certainly in the
case of Monitor—whether they share the concern about quality or
simply take the CQC’s word on trust. As the actions of these

the Government have reflected on our earlier debate and have come to
the view that it would be a very good thing to prescribe that all local
authorities should have their commissioning performance reviewed by the
CQC as a matter of priority.</hs_parafo>

noble friend raised the question of Winterbourne View. We debated the
problem of the contracts local authorities have set with private
providers where they are contracting staff on very low rates of pay.
These are the same providers which in some cases are giving 15-minute
periods of service, with staff on zero-hour contracts and often having
to pay the cost of their travel. I do not believe that those are the
right circumstances in which a quality service could be given. That is
why I believe that the CQC should prioritise the commissioning
responsibilities of local authorities. If it did, it would answer the
question posed by my noble

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, I begin with an observation that I hope is
incontrovertible: it is unacceptable for care users to be left without
the services that they need, particularly where the interruption of
those services, or the worry that this might happen, could badly affect
their well-being and place unacceptable stress on them and their
families, friends and carers. As the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, rightly
observed, the collapse of Southern Cross in the autumn of 2012
highlighted the importance of this principle. Although no one was
ultimately left without the services they needed, many people suffered
from a considerable amount of stress and anxiety as a result of worries
over whether the services that they, their friend or their relative
relied on would stop being provided. At the time, there were no formal
mechanisms for the Government to ensure that that was the
case.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13072221000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0003.htm#13072221000127">The
Government are therefore introducing, through the Bill, a new system of
financial oversight of the 50 to 60 providers of care and support that
are the most 
<?notus-xml column=1142?>difficult to replace. The system will provide local authorities with
early warning that one of those providers is likely to fail or could
fail, and will support authorities to ensure that, if a provider does
fail, the continuity of care is maintained. The Care Quality Commission
will assess the financial sustainability of all providers that are part
of the regime, ensure that providers are taking adequate steps to
tackle any risks to the sustainability of their business and support
local authorities to tackle the risk of individuals suffering gaps in
the services that they rely on when providers
fail.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072221000128" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0003.htm#13072221000128">I
sympathise with the arguments set out by the noble Lord, Lord Patel of
Bradford, in favour of this function being undertaken by Monitor. He
should be under no misapprehension: the decision about which regulator
should undertake this role was a finely balanced one. This would have
been a new role for either regulator. For the CQC, although its
existing powers extended to some financial issues, it had not in
practice used them significantly. For Monitor, this would have been an
extension into a new market and type of provider with which it had had
no previous experience. In the end, we came to the view that the CQC
was the most appropriate body to perform this market oversight
function, for three key reasons. First, this approach ensures that
there will be a single regulator for care and support providers. The
financial performance of a provider, whether exceptionally good or
exceptionally poor, can be a leading indicator of serious quality
failures. The CQC will be able to integrate quality and financial
information and assess both together.</hs_para>

better placed to implement this regime because of the existing working
relationships that it already has with providers through its current
role. This should also contribute to minimising the regulatory burden
on providers by ensuring that they have to work with and provide
information to only one regulator rather than two. Thirdly, the CQC
already has established working relationships with local authority
commissioners. The main objective of this regime is to support local
authorities in managing the failure of a difficult-to-replace provider.
The CQC’s existing relationships will be invaluable in assisting
it in performing this function
effectively.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072221000130" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0003.htm#13072221000130">The
noble Lord, Lord Hunt, questioned that rationale and pointed
particularly to the advantages of Monitor undertaking the role, not
least because of its current functions. I am the first to accept that
Monitor has existing expertise in financial regulation, but it does not
have experience in the care and support services market. The nature of
Monitor’s licensing regime differs from this market oversight
role in two key ways.</hs_para>

Monitor’s regime oversees the financial performance of very
different bodies operating in a very different environment. The market
in adult social care services is considerably
more diverse; it is constituted predominantly of independent providers
and involves different financing and funding arrangements. Secondly,
the focus of market oversight is to ensure that individuals continue to
receive the services they depend upon during the failure of a provider
rather than to manage the failure itself. In contrast to this approach,
Monitor operates a failure regime during 
<?notus-xml column=1143?>which it may implement a special administration to take control of the
provider’s affairs and directly manage the failure.
Monitor’s existing expertise, although, of course, relevant,
would not be sufficient to fulfil this
role.</hs_para>

of double regulation, we have taken steps to mitigate it by exempting
care providers who offer both social care and NHS-funded services from
Monitor’s licensing regime. Regulations laid before Parliament
create this exemption where the services provided are NHS continuing
healthcare or NHS-funded nursing care. The exemption will expire in
April 2015, at which point we will review whether it should be
renewed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072221000133" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0003.htm#13072221000133">The
noble Lord, Lord Patel of Bradford, argued that the CQC does not have
the capacity to undertake this additional role as it is undergoing
structural change. The CQC and the Government recognise that
improvements are needed in the way that the CQC carries out its
regulatory role, and we are putting in place a range of steps to ensure
that these improvements are made. Under new leadership, the CQC is
overhauling its regulatory approach, and I am very encouraged by the
progress it has made. It is led by a new chair, a new chief executive,
as the noble Lord knows, and new chief inspectors of hospitals, adult
social care and, shortly, general practice. The CQC is developing a
more specialist approach to regulation that will place providers under
greater scrutiny. The Department of Health is working with the CQC to
ensure that it is ready to implement the system from April
2015.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072221000134" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0003.htm#13072221000134">The

to secure the necessary expertise to oversee providers, including the

the CQC whether it will require additional financial or other support

Howe:</Member></B> The noble Lord makes an extremely important point,
and one that has not been lost on us. We recognise that
ownership structures can be extremely complex and that true ownership
can be hidden from normal view. It is one of the factors that we will
have to build into our discussions with the CQC. I do not pretend that
there is an easy answer because some businesses quite consciously and
deliberately set themselves up to ensure that it is very difficult to
probe the true state of their financial affairs and their true
ownership. As and when I can come back to the noble Lord on where we
are with that, I will be very happy to do
so.</hs_para>

Howe:</Member></B> My noble and learned friend is, of course, right.
That goes back to a question posed in an earlier group by the noble
Baroness, Lady Wheeler, about what the definition is of business
failure. We propose to define in regulations circumstances in which a
provider can be deemed to have failed. Those circumstances may include
a situation in which a provider is struggling to service its debts as
they fall due or has breached its financial covenants under loan
agreements, or an administrator, liquidator or receiver has been
appointed—which is a clear-cut case of failure. As I said, this
will be defined in regulations because we want to capture these various
different scenarios where a business can be deemed to have failed. We
will, of course, consult on the regulations before they are laid. No
doubt what I have just said will be refined and augmented during that
process.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072221000139" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0003.htm#13072221000139"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Warner" PimsId="4525" UID="13072221000323" xid="1486" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0003.htm#13072221000323">Lord
Warner:</Member></B> The Minister mentioned that the Government will
look very closely at some of these ownership issues and their opacity.
Will he be willing to look at some of the other sectors which have been
regulated? I would cite water and the electricity and gas industries,
where we are already seeing the emergence of a clear conflict between
the rights and needs of shareholders and those of consumers. There are
lessons to be learnt from these other sectors, which now have a lot of
experience of regulators trying to hold the balance between those who
invest and those who are receiving the services from the providers of
those services. Consolidation has also taken place in those industries,
particularly in the energy sectors.</hs_para>

seeing the early stages of consolidation, which is moving apace. Given
the vulnerabilities of the people who live in these homes, it is
conceivable that some ownership patterns could simply not be acceptable
in this particular sector because of the high risk that they pose for
the users of the services. Will the Government look at those other
sectors and at that issue as they start to consider this? I
am the last person to want to stop new entrants coming into a market,
but Southern Cross was a wake-up call for us. We have to see whether
certain ownership patterns have too much of a conflict of interest
between the investor and the user of the services for us to be able to
be comfortable that they could ever deliver the bacon in a satisfactory
way.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072221000141" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0003.htm#13072221000141"><B><Member ContinuationText="Earl Howe" PimsId="1035" UID="13072221000324" xid="1749" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0003.htm#13072221000324">Earl

question of whether there should be central oversight of local
authority commissioning practices. I wholeheartedly agree with many of
the arguments that have been expressed this evening. Commissioning
practices which risk undermining personal dignity and lowering quality
are simply not acceptable. That is why Clause 5 of the Bill introduces
a duty on local authorities to shape high-quality, diverse and
sustainable markets in care and support services. Clause 5(4) requires
local authorities to have regard to this duty when commissioning
services. As I said when the Committee discussed Clause 5, we are aware
that there are examples of poor commissioning practice across the
country. We need to move away from overly prescriptive commissioning
that focuses only on price or time slots, to consider how it can do
things differently and deliver better outcomes in quality
care.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072221000143" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0003.htm#13072221000143">In
relation to the option of central oversight of local authority
commissioning that the noble Lord, Lord Patel of Bradford, suggested,
the Bill leaves open the possibility of the CQC conducting reviews of
local authority commissioning. However, by enabling the CQC to review
local authority commissioning, if it is prescribed in regulations, the
Bill gives us the opportunity to discuss this option further. In
particular, we are considering whether the new chief inspector, who
will work with local authorities that commission care and support,
should have a formal role in assuring the performance of those
authorities, building on the strength of the current programme of
improvement activity and peer assurance led by
councils.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072221000144" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0003.htm#13072221000144">I
emphasise at this stage that if there is to be central oversight of
commissioning, the CQC, as a consequence of its links with the chief
inspector and its existing relationships with, and expertise in, the
social care sector, will be the most appropriate body to undertake this
function. Although we have not closed our minds to the option of
central oversight of local authority commissioning, the fundamental
problems underlying poor commissioning practices are cultural and
structural. Central oversight on its own will not necessarily tackle
these
issues.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072221000145" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0003.htm#13072221000145">The
noble Lord, Lord Warner, asked how we could be satisfied that local
authorities’ commissioning will be of a suitable quality. It
goes without saying that it is for local authorities to decide the most
appropriate way for them to fulfil their duty of commissioning and of
shaping local markets, responding to local needs and circumstances.
They will be accountable locally for those decisions. However, we are
working with local authorities to support them to develop their
capacity to shape local markets. We launched a programme of support
last year and intend to continue working with local authorities to
improve commissioning practices. We are committed to working with the
sector to support local authorities to shape diverse and high-quality
markets, including through improving commissioning practices, through
the recently announced homecare challenge and through a programme to
support the authorities in their market-shaping

regulations, he singled out three issues that were relevant to why the
CQC was chosen: having a single regulator, better relationships with
local authorities and better relationships with commissioners. That
goes some way towards reassuring me, but I still feel, coming back to

45,000—children or young people from newborns to the age of 19
who have long-term health conditions which will eventually end the
lives of most of them and for which they may require palliative care.
Medical advances mean that more young people with a range of different

conditions who are more cognitively able struggle to achieve
independence or to enter education or employment because plans are not
made for them. Those who are unlikely to be cured by treatment are
offered palliative care. Transition for children after their 16th
birthday is complex. Successful transition needs to address the
transfer of responsibility for young people from children to existing
adult social care, health and education services, and the development

all young people, many of those who need palliative care want to strike
out on their own and establish their independence. It should be
remembered that these are children who are on longer-term palliative
care. They hope to go into further or higher education, get a job, move
into their own home and develop a social life. Amendment 94 would
ensure that young people’s aspirations to move into their own
homes would be included in the transition plan. Tragically, as a result
of lack of planning, many are unable to do so. Too many of these young

they will be eligible for an EHC plan until the age of 25. I recognise
that an EHC plan could fulfil the functions that I intend a transition
plan in my amendment to do. Indeed, an optimal position would be where
EHC plans are available to all young disabled people up to the age of
25. In lieu of that, this amendment is necessarily lengthy—I

which have been added to Clauses 56, 58 and 61 blur the distinction
between consideration of needs and ways of meeting needs, other than
through services at the stage of assessment, before any decision about
whether the child, child carer or young carer have eligible needs. The
assessment process should show what the needs for care and support are
before consideration is given to how those needs will be
met.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072221000174" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0003.htm#13072221000174">Carers
UK—I declare an interest as its vice president—has tested
the wording of these clauses on a number of front-line workers and
their belief is that practice will be adversely affected. The
distinction is important because if consideration of needs does not
precede consideration of ways to meet those needs, there is a danger
that needs will be defined with regard to whatever support is available
and could result in children, young carers and parent carers finding it
more difficult to access statutory care and support as a result of
assumptions being made about the informal support that is available.
These amendments seek to remove any risk that family and friends will
be unduly and inappropriately relied on to provide care and support to
the child, child carer or young carer, and to ensure that care and

amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Patel, to which I have added
my name, emphasise the importance of the transition period to parent
carers and disabled young adults and the vulnerability of both groups.
I have little to add to his very eloquent presentation. It is sometimes
remarkably difficult to focus the attention of policy-makers on the
needs of parent carers. I have often been puzzled as to why that is. I
think it may be about the very decided views that we all have about
parental responsibility.</hs_para>

understand that the responsibility we gladly take for our non-disabled
children is very different from what we expect from the parents of a
child with special needs. These parent carers can find themselves
providing care for many years and often at the very heavy end of
caring—for example, someone who has severe mental and physical
disabilities may 
<?notus-xml column=1152?>need lifting and continence care—and for 24 hours a day. Do I
need to point out that keeping such people engaged in caring by giving
them enough support to stop them breaking down makes very sound
economic as well as moral sense? At no point is this support more
important than the transition stage, as the noble Lord, Lord Patel, has
so eloquently reminded

welcome the attempt in the Bill to tackle the issue of transition from
children’s services to adult social services and to try to make
it work for young people. Clauses 55 to 63 undoubtedly present an
important step in the right direction. However, some improvements are
needed to ensure that the Bill provides the appropriate legal basis for
the smooth transition for young people from children’s services
to adult services that I am sure we would all like to see, and to
remove the cliff edge that has been referred to in this and previous
debates.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307232000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0003.htm#1307232000003">First,
Amendment 92BA relates to Clause 63, which is about the continuity of
services and is designed to ensure that if adult care and support is
not in place by the time the child reaches 18, the services they
receive under other legislation will continue until adult care and
support is put in place. The potential for this change to benefit young
disabled people making the transition to adulthood is very much to be
welcomed. However, the benefits outlined in Clause 63 apply only if a
request has been made for a child’s needs assessment by the time
that child turns 18. The concern remains that some young people will
not be able to benefit from this protection because they or their
parents or carers will not be aware that they need to request an
assessment by the time they are 18. Therefore, the amendment would
ensure that every child who is receiving support under the relevant
legislation and is likely to continue to have a support need after the
age of 18 receives that assessment and the benefits that flow from
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307232000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0003.htm#1307232000004">With regard
to Amendment 92BA, as I have said in some of our earlier debates on the
Bill, there is an overlap in the jurisdiction between this Bill and the
Children and Families Bill, which specifically relates to social care
for young people entering adulthood. The proposed new education, health
and care plans, which the Children and Families Bill sets out to
introduce, are at the very centre of this debate. If the aim of the
current legislation is to create a better, joined-up system—as I
think it should be and I am sure that other noble Lords agree—it
is vital that the Care Bill makes reference to these EHC
plans.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307232000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0003.htm#1307232000005">I will
briefly explain that important link between the two Bills. At the same
time as the Care Bill aims to bring adult social care into the 21st
century, the Children and Families Bill aims to create a new joined-up
system of support for children and young people with special
educational needs between the ages of nought and 25. Plainly, with the
Care Bill applying to adults from the age of 18 and the Children and
Families Bill setting out the framework for children and young people
up to the age of 25, there is an overlap in the 18-to-25 age range. It
is vital that these plans are able 
<?notus-xml column=1153?>to talk to each other if we are really to have the sort of integrated
system that we all want, and if we are to achieve that desired goal of
a one-stop shop of services that young people can access when they need
them.</hs_para>

Adebowale:</Member></B> My Lords, I support Amendments 92B, 92C and
92D, which are also in the names of the noble Baroness, Lady
Pitkeathley, and the noble Lord, Lord Patel, who have spoken eloquently
on this matter. I declare an interest as the chief executive of Turning
Point, which provides health and social care to many young people in
the process of transition. I know, as we all do, that transition can be
a very delicate process if not done well. Young people slip through the
net between children’s and adult services and begin their adult
lives without adequate care and support, which risks deterioration of
physical and mental health, and the escalation of need to the point of
crisis. That is both immoral and
expensive.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307232000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0003.htm#1307232000008">The
Bill goes a long way to improve the current situation. I am pleased to
hear that Ministers informed the House during an earlier session that
discussions between the Department of Health and the Department for
Education about the links referred to between this Bill and the
Children and Families Bill are already taking place. These transition
amendments offer an opportunity for us to go further—it is quite
rare for a Bill to offer an opportunity to do something quite brilliant
for young people—and to ensure that all young people receive
support under other legislation. That support is likely to continue
after young people reach 18 and they will receive an offer of a needs
assessment from their local authority. Importantly, this process will
begin in good
time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307232000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0003.htm#1307232000009">This
includes those young people—or their families and carers, as has
already been mentioned—who have not themselves requested an

cases, as mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Tyler, where a family
just does not realise that they need to request an assessment. Good
transition is about helping to ensure that local authorities are better
prepared to meet the needs of young people. If assessments can be
conducted earlier, so long as this is what young people and their
families want, care and support can be in place sooner, and there is
less risk of people’s needs escalating to the point of

Warner:</Member></B> My Lords, I will make two quick points, the hour
being late. The Government need to look again at the way this Bill
works with the Children and Families Bill. These arrangements look
clunky for those moving from childhood into adulthood. The real problem
is that this Bill does not seem to work on the basis that many, if not
most, of these children will be known to the same local authority. Why,
then, is this Bill framed as though they are strangers coming into the
system, in which the local authority is permitted 
<?notus-xml column=1154?>to involve them? The local authority should have an obligation to make
seamless the move from childhood to adult services. The Bill does not
really deliver that. The Government need to look again at that
transition point, and reconcile the Children and Families Bill and the
Care Bill, because they do not work together as well as they
might.</hs_para><hs_time UID="1307232000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0003.htm#1307232000042">10.15

I, too, may raise the connection of this Bill with the Children and

of 25, there is a clear overlap in their jurisdiction in the context of
social care provision. Education, health and care plans under the
Children and Families Bill also include an assessment of a child or
young person’s social care needs, which means that young people
between the ages of 18 and 25 may be eligible both for an EHC plan and
an adult care and support plan. That seems to reinforce my noble friend

understanding—perhaps the Minister could confirm this—is
that the Government are considering bringing forward amendments to the

support. Clause 59 provides a power, rather than a duty, for local
authorities to provide support because existing children’s
legislation already includes provision for support to a child’s

and children’s services in relation to any review of the plan
under Clause 6(5)(a) and (b). Such co-operation for those
under 18 who are in transition is provided for by Clause 6(5)(c). This
would include co-operation with the preparation, maintenance and review
of the EHC plan as provided for by the Children and Families Bill, in
respect of children. Guidance can ensure that this is

requiring a local authority to make arrangements to secure provision
for children and young people with a transition plan would not be
appropriate. Services to children cannot be provided under the Care
Bill. Children’s legislation provides for this. Services to
young people over the age of 18 would be provided, if necessary, under
provisions earlier in Part
1.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307232000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0003.htm#1307232000026">In relation
to Amendment 104ZA, I agree on the need to ensure continuity of care.
However, we must avoid creating overlap or confusion with local
authorities’ existing duties in relation to children, including
rights to assessment and support under the Children Act
1989. For this reason, it would be preferable for the young person to
request assessment as they see fit and for the local authority to
initiate this conversation with the child. The request itself is not
envisaged as a formal process. Indeed, for some young people the
request will form part of a conversation the local authority initiates
about transition to adulthood. Guidance can be used to make this
point.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1307232000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-0003.htm#1307232000027">Young
people and their families will need information in order that they can
understand the adult care and support system and, crucially, that they

experiencing a gap in their care and support. I agree. Provision for
people over the age of 18 already exists at Clauses 36 and 37 and
provision for children with an Education Health and Care plan exists in
the Children and Families Bill. If a young person under the age of 18

from the draft Bill and asked why that was the case. The Bill as
introduced includes greater clarification as to the nature of the
assessment that should be carried out and what should be considered. It
is largely for drafting reasons that we split the subsections relating
to children, children’s carers and young carers into two
subsections for each group.</hs_para>

young people are strangers to the local authority. The Bill makes
provision both for those who are receiving children’s services

receiving care and support. Clause 6 provides a duty to co-operate,
including within the local authority. In particular, in relation to
children transitioning to adulthood, there is a duty for those internal
discussions to take place. The request mechanism in the Bill is not

My Lords, the Government are committed to providing
an environment for all sectors of the economy in which private
enterprise and businesses can flourish. A key objective is to simplify
employment legislation and remove unnecessary burdens from businesses.
As part of this, the Government have taken forward legislation through
the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013 to end the separate
agricultural minimum wage regime in England and Wales and to bring
employment in agriculture into line with other sectors of the
economy.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1307226000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#1307226000004">The
amendments which the Government are proposing to the Working Time
Regulations 1998 are a necessary consequence of the abolition of the
Agricultural Wages Board for England and Wales on 25 June 2013 and the
end of the separate agricultural minimum wage regime after 30 September
2013. Agricultural workers are already protected by the main provisions
of the Working Time Regulations, including those relating to the
maximum 48 hour week. However, some minor technical amendments are
needed to align the position for agricultural workers in England and
Wales fully under the regulations with that of workers in other sectors
of the economy. If approved, these amendments will come into force on 1
October 2013, when the current special regulatory framework for
agricultural minimum wages will end.</hs_para>

proposed amendments will remove some very specific exemptions in the
1998 regulations which apply only to workers employed in agriculture.
These are in relation to the date of the commencement of the leave year
and the arrangements for giving notice to take leave. Under the Working
Time Regulations, the leave year for a worker begins on the date
provided for in a relevant agreement. Where there is no provision in a
relevant agreement, the date of commencement of the leave year for a
new employee is the date or anniversary 
<?notus-xml column=388?>of the date of commencement of employment. For agricultural workers in
England and Wales, the commencement of the leave year is governed by
the provisions of the Agricultural Wages (England and Wales) Order
2012, which will remain in force until 1 October. The order
requires that the leave year for all agricultural workers begins on 1
October. There are also specific arrangements in the Working Time
Regulations for taking leave which require workers to give their
employer advance notice of the intention to take leave and for the
employer to give similar notice if either they require the worker to
take leave or do not agree to a request for leave from the worker.
These arrangements provide transparency and certainty for workers and
employers, but do not currently apply to agricultural
workers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307226000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#1307226000006">If
approved, these amendments mean that where agricultural workers in
England and Wales come into the industry and enter into employment
contracts after 30 September, the arrangements in respect of
commencement of the leave year and for leave-taking will be brought in
line with the arrangements for other workers under the 1998
regulations. For agricultural workers already employed before 1
October, their existing arrangements will remain in place until the end
of their current employment. This will ensure that there is no risk of
loss of annual leave entitlement for agricultural workers during a
period of employment. Any agricultural worker who is employed between
now and 1 October must still be treated in accordance with the full
terms and conditions set out in the agricultural wages order 2012. A
worker in this position will similarly retain the arrangements for
commencement of the leave year and leave-taking as provided for under
the order until the end of their current employment.</hs_para>

the Working Time Regulations 1998 are not approved, once the
agricultural wages order 2012 ceases to be in force after 30 September
this year, there would be no default position for commencement of the
leave year, nor arrangements for giving notice to take leave for new
agricultural workers coming into the industry after that date. This
could cause uncertainty and confusion for both agricultural workers and
their
employers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307226000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#1307226000008">It
may be helpful here to say something more generally about the proposed
application of the Working Time Regulations to agricultural workers
after 30 September 2013. From 1 October, all new workers coming into
the industry in England and Wales will be protected by the National
Minimum Wage Act and the Working Time Regulations, as are other workers
in different sectors of the economy. This means that agricultural
workers will be entitled to at least the minimum requirements for
annual leave entitlement and length of rest breaks as provided for by
the 1998 regulations, although we would expect that many employers will
agree terms which are more favourable to their workers than the minima
set in the
legislation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307226000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#1307226000009">Currently,
under the terms of the agricultural wages order 2012, agricultural
workers have enhanced entitlements for annual leave and rest breaks.
The Government have made very clear during debates in Parliament on the
amendment to the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act to abolish the
agricultural 
<?notus-xml column=389?>wages board that agricultural workers will retain any existing
contractual rights, including relating to leave and rest breaks. This
has been enshrined in the relevant secondary legislation abolishing the
board and the agricultural minimum wage
regime.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307226000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#1307226000010">Therefore,
let me reassure noble Lords that the amendments we are now proposing to
the Working Time Regulations will not have any impact on these existing
contractual rights. Workers with pre-existing contracts at 1 October
2013 will retain the right to the annual leave entitlement and length
of rest break determined in their contract of employment, unless either
they agree with their employer to vary their contract or the contract
comes to an end. These amendments are a necessary tidying-up exercise
as the result of the abolition of the agricultural wages board and the
agricultural minimum wage regime. Without them, for agricultural
workers who take up new employment on or after 1 October 2013, there
would be legal uncertainty and no clear provision as to the

have vehemently opposed the whole principle of the agricultural wages
board. I am not in essence opposing the provision today because, as the
noble Lord said, it is a logical tidying-up measure. However, serious
questions arise about its timing and the way in which it has been
introduced. He will recall that during the passage of the Enterprise
and Regulatory Reform Act there were arguments about the impact
assessment produced by the Government at that stage, which Ministers in
effect discounted and put to one side. To some extent the Minister has
repeated that today. That impact assessment produced for Defra showed a
total detriment to agricultural workers of about £250 million
over 10 years and a consequential benefit to farmers from that saving
in their wages bill. I argued at the time that that was a notional
benefit to farmers since, in effect, most of it would end up in the
pockets of the supermarkets. Nevertheless, that was the
Government’s argument at the time. During the course of
deliberations, they disavowed that whole impact assessment.</hs_para>

noble Lord has repeated today that many employers will improve the
terms and conditions of agricultural workers. That, however, is totally
contrary to the best expert advice available to the ministry at the
time that the amendment to the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act was
put through. In relation to limits on hours, I suspect there is not a
big detriment. There may even be a benefit. However, we do not have
another impact assessment. We do not have any indication of there being
any analysis by the department as to which way that would

the Government’s logic is to bring everything in line with
general minimum terms and conditions legislation, whether in terms of
the minimum wage Act or the working time directive and the legislation
stemming from that. I think that that is logical. However, it is
perhaps also interesting that Regulation 3 of this very short
instrument enshrines the Government’s view that the conditions
of the existing workforce, or those who are taken on before 1 October,
will not be changed by this enactment. That is, of course, legally
correct. However, the current terms and conditions will remain in place
only until they are altered, until the employer gives notice of the end
of their terms and

totality of the Government’s approach here is to change the
balance of power between the employee in the agricultural sector and
the farmer or other employer. It is hardly worth the paper that it is
written on to say that existing terms and conditions will continue to
apply to those who are already in the workforce. It may take a few
months or a few years for that to change. One of the reasons that the
impact assessment was ultimately rejected by Ministers on the Floor of
the House was that they recognised there would be a significant
disbenefit to workers in the industry: not only new workers but
existing workers would be faced with the likelihood of their terms and
conditions being changed once the agricultural wages board

think the Minister is probably right that this is relatively
straightforward and unlikely to cause huge detriment. It is
nevertheless part of the overall principle that we have opposed from
these Benches. It is part of the attitude towards wages within the

said that, my main concern about the timing of this relates to the way
in which it was written. It continues to provide for Scotland to be
excluded from this measure because Scotland has always had its own
agricultural wages board and still does. That means that it applies in
England and Wales. Only last week, however, the Welsh Assembly passed
legislation to establish a statutory body within Wales which would have
the possibility of retaining the statutory force both of the substance
and of the enforcement of the agricultural wages board. There would,
therefore, be a new agricultural wages board for
Wales<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307226000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#1307226000019">Surely
it would be more sensible to wait to introduce any consequential
statutory instruments until it was clear how they would in theory apply
to Wales—until it is clear how that new Welsh structure will
evolve. The original proposition from Wales was that the legislation
would not apply to Wales. They were, therefore, broadly content that
the previous way in which the AWB had applied to the Welsh farming
workforce would continue. However, we are now chipping away at that for
workers in Wales as far as working time is
concerned<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-22T15:44:37"></hs_TimeCode>. That

Minister implied that the agricultural wages board was all about the
minimum wage for farm workers. It is worth reminding the Committee at

issue of Wales in a moment, but this also follows yesterday’s
Tolpuddle festival—an occasion on which, in beautiful sunny
Dorset, we remember the Tolpuddle Martyrs. In 1834, George Loveless,
James Loveless, James Hammett, James Brine, Thomas Standfield and
Thomas’s son John were all charged with having taken an illegal
oath and then transported to Australia. That was the basis of the

noble friend was right to probe the lack of an impact assessment. At
the time, we kept returning to the impact assessment for the
legislation which abolished the agricultural wages board, and we will
keep reminding people that 150,000 workers are affected by the
abolition of the board and that £240 million will be taken out
of farm workers’ pockets. I know that that is contested by the
Government, but they did not take advantage of this opportunity to
publish any kind of impact assessment on these regulations to repair
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-22T15:47:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307226000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#1307226000024">I
also want to comment on the implications for existing terms and
conditions for individual employees. The abolition of the agricultural
wages order largely protects existing employees engaged prior to 1
October 2013 with no specific contractual provisions. However, I note
an article in <I>Farming UK</I> dated 26 June which quotes Colin Hall,
a partner at BTF Partnership and a director of the 50 Club

saying:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="1307226000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#1307226000053">“For
others, however, such as those more recently employed with a specific

greater.”</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="1307226000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#1307226000052">There
may be some currently employed workers who have particular contractual

bringing into force of the regulations that we are debating
today.</hs_parafo>

July—I know that he is a keen listener to “Farming
Today”, and I am sure that he is as assiduous in reading
<I>Farmers’ Weekly</I><I>—</I>about Peter Bailey, who was
employed as a tractor driver and stockman in Berkshire for more than 22
years. He was awarded £38,000 for underpayment of wages after
working an average 55-hour week at a farm there. Defra took up the case
with the board and in the end Mr Bailey was able, through a tribunal,
to prove that he was being exploited, not getting the pay he was
entitled to and forced to work more hours than he should have, and that
his employer was at fault. The tribunal found against the employer.
That was a contravention of the old agricultural wages order but
demonstrates that some farmers struggle to put existing employment
regulations into proper effect. As things change, it is a particularly
vulnerable time for employers. We need to ensure that they are properly
advised so that they do not, inadvertently, do the wrong thing by their
staff.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307226000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#1307226000026">It is
equally important that farm workers know their rights, reduced as they
are. For any of them listening, I strongly recommend that if they are
not a member of a trade union they quickly join because they will need
one more than before as they will have to negotiate their pay and
conditions on a case-by-case basis with employers. They will need the
advice and support of a trade union to do that effectively. It is also
worth noting—this was not something that was in force or that we
even knew about when we debated the legislation to get rid of the
board—that as of 29 July, this month, workers unfairly dismissed
or discriminated against by their employers will be charged a fee for
taking their claim to a tribunal. That means, in the absence of the
protection of the agricultural wages board, that these typically
extremely lowly paid workers will be denied the access to justice of a
tribunal unless they are willing to pay a fee, with no guarantee, if
the case is found in their favour, that they will get that
fee back.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307226000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#1307226000027">It is
worth saying that the law is also changing so that if their
employer—who might be their landlord—sidles up to them in
the farmyard and makes them an offer to do things slightly differently
and change terms and conditions, they would not be able to use that
conversation in a tribunal either. That would no longer be admissible.
I find that of huge regret, and we were not able to debate it when
those orders went through. The changes to their pay and conditions as a
result of this order and the new law abolishing the agricultural wages
board increase the risk of agricultural workers
suffering.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307226000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#1307226000028">My

laid before that decision was made by the Welsh Assembly Government, so
perhaps there is unfortunate rather than deliberate problems of timing.
It will certainly be September before the other place has a chance to
debate these regulations. If we do not have a satisfactory answer from
the Minister now, we will have to decide whether 
<?notus-xml column=393?>we want to pray against the regulations or leave it for the Minister to
come back with some proper consideration of these matters when they
come to the Commons in September. There will certainly be a problem if
the agricultural wages board arrangements are to apply in Wales while
the changes to leave entitlement are being made in these regulations.
The exemptions were put in place in 1998 for a good reason. If they are

delicacy of the position of the Attorney-General in looking at the
question of competence of the Welsh Assembly, in advice going to the
Attorney-General presumably the department has made clear the point
that I made when the Government made a similar point during the passage
of the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act: that although the
Government have now invented the doctrine that this is employment
legislation, since at least 1948, the wages board has been the
responsibility of Defra or MAFF, not of whatever department was
responsible for employment law. That may not be a clincher for the
Attorney-General, but it is an important indication of the approach of
previous Governments and in previous legislation—that is, as a
matter of agricultural not general employment
legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-22T16:02:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307226000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#1307226000045"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord De Mauley" PimsId="4732" UID="1307226000074" xid="1856" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#1307226000074">Lord

I may continue with the next series of points. The Government’s
position, as noble Lords know, is that abolishing the agricultural
minimum wage will bring agriculture into line with other sectors in the
economy. Allowing farmers to compete fairly in the labour market and
for agricultural wages to follow market levels will enhance the
competitiveness of the sector and may increase employment. This will in
turn encourage long-term prosperity in rural
areas.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307226000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#1307226000047">Having
said that, my experience is that workers, often on highly complex
machinery and managing animals, which these days is also a pretty
technical affair, are highly skilled and that the market for them is
highly competitive. We have been quite clear that there is uncertainty
about what the actual impact will be. The costs and benefits are made
up of a number of elements, including the potential impact on wages for
workers and other terms and conditions and the reduction in employment
costs paid to government and others. The reality will, as I said,
depend on demand, which evidence shows is
increasing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-22T16:03:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307226000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#1307226000048">The
real benefits will be from allowing farmers and workers the same
flexibility to agree terms and conditions as employers and workers in
other sectors of the economy, while ensuring the same levels of
protection for workers. As I said in my opening remarks, workers with
pre-existing contracts will retain those entitlements, and that is
enshrined in legislation. I take the noble Lord’s point about
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307226000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#1307226000049">The noble
Lord, Lord Knight, made a number of points. I acknowledge what he said
about what is covered by the agricultural wages board. Of course he is
right. Essentially, he asked why we had not done any back-assessment on
the regulations. As we discussed, 
<?notus-xml column=396?>these are minor, technical amendments to the Working Time Regulations as
a consequence of abolition of the agricultural wages board. They do not
have an impact on the level of protection for workers, nor do we
consider that they will have a significant impact on businesses, so an

Government firmly believe that the end of the separate agricultural
minimum wage regime is in the best interests of the industry. The
proposed amendments to the Working Time Regulations are a minor piece
of the jigsaw to complete a simplified employment regime across all
sectors of the economy. This will provide simplification, transparency
and greater flexibility, thereby encouraging investment, growth and job
opportunities in the sector, which will benefit both workers and
employers. A successful agricultural industry will contribute to the
growth of the wider rural economy, which is one of my
department’s four key objectives. I beg to

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, as noble Lords will be aware, this
Government established the Equitable Life payment scheme in 2010 to
make payments totalling up to £1.5 billion to as many as 1
million former Equitable Life policyholders who suffered financial
losses as a result of government maladministration that occurred in the
regulation of Equitable Life. Since the establishment of the scheme,
the Government have received representations suggesting that a specific
group of elderly policyholders who bought their with-profits annuity
from Equitable Life before 1 September 1992 should be included within
the scheme.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1307227000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#1307227000002">The Government remain of
the view that there is no basis for their inclusion in the scheme. The
reasons for the exclusion of this group of policyholders are well
documented and have been subject to debate in Parliament. In short, the
Equitable Life payment scheme is based on the understanding that those
investing with Equitable Life relied on regulatory returns that were
subject to government maladministration. As such, they had lost the
opportunity to make a fully informed decision and if they had had this
opportunity, they might have invested elsewhere. The first returns 
<?notus-xml column=397?>that would have been different if maladministration had not occurred
were those of 1991, which would not have influenced
policyholders’ decisions until September 1992. Therefore,
investment decisions made before this time are not included in the
scheme.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307227000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#1307227000003">However,
it is clear that this particular group of policyholders are under
financial pressure in their later years, as they have not received the
income they hoped for from the Equitable Life annuity that they bought
more than 20 years ago. In this year’s Budget, the Chancellor
announced that the Government will make an ex-gratia payment of
£5,000 to those individuals who bought an Equitable Life
with-profits annuity before 1 September 1992 and were aged over 60 on
20 March 2013. An additional £5,000 will be available
to those policyholders who meet the above criteria and are in receipt
of pension credit.</hs_para>

before the Committee today confirm the rules surrounding these
payments. Policyholders will not be required to prove their eligibility
for these payments; instead policyholder information held by the
Prudential, which makes regular annuity payments to all Equitable Life
with-profits annuitants, will be used to identify those eligible for a
payment. Eligible individuals will receive one payment of
£5,000—£10,000 if they are in receipt of pension
credit—regardless of the number of policies they hold. I can
also confirm that should an annuitant pass away after the Budget
announcement on 20 March this year but before receiving their payment,
the payment will be made to their estate. The rules are available in
full on the Government’s
website.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307227000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#1307227000005">The
Government recognise the need to issue these payments to elderly
individuals as soon as possible. The Treasury has been considering all
the possible options for delivering these payments quickly and
efficiently. I am pleased to confirm that it now plans to make these
payments within the current financial year, rather than in 2014-15 as
previously envisaged. It is currently planned that in the coming months
letters will be dispatched to all eligible policyholders to inform them
of the Government’s plans to make these payments. A few months
after that takes place, the payments will be issued to all living
pre-1992 WPA policyholders. Payments to estates, and the £5,000
additional payment made to those overseas policyholders in respect of
their receiving a specified equivalent to pension credit, will be made
later this financial
year.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307227000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#1307227000006">The
letter sent to all eligible policyholders will also advise that they
check their eligibility for pension credit. Individuals will have until
1 November this year to do that, and to apply for pension credit if
necessary. Policyholder information will then be securely shared with
the Department for Work and Pensions to identify those eligible
policyholders in receipt of pension credit. The payments due to them
will be increased from £5,000 to £10,000 accordingly
before they are dispatched. More information on the delivery of these
payments will be announced in due course. Finally, I draw the
Committee’s attention to a correction slip issued today that
makes minor corrections to the numbering of the regulations. I commend
the regulations to the Committee.</hs_para>

introduction to these regulations. They take us back to the saga of
Equitable Life, which spawned a range of inquiries and reviews,
including those by the FSA, the Treasury Select Committee, the
actuarial profession, the Treasury, the
ombudsman—twice—and the Public Administration Committee.
I do not propose to pick over those in detail this afternoon. As we
have heard, they culminated in the Equitable Life (Payments) Act, which
came before your Lordships’ House in 2010 as a money Bill. The
Act, which we supported, introduced a payment scheme to be operated by
an independent commission. It would seem that the scheme is well under
way and is open until April 2014, although annuitants will clearly
continue to be paid
thereafter.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307227000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#1307227000008">One
bone of contention with the proposed scheme was the overall amount of
money allocated, although the Parliamentary Ombudsman recommended the
need to reflect a public interest consideration and the impact on the
public purse. Another bone of contention was the starting date of the

from September 1992. In justifying not including earlier investment,

regulations have slightly recast that so that it applies only to those

simply matters of judgment. Should it be five rather than four rather

were Equitable Life policyholders who had not got the sort of benefit

the fact that they were not subject to maladministration in the same

people. The overall cost, which is, I think, £45

Minister of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord McNally):</Member></B> My
Lords, the three sets of regulations before us today contain the detail
of selection processes for judicial appointments and the composition of
the Judicial Appointments Commission. Specifically, the draft Judicial
Appointments Regulations 2013 set out the details of the selection
processes to be followed when selecting for certain judicial offices
managed by the Judicial Appointments Commission, and processes of
selection for the offices of Lord Chief Justice, heads of division, the
Senior President of Tribunals and Lords Justice of Appeal. The draft
Judicial Appointments Commission Regulations 2013 set out
the details of the composition of the Judicial Appointments Commission
including the number of commissioners and the process for their
selection, while the draft Supreme Court (Judicial Appointments)
Regulations 2013 set out details of the selection process for the
appointment of Supreme Court Justices, including the revised
composition of the selection commissions.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13072212000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072212000002">Before setting out
further details, I will explain the background to these changes. In
November 2011, the Ministry of Justice issued a public consultation
entitled <I>Appointments and Diversity: A Judiciary for the
21st Century</I>, which focused on delivering changes to the
statutory and regulatory frameworks for judicial appointments and
contained measures to increase judicial diversity. One of the proposals
in our consultation was to address the balance between primary and
secondary legislation; specifically, to move the detail of the
appointments processes into secondary legislation while keeping
important elements of principle on the face of primary legislation.
This approach was supported by the Constitution Committee as part of
its inquiry into the judicial appointments process.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13072212000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072212000003">Running concurrent with
our consultation, the Constitution Committee in the other place carried
out an inquiry into the judicial appointments process. In its final
report following the inquiry, the committee agreed that the detailed
provisions of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 should be included in
secondary legislation. They emphasised that Henry VIII clauses should
not be sought; provisions of particular constitutional importance
should continue to remain in primary legislation where they will
continue to be subject to full parliamentary scrutiny. Upon the
introduction of a Bill, the Government should publish draft secondary
legislation and the Lord Chief Justice and, where relevant, the senior
judge of the Supreme Court should be consulted before secondary
legislation is laid before Parliament.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13072212000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072212000004">Following the
committee’s recommendations and the support we received via our
consultation, the Government introduced powers for the Lord Chancellor
to make regulations through the Crime and Courts Act 2013, with the
agreement of the Lord Chief Justice and, where relevant, the senior
judge of the Supreme Court, which would contain the detail of the
judicial appointments processes, and these are the regulations we are
considering today. While moving this detail into secondary legislation,
we also made some changes to the judicial appointments processes
themselves that were informed by the recommendations arising from the
report of the Advisory Panel on Judicial Diversity,  
<?notus-xml column=402?>chaired by the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, together with
observations received from the Constitution Committee in the other
place.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13072212000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072212000005">All
three sets of regulations have been developed in conjunction with the
judiciary and the Judicial Appointments Commission, and we have shared
the draft versions with the devolved Administrations. Early drafts of
these regulations were shared with Parliament during the course of the
Crime and Courts Bill, as it then was, through Parliament as per the
observation made by the Constitution Committee. Lastly, as required by
legislation, the draft Judicial Appointments Regulations 2013 and the
draft Judicial Appointments Commission Regulations 2013 have been
agreed by the Lord Chief Justice before being laid. The draft Supreme
Court (Judicial Appointments) Regulations 2013 have been agreed with
the President of the UK Supreme Court before being laid. With this in
mind, I turn now to each statutory instrument
individually<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-22T16:29:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_time UID="13072212000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072212000056">4.30 pm</hs_time>

the draft Judicial Appointments Regulations 2013 concerning changes to
the selection panels and the role of the Lord Chancellor. The first set
of changes to the process detailed within the Constitutional Reform Act
2005 concerns the selection panels for senior judicial offices,
including the Lord Chief Justice, heads of division, the Senior
President of Tribunals and Lords Justice of the Court of Appeal.
Following a recommendation by the Advisory Panel on Judicial Diversity,
we revised the composition of selection panels for the most senior
appointments to increase lay representation on these panels. We have
provided for there to be an odd number of members on these panels, with
a minimum of five, to prevent the chair having a casting vote. There is
also now a duty upon those choosing members to sit on selection panels
to have regard to the desirability that the composition of the
selection panel should include both men and women and be drawn from a
range of different ethnic
groups.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072212000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072212000007">The
process detailed within these regulations for the selection of the Lord
Chief Justice and heads of division mirrors that set out in the
transitional provisions detailed in Part 5 of Schedule 13 to the Crime
and Courts Act 2013. Additionally, the Lord Chancellor is now provided
with a consultative role for the selection of Lords Justice of Appeal
and the Senior President of Tribunals. This consultative role is
similar to the role the Lord Chancellor already has in relation to
Supreme Court appointments, and given the importance of these judicial
offices to the administration of justice and the leadership they
provide to the judiciary, there is a clear case for the Executive to be
able to express a view on the qualities expected of future
officeholders.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13072212000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072212000008">I turn now to the
rebalancing of responsibilities between the Executive and the
judiciary. The Crime and Courts Act transfers from the Lord Chancellor
to the Lord Chief Justice responsibility for considering selections
made by the JAC in relation to the appointment of court-based judges
below the High Court. Similarly, the Senior President of Tribunals
assumes this role for the appointment of specified tribunal judges.
These regulations therefore provide the detail of the selection 
<?notus-xml column=403?>procedures that will be required to be applied by the Lord Chief Justice
and the Senior President of Tribunals, together with the Lord
Chancellor, when considering the nominations for judicial appointments
received from the JAC. These changes replicate the options that the
Lord Chancellor currently has when receiving a selection from the JAC
and apply them to the Lord Chief Justice and the Senior President of
Tribunals when undertaking these functions.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13072212000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072212000009">I come now to
authorisations to sit in the High Court. I would like to outline the
changes made through the Crime and Courts Act to the process by which
judges are authorised to sit in the High Court which is now set out in
these regulations. Sitting as a judge in the High Court is considered a
key route to promotion. However, the previous system for authorising
circuit judges and recorders to sit in the High Court did not provide
the same degree of openness or transparency enjoyed by other judicial
appointments. This meant that these positions, which are an important
stepping stone to more senior judicial appointments, were not open to
the widest range of potential candidates. The Crime and Courts Act and
the regulations introduce a new selection process for these
authorisations, one that is to be determined by the JAC. These
regulations therefore outline the process to select recorders,
specified tribunal judges and circuit judges for membership of a pool
from which the LCJ may then authorise to sit in the High
Court.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13072212000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072212000010">I turn now to the draft
Judicial Appointments Commission Regulations 2013, which set out the
composition of the JAC, including the number of commissioners and the
process for their selection. The composition as set out in
the regulations is closely based on the composition as was set out
in Schedule 12 to the Constitutional Reform
Act; however, I outline the main changes below. Previously,
only a solicitor or a barrister could take up the two positions on the
commission allocated to members of the legal profession.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13072212000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072212000011">However, we have made
it possible for fellows of the Chartered Institute of Legal
Executives—CILEx—to be members of the commission. This
resolves the oddity arising from the changes made through the
Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act, whereby CILEx fellows are
eligible to be appointed as judges but are not eligible to be JAC
commissioners. We have also increased the representation of the
tribunals’ judiciary on the commission, as the majority of JAC
appointments are to tribunals’ posts; the commission will in
future include a senior tribunal judge. We have also increased those
eligible to be selected as the non-legal members to include non-legally
qualified judicial members, such as lay tribunal members to sit on the
commission, together with lay
magistrates.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072212000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072212000012">Finally<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-22T16:35:22"></hs_TimeCode>,
I turn to the draft Supreme Court (Judicial Appointments) Regulations
2013. The Crime and Courts Act and the draft regulations make changes
to the composition of selection panels for the appointment of Supreme
Court judges. These changes are now reflected in these regulations and
will help to ensure that the balance between lay, judicial and
independent roles on the panels are appropriate. Significant changes 
<?notus-xml column=404?>include provision for a lay chair for a selection commission considering
selection for the office of President of the Supreme
Court.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072212000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072212000013">The
selection commission will also include one member of the Supreme Court
rather than two in line with a recommendation from the report of the
noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, on diversity. These changes guard
against the perception of the selection commissioners selecting judges
based on a likeness to their own image. There will, though, still be a
minimum of two judicial officeholders on the selection panel, with the
place previously taken by the Supreme Court judge taken by a senior UK
territorial
judge.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072212000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072212000014">The
substance of these regulations and the main changes contained within
them have been debated at length through the passage of the Crime and
Courts Act. As I have already mentioned, the changes made through the
Act were a product of a government consultation and recommendations
from the Advisory Panel on Judicial Diversity and the Constitution
Committee. The regulations have been developed in consultation with the
judiciary and the JAC and have received the required approval from the
Lord Chief Justice and the President of the Supreme Court, where
relevant, before being laid before Parliament to consider. I therefore
commend these draft regulations to the Committee and beg to

Marks of Henley-on-Thames:</Member></B> My Lords, I wish to make a
brief general point about judicial diversity in connection with these
regulations. The Committee knows that my noble friend is a forceful
advocate of judicial diversity. The Government’s commitment was
apparent during the passage of what is now the Crime and Courts Act,
and in particular in their promotion of the provisions which find
expression in Schedule 13 to that
Act<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-22T16:38:00"></hs_TimeCode>. While not
wishing to make any judgment about the recent appointment to the
position of Lord Chief Justice it is, from the diversity point of view,
a shame that the extremely highly thought-of female candidate was not
selected. That would have been real and very public
progress<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-22T16:38:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072212000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072212000016">These
regulations implement the new systems in ways that are both detailed
and welcome, but the imperative is to ensure that we move towards a
much more representative judiciary with more women, more ethnic
minority judges and judges from a far broader range of social
background. These regulations can be no more than a step on the way to
achieving that. While they are detailed and welcome provisions, to
achieve real change we need a deep and continuing change of culture.
That was highlighted in the report of the Advisory Panel on Judicial
Diversity, chaired by the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger and mentioned
by my noble friend. I look forward in the future to Government and the
judiciary working together to achieve that
change.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072212000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072212000017"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-22T16:39:24"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Hope of Craighead" PimsId="1014" UID="13072212000064" xid="1274" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072212000064">Lord
Hope of Craighead:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall make a short point
relating to the Supreme Court (Judicial Appointments) Regulations.
Before I explain my point, I should declare an interest. I recently
retired as deputy president of the Supreme Court. For the past four
years I have been a member of the ad hoc commission 
<?notus-xml column=405?>and thus responsible, along with the president, for a number of
appointments, which have included something like a third of the court
now sitting as the Supreme Court across the
square<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-22T16:40:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072212000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072212000018">My
point relates to diversity in a rather unusual way. As the Minister has
explained, one of the aims of redesigning the composition of the
selection commission described in Part 3 of these regulations is to
meet the recommendation that the commission should no longer be seen to
be appointing or selecting for appointment people in their own
image<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-22T16:40:41"></hs_TimeCode>. It may be
that that was a fair criticism at the time when I was sitting as one of
the two judicial members of the panel since the president and I were
both men, but I have just retired and I have been succeeded by the
noble and learned Baroness, Lady Hale of Richmond. In a way, this
follows on from a point just made by the noble Lord that one may regret
for diversity reasons the choice of Lord Chief Justice. I make no
comment on that, but one great advance that has been made in the
Supreme Court is that we now have the noble and learned Baroness, Lady
Hale, who is a very vigorous proponent of diversity and is probably
best suited of anyone to sit on such a
commission<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-22T16:41:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072212000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072212000019">It

the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, came with her members to visit us
and to discuss the change, I am sure that the noble Baroness would have
seen—it would have been perfectly obvious—that the noble
and learned Baroness was there and that we had on our team every
component for diversity one could possibly have wished for. As the
noble Lord rightly explained, when the draft regulations were discussed
with us, it was impossible to make the point that the noble and learned
Baroness, Lady Hale, might be my successor because I had not yet
resigned and the selection process for my successor had not yet taken
place. Therefore, we were very cautious not to make any prediction
about who would succeed me. The succession process produced this result
only about four weeks

is a great misfortune of timing has led us to the position where the
noble and learned Baroness will now be excluded from participation in
the selection process. The regulations are very carefully drafted
because the composition of the selection commission in Regulation 11
provides for a senior UK judge to be nominated to take the position
which I previously occupied. It is quite clear, if you read
Regulation 11(1)(e) with Regulation 14 and Regulation 2,
that the senior UK judge can be any senior UK judge other than a judge
of the Supreme Court. So it is quite clear it can only be the president
who would be the Supreme Court member, and the noble and learned
Baroness, Lady
Hale<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-22T16:43:10"></hs_TimeCode>, has no

way that the appointments have gone in the Supreme Court in recent
years means that there will be no fresh vacancy, I think I am right in
saying, for two or three years. Now that I have gone, the way is clear
for the court to settle down without any real change. However, in two
or three, or possibly three or four years’ time, a significant
number will retire and fall to be replaced, and the noble and learned
Baroness will 
<?notus-xml column=406?>still be there. The composition of what one might call the next but one
Supreme Court will be greatly influenced by the work of this
commission. It is a great pity that the reform has taken this form. As
I said earlier, I doubt very much whether it would have done before,
but I must concede that the Minister is absolutely right to say that
the regulations were shown to us. We did the best we could in our

Hope of Craighead. I want to add a few words on the Supreme Court
regulations relating to the manner in which believed incapacity is to
be dealt with. As your Lordships will be aware, the regulations provide
for the setting up of a selection commission, and various individuals
are to be given the power to nominate other individuals for membership
of that commission. One of the persons with the power to nominate such
a person is the President of the Supreme Court. That is set out in
Regulation 5:</hs_para>

the incapacity exists and therefore someone else must be the nominator
for the relevant purpose. I would suggest that that is profoundly
unsatisfactory. There are provisions about incapacity in the
Constitutional Reform Act 2005. Section 16 provides that the Lord Chief
Justice is incapacitated only if at least three of the four heads of
division declare in writing that he is incapacitated. Section
36,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13072212000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072212000051">“applies

“incapacitated” mean? It depends on the opinion of the
Lord Chancellor. One of the functions of the 2005 Act was to put an end
to the believed impropriety inconsistent with the separation of powers
of the highest court in the land being a part of the
legislature—the Law Lords, as they then were. The impropriety of
that was accepted by a number of people, and the Supreme Court was
brought into existence to put an end to that conflict. However, this
produces another conflict. So far as the regulation is concerned, the
Executive, in the form of the Lord Chancellor, does not have to base
his opinion on any medical evidence at all. The Lord Chancellor has the
right to pronounce his belief in the incapacity of the President, the
Deputy President or some other senior UK judge to act for the purposes
of the selection commission that these regulations will set up. That
itself seems to be inconsistent with the separation of
powers—not, as before, the separation between the legislature
and the judiciary but between the Executive and the judiciary. It
appears to be a much more serious infringement of the doctrine of
separation of powers than that which formerly existed when the Law
Lords, as Members of this House, acted as the highest court of the
land.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072212000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072212000026">I wonder
why relying on the opinion of the Lord Chancellor on these matters of
incapacity, which must require somebody with a little medical or
perhaps psychiatric knowledge to have a view, and without any
indication that the individual who is thought incapacitated is having
his or her opinion canvassed, should be thought to be an appropriate
way of dealing with this situation. I would seriously suggest to the
Government that it is a most improper way of dealing with the
situation. The Lord Chancellor’s opinion should not be
sufficient to declare somebody incapacitated, unless backed by a
medical certificate—which would suffice—or by the
concurrence of the heads of division or, so long as it was not the Lord
Chief Justice’s position being considered, of the Lord Chief
Justice. However, just relying on the opinion of the Lord Chancellor on
a matter that would require some medical or psychiatric expertise seems
to me to be offensive, unnecessary and something that should be
remedied before these regulations are brought into
effect.</hs_para>

Jones:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for his pithy
exposition of the Supreme Court (Judicial Appointments) Regulations
2013. I have been in this Parliament for only four decades.
Notwithstanding that, I know that a Member without any legal insight is
entitled to take part in the proceedings of your Lordships’
Committee and ask a question of the resourceful Minister who is taking
forward the business. By coincidence, a new Lord Chief Justice—a
distinguished Welshman—was appointed very recently, and I noted
in the correspondence column of the <I>Times</I> today that my
compatriot, Mr Winston Roddick QC, a former Counsel General to the
Welsh Assembly Government, has strongly supported his appointment. I
think the Lord Chief Justice is being warmly welcomed throughout the
Principality; he has the reputation of being a very charming and
knowledgeable
Welshman.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072212000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072212000028">At
this point, I will hurry on to ask whether the Minister is able to say
in what way, if at all, there is any prospect of what one might call
ordinary people being consulted on this enormously important post of
Lord Chief Justice. Does he have a point of view on that? Does a point
of view exist regarding widespread consultation or has it been resolved
that such a course would not be wise? How was the First Minister of
Wales consulted? I see at Regulation 19 that the First Ministers in
Scotland and Wales are down for consultation. Would it be reasonable to
assume that the First Minister of Wales was consulted on this recent
appointment of the new Lord Chief Justice? I am not in any way asking
what the result of the consultation was, or about the detail of what
was said or written, but it is reasonable to ask in what way he was
consulted, when he was consulted, and how, by whom and how recently his
opinions were

whether any relevant person is incapacitated from serving as a member
of the selection commission. The same formula he pointed out appears in
Regulations 7(2)(b), 14(2)(b), 16(1) and 17(2)(b). That is
exhaustive but that is where the concept appears. He made a point on
Section 16 of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 with regard to the
incapacity of the Lord Chief Justice. It is fair to point out that in
Section 16 that is a permanent incapacity, and indeed

suggest a possibility: somebody else, together with the Lord
Chancellor, could be involved in making a judgment and expressing a
determination as to whether there is, for the time being, incapacity of
the relevant member—that is, simply incapacity from serving as a
member of a selection committee. I would suggest possibly the Lord
Chancellor together with the Lord Chief Justice did that. If somebody
were then to make the point, “Well, it may be that the Lord
Chief Justice could himself be a candidate for appointment either to
the relevant office or, indeed, to being on the selection
committee”, in such a case it could be the next senior person
under the senior UK judge, which, again, is defined within the statute.
I merely put those forward as possible suggestions to dilute the
objection and concern voiced by my noble and learned friend Lord Scott
that it is, at least in terms of perception, troubling that the matter
should be left simply to the untrammelled opinion of the Lord
Chancellor unaided.</hs_para>

congratulating the Government generally on coming forward with these

in terms 
<?notus-xml column=410?>of diversity. Of 110 High Court judges, only 17 are women and only five
are from black and ethnic minority backgrounds, with no female heads of
division. However, we now have a female Supreme Court judge and that is
welcome. Those facts illuminate the reason for the Government’s
approach, which we certainly endorse. I particularly welcome the
reinforcing of independent elements in the appointments processes and,
of course, promoting diversity. That includes the revision of the
composition of selection panels for the most senior appointments. The
Government’s intention is explicit—to make the
appointments more diverse and increase lay representation on the
panels. However, I am not entirely clear about the extent to which the
selection panels themselves reflect diversity among their members,
particularly at the higher levels. As there are five members of the

level.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072212000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072212000036">I

either a barrister or solicitor. There is the option for
balance—it is not necessarily the case—where the CILEx
member was involved in other than tribunal appointments. That
possibility could occur. I dare say the Minister will correct me if my
interpretation is wrong. I very much welcome the inclusion of CILEx in
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072213000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072213000002">I return
to the question of the steps the Government will take to ensure that
there is diversity in the appointment of membership of panels,
especially in relation to gender and ethnicity. The noble and learned
Lords, Lord Scott and Lord Brown, referred to the difficulties raised
by the provision relating to incapacity. It is rather striking that
incapacity is only treated as a matter of concern if it afflicts a
holder of judicial office. It is not inconceivable that it might
afflict the Lord Chancellor but that is not covered by the
arrangements. That is slightly odd. I sympathise very strongly with the
observations of the noble and learned Lords in that regard. There must
be a procedure in which the Lord Chancellor is not perceived to have an
unfettered and sole discretion in this matter. That might not be the
Government’s intention—I suspect it is not—but it
would be much better if that were 
<?notus-xml column=411?>explicit. I hope the Minister will take this back and possibly make it
the subject of further regulation. The point that was made was quite
powerful.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072213000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072213000003">There
are two other matters I invite some comment on. First, given that we
are not talking about judicial appointments, I wonder whether the
Government have taken on board sufficiently—or to any
extent—the impact on future appointments of the changes they are
proposing, particularly in criminal legal aid. There is widespread
concern, expressed across the legal profession and reaching into the
judiciary, that diversity issues will arise if, as seems likely, there
is a significant reduction in the size of particularly the criminal Bar
but also of the solicitors’ side of the profession. I declare my
interest as a member of the Law Society and an unpaid consultant to a
firm of which I was formerly senior partner. There is a fear that the
ladder of appointments might become rather remote from those who
currently succeed in progressing. Even now, as I indicated, they do not
progress as high as the Government would wish. Again, I invite the
Government to consider the impact of these changes on their aspirations
for diversity in the
judiciary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072213000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072213000004">Secondly,
there is an area that I confess is beyond the scope of these
regulations. I invite the Minister to indicate what steps the
Government are considering to sustain and promote diversity among the
magistracy. That is diversity of all kinds: again gender and ethnicity
but also, although it is not in this series of recommendations
affecting the judiciary, social class as well. A local justice system
needs diversity in its officeholders to a significant extent, as does
the judiciary with which we are today
concerned.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072213000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072213000005">Having
said all that, the Government are certainly moving in the right
direction. We hope that some of the points made today might be
reflected in further regulation. This is a good start but needs to be
taken further. No doubt over time the Government will assess what
progress has been made and what steps they could take to encourage more
applications for judicial officers at all levels from a wide range of
people qualified in every respect to fulfil that important
duty.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072213000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072213000006"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord McNally" PimsId="1843" UID="13072213000071" xid="1331" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072213000071">Lord
McNally:</Member></B> My Lords, I am extremely grateful to all those
who have contributed to a very interesting debate. I have to confess
that as I sat waiting for the debate to begin, I felt rather like a
character in Alfred Hitchcock’s “The Birds”, as I
watched various distinguished Members of your Lordships’ House
flutter on to their perches waiting to take a peck at me. I shall start
by responding to the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, who is always thoughtful

people were hoping that the selection of the Lord Chief Justice would
give us an opportunity to make a great statement in terms of diversity
with the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Hale, as one of the
candidates. But, as has been made clear in a number of letters to the
<I>Times</I> today, that does not take away from the fact that we have
a very good choice for the Lord Chief Justice and we wish him well in
his appointment. A name which has been bandied around a great deal is
that of the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Hale. I remember when the 
<?notus-xml column=412?>Metropolitan Police appointed its first black policeman, PC Norwell
Gumbs. For a while, PC Gumbs seemed to be on duty outside 10 Downing
Street, Buckingham Palace or almost anywhere that would give the
impression of a diversity that did not actually exist. I must also say
to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope, that in the three years that
I have been a Minister, the Supreme Court has made three or four
appointments, none of which has been particularly diverse, although
undoubtedly extremely eminent. As my noble friend Lord Marks said, in
these regulations we are taking some stuttering steps forward in
diversity. I have been assured by the very highest ranks of the
judiciary that if I am patient, in 20 years’ time all will be
well. I would say that that is not a timescale that the country will be
satisfied with.</hs_para>

encourage the panels themselves to be diverse. It could take us into a
much wider debate, but I am conscious that it is from the criminal Bar
that we get the flow of eminent lawyers who go into our senior
judiciary. I hope that the Bar itself becomes much more constructively
involved in looking at how we bring about social mobility there. For
one reason or another—you cannot put all the blame on legal
aid—in my opinion, access to the Bar is probably less socially
mobile than it was 20 or 30 years ago, and that should be a matter of
concern to us.</hs_para>

noble Lord, Lord Beecham, in that I am a great supporter of the
magistracy. There is always a problem in respect of its social
composition but I think that it has come a long way from being the
local squire dispensing justice. Indeed, if we want to look for
diversity in our judicial system, it is there in the magistracy, where
there is far greater diversity both in terms of gender and ethnic
representation. I hope that we will look at how we encourage more
people into the magistracy and how we can give the magistracy greater
responsibility and powers within our criminal justice system. While I
remain in this post, I will certainly look for those
opportunities.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13072213000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072213000057">5.15

to the wider debate, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Marks, that this
is a small step on the way and that a change in culture is needed.
Despite some of the very distinguished speeches made today by noble and
learned Lords who have themselves been senior members of the judiciary,
I am still left, as a layman, with the feeling that the very senior
levels do not fully appreciate the impatience to see—and the
importance of seeing—our senior judiciary better reflect the
society which they serve. I understand that they believe that they are
protecting the highest qualities and standards, and I need no
persuading that the intellectual eminence and integrity of our
judiciary is something in which we in this country can all take great
pride. However, that does not mean that those important qualities can
only be protected from a very narrow social base or from a single
gender. I hear what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope, said about
unfortunate timing, given that the noble and learned Baroness, Lady
Hale, became Deputy President just when other changes were made, but I
think that she will have many opportunities in the next three or four
years to use this new and important position to achieve further
diversity in the judiciary.</hs_para>

points that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scott, made about dealing
with incapacity. In one way, I am amazed that I went into great detail
about the number of hoops that these regulations went through in terms
of clearance with the senior judiciary, clearance with the Constitution
Committee and the usual thorough going-over in both Houses. We have
reached, as it were, the final lap. It is important to remember that
the Lord Chancellor is not dealing with the issue in some casual way in
saying that the Lord Chief Justice is incapacitated. I cannot imagine
that either Parliament or the judiciary would remain silent in any way,
were that the case. This is in the limited circumstances of the Lord
Chief Justice’s functions relating to a senior selection panel,
where the usual process set out in Section 16 of the Constitutional
Reform Act would be inappropriate. One of the noble and learned Lords
made the point that I am about to make, which is that this is to avoid
the risk of any perceived conflict of interest, given that the heads of
division may themselves be applicants for the office of Lord Chief
Justice. As the Lord Chief Justice selects the fifth member of the
panel, it would enable them to have a say in the membership of the
selection panel if they determined that the Lord Chief Justice was
incapacitated.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072213000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072213000012">The
draft regulations in turn replicate the transitional provision, new
Section 71B(3), as detailed in Part 5 of Schedule 13 to the Crime and
Courts Act 2013, relating to the functions of the Lord Chief Justice.
They are also consistent with the approach set out in the draft Supreme
Court Regulation 7(2)(a) for determining whether the President is
incapacitated, which in turn is based on paragraph 5(1) of Schedule 8
of the Constitutional Reform Act
2005.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072213000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072213000013">Noble
Lords will realise I did not make that up in my head. That is the
position as the Government see it. I will take back the fact that noble
and learned Lords have raised this, but I do not think it is quite a
case of the grand “off with his head” Lord Chancellor
dealing imperiously with a recalcitrant Lord Chief Justice, which
perhaps was the tenor of some of the interventions. We are confident
that this process will be an appropriate test in what are obviously
very exceptional
circumstances.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072213000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072213000014">The
noble Lord, Lord Jones, asked me how ordinary people were to be
consulted in these matters. It is a little bit difficult to imagine a
kind of “X Factor” for the post of Lord Chief Justice. We
do our best, and these reforms try to make it more inclusive. Unless we
were to go down that rocky road of electing judges, as is the case in
the United States, I think what we are trying to do here is be more
responsive. I am told that the First Minister of Wales was informed at

have been asked what progress has been made on diversity. My blunt
answer is “not enough.” The noble and learned Lord, Lord
Hardie, asked whether the CILEx member would be involved only in
specific panels. No, he or she would be a full member of the panel and
would go on to selection processes as appropriate and as available. The
noble and learned Lord, Lord Brown, again raised the incapacity
question. The Government

that there has to be transparency about the procedures. The

is always those narrow and rare occasions which come under the

environment feel about the fact that they could be treated in this way.

Hardie:</Member></B> I should just express my concern about the
reference to CILEx. I fully appreciate that CILEx members should be
members of a commission appointing a tribunal where they have
experience, but the whole point of having legally qualified members of
the commission is to have people who have experience of the courts
within which they appear. That is why we are talking about barristers
or solicitors of the Supreme Court. When it comes to those other
courts, the CILEx member will have no experience of that and he or she
will effectively be an additional lay member, so the 
<?notus-xml column=415?>balance of the commission is being skewed. I invite the Minister to
reflect on that and perhaps come back with an amendment to confine the
involvement of CILEx members to jurisdictions where they practise and
have some experience. It is important that we should be aware of the
legal qualifications and legal ability of the people presiding over
courts in which they do not

I have no experience of this jurisdiction and I was not advocating an
appointments process on the basis of appointing “chaps like
us”. I was trying to confine myself to the regulations. The
regulations themselves set out the basis on which the commission is to
be composed. It is to be composed of so many judges, so many lay people
and so many legally qualified people. The point of legally qualified
people—that is, barristers and solicitors in the Supreme Court
in England and Wales—is that these men and women have experience
of that jurisdiction and know what is required of people exercising
that jurisdiction. I can understand the Government’s desire to
involve CILEx in tribunal appointments because that is a jurisdiction
of which its members have experience. I am not advocating jobs for the
boys but trying to adopt a sensible approach to these regulations. If
you appoint a member of CILEx to sit on a commission which is
appointing a judge of a higher level than that of a tribunal,
effectively you are adding an extra lay member and you do not have the

Minister of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord McNally):</Member></B> My
Lords, Sections 28 and 29 of the Offender Management Act provide for
the polygraph testing of sexual offenders. Specifically, they enable
polygraph testing to be included as an additional licence condition for
adult sexual offenders. The Act required the provisions to be piloted
in specified areas before full implementation. Those pilots took place
in eight probation trusts from January 2009 to March 2012. As I shall
come to explain, the pilot was successful. The purpose of this order is
to commence the provisions fully, to enable polygraph testing to be
included as a licence condition for sexual offenders throughout England
and Wales rather than just in the pilot
areas.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072213000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072213000030">As
noble Lords may be aware, a polygraph is a device that indicates
whether someone might be lying. More specifically, it measures changes
in heartbeat, breathing rates and sweating. Changes in these activities
can indicate whether an individual is telling the truth in response to
a set of questions. The management of sexual offenders in the community
is rightly a serious concern to the public. Having an objective
assessment of how truthful or otherwise an offender is with his or her
probation officer has the potential to make supervision more effective
and hence might reduce the risk of further offending. The potential for
polygraph testing as a tool for enhancing the effectiveness of the
statutory supervision of sexual offenders was considered in the Home
Office’s <I>Review of the Protection of Children from Sex
Offenders</I>, published in 2007. That review recommended the piloting
of polygraphy as a licence
condition.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072213000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072213000031">Following
commencement of Sections 28 to 30, polygraph testing was piloted in the
East and West Midlands from January 2009 to March 2012. In the pilots,
adult sexual offenders released on licence into the pilot area had a
condition to comply with polygraph testing included in their release
licence. In these pilots, sexual offenders were polygraph tested during
supervision to help assess whether they were complying with their
licence conditions or their level of risk had changed. The polygraph
was, of course, just one component of their supervision. Offenders were
also subject to the usual supervision process, which includes regular
reporting to a probation officer and may also include attendance on an
accredited sex offender programme, help with substance misuse and
assistance with accommodation or
employment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072213000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072213000032">Polygraph
testing was provided under a contract with the University of Newcastle.
An independent evaluation study of the pilots was carried out by the
University of Kent. The aim of the pilot was to find out whether
polygraph testing was a useful additional tool for probation officers
in their management of sex offenders in the community, who were on
licence. In other words, the pilots set out to answer the question: is
polygraph testing effective in helping to protect the public from
serious
harm?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072213000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072213000033">The
commencement order made under Section 41 defined the areas where the
pilots would take place and their duration. The intention was that, on
completion of the pilots, Parliament would consider their efficacy and
whether polygraphy should be rolled out across the probation service in
England and Wales. Any 
<?notus-xml column=418?>extension or expansion of the scheme may be made only with parliamentary
approval. Now that the pilots are complete and have been evaluated, I
am pleased to report that they were very successful.</hs_para>

should, at this point, draw attention to a change in the explanatory
memorandum provided to the Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee.
The explanatory memorandum stated that 599 offenders from seven
probation trusts were subject to mandatory polygraph testing during the
pilot. Five hundred and ninety-nine offenders were tested across eight
trusts during the entire lifetime of the pilots, which ran between
January 2009 and March 2012, but the evaluation, which was conducted
between April 2010 and December 2011, was based on the testing of 332
offenders in the pilot areas. In other words, testing started before
the evaluation and continued afterwards, but only those tests
undertaken during the period between April 2010 and December 2011 were
used for the evaluation study. As the 599 figure was based on
previously unpublished internal management information, officials
advised that it would be more appropriate to use the publicly available
evaluation data on 332 offenders, and the explanatory memorandum was
amended accordingly. The evaluation is in no way diminished or affected
by the changes to the original explanatory memorandum.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-22T17:41:25"></hs_TimeCode> Minister for
Prisons and Rehabilitation arranged for the original explanatory
memorandum to be withdrawn and an amended version to be laid in its
place. I know that the Minister has apologised to his colleagues in the
other place and to the chairman of the Secondary Legislation Scrutiny
Committee for this late change, and I should like to add my own
apologies to noble Lords.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13072213000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072213000035">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-22T17:41:51"></hs_TimeCode>
evaluation is a robust study of the mandatory polygraph pilot. Outcomes
for offenders who were subject to mandatory polygraph testing were
compared with a similar group of offenders who were supervised in other
probation areas where they did not use the polygraph as part of
supervision. The evaluation found that the offenders subject to
polygraph testing made more “clinically significant
disclosures” than the comparison group. These are disclosures
that led to changes in the way the offender was managed. Information
disclosed as part of the polygraph process led to probation offender
managers taking additional actions to manage the offender’s risk
and to improve compliance with their licence conditions. This included,
for example, changing the focus or frequency of supervision or, if
combined with further information, recalling the offender to custody.
The explanatory memorandum includes a link to the final published
report of the evaluation study. That report provides full information
on the effectiveness of mandatory polygraph testing during the pilot.
In summary, it concludes that polygraph testing has the potential to
lead to more informed and effective supervision by probation
officers.</hs_para>

am aware that there are a number of misconceptions about what a
polygraph is and how it is used. Polygraphy is often seen in the
entertainment industry, and if you search for polygraphy on the
internet, you will find sites which tell you that it does not work and
give advice on how to “beat” it. Opinion is divided about
how accurate a polygraph is in detecting deception, but the US National
Research Council indicates that  
<?notus-xml column=419?>the polygraph can obtain levels of accuracy of around 80% to 90%. This
is clearly not the same as 100% accuracy but it is well above
chance.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-22T17:44:23"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para>

part of the supervision of sex offenders, it is not the detection of
deception that is the critical factor, rather it is the information
disclosed by the offender before, during or after the polygraph test
that is used to inform decisions about their supervision. In other
words, it is less about “detecting lies” and more about
gathering useful information to properly manage risk. For that
reason—this is a point that I want to make absolutely
clear—no offender will be recalled to custody as the result of a
polygraph test alone.
An<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-22T17:55:13"></hs_TimeCode> offender will
be recalled to custody only if there is additional information that
they are not complying with licence conditions or that their risk to
the public is increasing. In many cases, such information was
volunteered by offenders in the pilots, when they were presented with
the results of their tests. Nor will the polygraph be used to determine
guilt or innocence. Indeed, Section 30 of the Offender Management Act
2007 specifically prevents any information obtained under the polygraph
being used in criminal proceedings against the
offender<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-22T17:55:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13072213000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072213000062">5.45

action in relation to polygraphy, including recall to custody, can be
instigated only if: an offender fails to attend a polygraph test; or,
as a result of challenges from the test, subsequently disclosed
information indicates that the offender is in breach of a licence
condition or is an increased risk to the public; or, the offender fails
to comply with the instructions of the polygrapher—including
trying to beat the polygraph through use of countermeasures. Your
Lordships may be interested to know that the most common supposed
countermeasures, which include fidgeting, biting your tongue and
clenching your toes, will be detected by the polygraph as these
generally result in changes to the physiological measures that the
polygraph is designed to assess. In summary, the polygraph test is used
simply as an additional source of information by probation offender
managers but it is a valuable one which, as I said, helps offender
managers to manage offenders more effectively in the
community.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072213000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072213000039">Of
course, if the polygraph test is to be useful, it is important that it
is carried out in a properly regulated manner and only by suitably
qualified and trained staff. During the pilots, the qualifications of
the polygraph examiners and operating requirements for each polygraph
test were governed by the polygraph rules, which were set out in a
statutory instrument, the Polygraph Rules 2009. These rules were
reviewed in light of learning from the pilots and are fit for purpose
if, as I commend to the House, polygraph testing is rolled out more
widely.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072213000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072213000040">Protecting
the public is our overriding priority. In particular, we are determined
to do all we can to protect children and adults from sexual offending.
To achieve this, we must do all we can to ensure that those who manage
sex offenders in the community have the right tools and powers to
support their work. The polygraph pilots have indicated that polygraph
testing leads to improvements in the supervision of sex offenders in
the community by providing probation offender 
<?notus-xml column=420?>managers with a valuable additional source of information with which to
monitor licence conditions more closely. The Government therefore seek
to make polygraph testing as a licence condition available for sex
offenders throughout England and Wales. The draft order enables us to

Beecham:</Member></B> My Lords, we have heard a good deal about
capacity and incapacity this afternoon. With respect, it does not say
much for the capacity of the department that it clearly made an error
in the way it presented the report to the Secondary Legislation
Scrutiny Committee. It ought to be comforted by the fact that it was an
error of only 40% compared with the 90% that appeared in the costing
that it applied to higher-value claims in the criminal legal aid
consultation paper—the department is moving in the right
direction. In all fairness, it should be pointed out that the letter
from the committee talked about “probationary trusts”, so
capacity is perhaps an issue that extends to the committee as well as
the
department.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072213000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072213000042">I
very much welcome this report, for two reasons to start with: the whole
scheme was started by the previous Government and Newcastle University
was very much involved in it. Those are two grounds on which I could
hardly fail to commend the Government for proceeding. It is right that
the project should be taken
forward.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072213000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072213000043">I am
slightly unnerved by the concept of polygraph testing. To me, it has
echoes of “Minority Report”, the Tom Cruise film—I
do not know whether the Minister saw it—in which, in a future
world, technology is used to predict criminality by potential offenders
and they are intercepted at an early stage. That nightmarish outcome is
not envisaged under the regulations; on the contrary, they should
assist in dealing with potential offenders. I welcome the assurance
contained in the explanatory note, and given again by the Minister,
that they will not be used as a basis for returning people to custody;
nor will they be relied on in court proceedings. They are an indicator
as to whether steps should be taken—additional supervision or
the like—for offenders. That is a welcome
limitation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072213000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072213000044">However,
I have one or two questions. The discussion is about applying the
polygraph tests to serious sex offenders. I am not clear what
constitutes a serious sex offence for this purpose or how you define
serious sex offenders. It would be helpful if the Minister
could clarify
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072213000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072213000045">In
addition, it is interesting that the process as currently envisaged
sees the technician carrying out the test at the behest of a probation
officer. Given the proposed changes in the probation service, do the
Government intend that such an approach would always be supervised by a
probation officer as opposed to some of the other people who will be
carrying out supervision under the new contractual and
payment-by-results system which the Government seem intent on pushing
forward? Given the nature of the offences we are talking about, it
would be preferable for these matters always to remain within the
domain of the probation
service.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072213000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072213000046">The

debate in the House of Commons, my honourable friend Jenny Chapman
asked whether all sex offenders should be covered by the procedures, as

capacity, it is noted in the notet, for a further 200 sexual
offenders to be built into whatever contract is eventually arrived
at—hopefully not with Group 4 or Serco—for this. That
would be in addition to the 750 per year which it is anticipated would
be subject to mandatory testing. Actually, the report states that the

forcefully by the Minister replying to the debate in the House of
Commons, Mr Wright, that there was a cost factor here. One understands
that, but the cost of this project is estimated at about £3
million. If every sexual offender were to be tested—although I
am not suggesting that—that would increase the cost to, say,
£12 million. Given the nature of the offences, I wonder whether
the financial consideration should be all that material. I repeat that
I am not suggesting that everybody should be tested, that would not be
sensible, but I hope that an artificial financial limitation will not
be imposed on the procedures. That would be a matter of public concern,
whereas this whole proposal should reassure the public that their
safety is likely to be enhanced by the process, with all the safeguards
and qualifications to which the Minister has
referred.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072213000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072213000049">The

McNally:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Beecham,
for that response. As I made clear in my speech, the department regrets
the error that was made, but at least we got good marks from him for
our choice of university, so I have come out of this with some merit. I
am not a great Tom Cruise fan and I have not seen “Minority
Report”, but that is probably a generational thing. I started
off with the same scepticism about polygraphs, mainly because of my
addiction as a child and a young man to American B-movies where they
quite often played a key part. I am thinking of Broderick Crawford
exposing the villain.</hs_para>

that making it available for all sex offenders was a consideration at
one point, but the way we are approaching this enables us to target
resources on those offenders who are likely to cause the most harm to
the public. It will be for serious sex offenders, and just to clarify
another of his questions, it will remain part of the public probation
service. All offenders released on licence for sexual offences will be
managed under the multi-agency public protection 
<?notus-xml column=422?>arrangements. All MAPPA cases will be retained by the public sector.
This means that the providers of polygraph testing will work with
offenders who are managed by retained public sector staff. We will
ensure that all staff working with high-risk sexual offenders are
appropriately trained and supported in how to use polygraph testing to
enhance the effectiveness of the statutory supervision.</hs_para>

how the choice will be made. It will be made where the MAPPA process
indicates sexual offenders who are assessed as being at high risk of
both reoffending and causing serious harm. By doing this, it enables us
to target resources on those offenders likely to be the most dangerous
to the public. As the noble Lord said, I do not think that cost should
be the decisive factor, although of course it has to play a part in
deciding what we can afford in taking this forward, but more than cost
it is a matter of proportionality. It is a useful tool for the offender
manager. I am glad that he acknowledged that the whole thrust of both
the pilot and now the proposal is to add an extra piece of equipment to
the armoury of the offender manager so that he or she can make a better
informed assessment of the danger to the public of a sex offender and
thus take forward appropriate treatment—including, if necessary,
recall. The noble Lord indicated that this was an initiative of the
previous Government which we have carried forward and which I think we
can recommend to the House with cross-party
support.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13072213000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072213000063">6

Beecham:</Member></B> I am very grateful for that response. Could he,
in due course, set that out a little more clearly? I revert to this
question of what constitutes a serious sexual offence. There are some
obvious things—rape, attempted rape—but you get down to
indecent assaults and so on. Are you going to be weighing, for example,
a lesser offence by a record that suggests that it has been repeated,
although it is not of itself a serious offence? In other words, what is
the composition? That needs a little bit of elucidation. I am not
asking for that now. Also, is there any chance of this system being
extended to politicians or even
Ministers?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072213000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072213000054"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord McNally" PimsId="1843" UID="13072213000089" xid="1331" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072213000089">Lord
McNally:</Member></B> Even as I was speaking I was conscious that I was
sweating but that is more because of our heat wave. Whenever you use
words such as “serious” in part that is the professional
judgment of the probation officers. It is their judgment and assessment
of future danger and risk that qualifies them for this kind of
assessment. The intention in bringing this forward is showing that
assessing future risk is itself a risky business. We feel that this use
of polygraphs as a tool in a wider range of skills and judgment by the
probation officers is a useful addition—no more, no less. With
that, I recommend the order to the
Committee.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="13072213000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-gc0001.htm#13072213000096">Motion

Capability Assessment (WCA) process, to ensure that it is as responsive
to the needs of claimants as possible. As part of this and to bring
down waiting times for claimants, DWP has decided to change its
approach to contracting for the WCA, by procuring additional providers
on a regional basis. This is in keeping with the Department’s
current commercial strategy and will provide increased capacity. These

process is currently subject to a system of quality assurance and
audits by both Atos Healthcare and DWP. A recent DWP audit identified a
reduction 
<?notus-xml column=152?>in the quality of written reports which are produced by Atos following
assessments and are then used by the Department to form part of the

reports, such as those provided by Atos, form only one part of the WCA
process, which has a number of checks and balances built in to ensure
the right decision is reached for claimants. After the Atos assessment
DWP Decision Makers make the final decision on claimants’
benefit entitlement based on all evidence provided during the claim. If
the claimant disputes the decision or appeals there is then a
reconsideration process where another DWP Decision Maker will
reconsider the decision. If the claimant is still unhappy about the
decision made, they can appeal. It is important to stress that
DWP’s audit activity showed that claimants whose reports did not
meet our rigorous quality standard were no more or less likely to have
been found fit for work or appeal against the Department’s
decision than other
claimants.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307222000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130722-wms0001.htm#1307222000013">The

independent reviews of the WCA. From the three reviews already carried
out by Professor Malcolm Harrington, over 50 recommendations have been,

all three areas of Somalia, particularly as a key source of finance for
businesses. Remittances are estimated to account for 50% of
Somalia’s gross national income and to support up to 40% of the
