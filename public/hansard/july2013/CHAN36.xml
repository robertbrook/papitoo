I am not familiar with the particular press reports to which the hon.
Gentleman has just referred, although I did hear some sedentary hums of
assent to the complaint that he was making. It would be only when I was
familiar with the detailed facts of the situation that it would be fair
for me to comment. Sometimes, reports that appear are of a speculative
character and owe their genesis to determined reporters trying to get
ahead of events and not necessarily to a deliberate briefing. On the

take place from time to time. The hon. Gentleman knows that I deprecate
them in the strongest terms.</hs_Para>

This Government have made sure that never again will a Prime Minister
sign away sovereignty in a European treaty without a referendum. We in
the Conservative party have made clear our intent to negotiate a new
relationship with the European Union which will then be put to the
British people in an in/out referendum. Of course, it is too early to
be specific about the changes we will seek in that negotiation, but I
am clear that the decision to opt out of these justice and home affairs
measures in 2014 does not leave us with the ideal settlement—far
from it. Significant problems still need to be addressed, such as the
interpretation and enforcement of free movement rules, the creative way

to make this commitment absolutely crystal clear, and to reassure hon.
Members who were worried about the role of the Committees in
scrutinising the Government’s plans to rejoin the selected
measures, we have listened to the points that were raised—I was
grateful to the Chairmen of the European Scrutiny Committee and the
Home Affairs Select Committee for the conversations that I had with
them; the Chairman of the Justice Committee was indeed
abroad—and we have tabled a new motion for today’s
debate. That new motion explicitly invites the European Scrutiny
Committee and the Home Affairs and Justice Committees to submit reports
before the end of October, in advance of the Government opening 
<?notus-xml column=776?>formal discussions with the European Commission and other member states.
I therefore hope the new motion will receive wide support from hon.

response to a similar question from the hon. Lady, I am aware that
concern has been expressed about the European arrest warrant because of
the importance—I intend to refer to this a little
later—of the operation of that arrest warrant between the United
Kingdom, and particularly between Northern Ireland and the Republic of
Ireland. A lot of concern expressed previously was when it was thought
that the Government would not propose to try to opt back into the
European arrest warrant. Of course we must have further discussions
with relevant Ministers in Northern Ireland on this

the substance of the debate. The Government will exercise the opt-out,
but as I announced last week and have said today, we propose to seek to
opt back into 35 measures where we believe it is in
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T15:59:39"></hs_TimeCode> national
interest to participate. My right hon. Friends the Secretary of State
for Justice, the Minister for Government Policy and the Minister for
Europe and I have listened to the views of the law enforcement
agencies, have considered the civil liberties of British subjects and
have been mindful of how the European institutions, particularly the
Court of Justice, operate,
and<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T16:00:13"></hs_TimeCode> to borrow a
phrase coined by my hon. Friend the Member for Esher and Walton (Mr
Raab), who has particular knowledge of and expertise in these matters,
we have pursued a policy of seeking “co-operation not
control”—for example, it is not for Europe to impose
minimum standards on our police and criminal justice system. There are
therefore more than 20 minimum standards measures that we will not seek
to rejoin.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13071511000272" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130715/debtext/130715-0001.htm#13071511000272">Likewise<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T16:00:42"></hs_TimeCode>,
we should not pretend that all these measures facilitate cross-border
co-operation; they do not. Where they do not—as with the measure
on counterfeiting, for example—we will not seek to opt back
in<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T16:00:25"></hs_TimeCode>. Furthermore,
the last Government signed us up to the Prum decisions on the
identification of DNA, fingerprint and vehicle registration documents,
but then did nothing to implement them. Rejoining now would leave the
UK open to a fine that would run into millions of pounds, so we will
not rejoin those measures.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T16:00:40"></hs_TimeCode>Lastly, I want
to make it absolutely clear that we will do nothing that leads to the
establishment of a European public prosecutor or anything akin to a

we will not support anything that, for example, establishes a European
public prosecutor, which we do not believe is the right way to go.
Furthermore, on the new Europol regulation, which I will mention later
and on which we will have a further debate tonight led by the security
Minister, the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon.

have concluded, however, that some of the measures in the opt-out

35 such measures, as I indicated last week. I will deal first with the
most controversial of the measures we plan to opt back into: the
European arrest warrant. It is a controversial measure because,
although we clearly need strong extradition arrangements in place to
see justice done, when extradition arrangements are wrong, they can
have a detrimental effect on our civil

need of change, which is why I propose new safeguards to increase the
protection offered to those wanted for extradition through the European
arrest warrant<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T16:02:45"></hs_TimeCode>.
First, as I indicated earlier, the Government have tabled amendments to
the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill, which is currently
in Committee in this House, to ensure that an arrest warrant can be
refused for minor crimes. Secondly, we will work with other member
states to enforce their fines and ensure that, where possible, an
investigation order is used instead of an arrest warrant, meaning that
police forces and prosecutors would share evidence and information
without requiring the extradition of a suspect at the investigative
stage<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T16:03:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071511000277" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130715/debtext/130715-0001.htm#13071511000277">Thirdly,
I will amend extradition legislation to ensure that people in the UK
can only be extradited under the European arrest warrant when the
requesting member state has already made a decision to charge and
a decision to try, unless that person’s presence is
required in that jurisdiction for those decisions to be made. Fourthly,
I will amend our law to make it clear that in cases where part of the
alleged conduct took place in the UK and where that conduct is not
criminal here, the judge must refuse extradition for that
conduct<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T16:03:43"></hs_TimeCode>.

we propose that the prisoner transfer framework decision should be used
to its fullest extent so that British subjects extradited and convicted
can be returned 
<?notus-xml column=779?>to serve their sentence here. Seventhly, where a British subject has
been convicted and sentenced abroad—for example, in their
absence—and is the subject of an arrest warrant, we will ask,
with their permission, for the warrant to be withdrawn and will use the
prisoner transfer arrangements instead. Eighthly, I plan either to
allow the temporary transfer of a consenting person so that they can be
interviewed by the issuing state’s authorities or to allow them
to do this through means such as video-conferencing in the UK. Where
the suspect is innocent, this should lead to the extradition request
being
withdrawn.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071511000279" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130715/debtext/130715-0001.htm#13071511000279">Those<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T16:04:28"></hs_TimeCode>

Justice. However, I suggest he look at other EU countries that already
have similar measures, certainly in terms of proportionality, and
operate them without any question of whether it is right for them to be
so operated. I believe it is possible for us to put these measures into
our law and do so in a way that provides extra safeguards for British
citizens. Many of the changes reflect the policies of other member
states, which means we can have confidence in their durability.
Co-operation across borders in the fight against crime is vital, but it
must not come at the expense of the civil liberties of British
subjects. I believe that the Government’s programme of reform
will get the balance

to delay, and there are very good examples of the EAW enabling speedier
extradition. Hussain Osman, one of the failed 21/7 bombers from 2005,

weeks. As I indicated earlier in response to an intervention, the

warrant, there is a clear difference between the extradition
arrangements in Europe now and those that previously existed, which
came under the banner of the Council of Europe. One of the key issues
is the level of delay that occurs; the European arrest warrant can be
exercised much more quickly. I cited the case of the failed 21/7 bomber
who was extradited from Italy in eight weeks. Before the introduction
of the European arrest warrant, that could have taken considerable
period of time—many months and potentially years. The ability to

exactly that issue in a number of areas—for example, pre-trial
detention—that right hon. and hon. Members have raised as a key
concern about the operation of the European arrest warrant. There are
member states that have been extraditing individuals before they have
properly investigated the case and before they have the evidence to
charge and try them. That has often led to British citizens waiting for
many months in jails abroad while the investigation took place. It is
why one of the changes I wish to make to the operation of the European
arrest warrant here in the UK would enable judges to discharge the
extradition request if the requesting country had not taken a decision
to charge and a decision to try the

Scrutiny Committee and the Select Committees, but, for example, we want
our law enforcement agencies to be able to establish joint
investigation teams with colleagues in other European countries; we
plan to rejoin the European supervision order, which allows British
subjects to be bailed back to the UK rather than spend months and
months abroad awaiting trial; and the second-generation Schengen
information system—a new way of sharing law enforcement alerts
throughout Europe—has the capacity to bring significant savings
to our criminal justice system, as well as make it easier to
identify foreign criminals. Again, this is just a question of practical
co-operation, so the Government plan to join the database. I hope the

its existing form as part of the 2014 decision. There is a separate
decision to be taken about Europol, and tonight’s debate will
not be about the organisation in its current form but in its proposed
future form. As things stand, the Commission proposes to change
Europol’s governance and powers, potentially allowing it to
direct national police forces and requiring us to share sensitive
intelligence crucial to our national security. I believe that would be
entirely unacceptable. These powers are unnecessary and would undermine
our way of policing—and Europol has not even asked for them. The
motive of the Commission appears to be nothing more than
state-building. That is why we will not opt into the new Europol

either Commission enforcement powers or the full jurisdiction of the
European Court of Justice. As a result, we could not be told by others

May:</Member></B> Let me give my hon. Friend the answer that I gave
when the matter was last raised with me. I do not believe that opting
back into these measures would trigger a referendum under the powers
that the Government have. However, I think Members should welcome the
Government’s statement that no future United Kingdom Government
will sign a treaty unless a suitable vote is held among the British
people.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071511000310" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130715/debtext/130715-0001.htm#13071511000310">The
issues involving justice and home affairs to which I referred earlier
are being considered in the Government’s “balance of
competences” review. Undoubtedly the jurisdiction of the
European Court of Justice will need to be considered when, after the
election, a future Conservative Government renegotiate Britain’s
relationship with the European Union; but the choice that is before us
now is binary. We are a coalition Government with no mandate to seek a
renegotiation of our relationship with Europe. We must make a choice
about whether, having exercised our right to opt out of these measures,
we should seek to opt back into any of them—knowing that we
would be subject to the junction of the European Court of
Justice—if we think that they are in the national
interest.</hs_Para>

the risks involved in being subject to the European Court, but when it
comes to the arrest warrant, I am also aware of the very significant
risks of having no framework within which we can extradite
criminals to and from Britain. Let me repeat that  
<?notus-xml column=784?>anyone who says that ECJ jurisdiction is too high a price must say how
they would cope without that extradition
framework.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071511000312" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130715/debtext/130715-0001.htm#13071511000312">It
would be remiss of me to participate in the debate without highlighting
the absurdity of the position of Labour Members. They have attacked our
decision to exercise the opt-out, but it was the last Government who
negotiated the opt-out in the first place. Their amendment demands that
we opt into various specific measures, but the former Home Secretary
the right hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle (Alan
Johnson) admits that the reason for our having to opt out of all these
measures en masse is the failure of Labour’s negotiating
strategy.</hs_Para>

Members now admit that the arrest warrant is in need of reform, but
they did not do a thing to change its operation when they were in
office. They question our negotiating strategy, but it was they who did
not just sign us up to the Lisbon treaty but wanted to sign the
constitutional treaty that went before it. They imply that somehow the
Government are not tough on crime, but our police reforms are working,
and crime is falling. They have no policies, no ideas, and nothing to
say. They are completely and utterly
irrelevant.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071511000314" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130715/debtext/130715-0001.htm#13071511000314">Let
me end as I began, by reminding the House what this debate is about. It
is about the fact that, for the first time in 40 years, a British
Government are bringing powers back from Brussels. Of course we should
not stop there, and, like many members of my party, I am impatient for
more. That is one reason why it is so important for us to have a
Conservative majority Government at the next election. Even as a
coalition, however, this Government have delivered the first ever cut
in a European budget, have vetoed a European treaty, and have put into
law a clear guarantee that no more powers will pass to Europe without a
referendum of the British people; and now we are bringing powers back
home.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071511000315" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130715/debtext/130715-0001.htm#13071511000315">A
vote in favour of the Government’s motion will send a clear
signal to the Commission and the other member states that Britain is
serious about bringing powers back home, and it will strengthen our
negotiating position in Brussels. The House will have an opportunity in
future to vote on the final list of measures that we will seek to
rejoin, but a vote in favour of the motion today is a vote in favour of
exercising the opt-out. I therefore call on Members on both sides of
the House to support the motion, and to vote with the
Government.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-15?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_15_PT_1/BE00B6E962915A069FEC6371363A7129E14D1019" __version__="1.9"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="15 July 2013">Monday

negotiating strategy in relation to opting back in, less than a week

European and constitutional experts on the implications, no chance to
find out whether transitional arrangements will be needed and what
risks might be attached to them, and no chance to explore the financial
penalty to Britain of pulling out. There has also been no chance for
those who have concerns about the European arrest warrant to assess the
impact of her reforms, and also no chance for those who support the
European arrest warrant, as we do, to make sure that it will not be put
at risk by those transitional arrangements or by opposition from the
Commission in the negotiations.</hs_Para>

why do we need a vote today to endorse the Home Secretary’s
plan? She does not need it to start negotiations. In fact she told the
House of Commons in October that negotiations had already started. She
does not need it to start the formal process with the Commission
either. In fact her own motion—the second and latest motion,

bounce Parliament; an attempt to get a rushed endorsement of her
strategy without Parliament having a proper chance to consider what is
going on. If she was serious about the parliamentary scrutiny to which
she belatedly made reference in her second motion, she would agree that
this vote on the Government’s strategy should be delayed and

me turn to the substance of the plan. Clearly, without time for
scrutiny it is hard for the House to take a view on the mix of measures
and the overall plan. I welcome the Home Secretary’s proposal to
opt back into some of the measures, and I am glad she has ignored the
Eurosceptic voices and has chosen to support the European arrest
warrant. She is right about the seriousness of the cases in which it
has been applied, and to support the arrest of Arunas Cervinskas,
returned from Britain to Ireland after his attempted rape and serious
assault of an 18-year-old girl, and the arrest only a few days ago of
Mark Lilley, who was found hidden in a luxury Spanish villa after 13
years on the run for drug smuggling and dealing. He will soon be back
in the UK to face his long prison sentence. Then there is the example
that the Home Secretary used last week and again today of Hussain
Osman, who was extradited back to the UK, after attempting to blow up a
tube train, in less than two months. She is right to say that
we cannot go back to the days when it took 10 years to
extradite a terror suspect to France or when it took 11 years to get
Ronnie Knight back from the costa del crime.</hs_Para>

am glad, too, that the Home Secretary has ignored the Eurosceptic
voices and decided to support joint investigation teams; she has
decided to support Operation Golf, in which 126 suspects from a
Romanian crime gang were arrested for benefit fraud, money laundering
and child neglect, and more than 270 trafficking victims were saved. We
cannot go back to the days when foreign crime gangs were untouchable,
allowed to damage our society or cause serious harm to victims. So I am
glad that she has decided to ignore the Eurosceptic Back
Benchers—to ignore the Fresh Start group—and instead to
agree with the arguments made by Labour Members, by the police and by
the Liberal Democrats.</hs_Para>

that opting into the EAW does mean it will be subject to the ECJ, but I
have to say to him that the importance of the EAW, not only to our
crime-fighting and to British police forces, but to victims is so
immense that it would be highly irresponsible, against the national
interest and against the interests of victims of crime to opt out of
it. I understand his views, and it is important that he should have the
opportunity to express them, but I just disagree with him on this
matter, given the serious cases we have seen. About 900 suspected
foreign criminals are extradited to other European countries each year
as a result of the EAW being in place. Without the EAW it would take
far longer to be able to send

practice guide on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters, but we
will keep one anyway as part of other plans for the European
investigation order. Nor will we sign up to the European judicial

UK bodies plan to do so anyway. We will not sign up to receive a
directory of specialist counter-terrorism officers, but we are already

John Redwood</B> (Wokingham) (Con):</Member> Today’s debate
should be about the very future of the United Kingdom’s
democracy. I and many of my right hon. and hon. Friends believe that
one of the great duties of a state is to settle on a fair and strong
criminal law and to ensure that the crime-fighting resources are put in
to maintain that law. We also believe that, in an increasingly global
world of criminal activity, those functions can be properly discharged
by the Home Secretary in Cabinet and by the police forces of our
country only if we have proper co-operation and collaboration
arrangements with other countries abroad. We need those co-operation
arrangements, not just with other European countries in the European
Union or the few countries in Europe not in the European Union, but
with every country around the world. I am pleased to say that thanks to
successive Governments and Home Secretaries we do have in place a set
of pretty good arrangements with the major countries, and we have
demonstrated our ability to negotiate successful arrangements for
extradition and mutual crime fighting with those countries that are not
in the European Union and to find ways of doing that with countries in
the European
Union<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T16:48:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071511000371" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130715/debtext/130715-0002.htm#13071511000371">Let
me make it clear at the outset that those of us who do not wish to opt
back in to European criminal justice measures are no more soft on crime
than anyone else in the House. We believe that there can be an
alternative way of ensuring proper co-operation and collaboration with
France, Germany and the other leading European Union countries, just as
we have those successful co-operation arrangements with countries that
are outside the European Union.</hs_Para>

different weights in the balance. He is giving us an immediate topical
problem of view, and I am giving him something fundamental about a
national democratic state and the future good government of our

have every confidence in the ability of the current and future Home

for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) seems about to allege that all members of
the European Union cannot be trusted and that we can do a deal only
with the Commission. I have more faith in France and Germany than he
does. I think that it would be in France’s and
Germany’s interests, should Britain opt out of the European
arrest warrant, to put in place really good arrangements, because they
will want them to operate for them in Britain just as surely as Britain
needs the arrangements to operate in France and Germany. As someone
who does not like centralised European government
arrangements, I find that I am often warm-hearted towards, and
supportive of, the French and Germans and believe that we can make very
good arrangements with them because it is in our mutual interests to do
so. It is the rapid pro-Europeans who so dislike our French and German
partners that they say that it all has to be bound up in central
European government because we cannot trust France and Germany to come
to a sensible arrangement with us over these important
matters.</hs_Para>

enhanced co-operation and collaboration with our nearest neighbours,
and of course I accept that there are more likely to be issues with
France, Belgium 
<?notus-xml column=794?>and Holland, because they are very close, than with countries in Asia,
so there is a reason for enhanced collaboration. We worked out a system
in which we could have better procedures, enhanced collaboration and
more co-operation, based on the mutual agreement of the states
involved, not based on an independent united states of Europe
Government, which is emerging as a result of this and other exercises

accept that this is a long and difficult process. Anyone who has served
as Minister for Europe—I see quite a few former Ministers for
Europe dotted around the Chamber—will know that dealing with the
European Union is not a piece of cake. It takes a huge amount of time
and effort to get one’s negotiating stance together, especially
when one is putting forward a view that will not be accepted by our
European colleagues. However, if the Government have had a long
discussion about these matters, the Home Secretary can expect the
Select Committees to want to scrutinise them. The Justice, Home Affairs
and European Scrutiny Committees all have right hon. and hon.

a result of the Government’s decision last Tuesday, of which we
had absolutely no notice, we have had to change the business that the
Committee had agreed in order to pursue this when we come back in
September. There will be only two sitting weeks in September to
scrutinise every one of these proposals. Then there is the natural
break for the party conferences, and the House will also come back for
two weeks in October. By and large, Select Committees, sit once a week.
Their members are very reluctant to sit more than once a week because
they are all assiduous Members of this House who have other things to
do, usually serving on 
<?notus-xml column=796?>other Committees. That means that if we devote all our time to this
cause, we will have just four sittings in which we can scrutinise the
proposals.</hs_Para>

the Home Secretary knows, a lot of business is going on in the Home

active Home Secretaries making structural changes to how policing,
immigration and counter-terrorism are dealt with. She has set the
Select Committee on Home Affairs a huge amount of work over the past

and are very minor. I read of someone who had the European arrest

person who gave false information when obtaining a loan of only
£200 from a Polish bank has also been subject to the European

question, as the Home Secretary has said, of whether our own laws would
be involved and whether we would be able to make appropriate amendments
in this House, but that the definition of judicial authority is absent
from the European arrest warrant? I suspect that that is the
reason why it is so difficult to deal with the examples the
right hon. Gentleman has given. It is a question not of whether we can
amend the laws in this House, but of whether the European arrest

Secretary, as
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T17:12:54"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Leicester East (Keith Vaz) described. She has listened, and
made changes to the original motion, which would have severely
prejudiced the scrutiny by this House that takes place in line with the
principles that
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T17:13:05"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood) set out. Those principles
are fundamental to the running of our affairs in this House that relate
to the European Union. There was a danger that the scrutiny process set
up under the requirements of our Standing Orders was going to be
completely bypassed, but the Home Secretary has listened and we have
made some progress.</hs_Para>

to a lot of problems not only in this country but elsewhere throughout
Europe. It is not just a question of whether we adjust our domestic law
in certain respects, but of whether the European arrest warrant can
properly fulfil the judicial role allocated to it. As I said earlier,
other matters such as dual criminality must also be considered. Many
questions looked at in 2001 were, as the shadow Home Secretary knows,
considered by the European Scrutiny Committee, although she was not
over-anxious to go into the detail. No doubt she will when she has an
opportunity to come back into the Chamber, and she is very welcome to
do that later

Home Affairs and Justice Committees, despite repeated promises that
those Committees would be consulted. There were also undertakings that
we would be given explanatory memorandums on measures covered by the

various lists, proposals, explanatory memorandums and the rest of it,
effectively bouncing the Committees and shunting straight past the
scrutiny process, in defiance of the promises and undertakings given
months ago. The Chairs are deeply concerned about this attempt to push
the scrutiny process to one side. The European Scrutiny Committee,
which I Chair, has a specific job to do under Standing Orders that
cannot be brushed aside by the Government or anybody else. Those are
the Standing Orders of the House. The other two Committees will want to
look at policy questions, but we consider proposals more on a
document-by-document basis, and there are 130-odd of them, so the
matter has to be dealt with within the framework of Standing
Orders.</hs_Para>

is an important debate. I do not approach this issue in an ideological
way. This is not about whether we are for Europe or against Europe; it
is about whether we come to a balanced decision that is in the best
interests of the United Kingdom. I have to be honest: I have some
reservations about the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. I
well remember the discussions inside Government when Labour was in
power about whether we should dismantle the third pillar and go along
with the suggestion that it should incorporated in the treaty on the
institutions of the European Union as a whole. I still have
some reservations and concerns about that.</hs_Para>

is also important to recognise just how significant the measures we are
debating are, particularly with regard to the European arrest warrant.
Whatever concerns we might have—for example, about the European
Court of Justice—it is important for us to look practically at
what the practitioners in the field say. I am thinking in particular of
the police. It is very significant indeed that the Association of Chief
Police Officers has said quite emphatically just how important the
European arrest warrant is in tackling international crime.</hs_Para>

face British justice for crimes committed here. It is important to
recognise what ACPO emphatically said in its evidence to the

in the evidence sessions held in the House of Lords indicated that
there was room for improvement. It is significant that the Home
Secretary specified in her statement this afternoon a number of
unilateral measures that the British Government would like to take to
improve the workings of the EAW. I would suggest, however, that it is
not simply a question of us wanting to improve the EAW. As the Home
Secretary said in response to my question, it is important to have a
dialogue with individual member states, but it is also important to
have a dialogue inside the institutions of the European Union.

David:</Member></B> One of the main concerns is that there are many
minor infringements. The Chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee
referred to the example of the Polish wheelbarrow theft. That provides
a clear practical example of where people realise that systems such as
this need to be changed. A number of practical points have been put

carefully.</hs_Para>

concern has been expressed about the practical workings of the EAW, but
the central point I want to make this afternoon is that the nature of
crime has changed markedly over the last few years. We all realise we
live in a global economy, but we are also seeing international crime
the like of which we have never seen before. The trend towards the
internationalisation of criminality is, frankly, likely to continue. I
well remember asking the then chief constable of Gwent, “Where
is the focal point for criminal planning and masterminding in
Gwent?” and the answer was that it was “in the
Balkans”. That brought home to me a very practical sense that if
we are serious about neighbourhood policing and tackling criminality in
our own areas, we have to be concerned not just about the national
picture but about the international picture, too. The European Union,
and the European arrest warrant in particular, represents a very
positive step towards addressing this practical reality.</hs_Para>

I say, practical reality is of primary concern, and it has to be placed
against other measures about which we might not be so enthusiastic,
such as the increasing jurisdiction and powers of the European Court of
Justice. However, on balance, I am confident that we should support the
proposal to opt into the
measures.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071511000467" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130715/debtext/130715-0002.htm#13071511000467">The
Government gave the clear impression that there would be far more
consultation and debate in the House than has actually taken place. I
intervened on the Home Secretary earlier when she quoted a statement
made back in January 2011 by the Minister for Europe, who stated
categorically that the Government would conduct further consultation on
the arrangements for the vote and that, in particular, there would be
consultation with the European Scrutiny, Home Affairs and Justice
Committees in both Houses. In fairness to the Minister, it must be said
that he recognised the significance of the vote and the need to go into
all the fine detail that is inherent in these measures; but sadly,
notwithstanding the apparent concession that was made a few moments
ago, the Government do not seem inclined to embrace the spirit of what
he said. I regret that, because I think it would be most unfortunate if
the impression were given that the House was being bounced into a
decision, and that we were engaged in a process that we did not wholly
understand because of its contradictory nature—what with
“in-out, in-out” and all the rest of it.</hs_Para>

is straightforwardness and transparency. We need a full appreciation of
the complexities of the issues, and a balanced, measured response to
the pros and cons with which we are faced. I think that the debate

I said earlier, this is an important issue, and no Member in any part

recognise the reality of the modern world in which we live, and we must
reach a balanced decision on whether these measures

warrant—will help or hinder the fight against crime. Personally,
I have no doubt that they will

That will mean that when British citizens are arrested overseas they

10 months in pre-trial detention and a further nine months on bail in
Greece, only then to be acquitted. That could all have been avoided if
he had been able to spend that time on bail back in the UK. Similarly,
EU nationals who come to the UK and commit crimes can be bailed back to

Long</B> (Belfast East) (Alliance):</Member> I am pleased to have an
opportunity to participate briefly in this debate. I want primarily to
address the issue of the EAW, which is of particular concern in
Northern Ireland because of the close co-operation required
between the justice Departments in Northern Ireland and the Republic of
Ireland in tackling terrorism and serious organised crime, on behalf of
not just Northern Ireland, but the rest of the United
Kingdom.</hs_Para>

recognise that the Home Secretary has clearly stated her intention to
opt back into the EAW, but I remain concerned at the impact of opting
out without any certainty on opting back in. It may be possible for the
UK to opt back into certain measures on an ad-hoc basis, but that will
not be automatic and it will need authorisation from the EU. If the UK
does opt back into a measure, it will have to accept re-entry criteria
and the rules of the Commission and Court. Those things have to be
taken into account.</hs_Para>

for Cambridge (Dr Huppert) as it is not in her gift to say that we will
definitely be able to opt back in; it will be for the EU to
decide, in negotiation with the UK. I accept that the intention is to
opt back in quickly and smoothly, but it is not possible at
this point to be assured on that. The uncertainty may not matter on
measures where we do not need or want to opt back in, but it is
dangerous on measures that are important to this country and its
security—the EAW is one such measure.</hs_Para>

I have indicated, there are continuing concerns in Northern Ireland
about the potential opt-out from a number of key areas, particularly
the EAW, and the collective impact that will have on cross-border
working with the Irish Republic, in particular, and with other states.
The Police Service of Northern Ireland has been 
<?notus-xml column=812?>very vocal in its opposition to the UK’s opting out of a number
of important measures and considers it vital that the UK opts back into
them as soon as possible. That view was also reflected in the ACPO
paper mentioned by other Members.</hs_Para>

believed that that was the single most important of the measures

existing European arrest warrant arrangements, and believed that it

believed that the best way to achieve improvements to the EAW system
was through negotiations with other member states from within. While I
welcome the fact that the Secretary of State says that she is pursuing
that matter, I remain concerned about the opt-out. I suspect that we
would all agree that there are flaws in the EAW—I believe,
however, that it worked reasonably well, and the evidence is that it
did so—and deficiencies have been identified, including
proportionality and the time that some nationals have spent in other
jurisdictions on remand following extradition. We would all wish to see
those matters reformed and addressed, but the opt-out could
have significant repercussions both for the internal security of the
United Kingdom and for the administration of criminal justice in the
UK, and it could reduce our influence over this area of EU
policy.</hs_Para>

the EAW. If the UK withdrew from that system, under the designation by
which member states that operate the system are regarded, we would
become a category 2 state, as opposed to category 1. Extradition would
then have to operate by way of formal requests from the UK Government
to other countries through bilateral treaties or under the European
convention on extradition.

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T18:03:12"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Beckenham (Bob Stewart), before the introduction of the
EAW, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland followed the
system known as the “backing of warrants”,
which allowed an arrest warrant issued in one jurisdiction to be passed
to police and endorsed or backed by a judge or magistrate in the area
where the subject of the warrant lived. The Backing of Warrants
(Republic of Ireland) Act 1965 was repealed by section 218(a) and
schedule 3 of the Extradition Act 2003. There is no reason to assume
that the Irish authorities would be willing to return to such a system.
The land border between the two jurisdictions necessitates speedy
arrangements that may no longer be available if the European convention
or a bilateral treaty were the basis of the extradition relationship. I
hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman’s question, because it
is a significant issue. Indeed, the Minister for Justice, Equality and
Defence in the Republic of Ireland, in discussions with the Minister of
Justice for Northern Ireland, has expressed concern about its impact,
given the repeal of legislation that facilitated north-south
extradition arrangements.</hs_Para>

however, Alan Shatter TD has just given up the chair of the EU Council
on Justice and Home Affairs, and is therefore exceptionally well placed
to gauge the Commission’s appetite for negotiating terms with
the UK to opt back in. His clear and continuing concern about the
opt-out should sound a note of caution for those who believe that an
opt-in will be simple and straightforward. I understand that this is a
reserved matter, but even when matters are reserved decisions made by
the UK Government can impact on the criminal justice system in devolved
settings, and nowhere more so than Northern Ireland, given that we have
a land border with the Republic of Ireland and thus a vested interest
in close co-operation.</hs_Para>

Cross-border co-operation is essential in tackling security threats and
organised crime, not only in Northern Ireland but across the whole of
the United Kingdom. Of the third pillar measures, the possible opt-out
from the EAW is the one that causes most alarm among all stakeholders

we were not happy with the wording which then emerged, which was a
considerable improvement on the Government’s first motion, was
that it appeared to us that the words would restrict the
Committees’ ability to argue for the inclusion of measures not
on the list or the exclusion of measures that were on the list. Our
understanding had been that specific confirmation of the list was a
matter for the second debate and vote, after the Committees had
considered the issues raised by the Government’s statement of
what they were minded to do on the various opt-in

Members who devote a great deal of time to the issue and I am reluctant
to become the arbiter of this argument. All we sought to secure in our
capacity as Committee Chairs was that the Committees’ ability to
do the job was not inhibited and could not be restricted by someone
pointing to the wording and saying, “You can’t discuss
that possibility. It’s outwith your reach.” What the
Government had made clear all along and made clear again to me in a
telephone call last week while I was away with the Justice Committee
was that there is to be a second-stage process as originally envisaged,
and at that stage there will be confirmation of what is at present
clear Government policy as to what the list is, following
consideration of the representations and views that may be put forward

other Members, I am not clear exactly what the Home Secretary thinks
she is trying to achieve today. She says the vote will be a signal to
our European partners, but where in the opt-out arrangements is there
any requirement to have such a vote at this stage? Unless she intends
to ignore the reports of the various Select Committees and the calls
from Back Benchers to let us, item by item, decide on the measures that
we want to opt back into, all we can possibly be signalling today is
our intention to exercise the block opt-out and an intention to try to
opt back into some unspecified measures. So I am not clear about the
reason for the vote
now<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T18:17:29"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Minister suggested that it was for political reasons. I wonder whether
it is more to do with the proximity of the Conservative party

the Minister clarify the exact date for notifying plans to opt out? The
Government say it is 31 May, but I have seen other calculations that
challenge that date. I am conscious that Home Office officials have had

of the things that I would like to know before we conclude the debate
is what estimate the Government have made of the possible costs of
cessation of participation under article 10(4). Throughout the now
discarded Command Paper the Government merely repeat the
view that they consider the economic impacts to be negligible, but
unless we have some idea of how they arrive at those figures, we could
be asked to vote for a blank cheque today. I am not quite as
comfortable with that as others might
be<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T18:19:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071525000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130715/debtext/130715-0002.htm#13071525000040">I
am also worried about the implications for security and
organised crime. Article 40 of the Schengen convention of June 1985
covers surveillance and assistance across borders, but the
Government’s own Command Paper acknowledges that opting out of
article 40 will leave us reliant on international letters of request.
It goes on to point out that there would be no way to compel other
states to respond to international letters of
request<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T18:19:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071525000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130715/debtext/130715-0002.htm#13071525000041">Any
transitional arrangements made following the opt-out are made by the
Commission and the Council without the UK, so what will happen if the
transitional arrangements are not acceptable? As I understand it, we
are talking about 30 measures on issues decided by the Council and the
Commission, and they are subject to qualified majority voting. The
measures that apply to the Schengen agreement are subject to unanimity
with a veto, and we have all seen that the veto can be exercised in
Europe. It would be helpful if we could have some further explanation

we will seek to opt back in. In any event, at the point that we opt
out, the Government’s intention is to fall back on the 1957

that approach. Like

opt-out on Europol. I do not know what his coalition partners would
make of this, but he seems to think that we can opt out for a matter of
hours, and then opt back in. I cannot believe that a single person in
the country would think that a worthwhile state of affairs. It would
involve an inordinate amount of time and energy for very little. I have
to assume that optimistic though the hon. Gentleman is—it is
quite likely that once we opt out of Europol we will be allowed back
in; I have no doubt about that—his hopes of keeping the present
occupant of the job in his post is slim

consideration have the Government given to article 10(5) of protocol
36, which I understand specifies overarching conditions regarding the
opt-out, and that Commission members need to be satisfied that there is
nothing in the UK’s behaviour in making the decision to opt out
and then seeking to opt back in that will affect the practical
operability of the measures. That will play an important part. Two
things occur to me. The first is that it was not quite so easy for
Denmark to opt back in. Secondly, how will we maintain the positions
that we hold within some of these European institutions while we are no
longer part of them? One of the prices that we have to pay for the
opt-out may be to diminish rather than strengthen British influence
within some of those institutions.</hs_Para>

are all matters worthy of some consideration and scrutiny. I cannot
understand why the Home Secretary, on such a matter where one would
have thought she needed quite a few allies, is not trying to find
greater consensus. It would not be difficult to get agreement in the
House that we should now exercise the block opt-out. It is a cumbersome
process, but it would not be difficult. I do not see why we are not
then using the time available 
<?notus-xml column=819?>to let Parliament and the Select Committees reach maximum agreement on
what we want to opt back into. The Home Secretary opening negotiations
and then finding herself in a position where Parliament does not agree
with her will hardly strengthen her hand. Rather it will weaken her
position. It would be much easier to make requests for transitional
arrangements if there were a clear, strong body of opinion behind her
in the House. At the moment, since we are not sure what she will try to
opt back into and how many of her Back Benchers will support her or
undermine her, it is difficult to know which transitional measures we
should be getting behind her on. I fear that she is putting the

we debate the flaws or merits of the EAW, we do well to recall what

first place: the growing threat of international terrorism. The EAW
ensures that dangerous suspects who threaten our security or commit
crimes on British soil are held to account by our jurisdiction. Its
fundamental aim is to serve the national interest, and it has already
been proven to do just that. We lose its effectiveness at our

enabled a faster, simpler and more cost-effective extradition process
for convicted offenders and criminal suspects right across Europe, and
the statistics back that up. Before the EAW was introduced in 2004,
extradition took, on average, a year. Today that has been cut to an
average of 48 days, or 16 days if the suspect agrees to surrender.
Since the EAW was introduced the number of extraditions has increased
significantly, and it continues to rise year on year. Since 2009 we
have issued around 150 warrants each year so that people suspected of
committing crimes on British soil can be brought to justice. The number
of suspected criminals who have been extradited to European countries
over the same period has risen from 772 to over 1,000, and that

with the EU. Under the EAW, unlike its predecessor, EU member states
can no longer refuse to extradite their citizens on grounds of
nationality. Extradition no longer requires a political decision for a
suspect to be handed over. The European arrest warrant is not a
political instrument; it is an instrument that works in the interests
of justice and in our national interest, and if we fight and lose it,
we will jeopardise the fight against serious cross-border crime. Let us
not play politics with this very serious

cannot separate the question of the European arrest warrant, or the
other measures that the Government have announced they intend to opt
into, from the European area of freedom, security and justice. My view
on these matters is determined by my view of the European
Union’s so-called area. I do not believe that it is a question
of simply looking at individual measures and deciding whether opting in
or out or co-operating here or there is in the national interest; my
view is that the national interest is a question of this House and this
Parliament determining the laws to which we are to be made
subject.</hs_Para>

below those that we would expect to see in this country. That includes
people being put on trial for very serious offences, having already
been acquitted of those offences, only to be told much later that the
whole charge against them was to be dropped. There is a long list of
such cases in which the European arrest warrant has gone wrong, and
they have been well documented, and I think that was reflected in the
critical testimony that Lord Justice Thomas, the senior extradition

There are also wider efforts to harmonise criminal law, which are
wholly unnecessary and, to be frank, set a pretty bad precedent.
Whether the question is which drugs to ban or how to define the

want to touch on three specific measures. First, on Europol, I have no
hesitation in saying that British police should share information and
co-operate at an operational level. I worked directly with Europol and
Eurojust when I was posted to The Hague during my time at the Foreign
and Commonwealth Office. I see real value in the college structure that
allows smoother day-to-day co-operation between national offices.
Europol is not perfect as currently configured. It has all the features
of bureaucracy and waste that we expect from the EU,
including—believe it or not—the €35,000 contract
it signed in 2010 to send flowers to
itself.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071540000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130715/debtext/130715-0003.htm#13071540000047">For<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T19:00:36"></hs_TimeCode>
all its flaws, Europol serves an important function. However, it is not
in the UK national interest to see Europol acquire supranational powers
that trump national authority over our police. I am already nervous
about the existing power of Europol to initiate investigations in the
UK and the increasingly limited right to
refuse<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T19:00:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071540000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130715/debtext/130715-0003.htm#13071540000048">The
new regulation on Europol, which we will debate later, would also
require UK police forces to give foreign police open access to their
files. All this would be interpreted by the European Court of Justice.
Step by step, the EU is heading towards a supranational model. What is
our long-term vision? Should we not be saying, clearly and
unambiguously, that we will not hold back willing EU states that want
to go down this route, but that it is not a model we will subscribe to
over the long term? I ask again whether Ministers have laid down a

on Eurojust, a college of collaborating national prosecutors is hugely
beneficial. I would rather it did not splash out €300,000 on

because previously people could be extradited before the foreign

dogmatic approach to it. The optimum solution would be not to ditch the
EAW altogether, but for Britain, having exercised the block opt-out, to
press for safeguards as a condition of opting back in. The problem with
that, however, is that I understand that the Government regard
renegotiation of the framework decision as unfeasible within Europe
because there is no majority to support it. Incidentally, that blows a
hole in the Liberal Democrats’ stance of saying that we can
achieve safeguards through negotiation if we opt back in straight away.
That is naive: we would lose all our leverage. I will come back shortly

other cheerleaders for the EAW seem to point to the Hussain Osman and

nationals—whether they be in Spain or whether they are Jeremy
Forrest, Hussain Osman or any of the other names that are bandied
around—should be deported, not extradited, straight back home
without fuss or fanfare. The point is that, far from being the cure, EU
law in the form of the 2004 citizenship directive, which Labour blindly
and irresponsibly agreed to, has whittled away the power to deport
nationals back home, which is 
<?notus-xml column=831?>another clear area where Britain should seek

argument is that extradition under the old Council of Europe
conventions would be slower. That is true, but it does not mean that
any fugitives would go free. Their return might end up being delayed

But, in the absence of adequate reform of the EAW, the slightly slower
surrender of crooks in return for protecting the innocent is not the
worst situation we could be in, at least for a limited period during

of the differences between our jurisdiction and those of the other
member states are sometimes a little over-dramatised. In this country,
we rightly place great emphasis on the charging process and on the
process that follows, from charge up to and including trial. One of the
great differences in our way of proceeding in criminal matters is to be
found following the decision to charge and during the detention of the
defendant. In other member states, the process is often much more
inquisitorial, with a heavy degree of judicial involvement in the
investigation. It can involve a wholly different way of dealing with
criminal proceedings from that of England and Wales, and indeed of
Scotland.</hs_Para>

underlines the fundamental issue that we have with many of the
proposals that emanated from the justice and home affairs pillar.
Notably, one proposal that we rightly decided not to opt into related
to access to lawyers. In this jurisdiction, we believe that access to
lawyers is fundamental once a subject is charged and being interviewed
formally in a police station under the terms of the Police and Criminal
Evidence Act 1984. However, if we read the EU directive carefully, we
see that the proposal applies to the investigative stage as well. I
could not support that, and neither could the Government, bearing in
mind the potential consequences for the admissibility of evidence in a
trial and the burdens that it would place on the investigating
authorities, which would have to ensure that lawyers were present at
the early stages of the criminal process.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T19:15:21"></hs_TimeCode>That is why a
process of opting in en bloc would have been wholly wrong. It would
have embraced far too many aspects of justice and home affairs that are

want to address what is probably the most politically contentious
issue, the European arrest warrant. I shall remind the House of some
further statistics relating to the arrest and surrender of people under
the warrant. Between April 2009 and April this year, just over 4,000
people were surrendered from England and Wales to another EU country,
of which only 181—or about 5% —were United Kingdom
nationals. In reverse, 507 people were surrendered to the United
Kingdom from another EU country in that same period, of which just over
half were British
nationals.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T19:16:28"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

in a large number of other measures, there exist helpful schemes of
mutual recognition that will assist prosecutors—for example,
when they are seeking to adduce evidence of previous convictions,

made the point earlier about the distinction between our system of
justice and certain others. Ours seeks to use proper evidence to
identify individuals who are suspected of committing crimes, and then
to proceed against them. We have to look at that in the context of
other systems in which the investigation process is far too long and in
which evidence that we would not regard as strongly probative can be
used to launch an investigation that can result in someone being
incarcerated for an inordinate period of time.

to the Anti-social behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill, which will amend
the Extradition Act 2003, are vital in this context. I was delighted to
see that one amendment provides that, in the absence of a prosecution
decision, a court would have to consider that factor before allowing
extradition. In fact, it would be barred where there was no clear
prosecution decision to charge or try the individual concerned. I
believe that the sort of monstrous situation in which Mr Symeou and
others have found themselves can in large measure be
avoided.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T19:19:58"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

the countries of the European Union took themselves down a massive

growing economic crisis that exploded on us all in 2007-08. That is
history and we must deal with its consequences, but the framework
within which we operate is something the Government could not control.
Setting out a clear intention—as the Government are
doing—indicating which proposals they wish to opt back into, and
allowing this place to debate each measure piece by piece, is the right
way to proceed. That sends a clear message to our colleagues in the
European Union, and allows practical measures to be taken that will
enhance the administration of justice, while at the same time avoiding

required even to consider that that could be in the national interest.
I know that his views will be persuasive to many colleagues. Instead of
making the decision today, we should decide just to opt out on a block
basis and leave for some time after tomorrow—perhaps many months
from now—the decision on what, if anything, to opt back into. I
congratulate the Government on their revised
approach.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-15?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_15_PT_1/E26010E704A95DBBF36D264F365DA97BD268F052" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="15 July 2013">Monday

that the Government, in their wisdom, have acceded to amendment

for parliamentary scrutiny, and instead of having time when the Select
Committees could do their work thoroughly and consider this matter of
the greatest importance, we were told that what was going to happen was
a vote today to agree to the Government’s position, with very
little opportunity for any scrutiny at all. It is therefore
hugely to be welcomed that the Government decided that that was not the
right way to proceed, and that the views of Parliament, representing
our constituents, were important in this matter to be able to see what
was happening, to deliberate, to report, to take evidence and to decide
what, if anything, it might be in the national interest to opt back
into. While I am grateful that the opportunity for parliamentary
scrutiny has improved, it was really quite extraordinary that last
Tuesday we were in such a situation as to have been denied
parliamentary scrutiny almost altogether. There is some praise now, but

to our friends in Brussels, but on this occasion there was a noble
fight. Horatius was on the bridge standing there fending off the massed
hoards coming from Europe to impose their will on brave little Blighty,

in both senses of the man. The rock was pushed up to the top of the

down again. To use a cricketing metaphor—which is appropriate in
the middle of an Ashes test series—the degree of spin required
to say that we are seeing the repatriation of power reminds me only of
that famous ball bowled by Shane Warne, when he was first visiting
England, when he removed Mike Gatting. It spun so much, so far that it
went down in history as one of the great balls in cricket. Even Tich
Freeman at his peak, when he got 305 wickets in a season, did not bowl
so much spin as this Government are bowling. Even Jim Laker in 1956 was
not spinning away so much when he got 19 wickets in Manchester against
the Australians, for there is no real repatriation of powers.</hs_Para>

justice—and the fount of justice—is the essence of
sovereignty. Why is Her Majesty sovereign? She is sovereign because she
is the fount of justice in this country. When we hand justice over, so
we hand sovereignty over—and so the move in sovereignty by
making things justiciable in front of the European Court is a major

co-operate; they commit crimes in many different countries; they travel

they try to get away with it. Crime does not stop at the channel, which
is why co-operation on justice and home affairs across the European

back in is complex in itself, but as Commissioner Reding said earlier

themselves the right to proceed with the process of opting out. It is
true that protocol 36 —which was mentioned by the hon. Member

through the Lobbies to vote against one. It promised us that the
charter of fundamental rights would have no legal force, and then voted
to give it legal force. Members will recall the unedifying episode in
which the former Prime Minister was so committed to the Lisbon treaty
that he had signed that he would not even turn up for the official
event to mark its signing,

more than 130 measures agreed before the Lisbon treaty, which affect
the administration of justice and the fight against crime in this
country. Labour Members knew that, which is why they kicked the can
down the road. It is why they put off the decision, and why they
negotiated the opt-out from those 130-odd measures at some point in the
future. I suppose that we should give them some credit at least for
creating circumstances in which this Government have the option to
decide what to do on behalf of the country, and this Parliament has the
option to decide. That that decision now resides on this side of the

get-out clause that the last Government put in place. The Lisbon treaty
allows the UK two freedoms. The first is to opt in or out of any new
measures the Commission brings forward, so we now only participate in
new measures that are in the national interest. The second is to opt
out of the policing and criminal justice measures in existence before
the Lisbon treaty. Tonight’s vote is about whether this country
takes up that second opt-out—nothing more, nothing less. If we

time what it wanted to do, and it cannot decide again tonight. The
lesson is that the Labour party was defeated at the last election

let me restate clearly to it what tonight’s vote is all about.
This vote starts a process. The Government have reached a settled view
that we do not want to participate in all the 130-plus measures. We do
not want to be part of a European justice system, but we do
want to be part of the fight against international crime. We do not
want courts across Europe to be told by Brussels the minimum standards
that should apply to the sentences they impose. We do not want matters
that should be 
<?notus-xml column=851?>resolved by member states to be legislated for at a European level. We
want to bring powers in those areas back to the UK.</hs_Para>

are clear that we must exercise this opt-out or face being subject to
all those measures anyway. We have decided we do not want to follow a
path that leads to a European justice system. Tonight’s vote,
and the vote due to take place in the House of Lords next week, will, I
hope, back our judgment and exercise that
opt-out<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T20:21:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071546000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130715/debtext/130715-0003.htm#13071546000045">What

the House and my hon. Friends who share that concern is that I would
not personally have signed up to this package without the sensible
reforms the Home Secretary is proposing. With those reforms being put
into legislation, I can say to those colleagues who shared my

we have won a majority in the next general election; it will be part of
a process of bringing powers back to this country, which we desperately
need to do, and of restoring a position that is right for the United
Kingdom. But tonight’s vote is about whether or not we exercise
the opt-out that the Labour party rightly negotiated—an opt-out
that is clearly in the interests of this country. It is so essential
that we act in the interests of this country tonight. So I call on all

this House takes note of European Union Document No. 8229/13
and Addenda 1 to 6, a draft Regulation of the European Parliament and
of the Council on the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement
Cooperation and Training (Europol) and repealing Decisions 2009/371/JHA
and 2005/681/JHA; and agrees with the Government that the UK should opt
into the Regulation post-adoption, provided that Europol is not given
the power to direct national law enforcement agencies to initiate
investigations or share data that conflicts with national
security.</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13071546001263" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130715/debtext/130715-0003.htm#13071546001263">The
motion sets out the position that the Government intend to take on the
new Europol regulation, which the Commission published at the end of
March. The motion makes clear our view that we should not opt into the
regulation now but only after it is adopted, provided that the two
conditions set out in the motion are met. Those are that the regulation
does not empower Europol to direct national law enforcement agencies to
initiate investigations and that it does not require them to share data
that conflict with national security. To join the regulation with those
requirements in it would not be
acceptable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071546001264" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130715/debtext/130715-0003.htm#13071546001264">In
making the recommendation, the Government had two choices. We could opt
into the new Europol regulation by the initial deadline of 30
July—in other words, within three months of its publication.
That would give us a vote in the negotiations, but would mean that we
were bound by the final text even if it contained measures that we
could not support. Alternatively, we could wait until the negotiations
were finished and then make a decision, knowing exactly what we would
be signing up to. That is the approach that the Government are
recommending
tonight.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071546001265" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130715/debtext/130715-0003.htm#13071546001265">In
saying that, I recognise, of course, the important help that Europol
gives us in the fight against cross-border crime. I have seen that at
first hand and I know it has played a crucial role in helping the
police catch some very serious criminals. For instance, Operation
Rescue brought together law enforcement authorities from 13
countries to tackle an online paedophile network. Europol cracked the
security features on the network’s server, which allowed law
enforcement to identify the offenders. As a result, 121 suspects were
arrested in the UK and 230 children were protected from
abuse.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071546001266" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130715/debtext/130715-0003.htm#13071546001266"><Member ContinuationText="Keith Vaz" PimsId="4426" UID="13071546003222" xid="614" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130715/debtext/130715-0003.htm#13071546003222"><B>Keith

can point to other examples. Operation Golf, which has been cited
several times previously in this House, was a joint UK-Romania
investigation team targeting a specific Romanian organised crime
network. Offences associated with the network included human
trafficking, money laundering, benefit fraud, perverting the course of
justice, theft, and handling stolen goods. Europol provided analytical
support and facilitated real-time checks on its systems, and 126
individuals were arrested in the UK. Europol’s help in Operation
Seagrape led directly to the identification of bank accounts used
by a people-smuggling gang based near Dunkirk. French, Belgian
and British agencies worked jointly to target a specific organised
crime group, and 36 arrests were made.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T21:00:38"></hs_TimeCode>It is for those
reasons that the Government believe that it is in the national interest
to seek to rejoin the current arrangements for Europol agreed back in
2009 as part of the 2014 decision. That was made clear in our
discussions in the previous debate.</hs_Para>

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T21:01:01"></hs_TimeCode>that is not the
matter before us now. Instead, we need to decide whether to opt into
the new regulation, which sets down new rules and powers for Europol
and, we believe, would change its relationship with member states in
some quite troubling ways. Our first concern is with the proposals on
data exchange. The Commission wants member states to share more data
with Europol. That is a good idea in principle; after all, Europol can
only be as effective as the information it holds. However, a strong
legal obligation to supply it with data, as proposed in the draft
regulation, is a different matter. It would undermine member
states’ control over their own law enforcement intelligence,
which we regard as absolutely
fundamental.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071546001271" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130715/debtext/130715-0003.htm#13071546001271">Even
more worrying is the fact that the draft regulation does not exempt
member states from providing information even if it could damage
national security, or endanger ongoing operations or an
individual’s safety. These protections are explicit in the
existing instrument governing Europol but absent from the new proposal.
That is a significant change. The proposal also strengthens
Europol’s power to request investigations. It can already do
this to some extent, but the new proposal creates a presumption that
member states will comply with a request. It also strengthens their
duty to give reasons if they decide not to do so. That is particularly
worrying because any reasons could be subject to challenge before the
European Court of Justice.</hs_Para>

that there is qualified majority voting and the European Parliament can

Brokenshire:</Member></B> I heard my hon. Friend speak in the preceding
debate about the importance of continuing operational co-operation.
Members from all parties recognise the transnational nature of crime
and the subsequent operational need for law enforcement divisions from
all European member states to be able to collaborate and co-operate in
order to fight it. We certainly believe that, because of the way in
which Europol can bring a number of member states together in one
space, it is the most effective way to proceed, provided that the
appropriate safeguards are met when the measure is finally concluded
and negotiated, and that they reflect the concerns that my hon. Friend
raised in the previous debate about extensions into supranational
competency. The Home Secretary also made clear in the previous debate
her views on a European police force.</hs_Para>

to those safeguards being introduced, we believe that a reformed
Europol measure is the optimum way forward, but it is clearly open to
us to negotiate individual operational relationships with other member
states. However, in our judgment, the nature of Europol and the
intelligence work that it conducts in support of member states’
law enforcement agencies mean that our emphasis will be on seeking to
influence the measure and to be in a position to opt into it following
its adoption, provided that the appropriate safeguards are achieved.
Again, that will be subject to further parliamentary scrutiny, and to
the potential for a further debate in this House, to assess and analyse
the provisions and to ensure that the appropriate safeguards are
provided.</hs_Para>

with the Labour party too. The Government might find themselves in a
position where they cannot maintain a presence in Europol. Europol will
have developed organically over 18 months to two years and we will not

Carmichael</B> (Stroud) (Con):</Member> One thing is clear: most of us
think that we should be in Europol. My hon. Friends in the Liberal
Democrats, the Opposition Front Benchers and the Minister are all clear
on that. It is good that we have all come to that
conclusion. It is fundamentally right that serious crime can be dealt
with internationally across Europe, and Europol is the right tool to do
that. I expect Britain to remain in Europol. However, the questions
about data management, national security and so on that the Minister
drew to our attention need further reflection and debate.</hs_Para>

for the Association of Chief Police Officers, the central point is not
so much what it would like as an outcome regarding our membership of

influence during the negotiation
period?<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T21:29:18"></hs_TimeCode>That is
the central question, and it is one to which we will return in relation
to a number of other issues, as we consider our future relationship
with the European Union as a whole and various aspects of it. However,
I would put down the marker that it is important for us to
engage—as I think we will, based on what the Minister
said—because we have to protect our interests in the ways that
he described and that get us the right outcome.</hs_Para>

Gentleman is absolutely right that everyone who has spoken so far
supports Europol—one wonders what we are debating—and is
full of praise for Rob Wainwright, who is one of the very few British
people to head a European organisation. Everyone who has spoken has
been full of praise for an organisation that can look back at a history
of co-operation between all European countries. I had the privilege of
visiting Europol five weeks ago, and meeting Rob Wainwright and looking
at the various methods by which countries co-operate. It was
fascinating, and I would urge every Member of 
<?notus-xml column=872?>the House to go. The Select Committee on Home Affairs will
probably go later this year, during our inquiry into international
crime and
terrorism<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T21:31:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071546001333" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130715/debtext/130715-0004.htm#13071546001333">Europol
basically has an office for every European country, with its police
officers present in those offices. If people wish to try to track down
criminals who have left this country and gone to other countries, our
office can be contacted. Those officers then cross the
corridor—literally—and hand the information to a police
officer in another country. Almost immediately the information is
transmitted to that other country, so while the serious and organised
criminals are out there trying to commit crimes, here we have an
organisation that is working to cut through the red tape of the
European Union and producing some superb results. As the Minister said,
not only did Operation Golf—the operation that brought together
our police force and the Romanian police—result in many strands
of human trafficking being disrupted, but we caught real criminals.
That was a great benefit to both countries.</hs_Para>

heard what the shadow Minister said about the Association of Chief
Police Officers, and he is absolutely right: we should take into
consideration what ACPO is saying. He is right to draw the
House’s attention to the fact that ACPO has written to the Prime
Minister and others about its concerns. However, at the end of the day,
such decisions are matters for this House and those who sit in it.
Although ACPO can be helpful in providing advice to this House and to
Ministers, ultimately it is we who need to make the decision.</hs_Para>

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T21:33:41"></hs_TimeCode>comes down to
this point. We need to opt in because Europol is a successful
organisation—one that actually catches international criminals
and disrupts criminal networks. In the area of Europol
dedicated to monitoring the internet, I saw how, almost hourly,
ACPO officials can view sites that are dedicated to supporting and
encouraging terrorism. If we did not have organisations like Europol,
our job in this country and the job of our police service would be much
more difficult.</hs_Para>

I think the Government are making a mistake in this motion. I supported
the Government in the last vote because the Government accepted the
amendment of the Chairs of the Select Committees and allowed us the
opportunity to scrutinise the opt-out arrangements—and, we hope,
the opt-in arrangements—when we have finished our scrutiny. The
mistake that has been made is this: if we are not at the table
influencing the way in which Europol 2, if we can call it that, will
develop, I feel that we will not do justice to the police services in
this country and we will not do justice to what we want to see happen

one of the Minister’s arguments is “If we are there, it
has to go to qualified majority voting”. He could ask the
Minister for Europe about this, but I think he will find if he looks at
the figures that we are almost always on the winning side when it comes
to QMV. I do not know whether he has the figures, whether his officials
could give him them or whether he could tell us about them if he makes
a winding-up speech, but unless things have changed in the last 10
years, when a British Minister sits at a table where European issues
are being discussed and it goes to a vote, we are almost always on the
winning side.</hs_Para>

think we will be on the winning side on this particular issue because
it is to do with policing and we are hugely respected for the work we
do in the fight against international crime. I think the
Minister’s argument is weak when he effectively says “We
are afraid of the results at the European Council and we cannot take a
risk because we might lose”. Of course we might lose, but I
think we can make these arguments, especially because we have a British
head of Europol, who has recently been confirmed for another

British Minister who would be widely respected on the justice and home
affairs agenda. He would be able to put his views forward in his
articulate and intelligent way while sitting at a meeting. He will
obviously draw on the efforts of ACPO, but I agree with

will remember, Mr Speaker, although I do not want to draw you into the

to vote for it”—until, of course, it changed its mind and
we did not follow that approach. We hugely respect ACPO and all the
people in it, but at the end of the day we need to make this decision.
I very much hope that the Minister will think again and allow us the
opportunity to be there at the top table, influencing these

Julian Huppert</B> (Cambridge) (LD):</Member> There seems to be a
wonderful outbreak of agreement about the value of Europol. I am not
sure that all the Members who 
<?notus-xml column=874?>contributed to the last debate would subscribe
entirely to that agreement, but certainly those of us who are here now
do so, and that pleases me very much. However, wonderful as it is,
Europol could be updated and reformed. I am glad that the Commission is
proceeding with that task, and that we will see a new, improved Europol
in 2015. I fear that the United Kingdom will be sidelined if we do not
opt into the Europol regulation.</hs_Para>

earlier, almost half the 600 investigations that Europol is currently
pursuing have links to the UK, and that is a huge factor for British
policing. I will not list all Europol’s other wonderful merits,
but I will make a connection with the last debate. I think it will have
been an enormous waste of time, money and other resources if we decide
to opt out of everything, then opt back into Europol in the
negotiations leading up to 2014, and then get kicked out
again in 2015. That strikes me as a very bizarre way of doing
things.</hs_Para>

issues, which the Minister outlined very clearly, are data sharing and
the proposal that would enable Europol to force the UK to initiate
investigations. I do not think that those issues are as huge as some
have made them out to be, but they have prompted concern, and it is
right for us to deal with that. Data sharing is extremely important,
but the changes that are being made are alarming. I think that many of
the other member states would agree with us, and I suspect that neither
of those proposals will be in the final version. Other countries will
not want to share data when doing so could be too damaging. A certain
amount of operational independence is necessary, and Britain should not
break that
principle.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071546001347" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130715/debtext/130715-0004.htm#13071546001347">It
is always a pleasure to follow the right hon. Member for Leicester East
(Keith Vaz). Like him—and, I believe, the other Liberal
Democrats—I should prefer simply to remain at the table in order
to be in on the negotiations at the outset. I think that if we had a
full voting seat and could shape the future of Europol, we would win on
the two points that I have mentioned and, I suspect, many others.
However, that is not an option, so I am very pleased that the motion
commits the Government to opting into the regulation post-adoption as
long as the provisions relating to data sharing and the initiation of
investigations remain. That strikes me as a reasonable approach which
will ensure that we have the benefits of Europol and can continue to
play a leading role in it, and I hope that our membership continues
under the existing framework in the
meantime.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071546001348" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130715/debtext/130715-0004.htm#13071546001348">I

Europol, although I do not think that I would go quite as far as some
Members in saying how wonderful it is in every particular, as though it
were an instrument of perfection. I do not think it is that; it is, in
fact, a rather bureaucratic organisation. Nevertheless, I appreciate
its work, which it does extremely well. Its law enforcement
achievements are there for all to see on its website, and it can be
very proud of those achievements, which are signal in many respects.
Generally speaking, I support Europol. I also appreciate the good work
Rob Wainwright does in heading that organisation, and I am glad his
term of office has been extended. There are too few British
officials in charge of European organisations, and I would like to see
more of them doing
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071546001357" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130715/debtext/130715-0004.htm#13071546001357">I
agree with the Minister that it is not appropriate at this point to be
talking about opting in, because we are not to do in this House what
others would not do in their respective legislatures in Europe, which
is see our sovereignty or security put at risk
inappropriately—or at all. Where there is insecurity, as far as
we are concerned, about the sovereign powers of this country, I do not
accept we should opt into the regulations as they currently are or as
they are envisaged. We should be very cautious about where we go in
respect of Europol and opting in.</hs_Para>

where people can escape the law and justice, as has been the case
hitherto. All Members across the House accept this principle as it is

functions are addressed, and can be supported, through the European
arrest warrant, which we discussed in our earlier debate. I have been a
strong critic of the EAW in its previous form, but I can again support
the Government in this provision for the simple reason that the
envisaged changes to the EAW before we could opt back into it are such
that they effectively mean it will be completely different from before.
If we deal with the three main problems, it will, in my submission, be
a different entity—a different thing—even though the name
may be the same. The first problem is to do with
proportionality—the fact that far too minor and petty offences
were subject to extradition. That made it an object of ridicule, as
well as injustice, in many cases. There is also the issue of charging.
People were being extradited to European countries without those
countries having made a charging decision as to whether, and how, to
proceed. We must also address the issue of bail, so that individuals
who are suspected of offences can be bailed pending their proceedings.
Addressing those problems would have the effect of completely changing
the EAW; it would be unrecognisable from the current instrument. That
should reassure those who are concerned about opting back into
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T21:48:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071546001361" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130715/debtext/130715-0004.htm#13071546001361">Europol

are trying to influence the negotiations but not be part of them; we
might be accused of wanting to have our gateau and eat it at the same

of the negotiations on the mass opt-out, we are securely committing,

that Rob Wainwright, a Brit, is leading this organisation shows us a
new model of the way in which we should approach European issues across

Brokenshire:</Member></B> With the leave of the House, Mr
Speaker, may I thank right hon. and hon. Members for their
contributions in this short debate? Let me be clear that our
recommendation in the motion is about participation in a future measure
governing Europol; it has no impact on our current participation in
Europol, which does benefit our law enforcement agencies. That point
was made by everyone who has contributed to this debate: the Chair of
the Select Committee,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T21:54:06"></hs_TimeCode> right 
<?notus-xml column=878?>hon. Member for Leicester East (Keith Vaz); and
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T21:54:10"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friends
the Members for Stroud (Neil Carmichael), for Cambridge (Dr Huppert),
for Northampton North (Michael Ellis) and for Cheltenham (Martin
Horwood). That highlights the issues at hand in respect of
the benefits that accrue from our current
relationship.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T21:49:52"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

underline the fact that nothing that the Government have proposed
reduces our commitment to tackle cross-border crime. However, we cannot
risk the operational independence of our law enforcement agencies, and
we need to ensure appropriate safeguards within the text so that that
does not happen. I say very clearly to right hon. and hon. Members that
we will play an active role in negotiations to ensure that we achieve
our negotiating aims, which will allow us to opt in post-adoption.

the challenge from
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T21:55:07"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Leicester East, we consider that it is possible to achieve
key negotiating objectives, even when we have not opted into a proposal
before the negotiations. We have already done that on a number of
measures, and we are clear about the influence that can be applied, and
that is precisely what we will do.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T21:55:34"></hs_TimeCode>As I said, we
consulted a number of our operational colleagues across the UK when
considering the proposal. They all agree about the value of

including their gender, age and postcode, the websites they visited,
the time of day texts were sent, and, linked to that, their location
when the texts were sent. Customers were clearly not aware that their
data were being handed on and used in this way. Ipsos MORI then had a
meeting with the Metropolitan police to discuss selling the data on for
a second time. These data go beyond anything the police can get without
an application under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000.
The scale of this is demonstrated by the fact that in 2011 only 2,911
such orders were given. Furthermore, a proposal to allow the police to
hold such data was dropped by the Home Secretary last

she wrote to me about this issue on 13 May this year, so she should not

put her finger on an important matter—namely, the responsibility
within Whitehall for some of these issues. She will know that, as
Communications Minister, I am responsible for the mobile phone
companies in the round, but that the Information Commissioner’s
Office remains under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice. It is
therefore right that the Ministry of Justice should address such
matters as the data protection regulations. A similar issue
arises with nuisance calls. I am driving forward reform in that area,
although the Information Commissioner deals with that matter, which

was talking about consent and, in my humble opinion, meeting the hon.
Lady halfway on some of her concerns, which I think were perfectly
legitimate to raise in the House. Personal data required by legislation
to be provided and made available to the general public—for
example, directors’ information or births, marriages and
deaths—can also be sold, but as I said, I would be concerned if
any of the mobile operators were to release personal data for sale in
contravention of the law. As she made clear, however, that was not her
point.</hs_Para>

turn now to the thrust of the hon. Lady’s comments. We have
moved on from the report in <I>The Sunday Times</I> to the general
issue of how personal data are handled, particularly in an online and
digital age. I begin with two points. First, we take this issue very
seriously. Quite recently, we strengthened the powers of the
Information Commissioner’s Office. All Members will recall the
issue with Google street cars, which were sent hither and thither to
take pictures of everybody’s houses so as to provide a public
service. When data protection was deemed to have been breached, it was
discovered that the ICO did not have the powers to fine Google.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T22:42:46"></hs_TimeCode>As she made
clear, the ICO is currently considering a privacy case involving
Google, and over the heads of Google and of other companies that break
privacy laws hangs the possibility of a significant fine from the ICO,
thanks to European legislation introduced by the Government. Those
fines are already being used to full effect to combat the plague of
nuisance
calls<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T22:43:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307161000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130715/debtext/130715-0004.htm#1307161000064">The
second privacy issue that required an important balancing act was the
transposition of the e-privacy directive, in which I was closely
involved. This relates directly to the issue of cookies, to which the
hon. Lady referred earlier. A cookie can be many things, but in the
online world, it is a small packet of data that allows one’s
movements to be tracked across the web. They can provide a useful
service to the user of online services by providing, for example,
advertisements tailored to the 
<?notus-xml column=892?>interests of the individual internet user based on their browsing
history, but, based on an important principle, the e-privacy directive
introduces the opportunity for an individual to consent to the use of
cookies. That is why anyone who uses the internet will see on most
websites a pop-up display, banner or some other notice making it clear
that the website uses cookies and asking the user to give their
consent. By and large—I do not have any specific evidence to
support this assertion—most people consent to the use of
cookies, because there are some benefits. However, let us not
underestimate the concerns that people have about this kind of
tracking. As the hon. Lady pointed out, people want to feel that they
have given their consent for tracking behaviour. Those of us who have
covered this brief in Government for a while will remember the storm
that occurred when BT tried to introduce tracking users through
software created by Phorm. That caused an enormous row and BT had to
withdraw it, because the people who used its website did not feel that
their consent had been given properly. That is the kind of issue
covered by the e-privacy directive.</hs_Para>

hon. Lady raised the matter of the proposals currently under discussion
in the Commission. I am loth to correct the hon. Lady on any issue, but
the proposals are not being put forward by Commissioner Kroes, who is
the Commissioner for digital services, but by Commissioner Viviane
Reding, who is the Commissioner with responsibility for consumer
affairs. The proposals will update the data protection regulations and,
as she pointed out, the Ministry of Justice is the lead Department. My
right hon. Friend the Lord Chancellor has been to Brussels and he has
used the straightforward and plain language that has stood him in such
good stead in his career over many years to make clear the concerns of
the British Government.</hs_Para>

me again be clear: we do not oppose the data protection regulations. We
support updating the regulations, but we have legitimate concerns about
some of the detail. The most notorious regulation, which has grabbed
the headlines, is of course the one that goes by that vernacular phrase
“the right to be forgotten”. Our concern is
straightforward: saying to any ordinary person that we are going to
give them the right to be forgotten on the internet will raise a huge
amount of expectation. We therefore want absolute clarity on what can
be achieved by talking directly to the website—for example,
Facebook—whose data we want to erase, and by asking how far that
can go and how many other people one has to speak to. The clear concern
of the British Government relates to scope.</hs_Para>

over seven years. From before the first diplomatic conference in July,
2012 through to the final diplomatic conference earlier this year, the
arms trade treaty has been a top priority for this Government with
Ministers lobbying hard for a robust agreement that could achieve the
broadest possible support. With the Minister of State for International
Development, I attended the diplomatic conference in July 2012 and I
attended the diplomatic conference in March this year to support the
efforts of our diplomats and to urge the international community to
agree on this important issue. The negotiations were hard fought and

always been to secure a robust treaty that can be implemented by all.
We will only accomplish our aims if the arms trade treaty is rapidly
and effectively implemented. Fifty ratifications are required to bring
the treaty into force. We will be working hard to encourage states to
sign and to ratify, to ensure swift entry into force. Like the
negotiations on the treaty itself, this will take time and require the
considerable efforts and persistence of a broad coalition of
supporters. Universal adherence to the arms trade treaty must be our
ultimate goal.</hs_Para>

commitment to modernising the post office network and safeguarding its
future, and allocated a £1.34 billion funding package to provide

no prospect of eliminating the losses at a local level under the

service will be retained within the area. Furthermore, before any
changes are made to the existing service provision in Stockton-on-Tees,
there will be a six-week local public consultation under the terms
of  a Code of Practice agreed between the Post Office Ltd and

support safety and community links that encourage more cycling. This is
over and above the £600m Local Sustainable Transport Fund where

introduced measures to make cycling safer, including flexibility for
Local Authorities to introduce 20mph speed limits in residential areas

England is the independent organisation that distributes

Council is an arm's length body of my Department and sets it strategy
for promoting engagement with the arts independently of Government.
However, I am pleased that the Arts Council has put in place internal
mechanisms for determining its budget allocations across the regions,
prioritising those areas with limited opportunity for engagement,
irrespective of their classification as urban or rural; and that its
Grants for the Arts programme has been reviewed to ensure that
decisions take account of the need for provision in rural
areas.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071545000169" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130715/text/130715w0002.htm#13071545000169">A
number of Arts Council programmes make a significant contribution to
maintaining and increasing access to the arts in rural communities: for
example, the £37 million Creative People and Places programme
targeting areas of low engagement, including rural areas; the
£45 million Strategic Touring programme encouraging
collaboration between theatre organisations to target places which rely
on touring for much of their arts provision; and the Arts Council will

call-off this framework. The framework was procured after an extensive
period of market engagement and consultation, and at the end of the
competitive procurement process the suppliers BT and Fujitsu were
appointed to the framework in June 2012. Local bodies could choose to
run a procurement independent of the framework and some local bodies
have chosen to run an independent procurement process. Most local
bodies have taken advantage of the reduced time and cost benefits from
using the framework. Any supplier who is successful in winning
public-funded contracts for broadband deployment will be subject to
state aid rules, which require that they provide effective wholesale
access to their network to promote competition from other providers of
superfast broadband.</hs_Para>

designed the call-off contracts to transfer the majority of risks
associated with delivery and operation of broadband networks to the
private sector. Local bodies' use of the gap fund model has reduced
cost to the public sector. BDUK performs various assurance activities

Vaizey:</Member></B> The Government commissioned an independent review
of e-lending in public libraries in England last year and the panel,
led by William Sieghart, recommended that Public Lending Right (PLR) be
extended to cover loans of audiobooks and e-books borrowed from library
premises and also remotely. On 26 June 2013, HM Treasury announced that
in response to William Sieghart's recommendation that PLR be extended
by commencing the provisions of the Digital Economy Act 2010; the
Government will consult on plans to extend the PLR scheme to cover
onsite loans of e-books and audiobooks, with loans data to be collected
from July

need using information about projected pupil numbers and school
capacity provided by local authorities. We consider an area to have a
basic need for school places where there is a projected surplus of
places at the relevant phase of less than 5%. This is the same system
for calculating basic need used by the last Government. We consider
this to be the minimum surplus necessary in the school system to ensure
pupils are not required to travel unreasonable distances in order to
take the last remaining available place, allow parental choice to be
exercised, and provide flexibility to allow for in-year population
movement.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071545000234" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130715/text/130715w0002.htm#13071545000234">This
Government is tackling the shortage of places we inherited through
basic need funding allocated to local authorities. The recent report by
the National Audit Office into school places found that the last
Government cut the number of primary places by 200,000 during a period
of population growth. Over the current spending review we are spending
£5 billion on addressing the shortage of places through basic
need funding—more than double the amount spent by the previous
Government over an equivalent four year period. By September, we expect
190,000 extra places will have been created, with many more to come. On
top of this, the recent spending review announced additional funding
for 500,000 extra places by
2020-21.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071545000235" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130715/text/130715w0002.htm#13071545000235">In

clearly document poverty, displacement and constrained growth. For
example, the UN recently reported that food insecurity levels among
households in the west bank rose from 17% in 2011 to 19% in 2012 and

power stations (owned or operated by major power producers (MPPs)) in
Great Britain from 1999 to 2011. While DECC publishes figures for all
generators for the UK as a whole, figures for Great Britain are only
available for MPPs, while data for 1989 to 1998 are not available. To
note that, under this measure, the capacity of some renewable
technologies (wind and small hydro) has been de-rated to account for

of work related indicators including work engagement which is related

The Work programme IT payment system update went live in April 2012.
All outcomes prior to this were recorded clerically and uploaded to the
system during April and May 2012. The outcome date for these is based
on the date the information was uploaded to the system. For job
outcomes recorded after this, outcome dates are based on the date that
payments were made to providers following pre-payment validation
processes to confirm job outcomes. The manual pre-payment validation
checks may take time to conduct resulting in a delay between the job
outcome being claimed and the date the payment is made to providers,
and hence recorded in the statistics. Validation procedures continue to
improve to streamline the process as issues are identified. For further
details around issues and delays to job outcome payments please see the
information note available on the WP landing
