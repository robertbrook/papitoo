£39 million for TB research over the past five years. Spending
for the next five years is dependent on the results of the ongoing
product development partnerships competition. If my noble friend looks
online, she will find DfID’s research strategy priorities and
commissioning practices, which were published earlier this year as part

Kinnock of Holyhead:</Member></B> My Lords, while a malaria vaccine is
the biggest need at this time, it receives virtually no research
funding. Currently, 10 times more is spent on a cure for
male baldness than on a cure for malaria. Does the Minister agree that
the research conducted by pharmaceutical companies focuses, as Bill
Gates has said, on what is most lucrative and not on what is most
needed? Does she agree with him that it is unlikely that the global
poor will ever be profitable enough to attract the interest of the
pharmaceutical
industry<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T15:10:11"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

Northover:</Member></B> The noble Baroness gets to the nub of the
problem. This is why special effort must go into supporting research in
these areas because it is, of course, the poorest who suffer from these
diseases and cannot pay the prices for the drugs. I think about 1% 
<?notus-xml column=1308?>of any investment went into this area of neglected tropical diseases,
which is of course why Gates took it up. At the moment, he funds 49% of
the research being taken forward. That is a template for what we are
doing and why we are supporting it.</hs_para>

Chidgey:</Member></B> My Lords, with DfID’s support, health
organisations have been successful in developing a wide range of new
health technologies to address the diseases that we are clearly aware
of in developing countries, including TB and malaria. Can my noble
friend tell us how successful the outcomes have been, and how confident
she is in the results, given that countries such as the DRC and Nigeria
together account for some 40% of the deaths from malaria, yet they have
the most inadequate data of any

Northover:</Member></B> DfID’s research investments have helped
to develop a range of treatments plus tests across these areas. For
example, there is a diagnostic test for TB which is now available in 29
countries and a child-friendly, life-saving anti-malarial is now
available in 39 countries—just to give my noble friend an
indication of positive outcomes. We are also working very hard at
country level to improve the quality of data to strengthen
accountability because he is quite right: if we are to measure this
properly, it is very important to have such data coming

Hunt of Kings Heath:</Member></B> My Lords, I refer noble Lords to my
health interests in the register. Does the noble Baroness think that
the introduction of value-based pricing for pharmaceuticals in this
country will lead to 
<?notus-xml column=1309?>more research in those areas where at the moment there clearly is not
a return for the pharmaceutical companies? They are

about value-based pricing in the United Kingdom. We have to take a few
steps back in terms of the support that needs to be given for the
development of these treatments overseas. This is on a totally
different scale. There is, in effect, no market, as the noble
Lord’s colleague said, and we need to ensure that there is
support for research and development before even the prospect of a
market is taken
forward.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072444000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072444000015"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T15:14:44"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Hughes of Woodside" PimsId="1055" UID="13072444000951" xid="1276" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072444000951">Lord

leaving care, local authorities are obliged to keep acting for them
until they are 21 if they are homeless. So they are already being
looked after. We recognise that a number of children under 21 leave
care. The 15 to 18 year-olds, in particular, are well cared for but we

On the first, about rough sleeping, as noble Lords know and as I have
made clear in this House, the Government are intent on stopping rough
sleeping. There is the No Second Night Out initiative, in London, The
Passage and other initiatives by organisations such as St
Mungo’s and St Basils. There is support for rough sleepers and

matter raised by the noble Lord, this is a new initiative that has just

students, people in the Armed Forces who are here for a short time, and
people who do not have

out a room. It would be subject always, of course, to their tenure,
lease or arrangements with the local authority, but it is perfectly
possible for them to do that. The situation with regard to having a
spare room is such that we have to recognise that the welfare bill is
enormous, it is £210 billion, and contributions need to be made
to
that.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-24?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_24_PT_1/92B96E66C34115FFC23553C371201190B5154BEB" __version__="1.12"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 24 July 2013">Wednesday,

De Mauley:</Member></B> My Lords, we are faced with the problem of
London’s sewers being at or close to capacity and millions of
tonnes of sewage overflowing each year. The solution costs a great deal
of money—more than £4 billion—so we need a
sophisticated way to finance it. Thames Water pays its tax, and the
entity which builds the tunnel will pay its tax, but water and sewerage
companies have to make huge investments in infrastructure, the tunnel
being a classic example. Therefore, while all companies are eligible
for capital allowances, water companies perhaps appear to benefit more
from them than others. We expect Thames Water’s
customers’ bills to rise by about £70 to £80 a
year to pay for the tunnel, which would still leave them paying below
the national average. Removing capital allowances would of course mean
that those bills would increase

point. Of course, the primary purpose of the tunnel is to reduce the
impact of sewage pollution on the river, thus, I think, indirectly
contributing to recreation by giving us a cleaner river. However, my
noble friend’s question leads me to the broader point, which is
that the tunnel on its own is not enough. We also need sustainable
drainage systems. I was visiting some very innovative solutions today
in Herne Hill. Those solutions are not able to deal with the whole

De Mauley:</Member></B> My Lords, I thought I had addressed that
question when I answered the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley. Thames Water
does not avoid paying tax. HMRC’s capital allowance regime
allows companies to delay—not to avoid—paying corporation
tax, based on how much they invest. Capital allowances are simply the
allowed amortisation of an asset for tax purposes and they exist to
encourage companies to carry out crucial investment. The mechanism
enables tax to be paid over the lifetime of the asset. If capital
allowances did not exist, that would mean either less investment or
higher bills for customers.</hs_para>

Taverne:</Member></B> My Lords, alcohol has been shown to be much the
most harmful of all the addictive drugs if one takes into account its
social as well as its physical impact. As the latest figures show, the
physical impact is becoming more serious and it seems likely that liver
disease will soon overtake heart disease as the biggest killer. In
2008, the Government’s own research department showed that
increasing the price of alcohol led to a steep decline in alcohol
consumption and was a most effective way of dealing with it, and lots
of other research confirms that. Why, then, have the Government changed
their mind? They announced their intention to increase alcohol pricing
and it was widely welcomed. Why do they ignore the evidence on this
urgent issue when there is scientific evidence showing that action
would save lives, reduce hospital admissions and reduce
crime?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072444000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072444000053"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Taylor of Holbeach" PimsId="5065" UID="13072444000991" xid="1920" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072444000991">Lord
Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> My Lords, the Government are not
ignoring the evidence; in fact a study published recently by Sheffield
University is very interesting in this subject area. That is why the
Government have introduced the whole business of duty plus
VAT—so that, for example, low-alcohol beer cannot be sold below
40p a can and strong lager below £1.15. This has been a
long-standing problem which Governments of all types have not been
prepared to deal with. This Government have a strategy now to deal with
it and I hope that it has the support of the
House.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072444000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072444000054"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Hollins" PimsId="5860" UID="13072444000992" xid="2089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072444000992">Baroness

Science at the British Medical Association. I understand that research
commissioned by the Department of Health shows that this policy on its
own will not have any impact. How much of an increase in price does
this new policy represent? I estimate that the policy will mean a
minimum shop price of 21p per unit for beer and 28p for
spirits—considerably less than the 45p minimum unit price

Williams of Crosby:</Member></B> The evidence is quite clear that
minimum unit pricing has two dramatic effects. First, it cuts the level
of alcohol-related deaths and sharply reduces admissions to hospital,
as my noble friend has said. Equally importantly, it drives drinkers
steadily towards lower-strength alcohol from high-strength
alcohol—which has nothing to do with the Minister’s
proposal about VAT and all the rest of it. Given the latest evidence
from Saskatchewan and from Sheffield University with regard to the
United Kingdom, will the Prime Minister and the Cabinet readdress this
issue, at a time when many thousands of English and Scottish people

this Dispatch Box about this so that I might understand why the
Government have moved from absolute certainty that they would 
introduce minimum alcohol pricing to equivocation and a consultation,
and now seem to be moving to total rejection. Following David
Cameron’s evasive answers at the weekend, the lobbyist and Prime
Minister’s adviser, Lynton Crosby, has stated that he has never
spoken to the Prime Minister about plain packaging for cigarettes. Can
the Minister give us the same assurance about minimum alcohol pricing?

Wills:</Member></B> My Lords, this amendment is designed to bring
greater transparency to the relationships between local authorities and
the private contractors to whom increasingly large amounts of public
services are being contracted out. Billions of pounds are at stake in
these contracts and the recent revelations about the electronic tagging
work carried out by private sector firms for the Ministry of Justice
are just the latest example for the case for greater transparency in
these
arrangements<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T15:40:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072444000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072444000063">I
moved a similar amendment at both Committee and Report Stages, when I
set out the merits of greater transparency in tackling fraud and
corruption, incompetence and inefficiency and in terms of
citizens’ rights to know about the services provided to them and
the taxpayers’ right to know about the services they pay for. I
do not need to detain your Lordships today by rehearsing those
arguments again at

Government appear to believe that there are already sufficient
provisions for transparency for this amendment not to be necessary, but
the fact that local authorities themselves are covered by the Freedom
of Information Act does not always provide the necessary transparency
for private sector bodies carrying out public sector work, as I argued
at Committee and Report Stages, nor does the right of electors to
inspect accounts and audit documents, important though that right is
and has been for the many years.</hs_para>

the heart of the Government’s resistance appears to be a belief
that transparency increases cost. I addressed this argument at length
on Report, by analysing the Government’s figures, which suggest
that such costs are likely to amount, if at all, to an increase in a
tiny percentage of the sums involved. The Government have not, so far,
questioned my calculations. I also  
<?notus-xml column=1319?>pointed out that transparency can save money often by revealing fraud
and corruption, incompetence and inefficiency. However, I recognise
that Ministers fret about things which sometimes they do not always
need to fret about and, in an attempt to set their minds at ease, I
have made two changes that I hope will go some way towards meeting the

amendment, there is a provision for a review after five years to see

parish councils, as in those cases this amendment might be
unnecessarily onerous. I hope that, even at this late stage, Ministers
might reconsider their position on greater transparency in this area

Tope:</Member></B> My Lords, Liberal Democrats campaigned hard for
freedom of information long before the Act was passed and have since
been consistent and enthusiastic supporters of its provisions. It
follows therefore that we start with considerable sympathy for the
issue that the noble Lord, Lord Wills, is pursuing. This is the first
time I have spoken on his amendments and I am grateful to him for
pursuing the issue at all stages of the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T15:44:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

are now seeing in local government a significant and substantial change
towards commissioning. It is not quite the same as outsourcing, as has
been referred to, but it is largely brought about by budget pressures
and is a change that is coming anyway. Now and in the years to come we
will see local authorities all over the country of all political
persuasions increasingly commissioning services not just from
commercial contractors, but from the third sector, joint ventures,
charities and so on. I am pleased that the noble Lord has therefore
included in subsection (4) of his proposed new clause a

that is at least in part the direction in which we are heading. For all

part company with the noble Lord a little on costs. He is quite right
to raise the issue and quite right that Governments of all persuasions,
local and national, tend to overstate this. I know that the Government
have argued that many of the respondents to the consultation said that
it would increase costs. I suspect that many of those respondents were
companies and others which did not want it to apply to them, so one
could say, “They would, wouldn’t they?”. The noble
Lord, Lord Wills, has said comprehensively at each stage of the Bill
why it should not increase costs.</hs_para>

Association, of which I am a brand new vice-president—that was a
declaration of interest—has said that it
supports the amendment, provided there is no increase in audit fees. I
want to question that a little and I do so from the point of view of
having for quite a number of years, until very recently, had political
responsibility within my own local authority for freedom of information
requests, of which there are now a huge number. Many of them are
fishing and some seek genuine information. To say that there is no
increased cost is not right; it actually takes organisations dealing
with freedom of information requests considerable time, and time is
money. That will apply even where the information is comparatively
readily stored and available. That happens and it would happen in this
case, too.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072444000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072444000071">I
hope that the Government will agree not simply to accept the word of
respondents, who probably have a vested interest, or even to take the
well rehearsed word of the noble Lord, Lord Wills, for this but to look
themselves at what actual costs would be involved in extending the Bill
in this way—it is, in effect, an extension. Then I would say, as
I think the noble Lord, Lord Wills, did, that it is not simply a matter
of the costs; there are the benefits as well. That is why we have a
cost-benefit analysis. Always, there are benefits but it is usually
harder to quantify them. That is sometimes because the benefits are
retrospective and we do not know what they are until they have
occurred. That has to be the other side of the equation, so there is
rather more work to be done on this issue.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13072444000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072444000072">Although of course this
has to be raised in the context of auditing and auditors, because that
is the subject of this Bill, the issue is very much wider. I said
earlier that the future for local government—and perhaps of
other public services—is with commissioning services from other
organisations, be they commercial companies or the third sector with
its charities and so on. Here, we have a very much bigger issue of the
extent to which, and how and whether, the freedom of information
provisions apply there. That is a wider issue and I would be happier if
the Government were able to reply again today by saying that they
recognise that this is a live and growing issue, and one that the
Government are going to address. Perhaps the Minister replying—I
do not know whether it is he or she, but I think it is he—will
give an undertaking that the issue will be actively reviewed and that
conclusions can be reached as to how or whether it should apply to the
more narrow confines of the Bill before it ends its parliamentary life.
The Bill is likely to leave this House after today but that certainly
does not end its life, as it will continue in another place throughout
the autumn. If the Government can say that they will continue
to look actively at that issue, both generally and in the
context of the Bill, I would be content to support
them.</hs_para>

Campbell-Savours:</Member></B> My Lords, I will briefly intervene to
follow up some of the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Tope. From 1986
onwards, I argued in the Commons for revision of the law governing the
provision of information to the public. It was during  a very
interesting period following the arguments in the mid-1980s over Tony
Wright and the reform of the Official Secrets Act.</hs_para>

argued for freedom of information was that we believed that it would
change the conduct within local authorities. My noble friend’s
amendment would extend those rights of access to a group of
organisations that effectively are carrying out the functions of local
authorities. In saying, “change the conduct”, I refer
back to the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Tope, on the additional
cost. However, no-one has been able to quantify the benefits
financially to local authorities of being more transparent in their
operations. I frequently used freedom of information requests to press
local authorities and other public bodies on the way that they conduct
themselves. After a series of freedom of information requests, one
sometimes notices a change in the way that a local authority conducts
its affairs. Very often, it means greater efficiency, the saving of
public money and a happier general public paying their council
taxes.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13072444000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072444000075">When
the Minister winds up, I do not think that he should see the issue
simply in terms of costs; he should think about the actual benefit to
the taxpayer of a system that is far more transparent in its
operations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T15:51:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Earl of Lytton:</Member></B> My Lords, I had intended to add my name to

Lord Tope, I declare my interests as a newly polished and appointed
vice-president of the Local Government Association and a possibly
somewhat more tarnished president of the National Association of Local
Councils. The issue is one of not adding unnecessarily to costs, as the
noble Lord pointed out. Part of me says that whenever locally—or
at whatever level—a greater throughput of taxpayers or public
money is being used, it is right that the level of scrutiny is
proportionate. The reference to “significant private
companies” is perhaps slightly less than I would have likes. I
would have liked the figure itself to have been objectively significant
rather than the company providing the service being significant. I am
not sure that I know what a significant company is in this context,
whereas I am clear as to what a significant figure might be.</hs_para>

that auditors should have a degree of discretion in looking at this. As
I said at an earlier stage in the Bill, we may be looking at quite
small organisations that, for whatever reason—perhaps because of
some project they are undertaking—may be responsible for
deploying fairly significant sums. It is right that those should be
subject to scrutiny. There is no place here for opacity in the way in
which figures are presented. Therefore I very much support the
principle of this amendment.</hs_para>

may, onto the freedom of information issue. I am aware that one of the
get-outs in relation to providing freedom of information data is when
the request is considered to be vexatious. The standard of
“vexatious” as a term of art seems to be a matter of
self-assessment to a degree by the body that is providing that
information; at least, that is how it seems to me. The noble Baroness
opposite is shaking her head slightly; if I have got it wrong, I
apologise. However, it 
<?notus-xml column=1322?>seems to me that that is capable of a degree of latitude. I certainly
have seen evidence of “vexatious” used as a reason for
not providing information—although not in the context of local
government—and the term ought to be made a little clearer. In
general terms, I support what the noble Lord, Lord Wills, has put
forward and am grateful to him for continuing to bring it to the
attention of the

Palmer of Childs </B><B>Hill</B><B>:</B></Member> My Lords, first, I
declare an interest as the current chairman of a local authority audit
committee. I shall chair a meeting later this evening. I shall add a
touch of reality to the comments made by other noble Lords.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13072444000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072444000081">The first subsection of
the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Wills, states that the
local auditor is to have right of access to the books and records of
contractors. In the real world, any local authority worth its salt has
in all its contracts a clause allowing it access to the documents of
its auditors or the processes that those local auditors use. If a local
authority does not have that, shame on it. What we are perhaps trying
to do here is to put into legislation something that is a normal
commercial attitude that local authorities or corporate bodies should
do anyway. As my noble friend Lord Tope said, commissioning is coming
on in so many local authorities, and the measure and size of some of
the contracts will be very significant. With these large commissioning
items, it is not the legislation that should be relied on but the
normal contractual terms between the local authority and the
contractor. The Government and the noble Lord, Lord Wills, are right to
highlight that local authorities should deal with this with their
contractors. As my noble friend Lord Tope said, when the Government
review these matters, even after this Bill is passed, they should
perhaps seek to encourage that within local
authorities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072444000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072444000082">Subsection
(3) of the amendment

worries me somewhat because, if something is too rigid and too
demanding, the net result in practical terms is that people do not put
it down on paper in order not to be subject to freedom of information.
That might discourage the local auditor from carrying out its job in a
deep way. I am all for transparency, but it should be transparency as
the auditor feels is right rather than being enshrined in law. Although
I understand where the noble Lord, Lord Wills, is coming from, and I
appreciate the amendment, I hope that it will encourage the Government
to review matters before the Bill becomes
law.</hs_parafo>

Beecham:</Member></B> My Lords, I join others in declaring membership
of the LGA vice-presidential mafia. I am also a member of Newcastle
City Council’s audit committee. I strongly support my noble
friend’s amendment, as did the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, a
former leader of Newcastle City Council who, alas, is not in his
place.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13072444000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072444000084">I
congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Tope, on the ingenuity with which he
has contrived some wriggle room to justify supporting the Government
this afternoon as opposed to doing what the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, 
<?notus-xml column=1323?>would perhaps have done had he been here and opposing them, but I do
not think his arguments carry very much weight. He
is particularly concerned about the cost of these matters, but the
audit is carried out on these services whether they are provided as of
now by the local authority or by an external body. There ought to be a
level playing field in that respect in any event so that there will be
a cost of proper auditing by the district auditor and it should not add
to the burden that is currently experienced.</hs_para>

noble Lord adduces about the need to assess the situation is perfectly
fair, but of course it is provided for in the amendment. One could
argue that my noble friend has been excessively generous in saying that
the review should take place after five years. It may be that a shorter
period will be short enough to assess the functioning of the system
and, if there is still a question as to the costs, the costs. However,
the principle of my noble friend’s amendment is clearly
right<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T16:00:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13072444000182" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072444000182">4

Lord, Lord Palmer, raised at the Report stage the issue of the
contractual aspect and he raised it again today. I do not think that
gets away from the thrust of my noble friend’s amendment, which
is to endeavour to ensure that these matters are properly looked at by
the district auditor and that the district auditor’s findings
are disclosable subject to the proviso that he has included about
commercial confidentiality and freedom of information. We have to
remember the context in which this debate takes place. We have had the
glaring and shocking examples of Group 4 and Serco recently in the
public domain. Those were large national contracts. I wonder whether
the questions of the noble Lord, Lord Palmer, about access to the
documentation and the contracts might not be addressed to central
government if that is a real concern. Certainly, they do not seem to
have taken steps of the kind that the noble Lord indicated in relation
to the problems that have been faced by those organisations.</hs_para>

ones where considerable difficulty has been experienced, vast expense
incurred and failures or inadequacies of service detected across a
range of public services. Again one thinks of Serco’s contract
with National Health Service England about out-of-hours care in
Cornwall and a range of other matters of that kind. There had been
systemic failure and it was clearly necessary for the audit
service—in this case the district audit service—to have a
role and for transparency to be the order of the
day.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072444000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072444000088">I am not
sure whether the noble Lord or the noble Baroness will be the Minister
replying—it will be the noble Lord shouldering this burden
manfully as he replies to the debate. I hope that he can give some
assurances of the kind suggested by my noble friend. I cannot see that
the Government would emerge with anything but credit for accepting the
amendment in the interests of transparency, in the interests of proper
scrutiny of what happens, and ultimately of procuring value for money
and saving money for the public
purse<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T16:02:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, I start by thanking the
noble Lord, Lord Wills, for our useful discussions about Amendments 1
and 2, both after 
<?notus-xml column=1324?>Committee and again earlier this week. I also acknowledge his commitment
to this agenda and the enthusiasm with which he pursues it.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13072444000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072444000090">Amendment 1 seeks to
give auditors a right to access audit documents of significant
contractors to local authorities and to make these available on
request. Amendment 2 is concerned with extending freedom of information
rules. The debate we have just had has extended over both amendments
and, to some extent, I have to answer both amendments, even though the
noble Lord chose to separate the two last
night.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072444000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072444000091">I
acknowledge that there is a wider issue here, as the noble Lord, Lord
Beecham, has just said, about the appropriate levels of audit,
transparency and accountability for private providers of public
services—whether they be for-profit companies, not-for-profit
voluntary organisations or others. This issue has grown over the past
25 to 30 years as successive Governments of all parties have outsourced
public services, both from the national and from the local level. As
the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, pointed out, recent publicity over
inadequate performance has heightened public interest and interest in
this House, although I should note that almost all the recent cases
publicised have been about nationally negotiated contracts, not local
contracts. Noble Lords may have noticed that the Atos contract with DWP
on work disability assessment included provision for DWP audit. That
has now discovered certain weaknesses for which Atos has
apologised.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13072444000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072444000092">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T16:04:44"></hs_TimeCode>
encourage the noble Lord to pursue this issue further. I will repeat
what I said on Report: both Parliament and the Government need to look
at this issue in general. With my Cabinet Office hat on I would say
that the Cabinet Office is actively looking at the issues of
commissioning and contracts and how to make sure that we are raising
standards across Whitehall. The new Commissioning Academy, the
Government’s champion for the non-profit sector, is part of how
we are working at learning from mistakes that have been made, both
under this Government and under our predecessor, and raising the level
of approach. It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T16:05:20"></hs_TimeCode>
would be highly appropriate for Parliament to look at this in parallel
with the Government. As I suggested on Report, I encourage the noble
Lord, Lord Wills, to consider whether he should bid for a sessional
committee, for example, which would examine the changing relationship
between non-governmental providers of public services and local
authorities and national authorities to see whether we can find
consensus across the parties on how we approach this
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T16:06:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072444000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072444000093">On
the wider issue, nevertheless, I have to say that the case has to be
made. I suspect that the noble Lord, Lord Wills, was, in his commitment
to greater transparency and freedom of information, in a minority in
the previous Government. I recall that the Prime Minister Tony Blair
said that the Freedom of Information Act was the biggest mistake that
they had made. I share, as do all those in my party, a commitment to
transparency in government, and the coalition Government have done
their best to extend transparency. In many ways, however, there is
rather further to go, particularly when one comes to the relations
between the private sector and the public sector—the private
for-profit 
<?notus-xml column=1325?>sector, which pleads commercial sensitivity and additional costs from
the extension of the sort of transparency and audit which the noble
Lord is
approving<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T16:07:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072444000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072444000094">This
specific amendment is not necessary because the Bill already gives
these powers to local auditors. Clause 21 enables local auditors to
access whatever documents and information they think are necessary to
undertake their functions under the Bill. That includes documents held
by local authorities’ contractors if the auditors consider that
these are necessary in order to undertake their functions. That covers
all the functions in the Bill, not just the audit of the financial
statement but all the additional functions that are unique to local
public audit such as the consideration of questions and objections from
the local electorate and the issue of public interest
reports<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T16:07:42"></hs_TimeCode>.
Schedule 11 to the Bill also includes provisions which enable local
auditors to disclose information necessary to answer those questions
and objections. The Government’s code of recommended practice
for local authorities on data transparency recommends a minimum set of
data to be published locally. All local authorities now publish
expenditure over £500 and many publish their contracts. No audit
firms have yet indicated that the current access rights are inadequate
or lacking.</hs_para>

being the case, I argue—I hope the noble Lord recognises that I
do not argue the resistance to his amendment primarily on cost
grounds—that the case is not made on this amendment. We all
recognise that there is a wider issue about the overall transformation
over the past 25 years of the relationship between government as
provider of funds and the private, profit and non-profit sectors as the
provider of those services in return for funds. However, I agree
strongly with my noble friend Lord Palmer of Childs Hill, who said that
much of this is covered in the contractual relationship. We are all
learning about how to improve that contractual relationship. The
Government, particularly within the Cabinet Office, are working on how
to extend best practice across the Government nationally as well as
assisting local authorities. Having given all of those assurances, I
hope that the noble Lord feels able to withdraw his amendment on the
condition that we will continue to discuss and examine this very broad
issue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072444000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072444000096"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T16:09:30"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Wills" PimsId="5791" UID="13072444001012" xid="2061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072444001012">Lord
Wills:</Member></B> My Lords, this has been a short but useful debate.
I am grateful to all who have spoken in it and for the fact that
everyone—except the Minister—has broadly supported the
amendment. I congratulate the two new vice-presidents of the Local
Government Association on their contribution on this subject. I am also
grateful to the Minister and the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, and their
officials for their willingness to engage continually with me on this
subject. I have benefited from our discussions.</hs_para>

am grateful, too, that the Minister expressed his continuing
willingness for the Government to keep looking at this issue. That is a
step forward from the Committee stage and the Report stage. Although
the Government have not accepted the amendment, I am grateful for what
I take to be a slow, almost imperceptible, warming of their position on
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T16:10:42"></hs_TimeCode>. However,
looking at this issue is not the same as doing something about it. 
<?notus-xml column=1326?>It is not the same as taking advantage of what is likely to be quite a
rare legislative opportunity to bring greater transparency
to this important sphere of public life.</hs_para>

Minister mentioned two primary reasons for resisting the amendment. One
was commercial sensitivity. However, he will be well aware that the
Freedom of Information Act 2000 has an exemption for commercial
sensitivity—subject, of course, to a public interest test. So,
with all respect to him, I am not sure how far he would wish to pursue
that
argument<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T16:11:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072444000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072444000099">The
Minister then focused on the idea that the amendment is not necessary.
Both he and the noble Lord, Lord Palmer of Childs Hill, relied for
their position on the fact that good local authorities should have this
aspect covered anyway in their contractual relationships with private
sector companies providing outsourced work. The noble Lords are, of
course, right. Good local authorities should have this covered. If all
local authorities were good local authorities, my amendment would not
be necessary. But they are not. They make mistakes and they overlook
things, as we all do. In Committee I gave
examples<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T16:11:58"></hs_TimeCode>. I
notice that the noble Lord, Lord Palmer of Childs Hill, did not say
that all local authorities do this. He said, quite rightly, shame on
those that do not, but he conceded that there are those that do not. I
think that the Minister himself said that “much” of
this—not all of it—was covered under the contractual
arrangements. That is precisely what the amendment seeks to remedy. It
seeks to ensure that all local authorities bring greater transparency
to this crucial area of public life, where billions of pounds of
taxpayers’ money are at stake. We have seen already how
necessary this
is<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T16:12:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072444000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072444000100">In
the light of that, I am afraid that I shall have to resist the
Minister’s invitation to withdraw the amendment. Because the
Government are warming to this idea, I hope that this House can send a
signal to the other place about the importance of transparency and
perhaps encourage the Government, when the Bill gets there, to move
further on this issue. I therefore beg to test the opinion of the
House.</hs_para><Division><hs_time UID="13072444000183" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072444000183">4.13

Wills:</Member></B> My Lords, I moved an identical amendment to this at
both Committee and Report stages of the Bill. I will not rehearse again
all the arguments I set out at both stages or the merits of greater
transparency, which we discussed in the debate on the previous
amendment, the advantages of tackling fraud, corruption, incompetence
and inefficiency, or the principled arguments in favour of citizens
having the right to know about the services provided for them to the
maximum extent possible and of taxpayers knowing as much as possible
about the services for which they pay. However, I stress again that
this amendment sets out not to promote an increase in transparency so
much as to tackle a decrease in transparency which is brought about by
the new arrangements under the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072444000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072444000103">As
I said on Report, the Audit Commission, which is being replaced by the
provisions of the Bill, was covered by the Freedom of Information Act.
My understanding is that in addition to information that it held for
its own purposes, which of course was covered by that Act, other
information held by auditors would also have been regarded as being
held by the commission in certain circumstances, and therefore would
also be covered by the Freedom of Information Act—for example,
when the Audit Commission was investigating a complaint against a
specified auditor, when it was conducting a quality control assessment
of an auditor’s work or when it had required an auditor to
provide information for the discharge of wider commission functions
such as making judgments 
<?notus-xml column=1330?>on local authorities’ use of resources. In such circumstances,
such information would have been deemed to be held by the Audit
Commission, and therefore would be subject to the Freedom of
Information Act. These are important categories of information that
cover significant areas of public interest and concern. Yet, as far as
I can see, no public authority as defined in the Freedom of Information
Act has inherited those responsibilities from the Audit Commission
under this Bill. Therefore, under this new regime, such information
will no longer be covered by the Freedom of Information Act. I think
that it should

transparency damages the public interest and the amendment seeks to
prevent that happening. At previous stages, this amendment received
support from all sides of the House and has the support of the Local
Government Association. Only the Government have stood out against it.
In the light of our previous discussions on this issue and the previous
debate today, I hope that they will now change their minds. I beg to

Beecham:</Member></B> My Lords, my noble friend is absolutely right to
point out that this is simply a question of preserving, or perhaps
reviving, the level terms on which freedom of information has hitherto
applied. It is different from the previous case that we debated. No
question of cost is likely to be germane to the amendment. It is simply
there to ensure that the transparency currently available within a
local authority’s documentation is extended to those with which
it contracts, subject to the Freedom of Information Act provisions and
exemptions. There seems to be an unanswerable case for ensuring that
that degree of transparency will apply as it applies now, before the
Bill is enacted. I concur with my noble friend who urges on the
Government acceptance of this provision, which is different from the
previous amendment and to which I can see no possible objection, even
from Liberal Democrat Members of your Lordships’ House or,
indeed,
elsewhere<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T16:29:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, the Government are keen to
promote transparency. As I have previously suggested, they are
sometimes keener than their predecessors were to promote transparency
and accountability around outsourced services. However, we agree with
the Justice Select Committee’s recommendations in its
post-legislative scrutiny of the Freedom of Information Act and
consider that the better approach is to preserve transparency through
contractual provisions, rather than the formal extension of the Freedom
of Information Act at this time. In 2012 the Justice Select Committee
considered in detail during its post-legislative scrutiny the challenge
of how to deal with contractors of public authorities. The committee
concluded
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13072444000170" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072444000170">“contracts

Government agreed with the Justice Committee’s recommendation
that contracts should include provisions specifying that contractors
should fully assist public 
<?notus-xml column=1331?>authorities in meeting their obligations under the Freedom of
Information Act. The Government will encourage public authorities to
include and enforce transparency clauses in contracts to ensure that
openness and accountability are maintained, and a revised code of
practice will be issued later this year. I stress that this is
something with which the Government are currently engaged and that the
Cabinet Office is helping to standardise across government. This will
also encourage the inclusion of clauses in contracts that go beyond
current Freedom of Information Act obligations and require the release
of a wider range of information about contract
delivery<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T16:30:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

believe that this, coupled with the wealth of information about
contracts already available from public authorities, both proactively
and in response to FOI requests, strikes an appropriate balance between
transparency and reducing burdens on business. The Government and the
Information Commissioner will monitor the success of this approach
during 2014. It is only right that we should give the approach we have
already outlined time to bed in over the next 12 months
before deciding whether further action might be justified. We strongly
urge public authorities and contractors to strive for the maximum
possible transparency under these arrangements. Should an appropriate
level of transparency not be achieved, public authorities and
contractors alike should be under no illusions that we will consider
what other steps we should take, including the potential extension of
the Freedom of Information
Act.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072444000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072444000109">There

Lord’s contention that it is a decrease in transparency. As I
remarked on the Atos cases, on which there has been some publicity, the
way in which contracts are now being formulated provides for a
considerable expansion in transparency in how they are negotiated, and
with access to the public authority as contractor. We simply do not

sides on this. However, it is not about authoritarianism but about
whether we trust a bunch of politicians or the citizen with the right
to transparency. The whole point of freedom of information is that it
gives the citizen the right. The Minister wants to give private sectors
and politicians the chance to stitch it up between them without giving
the citizen the right to scrutinise it. That is the difference between
the two parties. It has nothing to do with

the Minister has still not addressed the point that this is a decrease

decide, when it reviews the arrangements that the Bill will bring in,
whether transparency needs to be increased. By its definition it will

Minister focused his remarks on the relationship with the private
sector but the amendment covers not only that relationship but local
district auditors. That is the key point. The citizen and the taxpayer
need transparency in the operation of the people who scrutinise the
delivery of public services. I remind the Minister  
<?notus-xml column=1333?>that the Grant Thornton report on Mid Staffs showed how important it is
that there should be transparency in the work of those who monitor and
scrutinise the delivery of public services. The Government say that
they have learnt the lesson from Mid Staffs but the Minister, whatever
he says, has just proved that they still have not learnt the lessons
about the merits of
transparency.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072444000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072444000120">However,
I notice the Minister’s careful words. He said that “at
this time”, “at this stage”, he is reserving his
options. It may be that between now and the Bill going to the other
place the Government will change their minds and it will not be
“at this time” any more but “at another
time”. With that and the disappointingly unsatisfactory response
from the Minister in mind, and in the hope that your Lordships’
House will send a signal to the other place, I ask leave to test the
opinion of the
House.</hs_para><Division><hs_time UID="13072444000186" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072444000186">4.37

Public Audit (Wales) Act 2004 transferred a number of powers from the
National Audit Office and the Audit Commission to the Auditor-General
for Wales. This Bill already repeals some sections within the Public
Audit (Wales) Act 2004 which refer to the Audit Commission. Sections 69
and 70 provide transitional arrangements to enable auditors of Welsh
local government and NHS bodies who were appointed by the Audit
Commission to continue for the whole of their term, despite the Public
Audit (Wales) Act 2004 transferring responsibility for auditor
appointment from the Audit Commission to the Auditor-General for
Wales.</hs_para>

It is my pleasure to thank the Members of the Committee who have helped
us through the Bill over the past few months. I am extremely grateful
to everybody who has taken part and, as always with Bills leaving this
House, I think it has been strengthened as a result. It might be worth
reflecting that in response to issues raised during the debate, the
Government have made 15 individual amendments, not including minor,
technical amendments, and we have also made clear our intention to
amend the Bill in the other place to enable the non-mandatory central 
<?notus-xml column=1337?>procurement of auditors on behalf of relevant authorities. We are also
considering other points in relation to the data-matching powers, so
there have been significant interventions and significant help and I
thank all noble Lords, on the opposite side and in the coalition, for
all they have done to see us through the past few
months.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="13072444001062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072444001062">Bill

terrible events of those years. Britain saw the first bank run in over
a century. Depositors in Northern Rock queued in the streets to take
their money out. The biggest bank in the world, the Royal Bank of
Scotland, teetered on the brink. RBS and HBOS had to be bailed out and
the Government had to inject £65 billion of taxpayers’
money to save the banking system from
collapse.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072444000128" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072444000128">Huge
though this direct cost to the taxpayer was, the full costs of the
crisis were still greater. Gross domestic product fell, peak to trough,
by 7.2% as the supply of credit dried up and tight credit continues to
be a problem for many businesses and families. This is why the
Government have had to intervene to support credit supply through
measures such as Funding for Lending, Help to Buy and the Business
Finance Partnership. These will help to address the consequences of the
crisis. To tackle its causes and to prevent a repeat, the Government
are taking forward a programme of reform built on three
pillars.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072444000129" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072444000129">The
first pillar is reform of financial regulation. This was achieved
through the Financial Services Act 2012, which received
Royal Assent last December and came into force this spring. The second
pillar is structural reform of the banking industry. That is the focus
of the measures in the Bill before us today. The third pillar is reform
of banking standards and culture. The Parliamentary Commission on
Banking Standards—the PCBS; I am afraid there will be quite a
few abbreviations today—last month made important
recommendations in this area. The Government have accepted the
PCBS’s principal recommendations and where those require primary
legislation they will be incorporated into this Bill through government
amendments at Committee
stage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072444000130" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072444000130">Let me
first turn to the measures already in the Bill. The bulk of these
implement key recommendations of the Independent Commission on Banking,
or ICB, chaired by Sir John Vickers. As noble Lords will know, the
Vickers commission was established in 2010 to consider both structural
and non-structural reforms  
<?notus-xml column=1338?>to the banking sector. It reported in September 2011 and recommended,
first, the ring-fencing of retail from investment banking. The ICB also
proposed measures to improve banks’ ability to absorb losses and
to ensure that losses can be made to fall on banks’ creditors
and not the taxpayer if a bank fails. These measures included higher
capital requirements for ring-fenced banks, a bail-in power and
preference in insolvency for bank depositors over other creditors. The
Government accepted virtually all the ICB’s
recommendations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072444000131" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072444000131">This
Bill will implement the ring-fence as recommended by the ICB. It
defines core activities—that is, taking deposits—which
must be inside the ring-fence, and it defines excluded
activities—that is, trading in investments as
principal—which must be outside the ring-fence. As the ICB
recommended, activities that are neither core nor excluded may be
either in or out. The Bill makes safeguarding the continuity of
services connected to deposit-taking a part of the Prudential
Regulation Authority’s general objective. It requires the PRA to
make rules to ensure the independence of ring-fenced banks from their
wider corporate groups. In response to the recommendations of the PCBS,
we have amended the Bill in the Commons to electrify the ring-fence. I
will come on to the details of that
shortly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072444000132" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072444000132">The
Bill also makes deposits protected by the Financial Services
Compensation Scheme preferential debts in the event of insolvency. This
will increase the FSCS’s expected recovery in the event that a
bank fails and the FSCS has to pay out, reducing the risk of contagion
and protecting the taxpayer. The ICB also recommended that if a bank
fails the authorities should have the power to bail-in creditors,
imposing losses on them rather than letting those losses fall on the
taxpayer. The forthcoming EU bank recovery and resolution directive
should deliver a bail-in tool at European level and a requirement for
national authorities to ensure that their banks have in issue a minimum
amount of credibly bail-inable liabilities, necessary to ensure bail-in
is effective and credible. This Bill gives the Treasury power to set
the framework within which the PRA imposes requirements on banks to
have in issue minimum amounts of bail-inable
debt.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072444000133" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072444000133">In
addition to the ICB’s recommendations, the Bill also reforms the
governance of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme manager to
ensure proper oversight and accountability for its use of public funds.
It extends to subsidiaries of the Bank of England exemptions from
Companies Act accounting requirements given to the Bank itself where
the Bank considers that necessary for reasons of financial stability.
It also allows for the costs of the Treasury’s participation in
international organisations dealing with financial stability to be
recovered from the

reaching this House, the Bill already received very substantial
scrutiny. The Government published the Bill in draft last October for
pre-legislative scrutiny by the PCBS, which of course included several
Members of this House. In light of the PCBS’s report on the
draft Bill, the Government made a number of changes both before the
Bill was introduced to Parliament and while it was before the House of
Commons. In the Commons, the Bill was scrutinised line by line over
the  
<?notus-xml column=1339?>course of eight Committee sittings and had two days of debate on Report.

this process the Government have consistently adopted a constructive
approach. We have welcomed suggestions from all quarters on how the
Bill might be improved. Where we found those suggestions valuable, we
have amended the Bill accordingly. For example, in pre-legislative
scrutiny the PCBS argued that the regulator’s objective for
ring-fencing could be made clearer. We accepted this suggestion and
amended the Bill before its introduction and again on Report in the
Commons. The PCBS also called for specific requirements for ring-fenced
bank independence to be put in the Bill. We agreed and amended the Bill
in a way that the PCBS acknowledged arguably went even further than it
had suggested. The PCBS proposed that the PRA be required to report on
ring-fenced banks’ sale of derivatives to clients. We will amend
the Bill to this effect while it is before this
House.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072444000136" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072444000136">On the

most significantly, as I alluded to earlier, in response to the
recommendation of the PCBS, the Government amended the Bill in the
Commons to provide for a power for the full separation of an individual
banking group. This is what the PCBS termed
“electrifying” the ring-fence. The power we have added to
the Bill will substantially reinforce the ring-fence. It will allow the
regulator to require a banking group to separate completely its retail
from its wholesale banking operations. This power can be exercised if
the regulator believes that a ring-fenced bank is insufficiently
independent of the rest of its group, or that the group’s
conduct might in some other way threaten the regulator’s ability
to safeguard the continuity of core retail banking services. As the
PCBS recommended, given the momentous consequences for a banking group
of a requirement to separate, the regulator can only use this power
with the consent of the
Treasury.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072444000138" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072444000138">As
noble Lords will know, when this power was debated in the Commons,
questions were raised about the process for exercising it set out in
the Government’s amendment. Some argued that the procedure was
too complicated or lengthy. The Government have listened to these
arguments. We accept that the process for requiring a group to separate
could usefully be streamlined. We will therefore bring forward
amendments to that effect while the Bill is before this House. And we
will listen to the contributions of noble Lords to ensure that the
process in the Bill meets the objectives that the PCBS set out, and
which the Government
share.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072444000139" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072444000139">The
Government remain unpersuaded, however, that a reserve provision for
full separation across the entire industry would be appropriate. A
firm-specific reserve power will reinforce the ring-fence by deterring
banks from seeking to undermine or weaken it. However, to move to
industry-wide separation would be to abandon the ring-fence altogether,
in favour of an alternative structural reform. Let us be clear: this 
<?notus-xml column=1340?>would not be a sanction, it would be a different policy. That
alternative policy was considered in detail by the ICB, which rejected
it. As noble Lords will know, the ICB concluded that full separation
similar to Glass-Steagall would entail very significant additional
costs, for doubtful—or even negative—additional benefits
to ring-fencing. The Government have accepted the ICB’s
recommendation and are therefore implementing the ring-fence through
this
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072444000140" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072444000140">Like the
ICB, the Government believe that the ring-fence will succeed. A future
Government would, of course, be within their rights to come to a
different conclusion, and to shift to an alternative policy. But if
they did, the only proper and democratic way to implement that new
policy would be to return to Parliament with new primary legislation
which could be properly debated and scrutinised. The proposal made by
the PCBS would potentially lead to full separation with no more than a
short debate in Parliament and a vote. This would stand in extreme
contrast to the extensive consultation and scrutiny that the current
policy has gone
through.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072444000141" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072444000141">We
have also recently heard proposals from the PCBS on the issue of the
leverage ratio. The PCBS has suggested that control over the leverage
ratio should be taken out of political hands and given to the
regulator. The Government strongly support the principle of a binding
minimum leverage ratio, as agreed in the Basel III accord. We believe
that it is entirely appropriate for minimum standards to be set in
statute. This applies to all the minimum requirements in Basel III,
which we continue to push to have implemented through EU
legislation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072444000142" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072444000142">This
does not mean that there is no role for the regulator. Judgment-based
regulation means the regulator having the ability to impose additional
requirements if it feels that these are necessary to achieve its
statutory objectives. Only last month, the PRA required a number of
banks to meet higher leverage standards sooner than the Basel III
deadline. The PRA thus demonstrated that it already has the power to
impose higher requirements on leverage. So beyond minimum requirements
set in statute in line with international standards, day-to-day control
over the leverage ratio lies in the hands of the
PRA.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072444000143" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072444000143">Structural
reform of the banking industry is the second pillar of the
Government’s reform programme. The third pillar is reform of
banking standards and culture. As noble Lords well know, the Government
have welcomed the recent report of the PCBS, one main theme of which
was to strengthen individual accountability in financial services. The
PCBS argued that the existing approved persons regime has failed in
this, and that new measures are needed to replace it. The PCBS also
called for criminal sanctions for reckless misconduct in the management
of a bank.</hs_para>

further deterrent against misconduct, the Government will table
amendments to make reckless misconduct in the management of a bank a

overhaul of the system for holding bankers to account for their
actions. However, rules and sanctions alone will not guarantee good
conduct. The PCBS argued that effective competition between banks is
essential to ensuring high standards of behaviour, and the Government
agree. We will therefore amend the Bill to give the PRA a secondary
competition objective. This will give the PRA a greater role in

The whole House is grateful to noble Lords who are members of the

role might be described as watering down those recommendations. Every
dilution by the Government increases the risk in the banking sector. It

electrified or permeable the ring-fence might be, what would be the

portability is a valuable addition to consumer choice, of course, but
it is not a game changer in terms of competitive challenge. In
addition, prudential regulation in our sensitive post-crisis world is

the real economy. In the run-up to the crisis, the activity of European
banks raising deposits in the US and recycling them into the US shadow
banking sector undermined the impact of US leverage regulations. The
ICB refers tangentially to the importance of regulatory arbitrage, but
I do not find its assertions convincing. Could the same recycling
arbitrage happen to the UK’s ring-fence? Surely branches of EEA
banks operating in the UK could undermine ring-fencing by providing the
universal and potentially cheaper banking services that UK and EEA
subsidiaries are no longer able to provide. What steps will the
Government take to protect the UK ring-fence against such regulatory
arbitrage?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072453000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072453000013">Understandably,
the thinking behind this Bill concentrated on the problems of the
stability of the banking sector and, in particular, on ensuring that
essential banking services are maintained during a crisis. This
legislation also provides the opportunity to address a wider question:
what structure of banking industry would best serve the needs of
British industry as a whole, including manufacturing, the creative
industries and internationally traded services aiding them to grow and
compete in the global economy? Is the current structure that we are
shoring up in this legislation really appropriate to the needs of the
rest of UK plc? Is there a need for a British investment bank to
supplement the Green Investment Bank and the infrastructure bank? Is
there a case for regional banks? If the answer to both these questions
is yes, will the Minister tell us how such institutions would fit into

Kramer:</Member></B> My Lords, on a hot day such as today and so near
to recess, my noble friend Lord Sharkey and I, who will be working
together on the Bill, have tried somewhat to divide up the issues
between ourselves so that noble Lords are spared at least some degree
of repetition—although I have to admit that it will not always

particularly with three issues that my noble friend Lord Sharkey will
focus on in greater detail. The first is competition, perhaps the most
significant long-term reform to the banking system and one which the
current version of the Bill virtually ignores. While the regulators and
the Government are now open to competition in, frankly, a complete
reversal of historic attitudes, it will be a generation before new
banks will be in a position to seriously challenge the dominance of the
big four if we rely on organic growth alone. I was quite shaken to hear
some senior members of the banking world describe the future very much
in terms of a bar-bell: there will be the big four, a group of little
ones down the other end and almost nothing in the middle. That will be
a continuation of the uncompetitive situation that we face today. As I
have said, my noble friend Lord Sharkey will come forward with some
ideas on how we can try to accelerate that change, which everyone now
acknowledges is necessary. It is fundamental to our banking
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072453000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072453000027">I will
address two other issues, the first of them very quickly. In the
Financial Services Act 2012, this House -seriously tackled the issue of
payday and high-cost short-term lenders in what we all name the
Sassoon-Mitchell amendment, which gave very extensive powers to the FCA
to crack down on rollovers, interest rates, fees,
duration—indeed, I would argue, all the powers necessary to
prevent exploitation by this industry. Some comments by Ministers in
this House have suggested that the Government might have somewhat
watered down their position, although I have heard denials from other
Ministers. However, before we
return<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T17:27:34"></hs_TimeCode> in
October we will see the draft version of the new FCA rules. If they are
not satisfactory to this House we will have the opportunity to use the
Bill to provide the strength that we all think is
appropriate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072453000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072453000028">The
third issue, which is not often addressed in banking, is absolutely
fundamental and, I suspect, the biggest threat to our future; my noble
friend Lord Sharkey will address it in more detail. That is, that the
issue of the central clearing platforms for derivative contracts will
be a huge source of concentrated risk. Some recent articles by
Bloomberg say that the greatest security or strength of the protection
under these contracts is largely through the collateral that companies
are required to post. They suggest that the banks are finding some
fairly clever ways for junk to be used, going through the alchemy
process to provide collateral under these contracts. Therefore, I am
not sure what the answer is, but this House must not duck that issue,
and the Bill is an opportunity for that
debate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072453000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072453000029">I was

have choices over which businesses they abandon and which business they

business under those circumstances, but I recognise that those choices
are difficult. But the response to that has to be to bring in new
players to provide that kind of lending and credit, not to allow the
banks to be riskier than they should be for a safe economy. So the
focus has to be on developing deeper and broader capital markets that
can serve small businesses, to bring on the peer-to-peer players in
this arena. Last week, this House passed the relevant orders to provide
regulation for that industry. We need to bring in smaller, specialised,

requires a genuine alliance of the Government, perhaps using a business
bank, and the big banks—and, in the US, carrots and sticks have
been used to make sure that the big banks provide capital and know-how
to these little local institutions. Charities and social enterprises,
as well as the Church of England, are potential players in this
arena.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072453000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072453000041">Particularly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T17:39:29"></hs_TimeCode>

discussions on the Radio 4 programme “The Bishop and the

which we all depend for our welfare can, in its search for efficiency
and other objectives, become dehumanised and disconnected from the
needs and culture of individuals. Therefore the structural proposal to

possibility of a much better arrangement for the country as a whole. As
we focus both on the struggle of ordinary people to manage with what
little money they have, and on the need for micro, small and
medium-sized businesses to stay on their feet in competitive local and
export markets, strong arguments are being made not only for a new

Lawson of Blaby:</Member></B> My Lords, I am particularly happy to
follow the excellent speech of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of
Birmingham, not least because he stressed the importance of changing
the culture of banking. That is accepted across the board. It is
certainly accepted in the United States and it is accepted by everybody
in this country. Indeed, when the Parliamentary Commission on Banking
Standards was set up—like my noble friend Lady Kramer, I was a
member of that commission—the Prime Minister said that we needed
to address standards and culture. That is a problem that I was
concerned about.</hs_para>

the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Birmingham, I do not have the
ability to preach, so we had to decide how to change the culture by
legislation. It was not so easy, but we tried a whole battery of
proposals that we hoped would do something to help change the culture.
I will mention one or two specific things during the course of my
remarks. In speaking about the Parliamentary Commission on Banking
Standards, I shall say some things that are slightly critical of my
noble friend Lord Deighton. I was  sorry that he did not find
time to pay tribute to our chairman, our honourable friend the Member
of Parliament for Chichester, Andrew Tyrie. It was an extraordinary
effort. We produced an enormous number of recommendations in a large
number of reports. Incidentally, my noble friend Lord Deighton
said  that the commission produced some important
recommendations in its report last month. We produced five reports and
there were important recommendations in most of them. I am sure that
that is what he meant to
say<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T17:51:40"></hs_TimeCode>. We all
worked quite hard, including incidentally the most reverend Primate the
Archbishop of Canterbury. He, too, worked very hard, despite the fact
that he also had a day job. Nobody worked harder than Andrew Tyrie. It
has a lot to do with him that, with all parties represented, we managed
to secure a unanimous report. That gives it much greater weight than
would otherwise be the
case<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T17:52:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072460000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072460000004">I
shall focus on certain areas, some of which, although not all, have
already been discussed in the debate. One of them that has not been
discussed explicitly, on which we made a recommendation and which has
on the whole been accepted by my right honourable friend the Chancellor
of the Exchequer, George Osborne, concerns the split of the Royal Bank
of Scotland Group into a good bank and a bad bank. He has agreed to set
up an inquiry, which will report very soon. I very much hope that it
will come to the right conclusion. That is very important indeed to our
economy in its present condition.</hs_para>

idea of a good bank/bad bank split is not at all new. It was done in
the case of Northern Rock recently; and it has been done on other
occasions in this country and in other countries overseas. It is the
classic answer to the sort of problem we are facing. It is particularly
important in the case of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group. It is the
biggest bank in our country that supports, or is meant to support,
small and medium-sized
businesses—SMEs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T17:53:39"></hs_TimeCode>.
However, there is a problem with SME lending to which my noble friend
Lord Deighton referred. It is one of the reasons why our emergence 
<?notus-xml column=1354?>from the present recession is so slow. There is a real problem with
lending to SMEs, which is inhibited by the fact that the banks have a
huge amount of bad debts on their books—far more than they would
ever admit. They are very nervous of lending because it might increase
the amount of their bad debt. They already have more than they say they
have and they are exercising what is known in today’s jargon as
forbearance. They need to be strong. They will not lend unless they are
strong. We hold between 81% and 82% as a taxpayer stake in the Royal
Bank of Scotland Group. We should use that power to split the bad
assets and put them into a bad bank. Then we would have a good bank
with good assets which could help by lending to SMEs in order to help
our economy. That is the most important single thing that the
Government can do at the
present<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T17:54:58"></hs_TimeCode>

incidentally with my noble friend Lady Kramer and others who have
spoken about reforms in the banking system, in the sense of having more

shall now refer to the so-called ring-fence. I was very happy with what
my noble friend Lord Deighton said. Let me back-track a bit. I have
been arguing for the best part of five years for complete separation
between what used to be known as high street banking and investment
banking. To call it retail banking is slightly misleading because it is
also SME banking. We always used to have that in this country. I have
been a close observer of the City of London ever since I wrote the LEX
column for the <I>Financial Times</I> more than half a century ago. For
most of the time we had the high street banks and the merchant banks.
They were completely separate and we did not need legislation to keep
them separate; they were separate by custom and practice. I know the
people at the top of both kinds of bank. They were different kinds of
people with different cultures. The system worked and served this
country very
well<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T17:57:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072460000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0001.htm#13072460000008">The
Vickers commission accepted the problem and thought that the ring-fence
would be the solution. We on the commission were concerned that the
ring-fence would not be robust enough. There are all sorts of problems
with the ring-fence. I shall mention three quickly, if I may. One of
them, which is perhaps the least of the problems, but which has been
put to me by a number of senior bankers, is that the governance
structure is impossible. There has to be two totally separate
governances of a single entity, which would have an overall holding
governance with another governance with responsibility to the same
group of 
<?notus-xml column=1355?>shareholders. Many bankers have said that that cannot possibly work. The
other problems, which are perhaps more fundamental, are that it is
likely to be gamed; there will be a huge incentive to game it if it is
in the interests of the bank concerned to find ways around the
ring-fence. The third problem goes back to what the right reverend
Prelate the Bishop of Birmingham was saying. The cultures of high
street banking and the cultures of investment banking are totally
different. It is very difficult, with the best will in the world, to
see how we can have two totally separate cultures in the same
organisation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T17:59:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072460000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0002.htm#13072460000009">We
decided that we should give the Vickers ring-fence a chance but make
sure that it was fully electrified—that was the jargon we used.
So, if it were seen not to be working in one particular bank, it could
go to full separation. If it were seen not to work on a wider scale we
would have complete separation for the banking sector as a whole. The
Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Government said that they would
accept the first part of that but not the second. I think they are
wrong on that. Moreover, the voltage which they have put into the
electrification of the ring-fence is so lamentably low that it will
have no effect at all. I was therefore glad to hear my noble friend
Lord Deighton say that they would take it away and come forward with an
amendment closer to what the commission
recommended<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T18:00:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

points to the fact that this House has an unusually important part to
play in this legislation. It has passed through the other place and it
falls to us to get it into the shape it should be. I hope—this
is not a party political issue—that if the Government do not
bring forward the requisite amendments there will be a cross-party
agreement which will help the Government to do the job that needs to

was very surprised to hear my noble friend Lord Deighton say that we
cannot go to full separation in any circumstances because the Vickers
commission, the independent commission on banking, said that it wanted
the ring-fence. There are two curiosities in that point. First, we are
saying that we should go to full separation only if the ring fence
fails. I am quite sure that the Vickers commission does not want a
failed ring fence, it wants a successful one. I hope it is successful,
but if it fails we will have to go to full
separation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T18:02:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072460000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0002.htm#13072460000012">Secondly,
my noble friend implied that the Vickers commission was a holy writ and
we must do as it says. However, when it said that 3% leverage is
totally inadequate, the Government said that they did not agree and
that they were going to stick with 3%. This is the despite the fact, as
the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, pointed out, that the United States has
decided to go for 6%, although only for the larger banks. However, that
is all that matters because it is only a failure of the larger banks
that poses a systemic

Americans have quite rightly said that leverage set at 3%, to which we
are apparently meant to stick, is totally inadequate and that it must
be 6%. They have left it to the Fed to decide and impose. We said the
same. We did not say that a particular number—whether it was
four, five or six—was the right leverage ratio. You have to have
a leverage ratio and we have said that 
<?notus-xml column=1356?>that should be for the Financial Policy Committee of the Bank of England

have rejected that and have said that it should be for the politicians
to decide. That is profoundly mistaken. The noble Lord, Lord Eatwell,
was absolutely right that the risk-weighted assets are as long as a
piece of string. Each bank has its own model and puts into it whatever
will produce the risk-weighting that it wants. Studies have shown that
to be true. It is not a matter of
dispute<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T18:03:38"></hs_TimeCode>.

some of these matters. We all know how much lobbying of the Prime
Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer by the banks goes on at
the present time. It is thoroughly unhealthy. In my day, this did not
happen for a very good reason. The convention was not that the banks
could not lobby—of course they could, they were bound
to—but they had to lobby the Governor of the Bank of England,
who would then represent to the Chancellor of the Exchequer of the day
the concerns of the banks. That is a much healthier system and we would

at proprietary training—that is, investment banks trading

of banning proprietary trading—and, in the light of that, come
forward with measures, if necessary, to ban proprietary trading. Not to
ban it altogether—this is a free country—but it should be

As the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Birmingham pointed out, it
is to some extent the moral standards that we all like to think we
apply in our daily lives. However, there are two things in particular
that the banks need to have: a culture of caution and prudence, which
is what we expect from our bankers, and a culture of service to
clients. Proprietary trading is no service to clients because there are
no longer any clients. It is a form of speculation. I have nothing
against speculation in the right place but it does not sit well with
the culture of caution and prudence that we need. You cannot do this by
leverage ratios or by what you put on the statute book; it is a culture
of the people involved. Those people used to 
<?notus-xml column=1357?>be the high street bankers. They may have been rather boring but they

let me say a brief word about something that has not been
mentioned—the question of remuneration packages. I am opposed to
the cap on bonuses imposed by the European Union—as we said in

for up to 10 years. That does not mean to say that it should
always be for that length of time.</hs_para>

the old days the merchant banks performed very well. Moreover, during
this crisis it was the so-called reputable banks which went belly up
but very few hedge funds did. Both the merchant banks and the hedge
funds today normally have a partnership structure. The top management
and directors have their own wealth invested in the company. They have
their own skin in the game. That does not make them any less
innovative, but it does make them less reckless, because their own
wealth is at stake. It is too easy for bankers to construct a deal that
is crazy and will turn lousy a few years hence. They collect the
bonuses in year one and year two and then it is the poor shareholders
and taxpayers who suffer later on when the whole thing goes south. The
idea of deferring the payment of bonuses is to get something that
approximates more to the partnership structure, which is much

ago this month that the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards
was established. With more than170 hours in 80 evidence sessions in
public, 74 hours in private, and more than 9,000 questions later, what
have we found? Mindful that the remit was to look at culture and
standards in the banking industry, we have found an industry where
standards are abysmally low and the culture is rotten. Even in the
seven months in which we took oral evidence, we saw two more major
LIBOR scandals; an interest-rate swap scandal; the PPI mis-selling
scandal, the bill for which has risen £15 billion to £17
billion; a 
<?notus-xml column=1358?>major bank guilty of money-laundering in Latin America; and another
fined $700 million for sanction-busting in

we fix such a system where the public trust in these institutions is at
rock bottom? Despite the worthy attempts of the Parliamentary
Commission on Banking Standards, we have no magic solution. Yes, we
provided a profound analysis that illustrated both the structural and
organisational fault lines, but I would suggest that we have produced a
signpost report which points the way for the Government, the regulator,
the industry and also civic society to take things forward. This will
not be done overnight; it will take a generation. If we are to change
culture, we need that change to be a behavioural change and, for that,
individuals need to buy into it. It starts at the top and permeates the
organisation, which will take a considerable period of time. We have
seen boards, chairmen and chief executives deficient in this regard.
The report laid bare the lack of individual responsibility at the
top—I would suggest that we witnessed a “no see, no
tell” approach, where the collective decision-making was a
defused responsibility. The concept that “the buck stops
here” was non-existent in the banking system. I have two brief
examples of that. From UBS top management, four senior executives came
before the commission; a star trader had lost thousands of billions of
dollars in the Far East and, when we asked if they knew the star
trader, they replied no. We asked when they found out and they said,
“When we read it on the Bloomberg wires”. Collectively,
they were probably getting about £100 million a year, but they
knew neither who the people were within their organisation nor what
those people were doing on their
behalf.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072460000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0002.htm#13072460000024">The
payment protection insurance scandal has, as I mentioned, cost
£17 billion and is likely to go up to £30 billion.
Mindful that the cost of the Olympics was £8.9 billion, we are
talking about the cost of four Olympics being put on, with a
mis-selling scandal taking place over 18 years. Yes, the standards were
abysmally low, because of a lack of ethical principles at the top of
the organisation. Why, we may ask, did that situation prevail for so
long without adequate challenge from outside? Here we come to the
regulator; it is full of worthy people but it was, I would suggest,
captured, conned and cowed by the industry. Captured, because there was
an incestuous relationship where the views of wider society were rarely
heard and never heeded. When I was chairman of the Treasury Select
Committee, it took me five or six years to get at least one consumer
representative into the Financial Services Authority. With the
procession from the Financial Services Authority to the private
industry—and with the former chief executive going to Barclays
as a compliance officer for 10 times his salary at the FSA—I
suggest that we could be seeing a postgraduate institute of the FSA for
people to get better jobs in the private sector. If we want to have an
even system, where the balance of power is maintained, we are going
about  it the wrong way, because the regulator will always be

regulator was cowed, because this is a powerful industry that is used
to getting its own way and is impervious to challenge. The PPI scandal
illustrated that very well. I also said that the regulator was 
<?notus-xml column=1359?>conned. Why conned? It is because the FSA executives said to me for
years that the business model of institutions and organisations was not
their responsibility. They did not know, or seemed to care little for,
how much risk there was on the balance sheets of banks as a result of
complex models. That complexity provided an illusion of control; people
felt satisfied but they did not know what was going on. That very much
applied to the regulator. They did not wake up to the importance of the
selling of PPI, because they did not look at the profit and loss of the
balance sheets. One cursory look would have shown that there was a big
problem<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T18:17:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072460000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0002.htm#13072460000026">I
am not advocating for more regulation, we do not need more regulation.
What we do need is tougher regulation and change to the commercial law
of the land regarding the responsibilities of directors, so that the
heads of the banks are answerable for the actions of rogue
subordinates. We need to give the regulator both authority and
autonomy. I turn to the ring-fence and leverage, because the
Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards did its job adequately in
those areas. What have the Government done? To date, I would suggest,
they have pulled the rug from under the feet of the regulators. Let us
look at ring-fence and what the Government are proposing. In fact, some
of us, as the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, said, were advocates of full
separation and anyone who listened to the testimony of Paul Volcker
when he said to the commission that an executive or director of an
holding company is responsible for the ring-fence as well, would know,
as the noble Lord said, that it is very hard to have a ring-fence
situation. In the name of compromise, however, we sat down and said
that if the Government established the Vickers commission and Vickers
came out with ring-fencing, we were mindful that the Government would
be unsympathetic to anything else. That is why we called for the
electrification of the ring-fence. If anyone gamed the system, the
regulator could bring them into line quickly and threaten or impose
separation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T18:19:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Government done on paper? They have accepted that, but I suggest that
to date they have neutered it. The noble Baroness has already mentioned
the remarks of the chairman in the other place. How have they neutered
it? They have done so by expecting the regulator to issue three
preliminary notices to the offending bank, seeking permission from the
Treasury on each occasion. What price the independence of the regulator
in a situation such as
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T18:20:20"></hs_TimeCode>? The three
permissions from the Treasury are followed by a five-year gap before
there is any decision whatever on separation. I say to the Minister
that that is an affront to the genuine efforts of the Parliamentary
Commission on Banking Standards to seek a unanimous way forward. What
we have now is not a ring-fence; I suggest that it is a hammock in
which the executives can swing easily above the ground, while all the
hassle takes place on the ground with the politicians and the
regulators, and the executives look down from above, easy and relaxed.
Therefore, the Government have to fundamentally change their opinion on
that. I am going to be in the trenches with the noble Lord, Lord
Lawson, in ensuring that the Government do the right thing on this

excessive leverage has been the trigger in every banking crisis in

leverage. However, the Government declared “no, no, no”
three times, saying that they were wedded to Basel, despite the wise
advice to the contrary. Robert Jenkins, a former member of the interim
Financial Policy Committee, was very clear on the issue. He is no

leverage, but Barclays is operating with 45 times leverage—a
gearing 15 times the average of any hedge fund. If Barclays’
assets eroded in value by a mere 1.5%, it would be leveraged 100 times

thank my noble friend the Minister for arranging a meeting with
officials ahead of this debate; we may need to consult him further.
Officials have been very helpful, but drafting the whole thing by
reference to a quite different piece of legislation, albeit related, is
not, I think, the easiest way of doing it. Similarly, in the
Explanatory Notes we have constant references to “new
clauses”, when in fact, as I understand it, they have already
been approved by the other place. Certainly, the Bill is very unusual
in that the other place seems to have given proper attention to it,
instead of its being programmed, when it is impossible for them to do
their jobs in an orderly way. So we are coming to the Bill when it has
already been scrutinised in another place, unlike many other pieces of
legislation we
get.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072460000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0002.htm#13072460000041">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T18:36:36"></hs_TimeCode>
essence of the Bill is, I think, very much concerned with the issue of
banks being “too big to fail”. I come increasingly to the
view that they are not only too big to fail, many of them are too big
to manage. Noble Lords have only to look at the experience of the LIBOR
scandal, and so on, to realise the extent to which the people at the
top have not the remotest idea of what is happening in some parts of
the organisations they are supposed to head. Indeed, it may also be
that they are too big to regulate, so we have to ask, at some stage,
what the economies of scale in banking really are. I have increasing
doubts as to whether they are as big as they seem—I see, rather,
an increasing, somewhat megalomaniac approach by those in charge of
such organisations to make them bigger and bigger and take over more
and more other organisations. At all events, we now have a Bill which
is very interesting in that it is ring-fenced, with an electrified
ring-fence at that. This, we will need to examine very
carefully.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072460000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0002.htm#13072460000042">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T18:36:36"></hs_TimeCode>
ask my noble friend who is to wind up one simple question. Are there
any circumstances in which the investment bank can get its hands on the
assets in the retail bank? It is a simple question. I
understand the answer is supposed to be, no, but we need to examine the
extent to which the ring-fence is really effective. We also have to
consider very carefully the question of timing. My understanding is
that some of the proposals will not come into operation until 2019. Are
we really sure that we are not going to have another financial
crisis—for example, if the eurozone collapses before that time?
Are we sure that we are taking account of the possibility of the
structure not being properly in place when we need it
urgently?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072460000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0002.htm#13072460000043">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T18:36:36"></hs_TimeCode>
very much welcome the proposals for depositor preference, although it
is very much a Treasury-driven idea. It will limit the extent to which
the Treasury is liable if a particular bank runs into problems. In
effect, if the ring-fence really is electrified and if it really does
work, we are moving closer and closer to complete separation. I share
with my noble friend Lord Lawson and others the view that ultimately,
we should go for complete separation—a Glass-Steagall 
<?notus-xml column=1363?>solution, if you will. This may take some while and meanwhile, to
operate a ring-fence in a way that is satisfactory and protects
depositors is a move in the right
direction.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072460000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0002.htm#13072460000044">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T18:36:36"></hs_TimeCode>
have a final point which is very topical. I received a lot of
representations from the Community Investment Coalition which was very
anxious that we should make progress in providing more local data on
the extent to which banks provide finance to small and medium-sized
enterprises, and so on. I read, either on the web or in the news today,
that the Government  are proposing to publish such regional
data. If so, that is something that I am sure the organisation I
have  just mentioned will welcome—it is generally to be
welcomed. That is the present situation concerning these developments.
I believe that we are making progress, but it is progress in an
incredibly complicated situation. We are going to have to give the Bill
the closest possible scrutiny in Committee and at subsequent stages in
order to get it right. It may not be easy, but it is a job which is
very necessary and
urgent.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-24?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_24_PT_1/BD29712709847286836AB1702006828041284EA0" __version__="1.9"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 24 July 2013">Wednesday,

Hollick:</Member></B> My Lords, I declare some interests. I started
work in a merchant bank in the City in the late 1960s—medieval
times, as the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, described them—and then
from 1975 to 2000 was chief executive of what grew to become the
largest inter-dealer broker in the world, now called ICAP, where I am a
shareholder. For the past two years I have been a member of the
advisory board of Jefferies, a US investment bank, and a partner in GP
Bullhound, a boutique investment bank—in other words, a very
small investment bank—which arranges finance for young
technology
companies.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072460000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0002.htm#13072460000046">One
of the first things that was drummed into me as a graduate trainee at a
merchant bank was that banks had to put their customers first, be they
depositors or borrowers. That stands in stark contrast to the infamous
occasion when the chairman of Goldman Sachs was asked by a Senate
committee whether he put his customers first and, of course, he was
unable to answer in the affirmative because he did not: he put his
institution first. It is that lack of duty of care that has burdened
many of our companies, small and large, many individuals and, indeed,
the Government, through many PFI schemes, with the complex and very
costly interest rate swaps which extend far beyond the life of the
loan. Any institution or body that had a duty of care would immediately
draw the attention of those borrowers to that
fact.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072460000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0002.htm#13072460000047">The Bank
of England regulated wholesale markets in those days by applying
judgment as well as rules and my experience, as someone appointed to
rescue a secondary bank during the 1974-75 secondary banking crisis,

the Bank of England managed to contain and resolve that
crisis.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072460000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0002.htm#13072460000048">As
chief executive of the inter-dealer broker, I met regularly with the
leadership of many of the great banks operating both in London and
other major financial centres. I was very struck and, indeed, alarmed
by the depth of ignorance that the bank leadership, particularly
directors of banks, displayed about the 
<?notus-xml column=1364?>increasingly sophisticated products that were being traded on a
proprietary basis in their organisations in different time zones. To be
blunt, the attitude appeared to be that if the trading is profitable

the great skills of the City is that it is adept at devising business
models which can give a highly leveraged reward for success but
virtually no penalty for failure. That is called getting other
people’s money to work for you. Bank executives were notable
beneficiaries of this particular alchemy, and they were not reined in
by their boards or shareholders. As we heard, all too often,
Governments of all stripes have been dazzled by the great wealth of
those City chaps and too ready to take what the City says on trust. The
absence of scepticism from the board, directors, shareholders,
regulators and auditors allowed the financial services industry to bet
the UK economy. Of course, because of the large size of the financial
services industry in relation to that economy the cost of that bet is
now being borne by every business and household right across the
land—and will be for many years to
come.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072460000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0002.htm#13072460000050">The need
for fundamental reform is self-evident. I join other noble Lords in
congratulating the parliamentary commission on an outstanding and very
important piece of work. It and the independent commission made a
compelling case for reform and provided detailed proposals on how that
reform should be implemented. Now is indeed the time for fundamental
reform of the structure, governance and culture of banking. It is also
the time to make banking far more competitive—that will take
time—and better able to service the needs of an economy
desperate for the investment and funding necessary to achieve sustained
growth. The measures proposed by the commissions will not give us
zero-risk banking, but they can substantially reduce the overall risk
to the economy of the inevitable banking
failures.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072460000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0002.htm#13072460000051">The
test of the Financial Services (Banking Reform) Bill is whether it
seizes this historic opportunity or, under pressure from City lobbying,
fudges and fumbles it. The Chancellor said that he would implement the
main recommendations of the parliamentary commission and, where
legislative changes are required, he would amend the banking reform
Bill, but the Bill before us has fallen well short of those promises.
On the fundamental structural issue of separating retail and investment
banking, I entirely agree that they should be completely separate, as
they have a completely different culture with completely different risk
profiles. I suggest that shareholders will, over time, require them to
be separated. The full separation proposed is a complicated process:
three yellow cards are required, the regulator has to go to the
Treasury and full separation can take place only after five years. That
may be long after the problems have reached a scale where another
bail-out is necessary. The chairman of the parliamentary commission,
Andrew Tyrie, described the Government’s ring-fence proposals

proposals to give the Prudential Regulation Authority the powers to
inspect a bank’s trading book and ban excessive proprietary
trading—to which other noble Lords have referred—and the
recommendation that regulators should have the power to insist upon
stricter capital leverage ratios, have both been ignored by the
Government. This House must table amendments to ensure that these
critically important reforms reach the statute book. Relying on the
risk-weighted assets test is completely inadequate. If we do not grasp
this opportunity, business will go on very much as usual and I fear
that the chance to reform the City will be lost. Bank lending to
non-financial companies began to contract in 2009 and has continued to
do so for the past four years. The absence of certainty on bank
regulation makes it difficult for banks to assess with confidence the
long-term profitability of additional lending. The Government’s
confused response to the parliamentary commission’s principal
recommendations prolongs the agony. First they were welcomed, and now
they are watered down or ignored. That adds unwanted confusion, as does
the Chancellor’s meddling in RBS’s
affairs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072460000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0002.htm#13072460000053">The
Bill before us today is an empty vessel. It reminds me of the
prospectus issued saying that funds would be raised for purposes that
“shall hereinafter be revealed”—that was for the
South Sea bubble. Only ring-fencing is addressed in detail, and the
proposals there are deeply flawed. There is no mention of bank
governance, professional standards, duty of care, whistleblower
protection, remuneration or competition. All that, we are promised, is
to follow. The parliamentary commission has made detailed proposals on
all these matters and we look forward to seeing them properly and
faithfully reflected in the draft. Frankly, until amendments covering
these matters are tabled, it is not possible to have a detailed debate
on the merits of the Government’s proposals, and this is the
first half—or quarter—of Second Reading. Uncertainty
continues, and with it the suspicion that the Government are
backsliding on some of the important reforms needed, reforms which
would help to avoid another taxpayer bail-out when the next crisis
hits, as it will do, and promote a healthier culture in banking.
Reforms are long overdue to improve the supply and choice of banking
services available to SMEs and the public at large—in particular
to the
unbanked.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-24?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_24_PT_1/F882DA2526018D44FBD75F0FC6DC340BD5D694A6" __version__="1.9"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 24 July 2013">Wednesday,

Stewartby:</Member></B> My Lords, when I came into the Chamber this
afternoon I was nervous because I would have to make a confession, that
I do not really understand large tracts of the Bill. I thought that I
had better be honest about that. My noble friend Lord Higgins has put
his finger on the spot—this is nothing that can be sorted out by
fine words. There is an awful lot of verbiage in the Bill. There are
pages and pages of elements designed to go wholesale into the
record  of other Acts. That is not a workable way of dealing
with this sort of technical and difficult material. We have to
acknowledge that. A great deal still remains  to be done on
this legislation. I have no doubt that many amendments will be tabled,
but it is easy to lose track of them all. There are so many—so
many are 
<?notus-xml column=1366?>fundamental, and so many adjust other ones—that you do not get a
clear run at it. My nervousness about coming in this afternoon is
somewhat eased by having got that off my

looked at banking legislation in some considerable detail for 25 or 30
years. Although I have often found the whole performance difficult to
follow, I have never met anything quite as complicated and unmanageable
as the present Bill. It is not an advantage to say that the ring-fence
issue will be with us perhaps rather more strongly than it has been so
far. Personally, I think the two cultures are incompatible. We need a
change of culture—that is absolutely fine and other noble Lords
have mentioned that. You do not have the same sort of mental processes
going on if you run a retail bank as against an investment bank. We kid
ourselves if we do not face up to that. The whole scene has become
structurally complex with whole new architectures put in place. For
obvious reasons, there has not been an opportunity to examine most of
them in careful detail—as there needs to be. There is a lot of
work ahead on this Bill. Some of that work will be very technical.
Again, one has to face up to that. A lot of it will need detailed

take one particular example: the Prudential Regulation Authority. What

of many people—practitioners, commentators and others—so
we start from a very difficult and unbalanced situation. Regulation
is—funnily enough, because that is what the Latin word
means—about making rules and using the structures to construct
this new architecture. But it is not just a question of terminology. If
you start going at a problem and you are mentally confused between
regulation and supervision, you are not going to get to a sensible

all sure that it is. This is typical of the sort of thing which brings
misunderstanding. After all, if people do not understand the difference
between regulation and supervision, they are hardly going to get it
right, because a whole lot depends on what is put into the assumptions.
I do not think that we have so far had any serious comment on this.

Forgive me,  but it does not seem to me, as far as the
ring-fencing side of this Bill is concerned, that the Government have
totally accepted what the commission said. The commission did not go as
far as separation, which, like the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, I would

whole way through, everything that has to be done under this section of
the Bill can be done only by order of the Treasury, not by Parliament.
It does not surprise me too much that the Treasury wants all these

got it. That is because a Bill does not really go through the House of

this Bill—to go through it with great care—will be even
more important.</hs_parafo>

commission that on ring-fencing, if I read the report correctly, it
does not want full separation as the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, and I
might like to see. However, it would in certain circumstances be
prepared to go to it. As I understand it, that has been ruled out under
any circumstances by the noble Lord, Lord Deighton, and by the
Government. The whole question of Glass-Steagall is very important and
an important article was written by John Authers on it recently, on 15
July. His very interesting article spoke of the amount of bank assets
as a percentage of GDP. In the United States in 2010, that amount was
81%, but here in Europe it is ginormous. In Germany, France and Spain
respectively, the figures were 294%, 416% and 325% of assets as a
percentage of GDP. That is because the banks have grown substantially,
which is why they need separating. In the UK, for example, the most
recent figures on 19 May showed that we had 492% of GDP as bank
assets.</hs_para>

for the drafting of parts of the Bill. It would not surprise me if they

giving them drafts. Did they discuss the drafting and were they finally
happy with it as it stands? Those banks are a very powerful body. They
were even more powerful when Angela Knight did the PR work for them,
but we certainly know that they are a powerful group. It would be
interesting to know what lobbying the banks did of the Government

England, and the Bank of England in turn has got the PRA and the FCA,
renamed from the FSA—no doubt so they can have a lot of the

peaceful era. There were no risks to banks because the banks were

Flight:</Member></B> My Lords, I first declare my interests as set out
in the register, in particular as a co-founder and director of the new
retail bank, Metro Bank. I agree very much with what the noble Lord,
Lord Lawson, had to say about the separation of high street and
investment banking. It is accepted that the ring-fencing regime is a
compromise to see how it goes but it seems to me, above all, that these
huge institutions have become unmanageable. They are just too large to
manage effectively. I also note that investors, many  of them
pension funds, are still investing in a mixture of the two businesses,
so it really is not much help to them.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13072465000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0002.htm#13072465000003">The ring-fencing brings
a lot of problems in terms of which services can or cannot be sold to
retail clients. It is very complex but, to go only slightly in the
other direction, one should not forget that it was essentially bad
lending that led to the banking disasters. The noble Lord, Lord Lawson,
made that point. There was bad lending of all sorts, including the
buying of foolish CDO instruments. It was not particularly the
derivatives or the investment banking side. It is important to remember
that. I hope that a separation of the two sides of banking, should it
come about in the future, may leave the banking sector to return to
more reliable lending practices. That would go a long way to help
address the issue of remuneration. In the past there was never any
justification for huge remuneration. It was very much a carry-over from
the investment banking world.</hs_para>

the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards and to Andrew
Tyrie’s excellent leadership. I support the new senior person
responsibility regime, but with the proviso that we should continue to
have the principle that one is innocent until proven guilty. Some of
the proposals seem to point in the other direction.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13072465000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0002.htm#13072465000005">I want particularly to
talk about competition. I used to think that competition was not so
hugely important. The more that I focus on it, however, the more I
consider it the one thing that could completely change banking in this
country within as short a period as a decade. I will start by
commenting on the Payments Council arrangements to enable seven-day
current account switching, which come into operation this September,
and on the debate about whether bank account number portability will be
feasible in the foreseeable future. First, sort code account
portability 
<?notus-xml column=1371?>will not be feasible until banks have common sort code number systems.
There is a lot of work to be done to standardise sort codes, which will
be expensive. My second comment concerns a point that I raised at the
time of the Financial Services Bill, to which there has been no reply.
The anti-money laundering, or AML, “know your customer”
requirement means that another two weeks or so is added to the time
that it will take people to move their bank accounts. Banks will not
accept a new customer’s account until they have satisfied
themselves with an AML check. We all know that that goes on for ever;
people have to see lawyers, get passports signed and goodness knows
what. I would not mind if it was sensible—if there was a single
body that did all AML “know your customer” analysis that
was acceptable to all banks and which could be kept up to date. That
would save a lot of duplication. With my Metro Bank hat on, we find
that just by using a driving licence we can access all the data that we
want and open an account within 10 minutes.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13072465000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0002.htm#13072465000006">On the point about the
essence of competition, until the latter part of the 19th century we
were like America, with many regional banks. When local banks went down
they caused 10-year depressions in parts of the country, which led the
great Walter Bagehot to argue that if banks were consolidated, that
would spread the risk. Certainly, one could argue that, in the 1930s, a
Midland bank that had a very rough time in the north-west was
sustained, in part, because of its spread of business all over the
country.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13072465000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0002.htm#13072465000007">Inevitably, things
swing too far in the wrong direction. I would argue that in this
country the amalgamation to reduce risk spread virtually to a
cartelised banking system. When one of the large four banks decided to
cut massively the services that it provided to customers, everyone else
copied it. By and large, the big four have behaved in a similar way for
a long time. When we have a cartel situation we tend to get problems
and bad behaviour. Therefore, there is a sound case to be made for a
significant revival of new banks in this country, which might take as
much as half the total banking business—certainly the high
street business—over the next 10 years or so.</hs_para>

third birthday. We have opened 19 branches, we have a balance sheet of
nearly £1.5 billion, and we have about 210,000 account holders.
That has all been built from scratch. If we can do it, why cannot
everyone else do it? It is not that difficult. I am pleased to say that
Vernon Hill, the American backer, considers this to be a more welcoming
country than America in which to grow a bank. Although we may have our
complaints about regulation, the multitude of American regulation is
more exhausting than it is here. He is a great advocate of doing
banking business in this country.</hs_para>

areas in which we see scope to improve competitiveness. None of them is
absolutely huge, but all are important. The first concerns the need to
have a level playing field with regard to capital and liquidity
requirements. The second concerns the payments system. The Minister
commented on that in terms of the Government’s commitment.
Thirdly, our antiquated high street planning rules tend to make it
difficult for new banks to open up in good retail spots. 
<?notus-xml column=1372?>The final point concerns the guidance to all government departments on
doing business with new banks. As everyone knows, not so long ago the
advice was to place money where one got the highest interest rate. Then
came the Iceland banks crisis and the advice swung the other way:
“You mustn’t go to any bank unless it’s got a
credit rating”. We have all seen how useful credit ratings
are.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13072465000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0002.htm#13072465000010">On the
first point, it is unacceptable that small banks—not even just
new banks—often have four to five times the capital ratio
requirements for SME and mortgage lending as do large banks. Clearly, a
set of common industry standards for both liquidity and capital
requirements is needed. I accept that both requirements should be
higher in the early years of a new bank. There are high risks in
setting up a bank and it is appropriate that there should be
protection. However, the regulator should know what is going on and
after three or four years it should be able gradually to phase in the
capital and liquidity requirements to be broadly the same for all sizes
of bank. I am hopeful that the PRA will use the occasion of Basel III
and the EU’s CRD IV proposals, which come in at the beginning of
next year, to move in that direction. I cannot see why we are where we
are today and why the PRA should not get more of a move on.</hs_para>

new and smaller banks are dependent, as everyone knows, on large
competitors to provide them with agency banking services, for which
they invariably are significantly over-charged. It would be best to
remove the payments system completely from banks’ internal
mechanisms and to create an independently run licensed payments
platform that would provide the service to all banks. The US clearing
house inter-bank payments system is effectively that. It services
several thousand banks within the United States quite satisfactorily. I
cannot think why we might not think of copying the US in that
direction.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13072465000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0002.htm#13072465000012">On
planning, we have classes A1 and A2 planning designations where banks
are treated as A2 and therefore do not qualify for A1 retail sites. If
a bank wants to open an operation in a shopping mall in an area where
there is a lot of retail custom, it is not allowed to have that site.
If the bank thinks it worth the effort, it has to go through
substantial expense and time-consuming activity in seeking to get a
change of use from A1 to A2 before it can take on such a site. Needless
to say, landlords do not like that much, given that there is a delay in
the period in which they are likely to earn their rental. The costs of
dealing with planning add about £100,000 per site. The sensible
solution might be to amend class orders to reclassify banks that keep
retail hours, have retail customers and provide retail services as
being suitable for A1 and A2.</hs_para>

business with local authorities, it is clear that what is
needed—whether it is guidance from DCLG or local authorities
themselves—is to take a wider view of rating banks. Indeed, it
is an insult to the PRA, which is supposed to ensure the
creditworthiness, security and liquidity of all size of bank, to assume
that credit agencies are better and that the smaller, newer bank is
automatically less secure. Quite often it is, in fact, the other way
round. The guidelines ought to be amended inviting government 
<?notus-xml column=1373?>bodies to make their own judgments and potentially to place deposits on
a more pro rata basis to the capital of different
banks.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072465000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0002.htm#13072465000014">There
are two other issues I shall address briefly which are somewhat
indirect. One is that the EFG small business loan guarantee scheme is
working poorly in this country, particularly in comparison with the
small company loan scheme in the United States. The banks do not like
it as it is a nuisance and a hassle. However, in the United States,
there is effectively  full security cover because the lenders,
including the Government as guarantor, take a charge over the
entrepreneur’s residence whereas over here that is not
permitted. In the United States, that makes such loans more easily
on-sellable, so the banks can go on making
more.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072465000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0002.htm#13072465000015">Finally,
as noble Lords will have noticed, UK banks in America have now been
fined many billions for breaches of various regulations. I am very
mindful that America has reduced its international indebtedness by
about $1,000 billion as a result of the mis-selling of CDOs and that
has been substantially paid for by our banking system. I wonder whether
the Treasury has looked at whether the mis-selling of CDOs is a
regulatory offence for which we might look at levying some compensating
US fines.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13072465000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0002.htm#13072465000016">We

to the Co-op, and now to an IPO. I have also advised in the past on
derivatives in relation to interest and inflation hedging. I shall
speak to the importance of retail banking to our society and
competition in that sector, and to the consequent responsibility of
Government and this House to reform those areas with great
care.</hs_para>

Government have accepted—in the comments made by the noble Lord,
Lord Deighton, in opening—the conclusions of the parliamentary
commission. The Lord Chancellor, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and
the Secretary of State for Business have accepted the following words:
banks in the United Kingdom are not doing enough to carry out their
core role of financing economic growth; many of them have also failed
taxpayers, their customers and their shareholders; and trust in banking
is at a low ebb. A reform designed to deal with such a situation is, as
I have said, of great moment.</hs_para>

of such social importance? The facts: the largest four banks in this
country have 77% of the personal account business and 85% of SME
business, which, on its face, is a huge concentration of economic
power; and those banks administer £6 trillion of
assets, which is four times our GDP. It was thought by the Vickers
commission that around 20% of that  
<?notus-xml column=1374?>would be the subject of ring-fencing of the retail banking
sector—£1.5 trillion—affecting four people out of
five in this country. It follows that the size of such giant banking
corporations makes them of great significance in our society. Therefore
ring-fencing is not an interference with their freedom to do business;
it is a step taken to ensure that they do business in a way that
reflects their importance to society. So there is a need to
act—to restore trust by the steps promised by the commission
and, somewhat, in this
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072465000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0002.htm#13072465000020">In its
present form, the Bill identifies the importance of core services in
the retail sector. That gives statutory acknowledgement to the obvious.
What is of even greater importance is how to give protection to those
core services. “Ring-fencing the retail sector”,
“the personal liability of directors and senior persons”,
“promoting competition”—none of those words
appears in the Long Title of the Bill. Indeed, once you get past Clause
1, as the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, pointed out, and you get past the
objectives, the density becomes ever more impenetrable. That is not the
programme for reform. Reform should bespeak what, why, how and when.
This Bill in its present form does not satisfy those
tasks.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072465000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0002.htm#13072465000021">I turn
to the issues that I wish to concentrate on briefly: ring-fencing,
personal liability and competition. I think that I am the only
practising lawyer in the speakers list on the Bill. I can guarantee the
House that many, many more lawyers will be working on this for a long
time to come, at enormous expense. The flurry of paperwork arriving on
Ministers’ laps this evening will be as nothing to the amount of
paper that this will generate. Why? Because of the power that I have
just illustrated to the House. It is inevitable that people with such
power will seek to protect, as they think fit, their economic
interests.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13072465000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0002.htm#13072465000022">The noble Lords, Lord
Higgins and Lord Flight, and my noble friend Lord McFall were correct
to emphasise that these institutions are too big to manage in their
present form. They are not too big to manage in the retail sector once
that has been ring-fenced and separated. The purpose of ring-fencing is
therefore self-evident. There should be, in consequence of its
importance, a reserve power—a compulsory power to enforce
ring-fencing to the extent thought necessary to protect the public
interest. Why? Without that power, the flurry of legal activity will go
on for years. The ultimate threat that society will have through a
reserve power is, “If you are not reasonable, you will suffer
the consequence”. Any commercial negotiation would seek to
introduce a long-stop protection, and that is what a reserve power
does, creating no injustice and no concern to responsible banking.
Ring-fencing should come
in.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072465000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0002.htm#13072465000023">I turn now
to personal liability of directors and senior persons. It is important
for the Government and their advisers, as well as this House, to
realise how the industry and its lawyers will investigate ring-fencing
and personal liability. They will first look to whether there are
statutory duties for directors, as in the most recent Companies Act.
Secondly, they will look to regulatory rules that require specific
behaviour. They will then look to the
specific—specific—consequences that will follow from a
breach of duty or failure to  
<?notus-xml column=1375?>obey the rules. Duty, regulation, consequences: that will be their
analysis. This Bill should reflect that state of reality in terms of
enforcing a Bill of this
kind.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072465000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0002.htm#13072465000024">The role
of lawyers that I have described will be followed by potential judicial
review, first against the Treasury, secondly against the regulator,
thirdly against any other statutory body or decision-making entity
created by orders that flow from this Act, and also by attention from
the insurance industry to the D&amp;O liability of directors in
banking, the premiums for which could become extremely high. All that
will flow in any event. We should prepare for that now by making the
Bill as clear as we can in
Committee.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072465000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0002.htm#13072465000025">Lastly,
I turn to competition. The Government have said that they want this
Bill and other action to promote competition, especially in the retail
sector; to create, as Vickers wanted, a challenger bank—I
underline challenger—to the existing banking system: not a small
bank of moderate size with branches only in the tens or twenties, but
hundreds of branches of significant size that will compete with the
biggest banks. How do the Government suggest that this Bill, with any
ancillary policies, will promote such a challenger bank? If there is no
solution to that at this stage, then as the noble Baroness, Lady
Kramer, predicted, it could be a generation before a new bank emerges
through organic growth—if
then.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072465000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0002.htm#13072465000026">The
European Commission ordered Lloyds to divest itself of 630 branches
about four years ago. The time to implement that divestment will run
out in three months or so. As far as is known, Lloyds has not yet
applied for an extension and it runs out in November or December, I
think. So getting into the fifth year from the European requirement,
maybe we will have an IPO. Floating an IPO for a bank in the present
circumstances is not an easy commercial task. If it does not work,
where will the challenger bank come from? If it does work through an
IPO, it will be pretty well dependent on the existing Lloyds structure
for information technology and systems for a long time to come. If the
House will forgive me, a “Son of Lloyds Bank” is not a
new challenger
bank.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072465000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0002.htm#13072465000027">This is
serious stuff if with this Bill it appears that we change the law to
finish up with the same big four and the same system, except for
ring-fencing, with no serious competition. That is not really what the
public are entitled to expect.</hs_para>

Bill is an enormous task for Ministers and all the House. The final
Bill requires three particular characteristics. The first is clarity.
Everybody will look at what they are required to do and what the
consequences are if they do not do it, both in ring-fencing and in
personal liability.
You<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T19:33:10"></hs_TimeCode> cannot avoid
clarity and—as the noble Lord, Lord Stewartby, pointed
out—with this complexity it is no good hoping that the Minister,
doing his best with Treasury help, might at some stage tell us what he
thinks an ambiguity in the text really means. The last time I argued in
the House of Lords Judicial Committee—now the Supreme
Court—this principle of what the Minister said, I was accused by
one of the noble and learned Lords of a tedious exercise in what he
called legislative archaeology. It is an utter waste
of  
<?notus-xml column=1376?>time. The Bill should say what it means and mean what it says. That is
our job, especially after such a crisis. Clarity is a high aspiration,
but a necessary one.
</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072465000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0002.htm#13072465000029">Secondly,
there should be coherence. We have a Bill, statutory orders and the
regulatory authority, and will probably have codes of conduct and
banking standards—a proliferation of different modes of
behaviour. They have to fit in with each other. The absence of
interrelation is what the lawyers and bankers will look for. So we need
clarity, coherence and finally common sense. Do not those who have
£6 trillion in a society have a responsibility to treat
themselves as being in a form of societal partnership with their 50
million customers—the 87% and the 85%? If it is a form of social
partnership, then common sense suggests that both sides should stick
together to make it work. Coherence, clarity, common sense are what we
need.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072465000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0002.htm#13072465000030">If we
pass this Bill in much of its present form, how will anybody know how
to find out about this reform? They would have to superimpose the
present Bill on at least two other statutes and extract as best they
could from the superimposition a notional generic Bill for banking
reform, which would be an extremely difficult task. It is not too late
and it is not about starting again, but about a revision of
presentation. It is not too late to state principles with schedules of
consequential amendments to other legislation to inform an
understanding of this major
legislation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072465000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0002.htm#13072465000031">I
finish where I started. The Bill is of such importance. If society
cannot trust its banks what on earth can it trust? It is of such
importance to the Government and to this House that we have to take
real, reasonable and hard-working steps to get this right. On this side
of the House I am sure that we will look to co-operate with all others.
It seems to be left to us to ensure the protection of the people in
banking for the future. Let us get it

Earl of Caithness:</Member></B> My Lords, this is indeed a hugely
important Bill. It is one to which everyone looks to correct the
position in which we found ourselves in 2008, when people genuinely
feared that they were going to lose their deposits. They hope that at
the end of this Bill they will be in the position that the right
reverend Prelate quoted: that the banks in the UK will keep us up there
as the world’s financial centre, while protecting the ordinary
working person. I fear that the Bill as presented to us will not take

are two main reasons for that. One has to look at the reasons for the
2008 crisis. The bulk of that crisis was due to a structural banking
problem. It  was not so much the bankers’ fault; you
cannot blame the bankers for doing what legislation or law allows them
to do. However, we were all surprised and  even glad that the
report on HBOS showed that the incompetence of bankers within a
structural banking system was also a major
problem<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T19:40:24"></hs_TimeCode>. We can
tackle  one of the major structural problems of banks, and not
by changing them too dramatically, because  they have two main
functions. One is the storage and distribution of depositors’
money and the other is the investment of money seeking
investment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T19:40:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

<?notus-xml column=1377?><hs_para UID="13072469000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0002.htm#13072469000003">The huge figures that
the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, gave to us a moment ago underline the
problem, which is that the deposit belongs to the bank the moment that
you make it. The moment the money is paid into the bank it is no longer
yours. Most people in the country believe that when they make a deposit
to a bank it is still theirs. Two judicial decisions in 1811 and 1848
changed that, and banking became legalised theft, as I call it. It was
a move to take away people’s money. The noble Lord, Lord
Hollick, put it well when he said that it is getting other
people’s money  to work for you. It requires more than a
change of culture to change that in banks; to allow people to retain
control of their deposits requires a change in the law. If that
happens, the banks will, quite rightly, charge for the storage and
distribution of that deposit, but it will allow you, as the depositor,
to say, “I want that amount on deposit, which will be guaranteed
by the bank, and that amount can be used for investment”. If the
investment arm fails, that is fine—it will not involve the
taxpayer and your deposit is secure.</hs_para>

forward is by changing the structure that banks have used or adopted
themselves to use in the past. We seek to change the removal of title
from their own money for the depositors; we must get ownership of the
deposit back to the depositor. If you merely ring-fence a bank, the
money can be moved within the bank because all the money belongs to the
bank. We do not know the rules for the ring-fencing, but it will not
solve the fundamental problem that the bank owns all the
money<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T19:43:08"></hs_TimeCode>. Banks
should also be allowed to offer equity investments. One of the major
problems we face is debt. If all the banks are allowed to do is to make
more loans, all you will do is create more debt. As Stephen Cecchetti

said:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13072469000178" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0002.htm#13072469000178">“Debt

is no doubt in my mind that we are heading for another banking

part of its problem. There are too many banks; some have had to close
as part of restructuring and no doubt a lot more will do so as the

opening speech of the noble Lord, Lord Deighton, the Government have
thus far ducked the radical banking reform required, which the
cross-party Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards called for
over the course of five detailed and compelling reports. Perhaps that
should not surprise too many, because the Government have failed to
stand up to the banks on key issues, including the safety of major
institutions, boosting choice for consumers, increasing financial
inclusion, the high-risk, high-bonus culture and stimulating economic

the recommendations of the Independent Commission on Banking on
structure, capital and loss absorbency, with certain exceptions, and
the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards was established last
year, after the Chancellor came under pressure to hold an inquiry into
the industry after the LIBOR-rigging scandal. The commission was also
asked to conduct pre-legislative scrutiny of the draft Bill, and this
led, not surprisingly, to an expectation that the commission’s

electrification. The risk of the shock of separation would be an
essential incentive to improve behaviour. He also said that it was

giving regulators powers to call for the separation of retail and
investment banks, and described their decision to ignore measures to
clamp down on banks engaging in risky trading as

is an area in which I believe that the Bill might usefully be amended.
Indeed, it links very much with the startling report in today’s

see the announcement of GDP growth of around 0.5% for the second
quarter of the year, and that is to be very much welcomed. But it

districts. That shocking statistic confirms widespread fears that,
despite various tranches of quantitative easing and encouragement from
the Chancellor, lenders are failing to support a key potential area of
economic growth. British Bankers Association data show that, on a
regional level, lending has fallen in every area of Britain, in all
nine regions of England as well as in Scotland and Wales. But the
postcode breakdown was published only reluctantly by the banks, and it
is understood that the Government have used the threat of legislation

2011-12, with around 8 million new loans. Your Lordships

is all pretty depressing, but the real situation may be much worse. The
Government have no plans to monitor stock of payday lending until the
FCA takes over in April next year, when they will think about it. This
seems wrong. I can confirm to the noble Lords, Lord Higgins and Lord
Watson of Invergowrie, that the Government have announced today that
they have arranged for the banks to publish disaggregated lending
figures by postcode quarterly from December this year. Why cannot we do
exactly the same for payday lending? We will certainly look to amend

even more worrying than lack of accurate and timely data is the
Government’s ambivalence about the whole sector. I understand
their concerns about driving borrowers to loan sharks, but the fact is
that there is a successful model already well established of imposing
strict limitations on payday lenders. In Florida, the state strictly
regulates payday loans. There is a maximum borrowing limit of $500 at
any one time. You can have only one loan outstanding, and this is
tracked and enforced by a state-wide database of all loans taken out.
The maximum fee is 10% plus a $5 verification fee, with no
rollovers without having paid off the previous loan and a wait of 24
hours before applying for a new one. The software that does all this is
available for implementation in the UK right now. I am sure we will
want to consider in Committee the merits of having a similar regime in
the

second area of concern is to do with the regulation of central counter

probably cost only between £25 million and £50 million to
develop new, better, faster, more comprehensive payment systems. But
because the banks’ IT systems are essentially clapped out and
starved of investment, it would cost each bank hundreds of millions to
upgrade its systems to implement new services. Of course, in any really
competitive, customer-focused market, at least one bank would do just
this, but our big banks are not competitive and certainly not customer
focused and they do not do any of this. They do not even invest in
their current IT systems enough to stop them falling
over<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T20:06:56"></hs_TimeCode>. This is
cartel-like behaviour—and I will return to the issue of
competition in more detail in a
moment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T20:07:02"></hs_TimeCode>. The fact
is that the banks should not own or control the payments system, and we
need to fix that. I think I heard the Minister say that the Government
will bring forward amendments to do just that, which is very welcome. I
look forward to discussing those amendments when they appear in
Committee.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13072469000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0002.htm#13072469000041">Before<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T20:07:25"></hs_TimeCode>
I leave the financial plumbing system, I would like to touch briefly on
the issue of account portability. There has been progress on this. The
new current account switching service will be available from September
and mobile to mobile payments from 2014. This is a good thing as far as
it goes. But, again, the fact is that we could do much better without
the cartel-like involvement of the big banks. For example, under the
proposed account switching arrangements, know your customer checks will
still have to be carried out by the new bank, as the noble Lord, Lord
Flight, said. This will delay switching for many retail accounts and is
virtually certain to delay switching for all SME accounts. It need not
be like this. Know your customer checks could be the responsibility of
the plumbing system of a newly liberated VocaLink, and so could all the
details of direct debits and other payments. How nice it would be if
the banks were really forced to compete to service these consumer
packages<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T20:08:19"></hs_TimeCode>. This

many of the previous areas I have mentioned have in common is
competition or, rather, the lack of competition. This is the final area
that I want to talk about. I strongly agree with what the noble Lord,
Lord Eatwell, said on this subject. Our banking system is not even
remotely competitive. Four big banks control more than 80% of the
market, and it is this problem which is a key driver of many of our
other problems with the banks’ behaviour—resistance to
change, corruption, criminality and
incompetence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T20:09:01"></hs_TimeCode>. It

<?notus-xml column=1385?>is worth reminding ourselves, very briefly, of the most recent scandals:
the collapse of HBOS; the fixing of LIBOR; the involvement of Standard
Chartered and HSBC in sanctions-busting and drug money laundering; the
failure of the RBS payment systems last summer; and, last week,
Barclays being fined half a billion dollars in the United States for

these are not the worst things. The very worst scandal, an almost
unbelievably bad scandal, is the mis-selling of PPI policies. This
scandal was the worst for three reasons. First, it was absolutely huge.
The banks are going to have to pay at least £16 billion, and
perhaps £30 billion, to settle the claims made against them.
Secondly, it was not just one bank; it was lots of banks. But, most of
all, it is worst because it was deliberate exploitation of their
customers. It is worth quoting what John Lanchester recently said in
the LRB about the PPI scandal. He
said:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13072469000184" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0002.htm#13072469000184">“PPI
was about banks breaking trust by exploiting their customers, not
accidentally but as a matter of deliberate and sustained policy. They
sold policies which they knew did not serve the ends they were supposed
to serve and in doing so, treated their customers purely as an
extractive
source”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="13072469000170" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0002.htm#13072469000170">The
PPI scandal is the clearest possible indication that the banks do not
have their customers’ interests at heart—the opposite

competitive banking landscape and have made important moves to produce
this. In particular, it will be easier to set up new banks and this
will help. They would like to see the equivalent of the Sparkasse here
in the UK. That would help, too. P2P lending may also help, although I
should say in passing that I am very alarmed to see Santander muscling
in on Funding Circle. It is very hard to see how this would increase
diversity in our banking landscape. But all this is very small and very
gradual. It would take decades and decades before any of this had any

banks themselves offer two sorts of solutions. One is better, more
ethical cultures and better, more ethical leadership. However, it is
hard to be convinced that this would be sufficient. At the time that
HSBC was busting UN sanctions and laundering drug money, it had an
Anglican clergyman in charge of it. The other solution is better
regulation. The Government agree with this and in this Bill and in the
Financial Services Act put enormous faith in the ability of smarter,
stricter regulation to help solve the problem. I am convinced that
regulation will help a great deal but I am equally convinced that on
its own it will not solve the problem. In fact, I do not think the
problem with our banks can be solved unless we make them really
competitive and really focused on serving their customers. How we might
do this, we will want to discuss in detail as the Bill progresses, but
we do need to do something radical. At the moment, our banks are too
big to fail,

the Minister said, the Banking Bill will introduce a ring-fence around
the deposits of people and small businesses to separate the high street

will make sure that the new Prudential Regulation Authority can hold
banks to account for the way that they separate their retail and
investment activities, giving it powers to enforce the full separation
of individual banks. It will give depositors protected under the
Financial Services Compensation Scheme preference if a bank enters

fear that I may be in a minority but, overall, I approve of the Bill. A
lot of preparation has gone into it. The Government should be commended

Commission on Banking Standards—the PCBS—the members of

Government—correctly, in my view—have not gone overboard
in taking on all the suggestions, particularly of the latter report. In
this debate the one thing that we seem to have ignored is the fact that
banks have to remain competitive internationally. Until Glass-Steagall
is reinstated in the US, we will not be on the same playing field as
other international banks if we go down the route of total separation.

in a little more detail. The first item was the leverage ratio.

competition within the banking sector; restructure the banks concerned,

British Bankers’ Association, in its briefing for Second Reading
in this House, is generally in favour of the Bill. It says that
secondary legislation, as many other speakers have said, will be
critical in determining whether a ring-fenced bank can be organised in
an orderly and effective manner and whether it will be capable of
providing a suite of services to households and businesses consistent
with the principles originally set out by the ICB. Notwithstanding the
need to ensure that the ring-fence is suitably robust, there is also a
need to ensure that banking services in support of business, such as
simple hedging and trade finance, can be provided in a cost-effective
manner. So far, four statutory instruments have been produced. At first
sight these appear to address some of the concerns raised by the
industry and others, for instance in terms of the ability of
ring-fenced banks to provide hedging 
<?notus-xml column=1389?>services and trade finance to their clients. There appear, however, to
be significant gaps in the services that can be provided in support of

the objective of the group restructuring powers are understood,
including the independence of decision-making criteria, it will be
important to ensure that this is compatible with the statutory duty of
directors under Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006. The structural
reorganisation of a banking group to bring about ring-fencing is likely
to involve relying on the banking business-transfer regime and the
revised Part VII of the Financial Services and Markets Act for the
transfer of tens of millions of accounts and contracts. Key to this is
ensuring that the revised provisions are suitably scoped and the
procedures involved compatible with an orderly transition to

conclusion, I once again express my support for the Bill. Of course,
all these measures do not come without significant cost to the banks.
According to the Government’s impact assessment, ring-fencing
and depositor preference are expected to impose transitional and
ongoing costs on UK banks. The Government estimate the ongoing costs to
be in the range of no less than between £2 billion and £5
billion per year, with one-off transitional cost of between of
£1.5 billion and £2 billion. The individual customer
and/or small business will have to bear these costs. However, I hope
that the benefit will be increased financial stability. No one should
underestimate how close the UK banking system came to collapse in 2008,
and this can never be allowed to happen

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, it is always interesting to follow the
noble Lord, Lord Northbrook, in these financial services debates. I
regard him as one of the more articulate and deft defenders of the
status quo in the banking system. He may have slightly wrong-footed
himself by quoting Bob Diamond at an early stage but the noble Lord
nevertheless sets out the

different perspective. I want to introduce in this debate the view of
the customers of banking services—whether we are talking about
individual deposit-holders, like most of us; those who are seeking a
mortgage or a bit more credit; the middling businessman who is looking
for a little help in expanding their business or some support for their
forward business plan; or, as some noble Lords have mentioned, the
roughly 20% of our population who are effectively excluded from the
services of the mainstream banking sector. I regret to say that I agree
with my noble friend Lord McFall, who is not in his place, that the
lesson of the past few years is that consumers, whichever category they
fall into, have been at the bottom of the

from a very serious financial crisis affecting pretty much all the
globe and which was started in the banking sector. In this country and
in this House, this is the fourth major piece of financial legislation
that we have had to consider since that collapse of the system. At the
time of government intervention by introducing a degree of state
ownership in the banking sector, I probably had slightly better
institutional consumer credentials than I have now because I have
retired from that role, but I can recall—not in a partisan way
but just to say to the Minister—when my noble friend Lord
Mandelson was in his place advocating those emergency powers, that I
argued that within 18 months of the state acquisition of two of our
largest oligopolies there should be, within that statute, a clear
commitment to refer to the competition authorities the whole structure
of the UK banking system.</hs_para>

four bits of legislation, the Vickers commission and the Parliamentary
Commission on Banking Standards, not all of whose recommendations
appear in this Bill, as noble Lords have said, we are left
with—and are likely to continue to be left with—a
structure of banking that is extraordinarily similar, apart from the
public ownership bit, to the structure that was there before the 2008
crash. As for the customers, they are left with a rather less
responsive and sensitive
service<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T20:30:28"></hs_TimeCode>. There
is less competition in the banking system than there was then. There is
less sensitivity to individual account holders and individual
businessmen who go to their local bank managers. More of the risk has
been shifted from the banks to the taxpayer and bank customers. We have
not moved forward from 2008.</hs_para>

we have moved from an opportunity, in the face of that financial
catastrophe, to have a serious, comprehensive reassessment of the
banking structure in this country. We have gone from a position that
considered total separation of investment banking from commercial and
retail banking to the Vickers commission proposal for a strong
ring-fenced position and then to one that is a pretty weak ring-fencing
proposition with or without the additional electrification that the

a few barbarians within the banking sector and the stipulations in this
Bill, even if enhanced by further amendments by the Minister, are
unlikely to stop them. We have an oligopoly in banking. The banks are
too big to fail and too big, as the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, and

the three groups of customers to whom I have referred, how does that

the Bank of England was created. They face a reduction in personal
services from their local bank manager and an increase in charges. That
has resulted in the financial ombudsman reporting in the past couple of
weeks a 179% annual increase in the number of complaints.
Some of those relate to the mega crisis of PPI, but half are general
complaints about the banking system. On the ground, there are fewer

the point of view of small or medium-sized business, my noble friend
Lord Watson, who is not in his seat at the moment, has stolen my fire.
There is a report in today’s paper that the net increase in
lending to small firms in the last available year was negative. There
is a £4.5 billion reduction in lending from the banking sector
to small firms in a period when the deposits from small firms in those
very same banks increased by £7.8 billion. Is that a service to

better regulation of the banking system. The Government, with support
from the City and elsewhere in the financial pages, are deeply
resistant to Brussels innovation in regulation of the financial sector.
From the other end—not the bankers’ but the business
customers’ end—does the average small and medium-sized
business in Britain get a better service than in Germany? Has that been
the position in Germany for the past 60 years, never mind
more recently, where small and growing businesses can go to the
regional and co-operative banks for a personal service? Their
advancements are based on their business plans. That includes not only
the smaller companies but the all-important Mittelstand in the German

managers, the computer says no. That is what a lot of our business
customers face. The right reverend Prelate and others said that there

outside the banking system—is one that the Government, on a

the amendment of my noble friend Lord Mitchell to the previous
Financial Services Bill. Roughly 20% of the population either do not
have banking facilities or have such basic banking facilities that they
can never acquire credit or sophisticated services from the banking
system. So what happens to them? They go to Wonga—the noble
Baroness, Lady Kramer, referred to this earlier—or to pay-day

springing up around the country, or, even worse, they go to illegal

other sectors where we have an oligopoly and a regulator who is
supposed to operate in the interests of consumers—whether we are
talking about energy, water or telecoms, with all their
shortcomings—there is something close to a universal obligation.
This is because it is recognised in an oligopoly that they are vital to
economic and societal needs. In the banking sector there is no such

noble friend Lord McFall referred to the previous system of regulation

have a new regulator, the FCA, and we have yet to see how it will

need a more competitive structure, but the Bill as it stands is more
likely to consolidate the existing structure than it is to challenge
it. We need to ensure that during the Bill’s passage through the
House we improve on that situation. I appreciate that there are
statutory instruments to come, but I am not holding my breath that they
will create a more positive, proactive direction to the banking sector

of the problem is psychological. For a long period, we have regarded
the banking sector and the City of London as being the apex of our
economy. That is seriously wrong and damaging to our economy. The
banking sector should be a service to our economy and to our consumers,
both business and domestic. I appreciate and accept that further
legislation will deal with the standards issue and that there will be
secondary legislation under the Bill. I appreciate also that there is

appreciate, as the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, said, that we cannot deal
with this overnight. However, the reality is that we have had five
years since the financial crisis and there is still enormous unmet need
in both business and society for effective services by our banking
sector. I regret to say that the Bill is unlikely to meet 
<?notus-xml column=1393?>that unmet need or to take us very far down the road of so doing. I hope
that in the period of consideration that the House now has before it we
will improve its ability, but the framework of the Bill is seriously
limiting and I do not have great hope that we will improve it
substantially. However, improve it we must. The Government must
recognise that there will be a serious problem both for our society and
our economy if the banking sector continues to fail
us.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-24?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_24_PT_1/AFD091BC33AFE2BC3CABF7C53A5107FA5E7EF397" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 24 July 2013">Wednesday,

economy suffered. The Financial Services Act 2012 was part one of this
Government’s response to the structural changes that they argued
needed to be made. The Act abolished the FSA and established the PRA

this side of the House, we argue strongly—and let us face it,
there seems to be absolute consensus on this point—that a fuller
Bill is needed in response to the crisis and the banking standards. The
Bill needs to address cultural flaws in the industry.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T20:26:01"></hs_TimeCode> acknowledge
that cultural change cannot easily be legislated for, but several
legislative steps could make a difference and should be
included<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T20:49:30"></hs_TimeCode>. We
believe that that there needs to be a proper fiduciary duty—a
duty of care—on banks to operate prudently and to safeguard
deposits. Individual responsibilities need to be clearly defined and
appropriate criminal sanctions put in
place<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T20:49:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

noble friend Lord Brennan spelt out how the industry will respond to
the Bill when it comes into force. It will be about personal
responsibility and consequences, and we have to think through how we
shape the legislation. For instance, we are going down the difficult
route of reverse assumption—in the sense of guilt and the need
to create a defence. This is a difficult area but we did it in the
Bribery Act and there are one or two other examples in legislation.
However, it will have to be carefully
structured<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T20:50:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

addressing the proper focus of the banking industry, it is time to look
seriously at remuneration. The giving of grossly inflated bonus
settlements while the majority of households and individuals in the
middle continue to feel squeezed is not a scenario that we should
comfortably see continue. We need to force bankers to think of their
customers and of the consequences of their actions. We need a more
long-termist approach, which could include powers to require elements
of remuneration to be deferred for up to 10 years. To engender
responsible behaviour, we need to look at professional standards in the
banking industry and at whether bankers should be licensed. We need the
confidence in our bankers that professional standards regimes have
provided in other
sectors<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T20:51:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

there was a third pillar to this—the whole issue of culture.
Many noble Lords touched on that. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop
of Birmingham talked about the human or almost spiritual value in the
culture. I cannot quite find the right word but perhaps we could refer
to “human standards” in the culture. My noble friend Lord
McFall talked about regulatory capture in the culture. In pondering
this issue, I asked myself when it was that banking was great. It was
great when it was based on trust. What do we mean by trust? We mean a
willingness to trade in complete contracts because you know that the
counterparty will not let you down.
That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T20:53:07"></hs_TimeCode> trust
completely disappeared in the crisis, and that is why banks stopped
trading with each other almost overnight. Rebuilding a culture that
works is a really difficult challenge. What do we have on the table so
far? We  
<?notus-xml column=1396?>have incentives through getting the remuneration right; we have
regulations, which we know are difficult to get right in a holistic
way; and we have fear—the fear of going to jail. We have to talk
this over at considerable length, and we have to see what other shots
are in our locker.</hs_para>

issue that I certainly hope that we will look at is whether there can
be more transparency. In many ways, transparency is a useful prop for a
trusting culture. When people are seen doing things by their
counterparties, wider society or regulators with a great deal more
clarity and openness than is the case now, they behave differently. We
will certainly want to probe whether transparency might be added to the
list. It could be transparency in relations, remuneration and
trade<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T20:54:00"></hs_TimeCode>.

the PCBS’s proposals that the Competition and Markets Authority
immediately begins a full-market study of competition in the retail and

other interested parties, as to how we structure this. Whether we like
it or not, many of the debates in Committee will be “Second

them to outline them in context and for them to be challenged within
that wider context. It will probably be a good idea for us to discuss
how to do that away from the Floor of the House, but it will be a big
challenge to create the right structure to discuss the very wide areas
that have been discussed. There are the real-economy consequences, the
new investment vehicles and the points made by the noble Earl, Lord

made by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, and, I think, by my noble friend
Lord Brennan, about the sheer density of the material in front of us.
The noble Lord rightly said, “When I went to FiSMA and saw how

sense, because FiSMA has been modified ten times over since the copy he
got from the Printed Paper Office. We need help from the Government on
this. I believe it is called a Keeling schedule—they put one on
the web for the Financial Services Act. I urge them to do that early

will impact, frankly, on how we do business in the United Kingdom for

briefly where we will be coming from. The noble Lord, Lord Northbrook,
set out the Opposition’s position reasonably accurately—I
thank him very much for that; it saves me having to do it. The position
in many areas of the Bill is a spectrum with a series of strands. The
spectrum goes from light-touch regulation at one end to detailed,
prescriptive, heavy-handed regulation at the other. Light-touch
regulation did not work. It did not work here or in the US and we know
that it has to be changed. Let us face it, the vast majority of the
western world believed it was the solution. There are some people who
can genuinely say that they said, “This is too
hazardous”, all the way through, but they are very few. Many of
us said, “It is working, it is producing the money,
great”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072469000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0002.htm#13072469000100">That
is one end of the spectrum. I described the other end of the spectrum.
In many ways the Banking Commission tried to be at the consensual
centre of the spectrum, where it was optimal. We will bring forward
amendments, probably between the Banking Commission recommendations and
the more detailed end; we will be at the more intrusive end, probably.
We will do that believing that it is a good place to be. We will be a
listening Opposition, because there is so much expertise and depth of
knowledge in this House on this subject. We want to see how those
amendments fare and what counter-amendments come forward. We will look
to form consensus with other Members of this House—with the
Back-Benchers of other parties and the Cross Benches—and we
hope, through the process of debate, to draw the Government into that
consensus. At the end of the day, this Bill really needs the support
and wisdom of all parts of the House. The Lords will work
constructively in a cross-party way to ensure that the Government
deliver a good Bill—or, if they do not, that Parliament
will.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-24?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_24_PT_1/4A34789D06BA51F88E5A5719509B03E5928BCBBE" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 24 July 2013">Wednesday,

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank all noble Lords who have spoken
in the debate this evening, particularly members of the Parliamentary
Commission on Banking Standards—not so much for their
contributions tonight, excellent though they were, but for the
phenomenal amount of work they did on the commission. For months on end
it was impossible to discuss anything with my noble friend Lady Kramer
because she was 
<?notus-xml column=1398?>either in a meeting, just going to one or in the middle of reading great
piles of stuff. I know they did a huge amount of work. I share the
views expressed by my noble friend Lord Lawson and others about the
extraordinary leadership that Andrew Tyrie gave in driving that process
forward.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072469000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0002.htm#13072469000102">I
believe the Bill has been marked by a readiness on the
Government’s part to listen and respond to a wide range of
views. The Government have already made a series of amendments to the
Bill in response to the recommendations of the PCBS and have shown
willing to keep listening and to fine-tune their provisions as the
debate on these issues continued to unfold. We will make further
changes to the Bill in this House in response to the constructive
debates in another place and here, in particular on the firm-specific
electrification power. We will also introduce amendments to implement
the recommendations of the PCBS’s final report on culture and
standards.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072469000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0002.htm#13072469000103">The
debate today has confirmed the broad consensus and strength of feeling
across the House about the great significance of the measures contained
in this Bill and those shortly to be added to it. In the time available
now, I cannot deal with every issue that noble Lords raised. Indeed,
some issues went significantly further than the Bill itself. Of course,
we will return to all these issues in Committee. Many of the principal
issues mentioned by a number of noble Lords were first raised by the

he did.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072469000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0002.htm#13072469000104">There
has been a lot of discussion about whether this is a watering-down as
opposed to an enabling Bill in terms of what it contains. There are
many further, detailed provisions to be made to implement the changes
and we have taken the view that these are not all most suitably dealt
with in primary legislation. That is why there is a lot of material to
be done in secondary legislation. A lot of the detailed rules will be
made by the PRA. I hope that we are able during the course of debates
to explain how we see some of those being implemented in detail but the
principle of having much of the regulation done by secondary
legislation was agreed by the parliamentary
commission.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072469000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0002.htm#13072469000105">The

simple way of getting to the state that most noble Lords would like,

Chancellor commissioned an FSA review of barriers to entry and
expansion in the banking sector and the result of that review, in
answer to the noble Lord, Lord Northbrook, is that for new banks we
could see capital requirements fall by up to 80% over what was
previously required. This is a big change and one of the many

branches subject to regulation and supervision in the home state, so UK
branches of EU banks would not be subject to UK regulation or to
ring-fencing, as the noble Lord said. The presence of EEA banks in the
UK market at the moment is very small and we believe that domestic
banks enjoy a strong home advantage, so there is not likely to be
significant arbitrage. However, EU law has within it provisions to
ensure that institutions cannot simply move to avoid regulation. We and

point out that the Government’s proposal, based on the Basel
process, is that we would have a statutory minimum leverage level
across the piece. However, the regulators already have the power to set
a different leverage ratio for individual institutions, as we have
already seen in the way that they have looked at Barclays and

return to Parliament with new primary legislation. However, given that
it is a separate policy—not the same policy with a bit tacked
on—we do not believe that the proposals in the Bill will be a

ban on prop trading in addition to the ring-fence. I can confirm that a

Lords will know, the Armed Forces Act 2006 provides for the
disciplinary system of the Armed Forces wherever in the world they are
serving. The Act contains many important provisions, but perhaps the
most important ones are the duty to obey lawful commands and the
mechanism for enforcing that duty. Without those provisions, the Armed
Forces would be unable to continue as a disciplined force, and the
practical effect of not continuing the Act would be that the Armed
Forces, as we know and admire them, would cease to exist.</hs_para>

now turn to the new alcohol regulations. Currently, under the Armed
Forces Act 2006, an offence is committed if a person subject to service
law is, due to the influence of alcohol or drugs, unfit to be entrusted
with any duty they may reasonably be called on to perform or their
behaviour is disorderly or likely to bring discredit to Her
Majesty’s forces. Tests for alcohol and drugs can be
administered only after a serious incident. There is, however, no power
to test an individual in the services before an incident where it is
suspected that he or she may be under the influence of drugs or
alcohol. Our aim is to provide commanding officers greater powers to
deal with unfitness for duty through alcohol or drugs by allowing them
to take action early, before an incident occurs.</hs_para>

Armed Forces Act 2011 provides for the testing of persons subject to
service law where they are suspected either of being over a set alcohol
limit or of being unfit through drink or drugs to carry out any
safety-critical duty. It created a framework for doing this based
broadly on the provisions in the Railways and Transport Safety Act
2003. That Act provides an alcohol and 
<?notus-xml column=1404?>drug testing regime in the civilian professional shipping and aviation
environments. The services, however, are exempt from the provisions of
that regime. We are not removing the current exemption from the 2003
Act. Instead we are introducing a bespoke scheme for the services. This
is a further step to ensure that personnel conducting safety-critical
activities are not impaired by alcohol or drugs. This will run
alongside the compulsory drug testing
programme.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072469000138" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0003.htm#13072469000138">The
2011 Act amends the 2006 Act to create a new offence with regard to the
amount of alcohol a person subject to service law can have in their
breath, blood or urine in relation to prescribed safety-critical
duties. The regulations we are considering today prescribe those
safety-critical duties to which a specific alcohol limit is to apply,
and the related alcohol limits for breath, blood or urine. To be
specified as a duty to which a particular limit will apply, a duty must
be such that performing it while impaired by alcohol or drugs will

regulations set out two levels of alcohol for the testing of breath,
blood or urine in relation to prescribed safety-critical duties. The
majority of safety-critical duties fall into the higher alcohol levels.
These mirror the alcohol limits for drink-driving in criminal law under
the Road Traffic Act 1988. That is a recognised and easily understood
benchmark. Lower alcohol levels are set for those duties that require a
heightened speed of reaction in an emergency situation, such as
aviation or carrying a loaded weapon. Such duties demand that personnel
should have no ingested alcohol in their body on commencement of the
duty. This recognises that even small amounts of alcohol in a
person’s system can have a detrimental effect on his ability to
perform such duties. However, I should say that a small tolerance level
is allowed because in some people small amounts of alcohol occur
naturally in their

have been involved in the world of work and alcohol since I learnt to
fly in a university air squadron in the 1960s. We were still in the
grip of a post-war tradition; alcohol and being part of the force were
closely linked. Yes, you did not fly when you had been drinking, but
virtually all the rest of the time, every evening, alcohol was part of
that world. That was true in my early career as a pilot—once
again, we had rules about drinking—but in the industrial
relations world I lived in an enormous amount of business was done in
an alcohol environment. I went into the oil world and the situation was
the same. There was nothing special about me. I cannot claim that I did
not enjoy it. That was the world we lived in. If you were trailing jet
fuel you drank over dinner and in many social situations. It was how
business was
done<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T21:32:36"></hs_TimeCode>. Looking
back on it, it was wrong, in the sense that alcohol modifies how you
make judgments and decisions, and you make better decisions when
alcohol is averred. However, it is very difficult to change cultures
where these behaviours are the norm.</hs_para>

came into the railway industry in the late 1980s, and that had an
alcohol tradition, for want of a better way of describing it. Public
opinion came along and said, “This isn’t right”.
We had the same situation, although, of course, staff would assure one
that they were not under the influence of alcohol when they came to
work. However, public opinion wanted something more, and we, as the
management, saw that grasping that general direction was the right
thing to do. Yes, a piece of legislation came along, but we had a very
successful engagement with our trade unions, which saw that this was
what society expected, and we introduced drug and alcohol testing. To
say that it was traumatic would be too strong, but it was a shock to
the industry. We drove alcohol out of the front line of the industry.
It is interesting that we then recognised how we in the management, who
did not have “critical responsibilities” at the time, had
to follow suit. We had to set an
example<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T21:34:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072470000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0003.htm#13072470000004">This
will be, if I read it right, a shock to the services. It will need to
be handled very sensitively by the chain of command and it will need a

interesting that you cannot even get a private pilot’s licence
now without passing a paper which, although it is not called
“alcohol management”, is all about being fit for duty and

not feel “done to”, and that they recognise the value of
a change of culture. I am not suggesting that they have not been
changing their culture, but this specification is very clear and makes
the direction of travel absolutely clear. It will require some people

Rosser:</Member></B> My Lords, it is interesting to note that there are
now as many officials in the Box as there are Members of your
Lordships’ House present. We have no issues with either of these
measures. Debating the continuation order is an annual event, because,
as the Minister said, it is necessary to enable the Armed Forces Act
2006 to continue in force for a further year, rather than expiring on 2
November this
year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T21:36:55"></hs_TimeCode>. It would
therefore be entirely legitimate, in a debate on that order, to raise
just about any issue relating to our Armed Forces. However, I shall go
to the other extreme and say very little. I raised in a debate on an
earlier continuation order the question of whether, if the order were
not passed, that would mean that there was no statutory basis or
parliamentary authority for our Armed Forces, and the Minister
responded to me on that point in writing at the
time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T21:37:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Memorandum refers to the recently introduced single system of service
law. We recently had a debate on an order that provided for a reduction
in the number of lay members sitting on a more serious case, and having
to pass sentence where the defendant was pleading guilty. I raised a
number of questions, to which the noble Lord has also responded to me
in writing. I thank him for his usual and continuing courtesy, and the
trouble he takes to reply to the points—at times not an
insignificant number of points—raised both from this Dispatch

may come back to the Minister on his reply on courts martial and
officers who are lay members, largely to seek further information about
how the lay members are selected and what prior training they have had.
I acknowledge the parallel with a civilian jury, who determine guilt or
otherwise, and who have had no prior training—but that does not
apply to those who pass sentence. If I decide to explore that point
further, I will initiate the process either through a written question
or by writing to the

the continuation order, I conclude by expressing appreciation and
gratitude to our Armed Forces for the vital work that they

well-being, and sometimes at the cost of an all too real personal

and comments that I would like to
make<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T21:39:37"></hs_TimeCode>. As my
noble friend Lord Tunnicliffe said, attitudes towards excessive
drinking have changed in recent years, and its unacceptability and
potential consequences both for the drinker and for those with whom
they come in contact directly  or indirectly are more widely
acknowledged. We have seen changes in culture, particularly in the
field of work and employment, including the transport

well remember some years ago being at a lunch attended by many, in a
London hotel, and sitting at the same table as a
number of senior British Rail managers. On tables all around us, some
alcohol was being consumed. The senior British Rail managers had none.
They would all be back at their jobs in the afternoon, and thus on
duty. Being on duty having recently consumed alcohol was no more
permitted for them than it would be for someone on the front line
driving a train or maintaining signalling equipment. Will the Minister
indicate whether the alcohol limits we are talking about in this order
will in reality if not through this order apply to senior military
personnel, including at the very highest level of our Armed Forces?
They, too, make decisions which can have a profound impact on those
they command, including on their safety, as well as on the security of
this country, and on costs and finances. The fact that the impact of
the decisions that they make may not always become obvious immediately
should in no way detract from the requirement that, when they make
those decisions, they should be in a completely fit state to 
do
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072469000148" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0003.htm#13072469000148">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T21:41:30"></hs_TimeCode>
regulations provide for two maximum levels of permissible alcohol
intake, one being much lower than the other. It would be helpful if the
Minister could say why it has been felt desirable to have two different
levels, rather than simply one—namely, the lower
level—which would apply to all those duties listed here being
undertaken. They are all safety critical, and judgment and reactions
can be impaired by alcohol. I assumed something that the Minister
confirmed, that the reason there is not zero tolerance in respect of
alcohol limits is that it appears possible for two people who have had,
or, more relevantly, have not had, alcohol, to produce different
readings which, certainly in respect of meeting a zero tolerance
standard, could result in an
injustice<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T21:42:25"></hs_TimeCode>. If,
however, we are to have two different levels of alcohol limits related
to the duties being undertaken, it would be helpful if the Minister
could say perhaps a little bit more than is in the Explanatory
Memorandum about the kind of criteria used to determine which duties
should fall in which category of maximum acceptable alcohol
limits.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072469000149" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0003.htm#13072469000149">I
certainly have no intention of asking the Minister to explain why each
duty listed in the order has been put in the category shown in the

is shown in the higher alcohol limit category; so, too, is the duty of
supervising a diver. My understanding is that, if a problem arises for
a diver, the actions and decisions taken, and speed of those decisions
taken by the person supervising that diver, can literally be the
difference between life and death. I simply ask why it was not felt
appropriate to place the duty of supervision of a diver in the much
lower category for maximum acceptable alcohol

refer to testing procedures, but I assume that the procedures will be
similar to those in respect of a civilian involved in a road accident
or suspected of driving with excess alcohol. If that is the case, would
an individual under these regulations be tested only if they were
suspected of having excess alcohol; or, in respect of some or all of
the duties listed, would there be automatic testing before an 
<?notus-xml column=1408?>individual commenced their duties; or will there be random testing; or
will it be up to the superior officer concerned to
decide what to do in this regard? I am not sure the
extent to which carrying out the duties listed in the regulations with
an alcohol intake in excess of those laid down in these regulations is
an issue at the
moment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T21:44:27"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T21:44:13"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T21:43:32"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T21:43:12"></hs_TimeCode>.
If it is not, the impact of the regulations is likely to be minimal. If
it is an issue, the regulations will need to be introduced and
implemented with a degree of care and thought if we are not to leave
our Armed Forces with a feeling that they are being singled out and
cannot be trusted, as my noble friend Lord Tunnicliffe said.</hs_para>

change, if that is what these regulations are also intended to help
achieve, does not often come quickly or easily. We are, however, all
too aware of the shooting dead of an officer on the submarine HMS
“Astute” in April 2011 by a submariner who was at least
three times over the drink-drive limit while on guard duty. The
submariner had been issued with the SA80 weapon by an officer before
the shooting. The officer said that he was unaware that the submariner
was under the influence of alcohol at the time. The coroner said that
he would recommend random breath testing for Navy personnel. He also
said:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13072469000192" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0003.htm#13072469000192">“Anyone

words should give food for thought. The reality, as we know, is that
someone with a level of alcohol inside them which impairs their ability

colleagues and others who are dependent on them performing those duties
with maximum effectiveness and efficiency for their own safety, and for

Astor of Hever:</Member></B> My Lords, I am very grateful to both noble
Lords for the support they gave to the instruments that we have
considered today. I particularly appreciate the welcome given by the
noble Lord, Lord Tunnicliffe. He and I have discussed this issue in
some detail in the past and I very much respect his views. He speaks

noble Lord said that it is difficult to change attitudes on alcohol. It
is my experience as a defence Minister that there really has been a
cultural change within the Armed Forces. Members of the Armed Forces no
longer have an expectation that drink is appropriate. The Armed Forces

view<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T21:47:43"></hs_TimeCode> on
drugs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072470000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0003.htm#13072470000008">As a

also very much welcome the support given by the noble Lord, Lord
Rosser. I echo the noble Lord’s support for, and appreciation
of, what the Armed Forces do for us all. The noble Lord asked about the
basis of the testing and whether it would be done by breathalyser or
the taking of urine samples. He will have noted that I touched on this
subject in my opening speech. The likelihood is that in most cases the
sample will be of breath, as in the civilian system, but blood or urine
may also be required if necessary. Preliminary tests could be by breath
under Section 93B, preliminary impairment test under Section 93C or a
preliminary drug test under Section 93D. However, the commanding
officer will, of course, have had to make a judgment to refer an
individual for testing, and the service police will decide which test
to
conduct.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072470000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0003.htm#13072470000010">The
noble Lord asked why there were two categories; why not use just
category 2—the stricter one? As I explained in my opening
remarks, the lower limit is set for those duties that demand heightened
reactions, such as when piloting an aircraft or duties that are
particularly hazardous if performed while impaired, such as having a
firearm and ammunition or dealing with explosives. The higher limit is
the limit set in civilian law for drink-driving and is therefore
appropriate to activities that can be carried out safely after
consumption of a small amount of alcohol.</hs_para>

should also say that we considered it important to provide a balance.
On the one hand, we want to allow members of the Armed Forces to relax,
with access to alcohol in moderation, when operational demands allow.
On the other hand, we must ensure safety in operational effectiveness.
Too stringent a regime would be unjustifiably oppressive. We have
therefore only where
necessary<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T21:50:38"></hs_TimeCode>
imposed a limit that amounts to a complete ban for
duties.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072470000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-0003.htm#13072470000012">The
noble Lord asked what the criteria were for categories 1 and 2. I
touched on this in my opening remarks but, for amplification, I should
point out that the higher limit is itself a low limit—the one
set for drink-driving. The lower limit amounts, in effect, to a total
ban on alcohol. We do not wish to impose a total ban unless it is
demanded by the nature of the activity. However, we are not saying that
it is always right for personnel to conduct duties subject to the
higher limit when they are only just under that limit. If there is any
evidence to suggest that personnel are impaired, a commanding officer
can take action under existing provisions relating to unfitness for
duty<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T21:51:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

out that divers come under category 1, while diving supervisors are
also category 1. He asked why they are not category 2. I emphasise that
even the higher limit is not a licence to abuse alcohol. On the
specific point of divers and their supervisors, we have consulted the
services carefully about which duties should be subject to which limit.
Our judgment is that while both activities are safety critical, they do
not fall into the narrow category of activities for which the lower
limit is considered to be necessary. We do not see any need
to treat a supervisor more stringently than the
divers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T21:52:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

touched on the point that the noble Lord, Lord
Tunnicliffe, made about changing attitudes. Members
of the Armed Forces can be considered to be on duty all the time, and
it was therefore essential to provide a balance between allowing
members of the Armed Forces of all ranks to have some relaxation,
subject to the needs of operational effectiveness and especially of
safety. The approach adopted was therefore to focus on duties that are
safety critical. Unfitness or misconduct through use of alcohol or
drugs remains an offence under Section 20(1) of the Armed Forces Act
and covers instances in which service personnel are unable to carry out
their duty, or their behaviour is disorderly or likely to bring
discredit on Her Majesty’s forces. However, we do not want to

not wish to speculate about whether the circumstances of this tragic
case would or could have been different. In future, there will be a
power to test individuals where there is reasonable cause to believe
that a service person is unfit through alcohol or drugs, or has
exceeded the prescribed alcohol limits for safety critical duties. A

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My Lords, we are
considering today the draft of an order to move the date of the local
government elections in England in 2014 from Thursday 1 May to the same
date on which elections will be held across the United Kingdom for the
European Parliament. The elections to the European Parliament in 2014
will be held between 22 and 25 May. In the UK we are
planning to hold these elections on Thursday 22 May, and an order under
Section 4 of the European Parliamentary Elections Act 2002 will be made
in due
course<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T15:46:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the draft order before us today, the 2014 election date for
160-odd principal councils in England would be
moved—that is, all the London boroughs and metropolitan councils
and more than 90 shire and unitary district councils. The order would
also move the elections in around 250 parish councils across England.
In addition, as a result of this order moving the ordinary day of
election, the elections for directly elected mayors to be held in 2014,
in Hackney, Lewisham, Newham, Tower Hamlets and Watford—I feel a
bit like a train announcer here—will also be moved and held at
the same time as the European parliamentary
elections<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T15:47:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072445000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072445000005">This
is an important change. All electors in the UK will be eligible to vote
in the European elections, and 73 Members of the European Parliament
will be returned. More than 23 million people will be voting in the
local elections scheduled for 2014. That is just over 40% of the
electorate. Approximately 4,000 seats on principal councils will be
contested. The order has no effect outside England; in 2014 there are
no local elections for councils in Scotland or, indeed,
Wales<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T15:47:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

among member states, the date of the 2014 European
parliamentary election is being moved from 5 to 8 June to the period of
22 to 25 May. This is to avoid a clash with the Pentecost
holiday, which  
<?notus-xml column=482?>could impact on electors’ availability to vote across member
states. This will therefore mean that the UK European Parliament
election will be held on Thursday 22 May
2014<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T15:48:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072445000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072445000007">It
is appreciated that the arguments about combining local and European
elections are finely balanced, but on this occasion we have decided
that it is right to bring forward this order so that the two elections
can be combined. The Government are clear that, with the European
parliamentary elections on 22 May, just three weeks from the date on
which the local elections would have been held, the case for moving the
date of the local elections and combining them with the European ones
is strong. Were the period between the elections longer, the decision
might be less clear-cut. I stress that this does not necessarily create
a precedent for any future set of
elections<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T15:48:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

must be that we consider the voters’ interests above all other
considerations. If the local election date were not moved, there would
be two elections within three weeks. In such circumstances the balance
of argument, in terms of minimising inconvenience and confusion for
voters and of ensuring that the polls are soundly and efficiently
administered, lies in favour of moving the date of the local elections
and combining the
polls<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T15:49:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072445000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072445000009">I
want to talk through one or two arguments about things that would occur
if we did not hold these elections together. For example,
the start of the European election period will overlap with
the end of the local election period. This could be
confusing for voters —for example, a few days before voting in
the council’s elections, voters might receive a new poll card
with different details for the European election, and postal votes for
the European parliamentary election would be arriving with voters
during the week of polling day at the local elections. Anyone who has
been involved in elections at any level knows the challenges when you
knock on the door and find that people have received different cards
for different
elections<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T15:49:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072445000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072445000010">Another
argument to be put forward is one of resources. As we look at how we
can make savings across the piece, it is important that we look at what
savings can be realised here. There would be increased costs for others
such as political parties and the Electoral Commission in providing
entirely separate voter awareness campaigns if we were not to combine
the two elections; for example, in contacting voters and in canvassing.
The Electoral Commission estimates that holding the 2014 elections
together would save £0.95m from its public awareness campaigns
budget
alone.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072445000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072445000011">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T15:50:33"></hs_TimeCode>
may be difficulty in finding polling stations, as well as in hiring
polling stations and staff. Many schools host polling stations. Would
we be looking to close schools for two days? All these factors I
mention briefly because they strengthen the argument for holding the
two elections
together.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072445000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072445000012">It
is of course true that the procedures become more complex the more
electoral events are held on the same day and the more polls are
combined, but, on balance, this is preferred to the difficulties and
duplication of effort and resource involved in running separate
elections within a few weeks of each other.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=483?><hs_para UID="13072445000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072445000013">In addition, experience
of combined elections is now high among returning officers and we are
confident that the elections will be run successfully together.
European parliamentary elections and local elections have been combined
in the past without undue problems arising, and I see no reason for
that to be different this time. As I have just pointed out, our own
electoral staff are more much competent and can converse effectively
with those who seek guidance on different ballot papers in terms of
what they need to do—though not so much in terms of where to put
their
cross.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072445000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072445000014">We are
not of course proposing to move the local elections in 2014 without
consulting those who are most affected and who have specialist
knowledge of elections and electoral matters. On 26 March, the
Government published a consultation document inviting views on whether
we should, subject to parliamentary approval, move the date of the
English local elections from Thursday 1 May 2014 to the same day as the
European parliamentary election. That consultation closed on 13 May, by
which time we had received 155 responses. This included
representations from the Electoral Commission, the Association of
Electoral Administrators, the Local Government Association and some 64
councils.</hs_para>

shows that there are mixed views on moving the date, some
two-thirds of the 155 responses, including that from the Electoral
Commission, favoured the change of date. The Explanatory Memorandum
which accompanies the order summarises consultees’ views and
sets out the Government’s response to the consultation and
provides the rationale for the
change.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072445000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072445000016">Concerns
were raised about the increased complexities in the administration of
elections and the risk of voter confusion. For that reason, the view
was expressed by some that the local elections should not be moved.
There were also concerns that such a move would weaken the democratic
mandate of local government, as the public focus would inevitably be
drawn towards national issues with the importance of local issues being
overlooked. It was felt that a proper debate on the separate issues of
Europe and local public services would be
prevented.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072445000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072445000017">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T15:53:28"></hs_TimeCode>
do not take these concerns lightly, but, after careful consideration
based on the responses that we received from, among others, the
Electoral Commission, the Association of Electoral Administrators and
local authorities, which are responsible for administering elections,
the Government are confident that local authorities and the suppliers
they work with will have the capacity to manage local and European
elections held on the same date in May
2014<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T15:53:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072445000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072445000018">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T15:53:57"></hs_TimeCode>
am also sure that sufficient public awareness work will take place to
reduce risk of voter confusion both at the ballot box and when
distinguishing between the different issues on which they are being
asked to vote. We should not underestimate the intelligence of the
electorate to grasp the issues and to be discerning at the polls.
Indeed, it could be argued that holding two polls at the same time is
likely to increase, rather than decrease, interest in both sets of
issues. In its response, the Electoral Commission agreed that the
balance of argument lay with the date of the local
elections being 
<?notus-xml column=484?>moved. This view was equally shared by the
Association of Electoral Administrators. The Local Government
Association and many councils also supported the move to elections on
the same
day.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072445000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072445000019">This
order also addresses consequential issues. It contains the necessary
provisions that will enable elections to parish councils to take place
alongside the principal council and European elections on 22 May. It
extends the term of office for sitting councillors and mayors, although
for no more than three weeks, which is an issue that I raised with
officials. It provides that a by-election will not be held where a
casual vacancy arises in the office of councillor within six months of
the European parliamentary election held in 2014. It also provides for
annual meetings of joint authorities and parish councils to take place
at a date later than currently required by statute, given the later
date of the local elections, in particular for the London Fire and
Emergency Planning
Authority.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072445000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072445000020">In
conclusion, the balance of argument is such as put forward in the
order, which is both sensible and pragmatic. There are good reasons to
hold both elections on the same day. I commend this order to

Greaves:</Member></B> My Lords, Liberal Democrats in this House have no

ought to declare an interest—not because I think I have one,
because I do not think I have—but I remember when we spent a lot
of time in this Room 10 years ago debating elections, which turned out
to be joint elections, where there were all-postal vote pilots in some
of the northern regions of this country. I took part in those debates,
which were well in advance of the elections. There was a formal
complaint afterwards from the Labour Party, which wrote to the
authorities in this House asking that I should be dealt with in an
appropriate manner—perhaps taken to the Tower, I do not
know—because I had not declared an interest, because at those
elections I turned out to be not only an election agent but a
candidate, and indeed got elected to the local council.</hs_para>

enough problems on its hands at the moment and I do not want
to create more, and more time and expense for it in writing letters of
complaint, so I will be clear—although I do not think it is an
interest—that it is quite likely that I shall be an agent in the
local elections next May for at least some candidates, although my seat
is not coming up. So that saves the Labour Party all that time and
effort and it can worry about its membership rules, trade unions and
the rest of it
instead.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072445000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072445000024">The
consultation on these proposals was quite interesting. The explanation
of it in the Explanatory Memorandum is interesting. It seems that about
a third of the people who responded in fact suggested that the

perfectly respectable reasons, such as
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13072445000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072445000043">“combining

there is a thought. I do not think that is true, actually. Certainly,
in the part of the world I live in, where there are combined European
and local elections, the local elections tend to have a higher profile
than the European elections. One of the arguments for combining them is
that people who vote in the local elections might not usually vote in
the European elections and that will put the European turnout
up—and vice versa.</hs_parafo>

the Explanatory Memorandum but the word on the grapevine is that many
of the organisations and persons who objected to combining the
elections were actually local Conservative associations, which are
worried about precisely that. They are concerned that in the European
elections lots of people who normally do not bother to vote in the
council elections will go out and vote for UKIP because they read the
<I>Daily Mail </I>or<I> </I>the<I> Daily Express</I>, or whatever other
reasons they may have, and this will cause problems for the
Conservatives in the local elections. That is a problem for the
Conservative Party; it is not one about which we are too bothered.

two problems with combining elections, although this year the arguments
in favour are very good. One is that the national campaign and the
discussion of the issues in the media will be biased very strongly
towards one of the elections, which might mean that local elections are
not genuine local elections, as they ought to be. The second problem is
that voters will be confused, will not know what they are doing and
will not be able to make sense of the different ballot papers and
voting systems. That is nonsense, and an insult to the intelligence of
electors. The combination of different electoral systems in Scotland
has substantially put that argument to bed. It is not true, although I
remember canvassing in the first European elections of this nature 10
years ago. When people saw me coming, they would wave these big ballot
papers at me and say, “Can you explain all these things? Who are
these parties?”. We had mini-seminars in the street in that
sunny June. However, by and large, people
cope.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072445000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072445000027">The real
problem will come not with the European elections but the year after,
in 2015, when yet again local elections will be combined with the
general election. That is the great problem with combining elections.
Inevitably, the general election takes over and people campaigning in
local elections find it much more difficult to counter what people
think of as the real election. Of course, that is now set out in a
statute that states that local elections are on the first Thursday in
May, and the Fixed-term Parliaments Act states that general elections
are on the first Thursday in May. I hope that, sooner or later, general
elections will move to where they used to be, in September or October,
and the two will be separate. However, that is not something we can do

Electoral Commission, the LGA, SOLACE, the Electoral Reform Society and
the Association of Electoral Administrators. We are in good company. As
the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, explained, the Lib Dems have no
objections either. I was delighted that the noble Lord took the
opportunity to avoid any confusion over his possible role as an
election agent. I am sure that that will save the Labour Party a great
deal of time. I was interested to hear the noble Lord’s comments
on UKIP. We will have to see. My noble friend Lady Golding made the
point that we have done it in the past and it would be odd if we could
not support the order today, which we do. My noble friend has raised an
important point around the declaration of

that returning officers and local authorities are now experienced in
having more than one election on the same day. The research for the

the commission plans to encompass the combination of polls in its

that it is very important.

low voter turnout. We then saw a voter turnout of 37%. This contrasts
with 2010, when there was a double-header and it was held with the
general election, with a voter turnout of 62.6%. At a time when we need
to encourage more people to

Rights.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072445000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072445000037">Automatic
enrolment introduces the biggest change to private pension saving that
this country has seen for 100 years. It will result in up to 11 million
people starting to save, or saving more, for their retirement, with a
contribution from their employer. In fact, data published last week by
the Pensions Regulator show that since last July more than 1 million
people have been automatically enrolled. Automatic enrolment is
transforming our savings culture by encouraging and supporting people
to take personal responsibility and save for their future, helping to
ensure that they have a more comfortable lifestyle in retirement. It is
of vital importance, therefore, that we ensure that people have
confidence in the pensions that they are automatically enrolled into
and are protected from excessive or inappropriate
charges.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072445000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072445000038">The
draft regulations before us will introduce a new condition that a
scheme providing money purchase benefits must meet to be an automatic
enrolment scheme. The condition specifies that the scheme cannot allow
an employer to make an agreement with a third party under which that
third party is paid from the members’ pension pots. This will
effectively ban consultancy charges from schemes used to comply with
automatic enrolment. In doing this, we do not want to prevent the
normal day-to-day running of pension schemes. Trustees and managers of
occupational 
<?notus-xml column=488?>pension schemes and pension providers have therefore been excluded from
the definition of third party. This will mean that they can continue to
pay for important services for the efficient running of
schemes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072445000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072445000039">We
recognise that a small number of schemes which include consultancy
charges were put in place before the Minister for Pensions announced
the Government’s intention to legislate on 10 May. Therefore,
these regulations will not affect pension schemes where there was a
legally enforceable agreement in place between an employer and a third
party before 10 May 2013. We intend to consult in the autumn on
widening the ban on consultancy charges so that it covers all
qualifying schemes. Clause 35 of the Pensions Bill currently
before Parliament—it is in the other place at the
moment—will enable us to do this. Our direction of travel is
clear: consultancy charges do not have a place in qualifying
schemes.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13072445000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072445000040">The
concept of consultancy charges was introduced as part of the Retail
Distribution Review carried out by the then Financial Services
Authority. The review banned the practice of providers paying
commission to advisers for recommending their products. Consultancy
charging enables employers to pass on the costs of advice provided to
an employer to the members who join the pension scheme. While some of
the services to employers can improve the outcome for some members, the
primary aim in many situations is to support employer compliance with
their automatic enrolment duty. Fundamentally, therefore, there is a
misalignment between the interests of the employer and the member. The
employer chooses the service and the price is agreed between the
employer and the adviser, but the fee is paid by the individual member.
That fee is paid regardless of whether they receive any particular
benefit other than being automatically enrolled into a workplace
pension scheme. There is no one in this arrangement who has the
incentive to and is capable of driving down costs and ensuring value
for money. The member’s only choice is to accept that they have
to pay the consultancy charge to the adviser out of their pension or to
opt out of pension saving and forgo the employer contribution. That is
why we are bringing forward these regulations today.</hs_para>

emerging interaction between consultancy charging and automatic
enrolment. This involved the full range of organisations with an
interest in the issue, including pension providers, advice firms,

course of the review, a broad consensus emerged that there was a

review also<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T16:24:06"></hs_TimeCode>
found that consultancy charges can have a disproportionately negative
impact on people who move jobs regularly, because they might repeatedly
have to pay higher “initial” scheme set-up charges. In
April, the Work and Pensions Select Committee raised concerns about
consultancy charges and the ultimate impact on individuals’
income in retirement. The committee recommended that the Government ban
consultancy charges in automatic enrolment schemes without
delay.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072450000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072450000005">A<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T16:24:35"></hs_TimeCode>
number of options were considered during the review, including
restricting the use of consultancy charges through setting a cap,
imposing decency limits and providing statutory guidelines. Our
conclusion was that none of these options would protect consumers
sufficiently or quickly enough. Even a low consultancy charge will have
a detrimental effect on a member if they do not receive any tangible
benefit from the advice that they are paying for. Our approach is the
simplest rule to understand and enforce, and sends a clear message that
we are protecting consumers.</hs_para>

employers are free to get advice if they want it, the Government do not
believe that the cost of seeking such advice should be

charging for any scheme used for auto-enrolment and charges which arise
from an amount paid to a third party under an agreement between a third
party and an employer is very welcome, and I am pleased that the
Government have taken this decision. The decision recognises the
vulnerability of pension savers where they have not chosen the pension
product but are automatically enrolled in the employer’s choice

reflect that consultancy charging was initially allowed by the
FCA—previously the FSA—and its subsequent abolition,
because it is quite clearly not in the saver’s interest, is
compelling confirmation of the need for the two pensions regulators,
the Pensions Regulator and the FCA, to co-ordinate very clearly on what
is the appropriate framework of protection for pension savers in an
auto-enrolment world where one has a mix of both trustee and
contract-based pension provision and where, increasingly, the future

is important to reiterate a point to which the Minister referred:
Parliament having secured broad popular support for automatic
enrolment—which is certainly manifest in the preliminary
evidence of people not opting out from being auto-enrolled into a
pension scheme—cannot afford to fail those millions of people
who are allowing themselves to be auto-enrolled by not having a
framework of protection that ensures that the interests of the saver
are centre stage in any regulatory framework. Public confidence on this
issue, once lost, will not be easily regained. This is a framework for
auto-enrolment. I suspect that we have one chance at securing a rebuild
of private pension saving in this country and we cannot afford to get
too much of it

particularly endorse the analysis which points up the misalignment,
which the Minister referred to, between the interests of the primary
consumer—the employer—and the end customer—that
is, the member. As my honourable friend the shadow Pensions Minister
Gregg McClymont has made clear, the workplace pensions market is not
made up of fully informed consumers. The inertia that this phenomenon
fostered is, in part, to be addressed by auto-enrolment. A lack of
informed consumers is not sufficiently balanced by good governance
arrangements, particularly for contract-based DC schemes.</hs_para>

governance, especially for defined contribution schemes. My

Conduct Authority’s regulation offers sufficient safeguards for
the workplace pensions market, and has proposed an extension of
trust-based governance, a widening of fiduciary obligations and bigger

disclosure of costs and charges is not a sufficient improvement to the
current situation but it is a necessary one. We welcome the call for

have heard, in April 2013 the Work and Pensions Committee covered a
number of these issues and made the point, with which we agree, that
auto-enrolment will mean that many more people in the UK will be saving

it would seem that the Government have no plans to change this, so
tackling consultancy charges, which end up being paid by scheme

Government are right to ban these arrangements rather than seek to

have a few brief questions. In fact, I think the Minister has
pre-empted two of them. I am not sure whether that is foresight or I am
getting predictable. Have the Government considered the risk of trading
down in circumstances where employer contributions would be above the
statutory threshold but could be reduced to the statutory threshold,
with the savings covering the consultancy charges that would otherwise
be on-charged to scheme members? I was going to ask what assessment has
been made of the ramifications of the cut-off point where an employer
has entered into an agreement before 10 May 2013. Those agreements
presumably will run for some time in the future. Can the Minister say
something about the nature of these contracts and whether they tend to
be short or long term? If they can be terminated by notice, there does 
<?notus-xml column=492?>not seem to be an obligation on an employer to do that under these
arrangements. However, the Minister in her opening remarks said that
there seem to be just a few of them, so it does not seem to be a

response to the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Drake, in

workplace pensions that the Office of Fair Trading launched in January.
The aim of the study is to examine whether DC pensions are set up to
deliver the best value for money for savers and to take a
forward look at the impact of auto-enrolment. On 11 July, the OFT
published an update on its progress. This included several
areas it wishes to explore further, including the current level of
governance over the performance of some schemes, which the noble Lord,
Lord McKenzie, raised; schemes with two-tier charging structures in
which deferred members pay higher charges; and schemes that do not have
a realistic prospect of reaching sufficient scale to generate value for
their members. The OFT is also concerned about the way that charges are
currently presented and about charges in older schemes that may not
represent value for
money.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072450000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072450000026">The

to the points made by the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, about the
importance of good governance in automatic enrolment, with which of

occupational schemes, the trustee already has a fiduciary duty to act
impartially and in the best interests of scheme beneficiaries. There
are also some requirements in place for people running personal pension
schemes. In particular, the Financial Conduct Authority’s
Treating Customers Fairly programme says that customers’
interests should be at the heart of how firms do business. The

improve transparency and disclosure of charges, and we have powers to
legislate for greater disclosure to members, employers or the regulator
if necessary. Prior to any further action, consideration should be
given to balancing the burden of any further requirements on the
industry against their effectiveness in protecting consumers. There are

10 May and those that are not captured by these regulations. It is not
possible to know with certainty how many were in place then,

will talk for a moment about that shared understanding, which I will
put in very simple layman’s terms. No doubt others will expand
on it. The first point is that antibiotics have been a great benefit to
humanity in tackling everything from TB and pneumonias to sexually
transmitted diseases and bacterial infections of all kinds—not
just in this country of course but world wide, including in some of the
poorest countries of the world. I happen to chair Sightsavers, which
uses an enormous amount of antibiotics in dealing with trachoma in the
poorest countries of the
world.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072458000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072458000003">Antibiotics<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T16:54:37"></hs_TimeCode>
are the basis of much modern practice. We assume now that we can tackle
infections. Infamously, it was the American Surgeon General who said in
1968
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13072458000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072458000041">“the

words no doubt came back to haunt him. The problem is that the bacteria
are fighting back, in large part due to misuse—people failing to
complete courses of treatment and therefore to wipe out the infection.
The bacteria did not know that the war was over; evolving and becoming
drug resistant, the stronger ones survived. The result, as we know, is
that globally we have multidrug-resistant TB, and infections that
cannot be treated in countries as disparate and different as India and
Israel. This has been known for a long time, and the problems coming
forward have been known for a long time. It was the House of Lords
Science and Technology Committee’s 7th report in 1998 that first
drew attention to this. In the same year, the World Health Assembly
raised it as a serious issue.</hs_parafo>

considerable research over many years. I am indebted to one of the
world’s experts, Professor Otto Cars of Uppsala University in
Sweden, for setting out the evidence for me. It is compelling. Imagine
a world without effective antibiotics. Our English Chief Medical
Officer, Dame Sally Davies, said that if we do not take action, we may
all be back in an almost 19th-century environment where infections kill
us as a result of routine operations. We will not be able to do a lot
of our cancer treatments or organ
transplants.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072458000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072458000005">It
is not just the burden of disease that is at issue here but the
economic impact. It has long been known to be significant, but new work
coming forward from Professor Richard Smith of the London School of
Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Professor Joanna Coast of the
University of Birmingham, suggests that, when wider impacts are taken
into account, the costs are even higher than anticipated. These
economic arguments are extremely important in raising the issue up the
world priority list. It is significant that the World Economic Forum
sees antibiotic resistance as a major threat. There are other important
issues around animals that I will not mention in this short debate. My
noble friend Lord Trees will say something about
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072458000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072458000006">I
congratulate the Chief Medical Officer on drawing this issue to the
attention of the country and of the world in her 2011 annual report. I
also congratulate the Government on supporting her to raise the matter
at the World Health Assembly at the G8 summit and, I hope, at the UN in
September. Her report sets out the issue in detail and notes that there
are some drugs that are the last line of resistance, to which we should
give special attention now. She and the experts who wrote Chapter 5 of
her report drew attention to a number of solutions.</hs_para>

but at the moment there are few antibiotics manufacturers and few new
antibiotics in the pipeline. Thanks to AstraZeneca, I understand more
about the business model and the problems in dealing with drugs of last
resort. The simple issue is that they are kept on the shelf; they are
in reserve. It is important that we have them, but they do not get used
very much and they do not lead to sales. Therefore, the economic model
does not work. Even with the more common antibiotics that we use more
regularly, we only use them for a short period as therapeutic drugs,
not as long-term drugs that will produce a long-term income and
therefore provide a return on the massive investment required for
development.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072458000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072458000008">AstraZeneca
and many others argue that there is a need for very substantial changes
to regulation to allow for shorter and easier development times, and
even for antibiotics to be treated as a different category of drugs.
They also point to the need for investment to secure development. This
also makes the argument that vaccines are important in heading off
disease. I well understand that not every new drug or vaccine is a
significant advance, but there is enormous scope here for Government,
and the public and private sectors, to work together to develop a new
way of developing these drugs. My noble friend Lady Mar will say a bit
more about vaccines in a moment.</hs_para>

issue is the development and use of new diagnostics. If we can get
people into treatment faster, we will be quicker to control the
bacteria. At the moment it can be days before technicians know what
strain they are dealing
with.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072458000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072458000010">The
third and perhaps biggest point is about better stewardship and
conserving what we have. This is even more difficult, but it is the
basis for everything else. The CMO’s report describes good
practice that will achieve this. There are 10 top tips for effective
antibiotic prescribing that should be followed in this country. Imagine
for a moment the situation in every country in the world; every clinic
or village in China or India needs a battery of actions. There is a
need for education professionals in those areas to have the equivalent
of our 10 top tips, as well as for greater public awareness and
education. That is no easy task. We should remember that many of us in
our country do not take drugs in the way that we should. Also, in those
countries we must tackle counterfeit medicines and restrict
over-the-counter sales. We should also see changes to harmonise
regulation. This is phenomenally difficult, but it is not enough to put
our own house in order; we will be affected by what happens elsewhere

all these approaches combined: new drugs, new diagnostics, better
practices and stewardship, action across the whole healthcare system
and, indeed, across the whole world. Here I come to the point that I
really want to talk to the Government about: this needs remarkable
political effort. It is about reframing the issue and building
political support, and I will be interested to hear what the Government
have in
mind<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T17:00:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072458000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072458000012">I
will make two points. First, this is an enormous threat. Indeed, you
can galvanise people around the threat: it is real and it will impact
in terms of illness and economy. However, it is also an opportunity. I
am indebted to my friend and colleague Dr Ilona Kickbusch, and to
Professor Cars, for pointing out that we should treat antibiotics as a
global public good and that there is an alternative way of seeing this
problem. It is about a vision of a world in which the peoples of the
world really do in practice have a right to health and healthcare,
something most nations have signed up to—many, like ours, since
the UN declaration of 1948. In that world, nations develop, share and
look after those things, such as antibiotics, which are a benefit to us
all.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072458000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072458000013">We have
already seen how this can be done in tackling other threats such as
global pandemics. Although there is always controversy about that,
nevertheless great progress has been made in creating a network for
surveillance and tackling issues. There is more to do. We have also
seen it with the millennium development goals, working towards a vision
where no woman dies as a result of pregnancy, although there is much
more to do there as well. In other words, I am arguing for setting
ourselves the goal of preserving antibiotics for the future as one of
science’s great benefits for humanity, and for driving this
forward politically and technically, in every way in which we
can.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13072458000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072458000014">My
second point is simply that the UK can play an extraordinarily
important leadership role here. It is well respected in
health. We have the credibility of having a health system which seeks
to look after every person within it. We also have credibility because
of the 
<?notus-xml column=497?>world-leading role that has been played in development; here I
compliment both this Government and the previous one. We can be bold
and ambitious in taking a lead. No nation is better placed to do so,
with our connections in the Commonwealth, across the Atlantic, and in
Europe. The key is to bring together a group of like-minded countries,
as this and previous Governments have done on other things, starting
with those who are already taking this seriously. We should set out a
vision and pathway, and take on these issues step by step. The Chief
Medical Officer has already started this, but it is important to add
political weight and depth to her work. It is not just about health but
about economics and foreign policy. It is a step in building a better
world, where we have and share the means to offer better health to
everyone.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072458000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072458000015">I
therefore look forward to hearing the Government’s response to
these points, and to knowing how they will turn their undoubted
commitment in this area into something even bigger and bolder. Will
they seek to take a global lead on this? How will they do so? I also
greatly look forward to hearing from other noble Lords.</hs_para>

places where young people often gather together. It seems to be
more prevalent in the USA and therefore we should be

give the pharmaceutical industry incentives to develop more

further compounded by a widespread inability to screen for

infections should be rapid, cheap, easy to use, sensitive and specific,
and should screen for many micro-organisms and their antibiotic
resistance. The diagnostic platform should be transportable and robust;
ideally, it should also be able to be run on solar power for use in
remote healthcare settings in developing countries. In Australia there
is such a portable box, called the “lab without walls”,

Very worryingly, in some countries extensively drug-resistant TB is on

and development needs to be rebuilt. We know that the current estimates

need for a global initiative as well as a UK one. For the global
initiative, it has been suggested that something along the lines of the

the beginning of a solution. This would have to be paid for at a

resistance of bacteria to antibiotics—I will refer to
this as antimicrobial resistance—involves a complex interplay of
interactions between different bacteria, hosts and antibiotics. Some
bacteria exclusively infect animals. Resistance has developed in some
strains, which is likely to be associated with the use of antibiotics
in animals, and where the consequences will be confined to animals.
Equally, some bacteria are unique to humans. A few of them have

course, some bacteria—so-called zoonotic bacteria —infect
both humans and animals. The causes of their resistance, and
the consequences of it, can affect both animals and humans. Those
bacteria can move not only from animals to humans but from humans to

has been well described, antibiotic-resistant bacteria in wildlife and
in the environment. There is a flux and flow of resistant bacteria and
the genes that confer resistance within the

this brings me to my second major point. The reality is that this is a
global problem of massive scale, particularly in China and elsewhere in
Asia. We must recognise that, whatever we do about the domestic use of
antibiotics, the greatest threats will arise from overseas. This is a
consequence of a number of factors. One is the gross use and, one might
say, misuse of antibiotics in animals and humans. For example, in 2007,
China produced 210,000 tonnes of antibiotics, of which about 100,000
tonnes were used in animals. Adjusting pro rata for the human
population, that is 20 times the amount of antibiotics for animals than
we used on animals in the UK at that
time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T17:26:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

available over the counter in India, Asia and elsewhere, not
exclusively on prescription. This leads to their misuse, the
underdosing or curtailment of dosing regimes, both of which are factors
in inducing antimicrobial resistance—as, of course, is the
close contact of humans and animals in many of these
settings in developing countries. All these factors contribute to high
rates of antimicrobial resistance. Again, in China, in a survey of
hospital infections in 2009, more than 60% of staphylococcus aureus
infections were methicillin resistant—that is,
MRSA—compared with less than 2% in UK
hospitals<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T17:27:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

of antimicrobial resistance is coupled with the massive and rapid
movement of people throughout the world. Just like pathogens
themselves, such as the SARS virus and avian influenza, can move,
antimicrobial-resistant bacteria can evolve in distant lands and arrive
here in the UK within days if not hours. This is the downside to
globalisation. When globalisation comes in the door, biosecurity goes

Turnberg:</Member></B> My Lords, this has been a remarkable and
important debate. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Crisp, for

contributions made by other noble

Crisp, spoke very persuasively about the global impact of infectious
diseases, especially in the third world, a point re-emphasised by the
noble Lord, Lord Trees. However, I am going to narrow my focus to the
problems in the UK. There is little doubt that infectious diseases that
we once thought had been conquered never really went away. They are
rearing their collective head once again. Without about 5,000 deaths a
year from gram-negative sepsis in the UK alone, we cannot afford to be
complacent. No sooner have we managed to get a grip on one set of
antibiotic-resistant bacteria, MRSA and Clostridium difficile, than
another set has appeared, but the fact is that we managed to have an
impact on MRSA through a concerted and focused effort. That suggests at
least that we can do something if we put our minds to
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T17:30:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

faced with a new set of antibiotic-resistant germs that pose a major
threat to the population, in particular to highly susceptible subgroups
of the population. These are the gram-negative bacteria, particularly
E. coli and Klebsiella species, which make up more than a third of all
causes of bacteraemia reported to the Health Protection
Agency—now the public health laboratories. It is worth noting
that septicaemia due to E. coli has a 30% mortality rate. These
bacteria are now the biggest threats, but others are creeping up on us.
We are seeing more cases of resistant gonorrhoea, a very common
disease, and multidrug-resistant TB, which is much less frequent at
least in the UK but still very disturbing—a point well made by
the noble Baroness, Lady Masham. The reasons for all these
rises are complex and multiple. They include the increase in the number
of vulnerable patients—the very young and the very old, and
those with diseases that lower their resistance, such as cancers and
leukaemia—and the powerful immunosuppressive treatments that
they need. Bringing them close together in a hospital or a care home
increases their risk. We have heard about the overprescribing of
broad-spectrum antibiotics that allow the evolution of resistant
strains.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072463000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072463000016">Perhaps<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T17:31:52"></hs_TimeCode>
the major impact of inappropriate or over prescribing has been felt in
Asia, particularly in China and the Indian subcontinent, with their
huge populations, as the noble Lord, Lord Trees, emphasised. Here,
there has been a dramatic rise in antibiotic-resistant strains and they
are increasingly being imported as 
<?notus-xml column=504?>international travel grows. There are now no more frontiers that can
stop the spread of germs. So what is to be
done<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T17:32:13"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072463000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072463000017">It
is possible to reduce the spread of antibiotic resistance. We reduced
the incidence of MRSA and C. difficile by a combination of spreading
good practice—with handwashing or alcohol hand rubs at the
bedside, and nasal swabbing of all admissions to pick up
carriers—and better management of intravenous lines and better
infection-control measures. They all played a part. The noble Lord,
Lord Trees, spoke about the zoonoses. Stopping a few years ago the
practice of using antibiotics in animal feeds to promote growth must
also have been very valuable. Concerted action can therefore work. We
must once more pay attention to the recommendations of the Chief
Medical Officer in her admirable report of 2011. Here it was proposed
that we should ensure that NHS trusts and their chief executives
manage, report and audit infection rates. That was successful before,
and we must place even more emphasis on it in the duties placed on NHS
England and CCGs. Spreading the message yet again about thoughtful
prescribing of antibiotics, both in general practice and in hospitals,
has never been more
important<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T17:33:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072463000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072463000018">However,
we also need some different approaches. We desperately need better and
quicker diagnostic tests for bacteria and their resistance.
It now takes about 48 hours or more to get a report from the
laboratories on what bacteria are responsible for an infection.
Meanwhile, one is faced with treating a serious infection blindly or
not at all—a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Crisp, and the
noble Baroness, Lady Masham. Tests are becoming available, using
genetic profiling or next-generation sequencing, that will bring the
time for diagnosis down to a very few hours. If we can get there,
antibiotic prescribing will become much refined and we will be able to
avoid giving ineffective antibiotics. There is also a desperate need
for new antibacterials.</hs_para>

is unfortunately the case, as has been emphasised by a number of noble
Lords, that the pharmaceutical company pipelines are pretty low at the
moment. The cost of the development of new drugs is prohibitive and too
often drug companies are inhibited by overregulation and cost. The
noble Baroness, Lady Masham, mentioned that and the noble Countess,
Lady Mar, underlined the point. It has been suggested that the
Government might encourage investment in R&amp;D by industry through
such measures as prolonging the period during which the patents for new
antibacterial drugs may be retained, or by a more favourable tax regime
for companies developing those drugs. Perhaps we should take note, too,
of the ideas expressed by the noble Countess, Lady Mar, about a
multipronged attack; I found those very attractive. It seems to me that
we must do more in these two areas: more research into rapid diagnostic
techniques and more engagement with and encouragement for industry to
develop new
antibacterials<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T17:35:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

ensuring that the

action highlights the key issues that we need to tackle. These include,
for example, good infection prevention and control measures to help
prevent infections rather than a reliance on antibiotics, plus good
techniques for diagnosing and deploying the right treatment. Equally
important is ensuring that patients and animal keepers fully understand
the importance of the treatment regimens prescribed, coupled with
stronger surveillance measures to identify quickly new threats or
changing patterns in resistance, and working to develop a sustainable
supply of new antimicrobials.</hs_para>

that antimicrobial resistance refers to the ability of certain bacteria
to survive after exposure to an antimicrobial that normally would be
expected to kill them or inhibit their growth. Antimicrobial resistance
affects us all, but some groups in society are particularly susceptible
to infections and will feel the impact of antimicrobial resistance more
than others. These groups include children, older people, and those
with weakened immune systems such as cancer patients undergoing
treatment, transplant patients and HIV/AIDS patients. An increase in
difficult-to-treat infections will affect everyone as most of us will
belong to vulnerable groups at some stage in our lives. Moreover, we
know already that mortality is greater with resistant
infections.</hs_para>

resistance has obvious human costs, but it is also costly in terms of
healthcare expenditure. It is estimated that antimicrobial resistance
costs the European Union approximately €1.5 billion in
healthcare expenses and lost productivity each year. This is indicative
not only of the scale of the problem but of the fact that antimicrobial
resistance requires action at the national and the international

which will have three strategic aims. The first is to improve the
knowledge and understanding of antimicrobial resistance, through 
<?notus-xml column=506?>better information, intelligence and supporting data and through
developing more effective early warning systems to improve health
security. The second key aim is to conserve and steward the
effectiveness of existing treatments, through improving infection
prevention and control and through development of resources to
facilitate the optimal use of antibiotics in both humans and animals.
The third aim is to stimulate the development of new antibiotics,
diagnostics and novel therapies by promoting innovation and investment
in the development of new drugs and by ensuring that new therapeutics

component of antimicrobial stewardship is infection prevention and
control. I would like to take this opportunity to reassure your
Lordships that we will maintain a focus on healthcare-associated
infections. Existing provisions, such as that requiring all healthcare
providers to demonstrate compliance with the code of practice on the
prevention and control of infection, will remain in place. The new NHS
infrastructure also offers opportunities. For example, antimicrobial
resistance has been included in key documents such as the
Government’s proposed mandate for the NHS for 2014-15, which is

noted the need for improved diagnostics. Public funders of research
already invest widely in the development and evaluation of rapid

NIHR launched a themed call for antimicrobial resistance research and
the development of new tests. The research and development of new tests

example of what the Government are doing is that, from April 2014, the
NIHR aims to fund 12 health protection research units for five years.
These will be partnerships between universities and Public Health
England. A number are expected to cover infectious disease areas and
could potentially aim to include research on rapid diagnosis within
their research programmes. From 1 September 2013, the Department of
Health will provide a total of £4 million over four years to
establish four National Institute for Health Research diagnostic
evidence co-operatives to catalyse the generation of evidence on the
clinical validity, clinical utility, cost-effectiveness and
care pathway benefits of in vitro diagnostics. Based in NHS
organisations and involving multidisciplinary teams, they will enable
collaboration between a range of stakeholders, including providers of
NHS pathology services and NHS commissioners. Two of the four DECs have

Government are well aware that they cannot deliver the action required
to tackle antimicrobial resistance on their own. We need a societal
shift, where antimicrobial resistance is seen as a priority that
everyone can help address. To this end, we will continue to use the
annual European Antibiotic Awareness Day to provide online educational
materials that the NHS can use for local initiatives. In previous
campaigns we reminded people that colds, and most coughs and sore
throats, get better without antibiotics. That is because they are
caused by viruses and not bacteria, and antibiotics only work on
bacteria.</hs_para>

consensus is that use of antimicrobials in human medicine is the main
driving force for antimicrobial-resistant human infections, use in the
veterinary sector contributes to overall resistance rates. I listened
with care and interest to the noble Lord, Lord Trees, on this aspect.
We recognise that antibiotics, used responsibly, remain a vital part of
the veterinary surgeon’s toolbox, without which animals
suffering from a bacterial infection could not be treated effectively.
As the noble Lord, Lord Trees, emphasised, the use of antibiotics in
veterinary medicine is controlled by veterinary prescription and is
equivalent to the arrangements for humans. In this way we are
minimising antibiotics being used routinely and encouraging their
responsible use. The Government’s position on the use of
antibiotics in farming is very clear; we do not support the routine
prophylactic use of antibiotics in animal health. I am pleased to say
that Defra will be strengthening its guidance to ensure that this point
is brought out very clearly. We very much welcome the support of the

the noble Lord, Lord Trees, and the noble Lord, Lord Crisp,
referred to the vital need for international action. The Government
recognise that to achieve many of the objectives of their strategy it
is essential that the international community is actively engaged, and
I can tell the Committee that the Government have been at the forefront
in galvanising action at an international level. For example, this May
my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health delivered
the keynote address at the World Health Assembly, with antimicrobial
resistance as a focus. Last month we ensured that antimicrobial
resistance was a focal point of the G8 science meeting on 12
June. Furthermore, we held a special event at Chatham House
to engage international experts on ways and means to tackle this
complex problem. The noble Baroness, Lady Masham, and the
noble Countess, Lady Mar, will be reassured to know that incentivising
the development of new drugs was covered at this meeting, and I assure

number of noble Lords, not least the noble Lord, Lord Crisp, referred
to the barriers to producing new drugs. The discovery and development
of new drugs takes time—up to 10 or even 15 years—and a
barrier to developing new antibiotics is, as the noble Lord, Lord
Crisp, rightly said, the relatively low private return on investment
for antimicrobials relative to making investments in other therapeutic
areas. Our work on strengthening international collaboration will be
key to new drug development because international agreement to address
this issue, as I said, is essential; it is too large an issue to tackle
alone. We will build on existing international research collaborations,

Bakewell:</Member></B> My Lords, I am pleased to introduce this debate
today because it is both timely and urgent. It is timely in the sense
that it is the end of the summer term, when thousands of bright young
people are making plans to take up what is now the accepted route to
university qualifications. It is therefore a good time to challenge the
assumption that three years’ full-time study, usually
residential, at a university is the only way to go. It is urgent
because there is a serious crisis in part-time education, which needs
to be addressed. I am pleased that even ahead of the Universities UK
review that will be published in the autumn, engagement with the matter
should be kept in the public awareness and that the campaign, Part-time
Matters, is supported by this
debate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072463000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072463000037">I
declare my interest: I am president of Birkbeck and have an honorary
degree from the Open University—both institutions with a fine
and long-standing record of providing part-time study leading to full
degrees for their students and world-class champions of the case for
lifelong learning.</hs_para>

enrolment figures for part-time study at both graduate and postgraduate
level are falling year on year. The number of part-time undergraduate
entrants has fallen by 40% since 2010. Following the annual report of
the Office for Fair Access—OFFA—for the 2012-13 academic
year, its director, Professor Les Ebdon expressed concern about the
fall in part-time study and applications from mature 
<?notus-xml column=509?>students. The university think tank, million+, called
on Ministers to launch a high-profile campaign to promote part-time
study. The chair of million+, Professor Michael Gunn, declared
that,</hs_para>
<hs_quotefo UID="13072463000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072463000070">“there is a
real risk of a downward spiral that will depress social mobility and
lead to skills shortages in the long
term”.</hs_quotefo><hs_para UID="13072463000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072463000039">Who
are part-time students? In the main, they are older and more likely to
be female and less diverse than full-time students: They are also
likely to have other commitments, either in public careers out there in
the workforce—some 80% of part-time learners are in
employment—or with domestic careers as homemakers: women
struggling with the work/life balance and hoping to keep their
qualifications up to date. There is also a considerable number of
retired people who find delight and fulfilment in late-life learning.
There is real potential in growing the numbers in this group. Indeed,
it has the blessing of David Willetts, the Minister for Universities
and Science, who sees scope for older citizens retraining and adding to
their skills or simply engaging in retirement in lifelong learning for
its own sake. This is far from the standard profile of the student
cohort.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072463000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072463000040">Central
to the issue is money. Following fee changes in 2012, part-time
undergraduate students have had access to fee loans. However, some
part-time fees increased in 2012. The Higher Education Funding Council
for England, HEFCE, reported that between November 2012 and January
2013—scarcely three months —21 colleges reported a drop
in demand for part-time courses because of reluctance to take on
student loans. These moves in student numbers are steep and
sudden.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072463000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072463000041">So how
is money impacting on part-time study applications? First, students
seem to be unclear about what scope there is for loans or
employer-funding and over what time repayments are to be made.
Students, even if they know about it, struggle to navigate the Student
Loans Company. Each and every hiccough in the system acts as a
deterrent to student
applications.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072463000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072463000042">Secondly,
the withdrawal of funding for ELQs—equivalent or lower
qualifications—came into effect in 2008-09, and in January 2009
David Lammy, then Minister of State for Education, asked HEFCE to draw
up an early review of the impact of that policy. The first evidence
indicates that overall fundable numbers had already reduced. The most
commonly cited area affected by the EFQ ruling is lifelong learning.
That can hardly be surprising—you cut the funding and numbers
fall
away<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T17:55:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072463000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072463000043">Thirdly,
the economy of the country has a direct impact on part-time
studies. At a time of redundancies and a relatively stagnant economy,
individuals are anxious about their jobs and future prospects. They are
often asked to work longer hours, which makes part-time study
difficult. There is also evidence that employer-funding is on the
decline, suggesting that this is something that
employers—wrongly, in my view—see as an extra to their
core budgets rather than a fundamental part of their employee welfare
and
development<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T17:56:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072463000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072463000044">How
much does any of this matter? It is crucial for several reasons. The
known and existing benefits of part-time study are already
understood: it increases social mobility by allowing people from poorer
backgrounds to access study that they would not be able to afford 
<?notus-xml column=510?>full-time, and it allows adults who have missed out earlier by taking
employment straight from school to rethink and reshape their prospects,
consider a change of direction and gain a more fulfilling and
self-directed future for
themselves<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T17:57:06"></hs_TimeCode>.
According to the National Institute of Adult Continuing Education,
there is evidence that it boosts skill levels and improves
employability. The NIACE also tells us that adult learning contributes
to better health: evidence exists that taking up courses as an adult
increases the chances of giving up smoking and reduces the risk of
depression, especially in women. I can thoroughly understand the
latter; the risk of social isolation and stress often experienced by
young mothers is all too
familiar<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T17:57:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072463000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072463000045">If
all this sounds a little like mother love and apple pie, a utopian
vision in which we all go on learning and feeling and doing better in
our lives, I think it brings us to a more wide-reaching discussion
about how education as it currently serves this society is formulated
and structured, and why it is not answering all our needs. I was
brought up short by a grandson who declared to me, “Your
generation”—in which I think he also included his
parents—“never asked us if we wanted to go to university.
It is always assumed that if we pass exams well, we will go on to three
years’ residential at a university. No other options are given
any serious consideration”. Indeed, they are
not<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T17:58:31"></hs_TimeCode>. What is
more, there is increasing evidence that this current accepted pattern
does not always benefit students or learning. Young people can arrive
at university already exhausted by the educational template that they
have been following. They give evidence of this by a failure to focus,
varying attendance and drop-out rates.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13072463000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072463000046">There is strong
evidence that part-time students are strongly motivated, have a strong
sense of intention in their study and a commitment to its helping
improve their outlook, their careers and their sense of fulfilment.
That is why, in launching this debate today, I hope to start and
continue a debate about how to shift the focus of education better to
match the needs of those who would be students.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13072463000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072463000047">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T17:59:30"></hs_TimeCode>
need government help to do this, and I believe that, with the argument
strongly made, we will get a good hearing. At a recent reception for
the Part-time Matters campaign, David Willetts spoke encouragingly of
his wish to stop the decline of part-time study. But the message has to
go further than a reception in the Cholmondeley Room. Schools, heads,
teachers, careers advisers and parents should all be aware of part-time
study as an option. Trade unions and professional groups, as well as
informal organisations like the WI, should be familiar with the
existence of part-time study and be aware of what it can offer and how
it can be afforded. In this way, we can check the decline and move to
boost educational opportunities for those who might otherwise lose
out.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-24?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_24_PT_1/06C9F4EA183AA9A0FF2DD47AC01773E7E255AB88" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 24 July 2013">Wednesday,

Sharp of Guildford:</Member></B> My Lords, it gives me great pleasure
to follow the noble Baroness, Lady Bakewell, and to thank her for
raising this extremely important issue. I agree with her thoroughly
that it is one that we need to give as much publicity to as we
can.</hs_para>

an interest in that I am an honorary fellow of Birkbeck. I was awarded
that honorary fellowship for my work during the early part of this
century on raising the profile of part-time learning and arguing for
parity between part-time and full-time study. The grants and loans were
all being accorded to full-time students because, as the noble Baroness
said, the assumption was that the only time that matters is that
between the ages of 18 and 21. I felt it was extremely important that
part-time students, not only at the university level but also those in
further education, should be given some consideration.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13072463000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072463000050">While in many senses I
was unhappy about the introduction of full-cost fees when the
regulations went through in 2010, one of the good things I kept
pointing to was the fact that at long last we had parity. In terms of
loans, part-time students now have access to the same loan schemes as
full-time students. That was an important victory. It was therefore a
matter of considerable shock and disappointment on my part that the
major effect of introducing full-cost fees is that it has hit the
part-timers of this world rather than the full-timers. We have seen a
remarkably small decrease in full-time applications, but a considerable
one in part-time applications.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13072463000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072463000051">As the noble Baroness,
Lady Bakewell, indicated, part-time education is in many ways a hidden
sector in this country. If you tell people that there are actually
824,000 part-time students compared with 1,167,000
full-timers—half as many, and one-third in numerical
terms—most of them just do not believe it. In full-time
equivalence terms, they account for 250,000 students. The drop of 40%
in applications is equivalent to Basingstoke dropping off the map, so
it really is significant and important.</hs_para>

interesting one. It is disproportionately female, at 63% as against 37%
male. It is less diverse, with 18% from the black and ethnic minorities
compared with 22% in the university sector as a whole. The subjects
studied are also disproportionately focused in certain areas: the
professions allied to medicine and education. Of course, the Open
University dominates the sector. I believe that the total number of
full-time equivalents at the OU is 90,000 to 100,000, and again the
total number is around 250,000. The university’s mixed
introductory courses are extremely popular. Large numbers of the people
involved in part-time education are taking undergraduate course modules
but not necessarily following through with entire courses. That is
important and something that we need to pick up.</hs_para>

liked by employers, who recognise that it improves skills and knowledge
and raises productivity and efficiency. However, despite acknowledging
this, employers will not, on the whole, pay fees for part-time
education. Where they do, it is on the whole for customised courses
that specifically fit their own needs or on behalf of the higher-level
employees in their unit who they send off on expensive MBA courses and
that sort of
thing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072463000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072463000054">Why is
part-time education so important for this country? The noble Baroness,
Lady Bakewell, mentioned a number of the socialising
effects—such as the sense 
<?notus-xml column=512?>of fulfilment and the benefits for older people—all of which are
very important and must not be neglected. However, we also need to be
aware of two things. First, as a country, we have a very poor skill
profile. We have quite a number at the graduate level but are
disproportionately poor at the intermediate level—what is known
as level 3 and level 4—and at technician levels. As a country,
our skill profile remains rather poor compared to other countries.
Secondly, in my generation, you went into a job when you were 21,
post-university, and to some extent you trained in that job, carried
through with it and ended up with a nice inflation-linked pension and
so forth. That is no longer true, and most people will have to change
jobs throughout their
lives.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072463000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072463000055">If we
are going to upskill and reskill this current generation, it is vital
that we have the means of doing so. Part-time education—being
able to earn and learn at the same time, and upskill and
reskill—is vital to upgrading the skill profile of this country.
What can we do about it? One thing, certainly, is more publicity. We
need to make people aware that part-time education is there and can be
pursued. Secondly, picking up on what I was saying earlier about most
people doing small chunks of things, we need more flexible
courses that students can opt in and out
of—more modular courses and mixing and matching distance
learning, albeit backed up by the strong mentoring that the
Open University has stressed. If we are going to do that, we
need a proper credit transfer system. We really need to work
on that and get something much more
efficient.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072463000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072463000056">I
make a plea for more co-operation between higher education and further
education. I am appalled at the current situation where these two
sectors, which used to co-operate with each other, have been split
apart. Many of the universities that used to accredit graduate courses
in further education colleges have pulled out from accrediting them,
which makes for a very difficult situation. We certainly need to look
at these ELQ rules and ease up on
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072463000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072463000057">I put in
a plea for two incentives of some sort. One is for employers. There is
a tax credit for R&amp;D, where small companies that spend on R&amp;D
can claim an extra tax credit, which means that they can not only claim
it as an expense against tax but claim it twice over. We should look at
a similar scheme for education and training. If you spend money in
America on fees for part-time education, you can claim it against tax.
Why should we not be able to claim the money that we spend on training
ourselves against tax? I would like to see that
happen.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-24?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_24_PT_1/FB2CC20E315F569F7F5582324595967F571684B4" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 24 July 2013">Wednesday,

Rees of Ludlow:</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate the noble
Baroness on initiating this debate. My comments will focus on
universities as that is the sector I am familiar with. Universities
could surely develop more flexibility in two respects. First, there
should be a “credit” system that allows students to gain
intermediate qualifications as well as to intermit and to transfer more
readily between institutions. Secondly, universities should seize the
opportunities offered by the internet to extend their reach.</hs_para>

enrolment has hugely expanded since the student days of most of us.
However, this entirely welcome expansion has not been accompanied by
sufficient growth in the variety of the offerings of universities.
Nearly all of them still focus on degrees that take three or four
years. They are incentivised to aspire to rise in a single league
table—which, incidentally, under-weights things that really
matter but are hard to measure, such as how rigorous the courses are
and how hard the students work. The norm is, of course, for young
people to enter university more or less straight from school for
full-time study. A downside of higher enrolment levels is that career
opportunities for non-graduates are worse than they were in the
past.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072463000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072463000060">We
should recognise that degree-level competence need not be achieved by
continuous study in a traditional residential university. Moreover,
there is nothing magic about the specific level of achievement of a
degree. Credits, even if not sufficient for graduation, should be
formalised. It is surely better that universities should take risks on
admission, give students a chance, and let some leave after two years
with a credit. Some will continue after a gap, perhaps at another
institution. Others may pursue part-time distance learning. Even those
who go no further should not be typecast as wastage. An American will
say, “I had two years of college”, and will regard the
experience as
positive.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072463000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072463000061">Higher
education is a driver of social mobility. However, as Alan
Milburn and others have shown, mobility is stagnating. Young people who
have been unlucky in their schooling will not have at the age of 18 a
fair chance of access to a selective university even if they have great
potential. Worse still, generally they have no second chance. The
optimum solution to the problem is to enhance teaching at all schools
across the full geographical and social spectrum, but that will take a
long time. In the shorter term, we can widen opportunities by learning
something from the United
States.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072463000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072463000062">In
California, for instance, a substantial fraction of those who attend
the elite state university of Berkeley come not directly from high
school but as transfer students from a lower-tier college. Our most
selective universities should likewise earmark a proportion of their
places for students who do not come directly from school, but have
gained credits by studying at another institution, part-time or online.
The Open University’s OpenPlus programme, which offers two years
of part-time study, is very valuable. It allows students to get up to
speed so that they can be admitted into the second year of several
other
universities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072463000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072463000063">The
importance of mature students, part-time courses and distance learning
in the UK’s overall system is surely going to grow. That makes
last year’s drastic decline in enrolments, revealed by HEFCE,
especially worrying. It is perhaps an unintended consequence of the fee
structure, of perceptions of that system among potential students, and
of their lack of confidence in taking on debt even if loans are
available.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072463000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072463000064">Despite
the overall fall, the OU has to some extent bucked the trend
with a major campaign to explain the new loan scheme to
potential students. We should highlight and acclaim the special role of
that great institution. The OU model of distance learning supplemented
by a network of local tutors and mentors 
<?notus-xml column=514?>has vastly more potential in the era of the internet and smartphones
than when it was founded. We all have free access to the wonderful
material on the OpenLearn website, much of it prepared jointly with the
BBC. The OU can surely take a lead in the development of
so-called MOOCs: massive open online courses. The razzmatazz around
these courses comes from some very successful initiatives by Stanford
and other US universities. There are now two major organisations in the
US, edX and Coursera, which disseminate courses developed by leading
universities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072463000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072463000065">It
is excellent news that the Open University has set up a similar system
called FutureLearn. UK universities should eagerly seize the
opportunity to widen their impact and support the OU by contributing
material to FutureLearn rather than getting locked into one of the US
platforms. This is an arena where the UK has huge worldwide potential.
The Open University should have a competitive edge globally, especially
as some of its private-sector US counterparts have recently suffered
reputational damage. Distance learning will have a transformative
effect to the extent that it will threaten the future of many
traditional mass universities of the kind that exist in Italy and
India, which offer little more than lectures to large classes with
minimal
feedback.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072463000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072463000066">Finally,
I will mention another benign spin-off from the internet: the
democratisation of research as well as of learning. We are immersed in
a cyberspace that is ever more information-rich and sophisticated. Many
archives are now available on the web, which is a huge boon to scholars
around the world who are not close to a major library. To take a
specific example, amateur scholars are reading and transcribing
ships’ logbooks from the 18th and 19th centuries, which contain
fascinating social history as well as important data on the history of
climate change. The involvement of amateurs has been traditional in
sciences such as botany, but the scope for citizen-scientists is now
far wider. In my subject of astronomy, there are sometimes
so much data that the professionals cannot scrutinise them all fully.
It is now possible for eagle-eyed amateurs to access these datasets and
themselves discover new planets. Thanks to the internet, advances can
be disseminated rapidly, even throughout the developing world. Indeed,
more projects can now be done co-operatively and globally, rather like
improving open-source

are huge opportunities, but to exploit them for maximum benefit our
system needs a more diverse ecology and a blurring of the lines between
higher and further education, between full time and part
time—which is most relevant to this debate—and between
residential and online. We need a more effective transferable credit
system to facilitate transfers between institutions and to allow
continuing professional development. By so doing, we can exploit the
benefits of the internet, offer a more realistic second chance to young
people who have been unlucky in their early education, and promote
lifelong learning for us
all.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-24?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_24_PT_1/B07C76BDDCCAD4AE157B7E98CEE1AC5527EF91F8" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 24 July 2013">Wednesday,

public attention to the importance of part-time higher education. The

mind.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072466000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072466000003">During<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T18:16:59"></hs_TimeCode>
those many debates, as in this one, noble Lords agreed that the
economic evidence was unequivocal. The economy and the labour market
are changing with increasing rapidity. To keep up, most people will
have to adapt to many jobs, and several careers, during their working
lives. This can only be more marked as the age of retirement goes
up.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072466000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072466000004">My noble
friend Lord
Leitch<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T18:17:16"></hs_TimeCode>, in his
2006 <I>Review of Skills</I>, pointed out that 70% of the 2020
workforce had already completed compulsory education. He argued that to
meet the changing needs of employers more than 40% of adults should be
qualified to level 4 and above—in other words, equivalent to a
degree-level qualification. The figure is up from 29% in 2005. By
common agreement, that can be achieved only by increasing the level of
skills of those already in work as well as of young
learners.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072466000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072466000005">The
facts have not changed. What has changed is that, instead of a steady
increase in part-time study, we have seen a marked decline.
It is not a new phenomenon; it has been happening for a decade.
However, as other noble Lords have said, we appear to have reached
something of a crisis point. Between 2010-11 and 2012-13, the number of
new entrants to part-time undergraduate study in England declined by
40%. At a recent breakfast discussion hosted by the All-Party
Parliamentary University Group, we agreed that if this had happened to
full-time participation, we would have seen a national outcry. Instead,
there has been relatively muted comment in the media and even in
Parliament. Why is
this?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072466000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072466000006">One<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T18:18:39"></hs_TimeCode>
answer is that it is far harder to talk about part-time students as a
group. Their backgrounds and motivations are varied. They include large
numbers of people from low-participation backgrounds, and with low
skill levels, but a large proportion are already educated to degree
level. The most substantial proportion of part-time study is directly
linked to current employment, particularly in the public sector. On the
other hand, some are studying for reasons of personal development and a
love of
learning.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072466000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072466000007">There
are a few really striking facts, which Claire Callender and others have
done much to explain. Part-time students are more likely to be older
and more likely to be female compared to their full-time counterparts.
Some 63% of part-time students are female, compared with 56% of
full-timers; and 80% are over 25. Two-thirds have family
responsibilities and two in five have children, while 92% of full-time
students do not. With the exception of Birkbeck, they are concentrated
in the less research-intensive universities.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13072466000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072466000008">I wonder whether the
lack of interest in part-time trends is associated with assumptions and
prejudices which are familiar in so many other areas of policy. 
<?notus-xml column=516?>Are older female students invisible in higher education policy in the
same way as older women appear to be invisible in so many other parts
of public life? That would certainly be an illuminating area for
study.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072466000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072466000009">The
varied characteristics of part-time students make it difficult to
identify universal explanations for the decline in enrolment, but two
factors appear to be particularly important. The first is that for many
people considering starting—or returning to—higher
education in middle life, their response to the shift in government
funding to higher fees is very different from that of young learners.
If you have children or dependent parents—or both—a
mortgage or rising rent costs and are facing rising living costs, it
may be particularly hard to face any additional expenditure. This may
be especially true if you have to pay more for childcare and travel to
make study possible. You may be weighing this up against the need to
make a contribution to a pension for long-term security. It is clear
that the introduction of fee loans, though welcome, has not helped as
much as we might have
expected.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072466000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072466000010">The
second factor is the connection between part-time study and public
sector jobs. As the public sector shrinks, the proportion of people who
are supported by their employers may also be falling. There are
questions about whether private companies are willing to invest as much
in training or whether they are maintaining their investment but
focusing it on a smaller number of people. Certainly, anecdotal
evidence suggests that employers may be less willing to subsidise
career-enhancing study. The shift from public to private sector
employment may be narrowing
opportunities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072466000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072466000011">We
need to know much more about what is happening in particular sectors of
the economy, such as healthcare and education, where there is a
particularly high concentration of part-time students, and
where—if anywhere—employees are going for training if not
to universities. I commend the Government for commissioning
the Universities UK study, but I echo my noble friend in suggesting
that it is likely to be the beginning and not the end of the
conversation about how best to support and incentivise part-time higher
education.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072466000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072466000012">The
Government face a choice. Public funding is scarce. Policy options are
consequently limited. But I return to my original point. The evidence
of economic need has not changed. I would argue that the Government can
either pay now to encourage and support more people to study part-time
or they can pay later in the higher social and economic costs of
supporting people who cannot get jobs in a labour market that has
changed. There are short-term considerations but there are also
long-term imperatives. It cannot be right to see part-time
undergraduate—and, for that matter, postgraduate—higher
education shrink and do nothing about
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072466000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072466000013">I have two
immediate questions for the Minister. Will the Government consider
incentives for employers to make contributions towards part-time higher
education for their employees? Will they encourage HEFCE to provide
incentives to institutions to maintain or develop part-time provision?
Of course universities have to 
<?notus-xml column=517?>adapt, and I hope that the UUK report will help them think about how to
do that, but policy will need to adapt as
well.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13072466000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072466000044">6.23

one myth that I often find still needs to be exploded is the public
view of a typical university student as being 18 and leaving home to go
away and study for three years on a full-time course. As an
aide-memoire for the Committee, the seven speakers in this debate all
attended Russell Group universities and six went to
Oxbridge—very much the tradition for our era. I suspect that
none of us studied part-time. I was a mature student at Cambridge. The
offer for part-time students was very limited and did not fit in with
my job at the BBC so I had no choice. I would have loved to study
part-time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072466000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072466000016">We
need to celebrate a higher education system that has grown and
developed over recent years, recognising the needs of prospective
students and creating flexible courses that fit in with work and caring
duties, whether for children or other family members. Birkbeck College
and the Open University in particular have outstanding records in their
provision for part-time students in very different
ways—something to which other speakers have already
alluded.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072466000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072466000017">First,
despite some of the comments from other speakers, I want to
congratulate the Government on making part-time students eligible for
tuition fee loans. That is something that we have advocated from these
Benches for a very long time, and I am sure that in the longer term
there will be a real benefit to the part-time students who choose to
take out the loans rather than having to find commercial loans instead,
which I suspect put many off studying in the
past<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T18:25:13"></hs_TimeCode>. However,
the 40% drop that others have talked about is serious. For
whatever reason, individuals have not applied, and we need to advertise
that that support is available. Will the Government confirm that they
will be co-ordinating such a campaign, rather than leaving it to the
few institutions that rely heavily on part-time
students?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072466000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072466000018">Having
said that, I specifically commend the campaigns run by Birkbeck College
and the Open University, which are eye-catching and
encouraging. One such was the OU advertorial in <I>Metro</I> newspaper
about 10 days ago, with a quiz, a number of encouraging
personal stories from past and present students and information on how
to apply. I saw two people sitting next to me on my commuter
train doing the quiz. It really engaged them.</hs_para>

also led the way with FutureLearn. The noble Lord, Lord Rees, went into
that in some detail so I will not repeat it, but it is a groundbreaking
proposal that is now supported by 21 HEIs in this country.
It will provide free access for short courses via
MOOCs—obviously the phrase of the afternoon—a web-based
multi-university experience designed for a global audience.
Non-university partners in FutureLearn are also important, including
the British Council, the British Library and the British Museum, 
<?notus-xml column=518?>but the key is the OU’s expertise in distance
learning, which has been critical to getting this off the ground. These
courses, and the way in which students interact with each other as well
as with staff across the various institutions, is the learning
environment of the 21st
century.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072466000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072466000020">I
would like to see an HE and FE sector that works to bring
flexibility—real flexibility—to study for qualifications.
Someone who works full-time, has had experience of a couple of short
courses on the MOOC scheme and has acquired a taste for learning may
want to retain that flexibility when they study for a more formal
qualification such as a degree or even a shorter course with a number
of modules. That is why I am glad that we are at last beginning to see
credit accumulation and transfer taking off. Students can study a
number of modules, bank them and, at a later date, transfer to another
university to complete the next group of modules, and so on. The key to
CATs is universities recognising each other’s quality assurance,
and I am sorry to say that while a few HEIs are very good at this,
the number is too low, and this is certainly not discussed
enough.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072466000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072466000021">In the
late 1990s I helped to fund a project through my development agency to
look at CATs in the east of England. We had a fascinating research
proposal with some wonderful recommendations, which then
just gathered dust because none of the institutions was
prepared to take another on trust. What are the Government doing to
encourage more HEIs to work together to develop CATs, so that part-time
students really can study at the best time and place for them over a
longer period than the usual three to five years for an undergraduate
course? There are already mechanisms in place for storing a
student’s record in a “personal learning cloud”,
so that if they either transfer to a different university or take a
break, all the information is kept in one place. The Scottish
qualification system does this well, and England and Wales should take
a leaf out of its
book.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072466000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072466000022">I
welcome the Government’s increase in the Access to Learning Fund
to £50 million, and I hope that universities will further top it
up to give part-time students bursaries or some other chance of finding
support that was denied them in the past. Not all part-time students
work, and many are making large personal sacrifices to study. More
worryingly, the part-time premium grant to HEIs has been halved. This
is a key factor in the downward spiral of the number of part-time
students, even though the grant is a very internal university-oriented
one. It should be remedied as soon as funds
allow.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072466000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072466000023">Finally,
employers ought to have a key role working with universities to devise
the courses, especially as they are equal beneficiaries with the
learners. Local enterprise partnerships are important stakeholders in
securing more flexible skills provision and in promoting workforce
development. I hope that HEFCE is preparing to strengthen the
guidelines for widening participation budgets, and making HEIs

Stevenson of Balmacara:</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate my noble
friend Lady Bakewell on securing this timely debate, and on her
eloquent and important speech, delivered, as you would expect from a
broadcasting professional, in a very clear way and exactly to 10
minutes; I know that she was worrying about it, but she did very well.
I also thank all noble Lords for their contributions, which, again,
were of a very high standard. We have too few chances to debate higher
education policy, and have to take every opportunity. This, again, has
shown how important we think this topic is.</hs_para>

The noble Baroness, Lady Brinton, was right to research our
backgrounds; that shows something. However, I also claim in mitigation
that I did a part-time course for six years. I struggled; it was very
difficult. I finally succeeded, but I know something of which I am
about to speak.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13072466000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072466000029">We do not get much in
the way of public statements or chances to debate higher education
policy. The last time we had anything major was the White Paper,
<I>Higher Education: Students at the Heart of the System</I>, in June
2011. It says about part-time
students:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13072466000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072466000042">“For
the first time, students starting part-time undergraduate courses in
2012/13, many of whom are from non-traditional backgrounds, will be
entitled to an up-front loan to meet their tuition costs … This
is a major step in terms of opening up access to higher education, and
remedies a long-standing injustice in support for adult learners. Up to
around 175,000 part-time students will benefit”.</hs_quote>
<hs_parafo UID="13072466000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072466000040">As we have heard,
that has not happened. It is clear that the Government hoped that the
changes would open up access and stem the decline in part-time higher
education study, but it appears to have had the opposite effect. It is
clear from what we have heard today and the evidence that has been
presented that the Government are failing to deal with the serious
decline in part-time study The trends are worrying. Were they to
continue, they could have a genuinely damaging impact on our overall
skills base, which has 
<?notus-xml column=520?>been referred to. Towns and regions across the UK
that depend on people with higher-level qualifications will not have
them to fill available
jobs.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13072466000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072466000030">We
have heard in the debate about the benefits of part-time study, and the
way in which it transforms and provides significant benefits for those
studying part-time rather than full-time. It helps employers, society
and of course the individual. It is interesting that levels of
employment stability are high for part-time students, with 81% working
throughout their study. Employers value part-time study as a good model
to develop work-readiness in graduates and to provide existing
employees with skills and knowledge. Graduates have said in surveys
that part-time study has helped them develop as a person and improve
their self-confidence, so there are personal benefits as well. There is
no question that, if we are to provide the skills that we have heard we
need in this country, part-time has a role to play and is important in
itself.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072466000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072466000031">We
have also heard about the characteristics unique to part-time
undergraduate students, but more generally in the part-time population.
Many, some 80%, are over the age of 25 compared with full-time
students. Nearly two-thirds are female, as we have heard, compared with
56% of full-timers. However, most have to struggle to fit family and
work commitments around their studies. Entry requirements and the
qualifications the students pursue are also different. Some 81% of
part-time students, being employed, have to juggle many
responsibilities and obviously encounter
problems.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072466000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072466000032">We
often hear about the difficulties at Birkbeck and the Open
University. The assumption made is that the bulk of the
part-time student population studies there, but the facts show that 51%
of all part-time undergraduates study at 10 universities, and 77% study
at 40 of the UK’s 165 universities, so it is a widely spread
mode of
study.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072466000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072466000033">The
impact of the 2012-13 funding reforms has been explained. There was a
40% fall in the number of part-time students; Basingstoke fell off the
map. That is a striking metaphor. I am grateful to the noble Baroness,
Lady Sharp, for drawing it to our attention. I must try to remember it
when we come to discuss these issues. The fall was largely because of
changes in the fee structure and in the relative unwillingness of
part-time students to take out
loans.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072466000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072466000034">We
should look at this in more detail. Two-thirds of part-timers do not
qualify for loans, so the higher fees have to be paid from their own
pockets. High fees generally make part-time study a risky
investment. University tuition fees have a negative impact on
participation, and we know from general research that fee increases
tend to cause a general decline in participation, particularly among
students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Because many of the
students are already in work, financial returns for part-time study
tend to be lower than for younger, full-time students, and that has to
be taken into account. Given that many people in part-time study have
other responsibilities and costs, including mortgages, it is inevitable
that an income-contingent fee loan will be a
problem.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072466000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072466000035">What
should we do about this? It is clear from the debate that if we do
nothing, it is very likely that both the demand for and the supply of
part-time study will continue to decline. Part-time provision could
possibly 
<?notus-xml column=521?>disappear in some higher education institutions, which will threaten the
genuinely held belief in the value of lifelong learning. That is to be
regretted. My noble friend Lady Warwick made the very
important point that the need to acquire skills, and the benefit from
doing so, have not changed, yet the numbers are plunging. Basingstoke
is rapidly disappearing. We must do
something.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072466000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072466000036">Some
of the solutions that have come up today would be helpful. As the noble
Lord, Lord Rees, said, there is a need for a rethink on credit
accumulation, and a need to build on that as a way of getting FE
colleges and universities to collaborate. That must be a way forward in
future. It is clear from the evidence generated by the Open University
that providing a lot more information and advice at every level, with
greater collaboration across education and skills sectors, will have an
impact on those who might be considering part-time education. We should
learn from that. The Government should take on these
responsibilities.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13072466000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072466000037">We need more
understanding of why the 40% drop has happened. It is fairly clear that
it is to do with the financial system and the costs that would be borne
by individuals, but we must understand better the change in the
employment situation; whether people are coming from employment in the
public sector or private sector; whether that would have an impact on
whether they were released to do so; and whether their fees are paid.
As a number of noble Lords said, we need a wider debate about higher
education more generally—whether it should be full-time or
part-time, residential or online, concentrated or lifelong. These are
all important issues. They have not been discussed enough and they
should be brought
forward.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072466000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072466000038">The
wider issue that we started with, which was raised by my noble friend
Lady Bakewell, is how we convince people across the country that
part-time education is something of value, and that if we do not act
soon, it will be
lost.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-24?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_24_PT_1/3756A626ACCFD828B7A21FE02A618170E44B6EB0" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 24 July 2013">Wednesday,

Garden of Frognal:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, am most grateful to
the noble Baroness, Lady Bakewell, for the opportunity to consider this
important subject. The UK has a strong tradition of part-time
education, encompassing both degree-level study and vocational
qualifications. Institutions such as the Open University and Birkbeck,
of which the noble Baroness is president and about which she spoke so
eloquently, are an integral part of our education landscape. They
continue to lead the field in the provision of part-time study. Of
course, qualifications provide a public recognition of achievement at
the end of that
study.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072467000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072467000002">In
higher education the Government have made significant progress in
creating a flexible, dynamic system that offers students maximum choice
in where, when and how they study. Our reforms have delivered a
sustainable funding model as well as a renewed focus on teaching
excellence and student choice. We have introduced more financial
support for students and graduates and we have made a strong commitment
to social mobility. UCAS data show that entry rates for disadvantaged
18 year-olds reached a new high for England in 2012.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=522?><hs_para UID="13072467000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072467000003">However, we recognise
that the fall in part-time entrants is a cause for concern and I share
with the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, my noble friend’s dramatic
analogy that we are losing a Basingstoke in this—and I am sure
that none of us would wish to lose Basingstoke. We are working with the
sector to explore the reasons for the decline
but, as the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, pointed out, it is very
difficult to talk of a “group” of part-time
students because of their very wide diversity.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13072467000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072467000004">Higher education is an
excellent long-term investment and one of the best routes to a
rewarding career. The desire to study at university remains strong. For
2013 the application rate for 18 year-olds from England is at 35.5%,
the second highest on record. I have also heard the comments, from
around this Room and elsewhere, that young people are often not offered
valid alternatives to full-time higher education, and more needs to be
done in careers information advice and guidance to point out that there
are alternatives to three years of full-time university. We recently
had a week concentrating on apprentices. I have been out to visit some,
and it was quite interesting to hear how many of them were saying that
their parents and schools objected when they said, “What we want
to do is an apprenticeship”. We need alternatives to those three
years at university. It seems essential to me that we beef up all those
opportunities when young people are leaving school
particularly.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13072467000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072467000005">Research clearly
illustrates that, even in these difficult economic conditions, the
average net lifetime earnings benefit for those with a degree compared
to those with just A-levels is comfortably over £100,000. We
recognise that part-time adult education is an important route to
higher-level learning and skills. It enables flexible study and plays a
significant role in raising and updating the skills and qualifications
of people already in employment. My noble friend Lady Sharp mentioned
the need for upskilling and reskilling. That is one of the real aspects
of the needs of our workforce in these days, and of course part-time
study can play a very significant part in that. Research carried out in
2012 demonstrated the positive effects of part-time higher education
for individuals, employers and the wider economy. It found that
part-time study boosts economic, cultural and social development, and
indeed can transform people’s lives.</hs_para>

working hard to create a more level playing field for part-time
students. I was grateful for the acknowledgement by my noble friends
Lady Brinton and Lady Sharp of the attempts to level the playing field
by way of funding. As a key plank of our higher education reforms, new
part-time students became eligible for non-means-tested tuition fee
loans for the first time in 2012, responding to long-standing sector
demand. This has significantly increased the number of students
eligible for government support, but what we have to ask is why that is
not reflected in the number of students actually taking it up. The
provisions on the repayments start date for part-time students were
made more generous, following representations from this House, but I
agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Bakewell, that more clarity over
the funding available is
imperative<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T18:43:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

<?notus-xml column=523?><hs_para UID="13072467000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072467000007">Unlike for full-time
students, the Government have placed no limit on the number of
part-time students whom institutions may recruit, so institutions can
expand their provision if there is demand from prospective students.
Undergraduate part-time entrant numbers have been declining since their
peak in 2008-09, the year when the previous Government
introduced the equivalent and lower qualifications policy. As the
Committee knows, that means that students qualifying for a
qualification equivalent to or lower than the one that they already
hold are not eligible for student support, and their institution does
not receive HEFCE funding in respect of them. Both my noble friend Lady
Sharp and the noble Baroness, Lady Bakewell, flagged up the
problems of the ELQ in relation to enabling funding for students who
would wish to take part-time funding. We hope that this will be part of
the Universities UK review, which we await in October, because it has
become a real issue. However, with all these options, we have to
consider the priorities and what is affordable within spending
limits<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T18:44:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072467000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072467000008">The
Government and the sector are working together to explore what more we
can do to support part-time study. We need to understand the evidence
on the part-time market. HEFCE is monitoring changes in demand and
supply. As I have mentioned, Universities UK is undertaking a review
which it will publish in October. The noble Lord, Lord Stevenson,
commented that we do not debate higher education often enough in the
Chamber; I am quite sure that that review will give us an opportunity
once again to raise this very important subject. We hope that it will
encourage the adoption of best practice and offer recommendations to
support part-time
study.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072467000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072467000009">We are
also increasing our efforts to communicate the benefits of higher
education and the financial support available to part-time students.
Both my noble friend Lady Brinton and the noble Baroness, Lady
Bakewell, mentioned the importance of communication. Our communications
activity for 2013 has elements focused specifically on part-time
applicants. This includes our student finance tour, which will be
visiting further education colleges up and down the country, and
digital advertising on key websites visited by prospective applicants,
which have already been
mentioned.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072467000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072467000010">The
Student Loans Company is open for applications for part-time student
finance nearly four months earlier than last year. Its partnership with
The Student Room provides dedicated information on finance for
part-time students. For the first time, the UCAS website carries
messages highlighting financial support for part-time study and
features a new search tool which lists the Open University’s
part-time courses. The next phase of this tool will allow all other
members to display their part-time courses on UCAS.com, because, as the
noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, pointed out, many universities offer
part-time
provision<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T18:46:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072467000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072467000011">The
noble Lord, Lord Rees, and my noble friend Lady Brinton focused on the
exciting development of the MOOCs, the massive open online courses.
Many UK universities are now developing free online courses that are
attracting thousands of new learners. In collaboration with a number of
partner universities, the Open University is developing the UK’s
first online 
<?notus-xml column=524?>MOOC platform, FutureLearn, to be launched later this year. I entirely
agree with the noble Lord, Lord Rees, that a UK version of this would
be an exciting development and mean that we would not always be
dependent on what the US is providing—although it is very often
a leader in such fields. Opportunities such as these help to facilitate
mobility, increase our knowledge economy and support lifelong learning,
which, as we know, brings benefit to the country and enriches
lives<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T18:47:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072467000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072467000012">My
noble friend Lady Sharp mentioned the changes in employment over the
years and the fact that people do not now go into one secure job. The
chances are that they will change job any number of times
and therefore need to upskill and reskill to keep abreast.
We were hearing today from employers who find it almost impossible to
recruit the number of skilled local employees that they need in spite
of the job opportunities being there. Something is definitely not going
right in the transition between schools and
work<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T18:48:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072467000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072467000013">My
noble friend mentioned credit transfers, as did the noble Lord, Lord
Rees, and my noble friend Lady Brinton, and transfer between
universities, as happens from time to time with some universities in
the US and other parts of the world. I remember years ago working on
national vocational qualifications for transfer of units there between
awarding bodies. It seemed to be relatively straightforward, but I have
to say that it was anything but. I also remember, 20-odd years ago,
working with universities on possibility for credit transfers.
Universities cherish their autonomy. It became increasingly obvious
that this would be a very bitty operation and that it was unlikely that
we would secure the motivation among all universities to co-operate in
that
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T18:49:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072467000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072467000014">My
noble friend Lady Sharp mentioned a possible tax system for employers.
We understand that the UUK review will explore ways to incentivise
employers to support part-time study—the noble Baroness, Lady

consider those
recommendations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T18:49:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072467000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072467000015">The
noble Lord, Lord Rees, also mentioned universities setting aside places
for second-chance students. We come back to the same
problem—universities are in control of their own admissions
policies and it is for them to consider applications from all
non-traditional applicants. Of course, many universities already
consider those with non-traditional qualifications, but that is very
far from
universal.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072467000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072467000016">The
noble Baronesses, Lady Warwick and Lady Bakewell, mentioned the fact
that very often part-time study is an attractive option for women. The
Government are committed to making higher education accessible for all.
There has been tremendous, rapid achievement for women but I note the
rather negative connotation that the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, put
upon it. As for higher education supporting access, by 2014
universities are expecting to spend £684.5 million on access,
including financial support, outreach and student success. Obviously,
the contribution of employers and partnerships between HEIs
and local enterprise partnerships will be critical if we are to get the
results that we
wish.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072467000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072467000017">Our
world-class colleges and universities have responded well to the
Government’s reforms. There is a new focus on the student
experience, greater social 
<?notus-xml column=525?>mobility and greater flexibility in ways of studying
and in funding. According to the World Bank, the funding system is
exemplary, and the OECD says that ours is the only sustainable system
in Europe. But we have much more to do. We will be working with the
sector to monitor the changing demand for part-time study and to
promote the opportunities available.</hs_para>

Harries of Pentregarth:</Member></B> My Lords,
violations of basic human rights in West Papua are not only continuing
but becoming more frequent. In 2012-13 there were numerous incidents of
West Papuans being shot, arrested and tortured simply for taking part
in peaceful demonstrations. Leaders of the West Papua National
Committee—the KNPB—are particularly targeted. To give
just one example, at a peaceful demonstration on 1 May this year, three
Papuans were shot—killings which were rightly condemned by both
the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, and Amnesty
International. A list of 30 such incidents involving arrests for
peaceful protests in just two weeks in April and May this year was sent
to the OHCHR in Geneva by TAPOL on behalf of eight international
organisations concerned with West
Papua.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072467000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072467000020">It will
therefore be no surprise to learn that in 2012 alone there were some
200 political arrests and that there are at least 40 political
prisoners in jail. Raising a West Papuan flag, for example, can lead to
a charge carrying a life sentence. At the same time, sweeping
operations by the Indonesian military in the highlands of West Papua
continued throughout 2012-13, displacing thousands of villagers, with
homes being burned and subsistence crops destroyed, as reported by the
Asian Human Rights Commission. Despite the fact that foreign reporters
and NGOs are severely restricted in their attempts to enter and report
on what is going on —an issue that other noble Lords will
raise—these facts are becoming ever more widely known in the
world
outside.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072467000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072467000021">I
know that our Government are aware of and concerned about these human
rights abuses, as they have made clear in their Answers to several
Parliamentary Questions. However, is it not also a matter of concern
that an Indonesian counterterrorism unit, Special Detachment 88,
trained by the UK, is believed to be operating in Papua, targeting
leaders of the independence unit? We know that the training for this
detachment includes issues of human rights, but we do not know whether
that has had any effect at all on its operations. In view of the fact
that human rights abuses are 
<?notus-xml column=526?>increasing, will the Minister ask the Foreign Office to undertake, as a
matter of urgency, an impact assessment of the training that this
detachment is receiving to see whether in fact it is making any
difference at
all?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072467000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072467000022">Juan
Mendez, the UN special adviser on the prevention of genocide, wrote in
2008 that West Papua was among those countries whose populations were
“at risk of extinction”—a very serious charge.
With the huge influx of Indonesians from Jakarta, the West
Papuans are in danger of becoming a minority in their own
country.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13072467000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072467000023">What
are the Indonesian Government and the Indonesian elite in West Papua
doing about this very serious situation? The policy in recent years has
been to divide the country into two provinces, West Papua and Papua,
give a degree of local autonomy to each one, deliver economic benefits
and hope that this will lead to an end to the increasing unrest. The
International Crisis Group, in its thorough and balanced 30-page report
of last August, provided as part of the Library’s helpful
briefing for this debate, evaluated that policy in these
words:</hs_para>
<hs_quote UID="13072467000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072467000093">“To date the

Indonesian Government can see the failure, a special organisation, the
Unit for the Acceleration of Development in Papua and West Papua,
called UP4B, has been set up through presidential decrees to achieve
what its name suggests. The polite language of the International Crisis
Group’s report, in the chapter entitled “UP4B: Good
Intentions, Diminished Hopes”, cannot disguise the fact that
this policy continues to fail very badly. There is failure at the
economic level—very little of the huge wealth being generated in
this oil and mineral-rich country is being channelled to the people
whose land it is—and there is a fundamental failure at a
political level to engage in a political process with
representative leaders of the indigenous people. Does the Minister
agree that there is no serious chance of progress in West Papua unless
the Government in Jakarta set up a serious process of engagement with
West Papuan leaders, and will they urge them to do
so?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072467000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072467000025">I know
that Indonesia is an important ally in the worldwide fight against
terrorism and has made big strides in recent years towards genuine
democracy in some parts of its legitimate territory. Our own country,
like Australia, has important business links with it. West Papua has
vast oil and mineral wealth; BP alone has a £7.5 billion stake
in it. We can all understand the pressures of realpolitik coming from
both Governments, to whom we need to relate, and international
capitalism, whose money is needed for development.</hs_para>

cannot be hidden forever. The 1962 New York agreement signed
between the Netherlands, Indonesia and the United Nations guaranteed an
“act of self-determination” for the people of West Papua.
In 1969 that so-called Act of Free Choice took place. On 13 December

first question that arises in my mind is whether that 70% and 80% of
the royalties has been going to the West Papuan people. Is there any
evidence of this? More fundamentally, the special autonomy measure has
now been in place for 13 years. It has had plenty of time to embed and
show results. What is revealed is the total failure of the policy
itself, because it fails to address the fundamental issue, namely the
political aspirations of the indigenous people. Given that the former
UN Under-Secretary-General, Chakravarthi Narasimhan, admitted publicly
in 2004 that the 1969 so-called Act of Free Choice was in effect a
sham, will the Government join with International Parliamentarians for
West Papua and International Lawyers for West Papua in asking the UN to
conduct an inquiry into what happened in 1969 and then to instigate a
referendum on the issue in West Papua
itself?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072467000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072467000028">Given
the 2010 referendum on self-determination in South Sudan and the
upcoming referendums on independence in New
Caledonia—Kanaky—Bougainville and Scotland, and bearing
in mind what happened in East Timor, would it not be prudent, as well
as absolutely right, to press for a true, internationally monitored

the Indonesian Government might wish that it

Kilclooney:</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate the noble and right
reverend Lord, Lord Harries, on securing this debate today. This is a
subject that I knew nothing about until I came to the House of Lords. I
place it on the record that the people of West Papua owe much to the
noble and right reverend Lord for the way in which he has raised this
subject throughout the past 10 years since I first came across it. It
is a subject that is rarely mentioned in the press and the rest of the
media or by the Government. It is not only a tragedy but, in the
context of many tragedies around this world, one of the worst that I
have come across—and living on the island of Ireland, I know
what tragedies are.</hs_para>

problems of the modern world is that the Islamic and Christian worlds
are given the impression that they are in conflict. I reject that. As a
Christian myself, I accept that Islam and Christianity both believe in
God and both accept the reality of Jesus—one as a saviour and
the other as a prophet. We have much in common and should not be seen
to be in conflict or presented by some people as being in
conflict. After all, it was the western world that came to the rescue
of Islam in Kosovo, where my son fought; in Bosnia, where my daughter
fought; and even in Kuwait, where we relieved the Islamic people of
Kuwait when they were invaded. We should take credit for these
instances where we came to the rescue of Islam, and should not always
allow ourselves to be portrayed as people who are opposed to
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072467000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072467000031">Of course,
Islam is facing a great crisis, mainly between the Sunni and the Shia,
and not just in Syria. It is happening right across the Middle East and
north Africa, in Pakistan and in Indonesia, where the Shia are
encountering problems with the Sunni majority. Indonesia is one of the
great countries of the world today. It is the largest Islamic country
in the world. It has a growing economy, so the United Kingdom requires
a good relationship with that great nation. It is 86%
Islamic and 9% Christian, and within it is West Papua which, as was
mentioned by the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, has a
population of around 800,000 of whom 55% are Christian and 40% are
Muslim. It is the Christians in West Papua who are experiencing
problems so far as freedoms are concerned. I recommend highly to anyone
who reads the <I>Hansard</I> report of this debate that they should
look at the House of Lords Library briefing pack because it is
excellent. It goes into every detail of the atrocities that are taking
place in West Papua. I could not go into that detail in the time
available today, but I recommend the document.</hs_para>

Papua is rather sad because, after the Dutch left, the Indonesians
invaded it in 1961. By 1969 the United Nations had shown an
interest, saying that there should be, as the noble and right reverend
Lord, Lord Harries, said, an Act of Free Choice. However, I underline
what has just been said: there was no free choice. In fact, the
Indonesians selected 1,000 chosen people to vote on behalf of the
entire West Papuan population. They selected who could vote and more or
less told them how to vote. They said that that was how democracy
worked, that West Papua had expressed its opinion and that it wanted to
be part of the Indonesian nation. Regrettably, there are now almost
daily atrocities that are never reported in the media. The silence of
the world on the tragedy of West Papua is amazing. There is hardly any
government structure in the province, and certainly no one that you can
really talk to in order to get the consent of the population. The
international bodies and the United Nations itself, with their
disregard of what is going on in West Papua, have been shameful in
their attitude. They have ignored the tragedy of that part of
Indonesia.</hs_para>

that the people of West Papua—I stress “the
people”—never voted to be part of Indonesia? Does she
accept that there are continual killings and a denial of human rights
in West Papua today? It is time that we had clear answers to these 
<?notus-xml column=529?>allegations. When did Her Majesty’s Government last raise the
issue of West Papua with Indonesia? I ask that because it is
very important. In fairness, I think that the Prime Minister, Mr
Cameron, did raise it, but I want that confirmed in the debate
today.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13072467000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072467000034">Of
course, it is hard to know what is going on day to day in West Papua if
the press are forbidden to visit it in order to see what is happening
and report on it openly. Freedom of the press is one of the essentials
of democracy, so it is important that the press are given access to
West Papua. As we know from the Belfast agreement talks, there can be a
security solution or there can be a political solution. In a divided
society like West Papua, there is no security solution. The more you
apply security pressures, the more the opposition to the established
Government will increase. The way forward must be through political
dialogue, and I suggest that in their own interests the Indonesians,
for whom I have great sympathy and whom I support—I repeat that
it is a great country that we need to be friendly with—should
develop a dialogue with West Papua. People may ask, “But with
who? Who are the leaders in West Papua? How can you negotiate with them
or have a dialogue?”. I suggest that the Indonesian Government
should start a dialogue with the church leaders under the chairmanship
of an independent statesman drawn from outside. That would be a
beginning.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-24?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_24_PT_1/D47A81A2FDDAC66EC6B036630A8F5F97C546509B" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 24 July 2013">Wednesday,

declare a previous interest: from 2001 to 2009, I visited West
Papua—which for the purposes of this debate, as the noble and
right reverend Lord said in his introduction, is taken as comprising
the two Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua—annually as
a member of an independent panel set up by BP to offer the company
advice on what can loosely be described as the performance of its
corporate social responsibility in connection with the development of a
large natural gas field situated under the waters of Bintuni Bay in the
Bird’s Head region of West Papua, and a liquefied natural gas
plant on the southern shore of the bay.</hs_para>

former US Senator George Mitchell, visited Papua every year. We had
talks with government and parliamentary leaders and NGOs in the
capitals of the two provinces, Jayapura and Manokwari. We visited the
sites for meetings with BP and its contractors and we held what the
Americans would call town hall meetings in each of the 10 or so
directly affected villages neighbouring the sites. We then discussed
our findings with Indonesian Ministers and international agencies such
as the World Bank in Jakarta, and presented the company with
our recommendations. While I would not claim to be a genuine expert on
West Papua, I have some familiarity with the region and its
problems.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072467000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072467000038">It
is certainly extremely welcome that the noble and right reverend Lord,
Lord Harries, has initiated this debate. That there have been and still
are abuses of 
<?notus-xml column=530?>human rights in West Papua, mainly committed by
members of the Indonesian armed forces and police, is really not in
doubt. But because of what I regard as the Indonesian
Government’s misguided policy of banning visits to the provinces
by international journalists and NGOs, too little is known about these
abuses, their nature and the background to them. Where
secrecy prevails, rumour and allegations flourish, which is why I
regard the Indonesian Government’s policy as
misguided.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072467000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072467000039">One
part of the background that needs to be borne in mind is the massive
size of West Papua and the sparsity of its population. They
may be the poorest provinces of Indonesia but they are also the least
populous. Those areas where the most abuses have taken place—the
two provincial capitals, the mountainous regions along the
international boundary with Papua New Guinea, and the area around the
huge copper and gold mine being operated by Freeport-McMoRan at
Timika—are often separated by hundreds of miles of
trackless jungle from other, largely peaceful parts of the
two
provinces.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072467000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072467000040">To
address the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, about faith
relationships, another dimension is the peaceful coexistence across
most of the provinces of communities of Catholics, Protestants and
Muslims. In the villages around Bintuni Bay, it was normal to find
Catholic and Protestant churches and a mosque in the same
village.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072467000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072467000041">As
one of the Muslim imams said to us when the panel talked to him,
“Please do nothing to disturb the amity in which our communities
have lived for many centuries”. That was sage advice, and the
Indonesian Government, often beset elsewhere in the country with acute
interfaith tensions, would do well to heed
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T19:14:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072467000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0001.htm#13072467000042">What
can be done to avoid the human rights abuses that take place? Part of
the solution lies in better training for, and tighter control over, the
Indonesian military and police. I look forward to the Minister
responding to the point that was made by the noble and right reverend
Lord, Lord Harries, about the training that we give them, the effect
that it has and whether we have any evidence that it is actually
producing better performance. Just as important as that is to make a
living reality, not just a paper reality, of the regional autonomy that
Indonesia has granted to its provinces. Raising the living standards
and the access to healthcare and to education of indigenous
populations, which are among the poorest in the world, is
another.</hs_para>

all, the Indonesian Government need to demonstrate respect for the
cultural particularities and identity of indigenous Papuans. These are
real and based on centuries of history. Any attempt to homogenise the
provinces to a kind of Indonesian norm, or to encourage substantial
inward migration from other parts of Indonesia, would inevitably raise
tensions and lead to the sort of incidents at which human rights abuses
have occurred and are still occurring. As the example of East Timor
showed, a policy of repression is only too likely to be
counterproductive; it is far better to pursue the objective of
reconciling Papuans to their continuance as a part of Indonesia by
generous policies of regional autonomy and economic development. To be
fair, these are the proclaimed policies of the
Administration of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, but too often in
the past practical application has diverged from these admirable
objectives<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T19:16:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

role should Britain play in all this? We should certainly not just
snipe from the sidelines when allegations of human rights abuses are
brought up, although we should not turn a blind eye to them. We should
also do our best, I suggest, through our aid programme, the provision
of training and scholarships and the enlargement of responsible inward
investment—such as I believe BP has provided in the Tangguh
project, which is now undergoing rapid expansion—to create the
conditions and the capacity-building that will encourage Papuans to
believe that a peaceful and prosperous future is not beyond their
reach. I hope that the Minister can say something about the way in
which the Government are playing a positive role in West

Avebury:</Member></B> My Lords, the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord
Harries, reminded us of the betrayal by the UN of the people of West
Papua after Indonesia invaded and occupied the territory in 1961; it
then connived with the so-called Act of Free Choice, when 1,000
handpicked men were coerced into ratifying the annexation. Today,
unfortunately, the UN seems just as helpless in dealing with the gross
and persistent violations of human rights inflicted on the occupied
people, of which a great many examples were given recently to the Human
Rights Committee, including a 53-page report from Amnesty
International. Another was a report by TAPOL, which campaigns for
democracy and human rights in Indonesia, and I declare an interest as
its honorary president, having been connected with it and its
distinguished founder, Carmel Budiardjo, for the 40 years of its
existence.</hs_para>

some of the 200 political arrests in the territory in 2012. A number
were shot, some of them fatally, while allegedly resisting
arrest. Those who continue to speak about self-determination
for the territory, as they have every right to do under
Article 1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,
risk prosecution under Article 106 of the criminal code, which
prescribes life imprisonment for any attempt to separate a part of the
state. I hope that the Prime Minister will invite President SBY to
visit the UK in September next year so that he can see how
we deal with demands for self-determination in this
country.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072467000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0002.htm#13072467000047">The
Indonesians should recall their own experiences with East Timor,
mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, which achieved independence,
and Aceh, which gained a substantial degree of autonomy, after long and
bloody struggles. In both cases, the results were achieved through
dialogue, as I remember from having been an adviser at the talks
between the Indonesians and the Free Aceh Movement between 2000 and
2002. That process, and the agreement subsequently moderated by former
President Martti Ahtisaari of Finland, could form a model for
eliminating the causes of human rights violations in West Papua, rather
than Indonesia pursuing futile attempts to eradicate the movement for
self-determination by military force and draconian
laws.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072467000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0002.htm#13072467000048">The
results of the present policies are illustrated by a report from Human
Rights Watch focusing on violence, impunity and the denial of access to
foreign journalists and the UN special procedures. The UN special

again in 2008, but has never received a reply. This came up at the
Human Rights Council, but in the 208 paragraphs of the

reference to the egregious denial of the UN special procedures’
right of access to perform their
duties.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072467000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0002.htm#13072467000049">Navi
Pillay, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, issued a statement
in May calling on Indonesia to allow visits by journalists and by the
UN special procedures. A visit by the UN special rapporteur on freedom
of expression, which had been scheduled for January, was postponed
indefinitely. The UK was among the states that echoed the
demand that they be admitted, and I hope my noble friend can tell your
Lordships what further steps can be taken by the UN Human Rights
Council, or what else can be done, to deal with the open defiance of
the UN’s authority. I recognise that it would be difficult to
get agreement on raising the powers of the UN’s human rights
mechanism, but does my noble friend agree that if there are no
coalitions of the willing ready to impose penalties on recalcitrant
states, it is only to be expected that those states will ignore the
Human Rights Council, as Indonesia

Government say that there is freedom of the press, that people
criticise the Government and that there is no bar even on separatist

provides a clue as to why Jakarta is so paranoid. As we heard from the
noble Lord, Lord Hannay, West Papua is a land of immense mineral and
forestry wealth and the Indonesians do not want outsiders

operates the largest gold and copper mine in the world, are causing

the coalition, the previous Labour Government believed that the complex
issues in Papua can best be resolved through peaceful dialogue between
the people of Papua and the Government of Indonesia. The previous

as we have heard in today’s debate, the picture in West Papua is
not one of progress but one of increased violence and repression.
Indonesia’s treason laws continue to be used to punish free
expression. Peaceful demonstrations are banned and attacked by the
security services. In the past 12 months there have been numerous
incidents of Papuans being shot, poisoned, arrested and tortured for
taking part in peaceful demonstrations and other activities associated
with independence
aspirations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072467000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0002.htm#13072467000058">As
the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, reminded us, the most
recent example was the peaceful demonstrations on 1 May 2013 to mark 50
years of Indonesian control over West Papua. Three Papuans were fatally
shot. Following this, a demonstration was planned to commemorate the
three people who were killed. The local police banned the
demonstration, which took place anyway. The demonstration was
repeatedly attacked by police, and four members of the West Papuan
National Committee, including its chairman, were arrested and
reportedly
tortured.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072467000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0002.htm#13072467000059">In
contrast to these actions, the Indonesian Government, as we have heard,
talked of the special autonomy measures established through
presidential decree in 2011, which they claimed would accelerate
development in Papua and West Papua. Programmes related to the
enhancement of food security, poverty eradication, community-based
economic development, education, health and basic infrastructures are,
they say, their key focus. However, as the noble and right reverend

highlighted the ongoing violence in Papua and deplored the excessive
use of force by the Indonesian security forces. It, too, highlighted
the fact that there is no effective mechanism to hold members of the
military accountable. As we have heard, some 70 extrajudicial killings
had recently taken place in Papua, but no one was prosecuted. Impunity
had become a structural problem in Indonesia. Criminal prosecutions and
sanctions were appropriate measures to combat police violence and had
to be implemented. The committee’s clear view was that such
violations were likely to continue until Indonesia takes measures to
develop effective complaints procedures.</hs_para>

noble Lords have done today, the Government condemn all violations of
human rights, no matter who the victim. Violations in Papua have been
committed by the security forces as well as by those who claim to be
striving for the rights of Papuan people. Verifying the details is
often difficult given the remoteness of the region. We have heard from
the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, about Papuans who have
tragically paid with their lives. We also saw the appalling murder of
eight Indonesian military personnel in February this year. Non-ethnic
Papuans based in the highlands have been attacked and killed, and a
German tourist was shot in May 2012.</hs_para>

upon those voicing their political opinion are also cause for concern.
Lengthy jail terms have been handed down for holding peaceful protests,
and I pay tribute to the NGOs and their staff who work tirelessly to
support these prisoners. Freedom of religion and belief and freedom of
expression were raised at the universal periodic review. The invitation
to the UN special rapporteur on freedom of expression to visit

place soon.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072467000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0002.htm#13072467000077">I
echo the concerns raised by the noble Lord, Lord Collins of Highbury,
about journalists, NGOs and international
organisations—including the International Red Cross, which has
extremely limited access to Papua —and we have raised
these with the Government of Indonesia at all levels. As the noble
Lord, Lord Hannay, reminded us, without opening Papua up, there is a
risk of misreporting or incidents being misrepresented. Incidents will
remain hard to verify as long as Papua remains
closed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072467000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724-gc0002.htm#13072467000078">The
Government are resolute in demanding that human rights be respected by
all in Papua. We make this absolutely clear to the Indonesian
Government at the highest levels. In the past 12 months alone, my right
honourable friend the Prime Minister and President Yudhoyono discussed
Papua when they met in November during the state visit—I can
confirm that on the record. The human rights situation in
Papua also features regularly in our discussions with the Indonesian
Foreign 
<?notus-xml column=537?>Minister and the governor of Papua. British embassy staff visit the
region regularly. As my noble friend Lord Howell of
Guildford informed the House last year, in May 2012, as part of the
universal periodic review, we, along with other UN members had an
opportunity to comment on human rights progress in Indonesia.</hs_para>

Indonesia. The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-24T19:40:08"></hs_TimeCode>
noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, raised the issue of human rights
violations generally, and how far these concerns had been raised. I
have already explained how these issues have been raised at the
presidential level. I can, however, tell him that last September the
ambassador visited Papua and met senior military and police officials,
emphasising the need to respect human rights and ensure full and
transparent investigations into any violent incidents, and only in
April of this year, the British ambassador discussed the situation in
Papua with the new governor of the province.</hs_para>

fundamental and based on universal values. They are not there to be
invoked only when economic conditions allow. Even so, a myriad of
social, political and economic influences often lie behind human rights
abuses, and these must also be addressed. The UK will therefore
continue to encourage meaningful progress on governance issues,
including the full implementation of the special autonomy law for the
provinces of Papua and West Papua. We also support the increased focus
on economic and social development to which the Government have
committed themselves in order to address the widespread poverty in the
region, especially among ethnic Papuans.</hs_para>

Collins, referred to the position of previous Governments on the
political status of Papua. Of course, ours remains the same: the UK
supports the territorial integrity of the Republic of Indonesia and
does not support calls for the independence of Papua. Like the noble
Lord, Lord Kilclooney, I recognise that the events surrounding the 1969
Act of Free Choice continue to be a focus of controversy for many with
an interest in Papua and West Papua. The UK was not party to the
process and we have no plans to support a review of the Act. All

Law Enforcement Co-operation, which includes officers from Densus 88,
takes place within a framework of respect for the rule of law and a
commitment to upholding human rights obligations in compliance with UK

rooted firmly in the importance of upholding human rights in
counterterrorism investigations. Each training course contains a
specific 
<?notus-xml column=538?>module on these obligations. There have been impact assessments; I think
that there was one in 2011. However, for operational reasons we would

classroom-based training programmes. We also deliver a regional course

DfID is providing £10 million of funding from 2013 to 2015 which

United Kingdom has an important and wide-ranging relationship with
Indonesia, aspects of which I have outlined this evening. It is a

situation in Papua is of concern and that we should continue to speak
out against violations, whoever commits them, which contravene human
rights and international law. Greater accountability and transparency
are needed regarding abuses committed both by the Indonesian security
forces and by Papuan armed groups. All those with a stake in
Papua’s future need constructively to engage in peaceful
dialogue as a way to resolve their grievances. I firmly believe that it
is possible for Papua to enjoy the same level of peace, stability and
prosperity that is seen elsewhere in Indonesia. That is, after all, in
the interests of all Papuan people. However, it will take commitment
from all sides. We believe that the Indonesian Government are genuinely
committed to addressing these challenges and we hope that others will
join us in supporting their efforts.</hs_para>

occupational disease caused by exposure to asbestos, with sufferers

Despite this, there is evidence that around 50% of claims for
compensation take over 12 months to settle; which means that victims
may die before their claim is paid

parents most often occurs where the parent in question is a foreign
national offender who is detained pending deportation or removal from
the UK at the end of a prison sentence. When deciding whether to detain
parents in such circumstances, consideration must take account of the
best interests of the child and how their parent's continued detention
beyond their prison sentence may impact on them, striking a careful
balance between the welfare of the child and the risk of harm posed to
the public by the parent. The same considerations apply to the regular
reviews of detention carried out in each case should detention be
authorised. This is in line with the statutory duty under section 55 of
the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 to have regard to the
need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children in the

Gardiner of Kimble:</Member> HMG is working closely with industry to
ensure that as far as possible, children will be
unable to access or accidentally view this type of material. We are
working with the main public Wi-Fi providers, so that from the end of
the year those who do not already, will offer family-friendly Wi-Fi in
public places, where children may be present. All the main ISPs
currently offer free parental control tools to all customers –
new and existing - but since the end of 2012 all new customers face an
unavoidable choice about whether or not to set up filters. All the main
providers by the end of 2013 will implement ‘whole-home’
/ network-level filtering (which covers every device in the home). If
people choose not to engage with the set-up steps (for example, if they
just repeatedly click ‘yes’ to get through set-up
quickly) then that would lead to protection being on rather than off.
Closed loop age verification will ensure that people are informed if
their parental controls settings have been
changed.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question"><hs_DebateHeading UID="13072447000495" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130724w0001.htm#13072447000495">Israel
