in the country. The Institute and Faculty of Actuaries has released
information showing that the number of third-party whiplash claims rose
by 5% in the year 2010-11, although the number of accidents fell.
According to the institute’s chairman, 60% of the claims were
exaggerated, misrepresented or fraudulent. Will the Secretary of State

accident.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070275000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0001.htm#13070275000053"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mrs Grant" PimsId="5562" UID="13070275001437" xid="1106" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0001.htm#13070275001437">Mrs

committed to tackling fraudulent whiplash claims, while also ensuring
that those with genuine neck injuries receive the compensation that
they need and 
<?notus-xml column=730?>deserve. Making the system fairer for defendants does not, of course,

Jones</B> (Warrington North) (Lab):</Member> As the Minister knows, the
vast majority of claims are genuine. Rather than being obsessed with
this issue, should not the Government be targeting some of the
practices of the insurance industry, such as cold-calling victims or
referring them to its in-house lawyers in the hope of settling claims
cheaply? Why are the Government not doing that? Is it because, again,

the test. We think it is important to test on a random, and perhaps
frequent, basis. We entirely agree with him and his Committee, however,

finger on a big gap in the system up to this point in that those
offenders who receive a custodial sentence of 12 months or less receive
very little or no supervision at all. It is very important that they
should, because that is the group with the highest rates of
reoffending. Some 60% reoffend within 12 months. We need to address

I do not agree with her. This is an important and urgent reform. She
must recognise that every single year 600,000 offences are committed by
people who have previously committed an offence. Until we start to
address reoffending effectively, that number will not come down and we
will not avoid the creation of tens of thousands of new victims every
year. That is why this is urgent. As far as I understand the position
of the hon. Lady’s party, she agrees that reoffending rates are
too high, that something must be done about that and that there is a
problem with the group with sentences under 12 months, yet we hear
nothing from her about what she would do about that if it was not what
we propose to do. If she has an alternative, let us hear it.</hs_Para>

The figures that we used for the recent consultation were based on the
criminal legal aid spend in 2011-12, which were the most up-to-date
figures when we published the document. When developing these
proposals, we have also taken fully into account the savings that came
out of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012,
which were presaged by the previous Government, who set in train the
initial process towards cutting legal aid costs. However, given the

working in particular with Pakistan, which has a vital role in fighting
terrorism in the region. Let me take those three points in
turn.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070275000227" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0001.htm#13070275000227">On
security, four years ago three quarters of the most serious terrorist
plots against the UK had links to Afghanistan and Pakistan. Today, it
is less than half. British and international forces have stopped
Afghanistan acting as a safe haven for al-Qaeda, and Afghan forces are
taking the lead on security right across the country. At the weekend I
went to Camp Bastion, Lashkar Gah and the forward operating base at
Durai. The British forces I met are absolutely clear about the
capability, confidence and leadership of the Afghan forces. Afghan
forces already deliver 90% of their own training, and all the 1,000
police patrols in central Helmand each week are now conducted alone
without international security assistance force support. It is that
growing capability that enables us to draw down our troops. Our numbers
in Afghanistan have already reduced from 9,500 to 7,900. By
the end of this year, they will be about 5,200. Until recently, we were
in 137 different bases. We are now in 13 bases and by the end of the
year it will be four or five bases. By the end of next year,
when Afghan forces take on full security responsibility,
there will be no British troops in any kind of combat role
at all. Beyond 2014, small numbers of British troops will
remain to help the Afghans deliver their national army officer
academy, and this was a request from the Afghan President
himself. We will also contribute £70
million a year as part of international financial support for Afghan
security beyond

strong security response must be also be accompanied by a strong
political response. In Helmand, we have been working for many years to
support the development of better governance, local justice, public
services and the chance for Afghans to build sustainable livelihoods
that do not involve drugs. Some 130,000 children are now in school,
including 30,000 girls—something that would have been impossible
under the Taliban—and 
<?notus-xml column=752?>80% of the population can now get health care within
10 km of their home. At the national level, the political process is
moving forward too. At the weekend, President Karzai assured me of his
commitment to the first peaceful democratic succession of power in
living memory, following next year’s elections at the end of his
second and final term. More than 50,000 new voters have already
registered, including over 10,000 women. Britain is supporting this

progress in Afghanistan is a challenge to the Taliban. The combination
of the successful build-up of the Afghan national security forces and
progress on the ground demonstrates that the way to a role in
Afghanistan’s future is not through terror and violence, but
only by engaging in a political process. So I welcome plans to begin
direct talks with the Taliban. The peace process must be Afghan led,
but we should do all we can to support it. That does not signal any
weakening of our security response, but if we can persuade people that
there is a legitimate political path for them to follow, we should do

Afghanistan alone. The support of neighbouring countries such as
Pakistan will be vital. On my visit to Pakistan, I was greatly
encouraged by the commitment of the new Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif.
His election was the first ever democratic transition in that country
from one elected Government to another. I believe that that represents
a precious sign of progress in Pakistan. We discussed our trade,
economic and cultural ties. We also agreed to work together in
countering extremism and radicalisation, investing in education,
tackling poverty and dealing with all the issues that can fuel
terrorism. Building on the trilateral process I have been leading
between the UK, Afghanistan and Pakistan, I welcomed the Prime

me turn to last week’s European Council. This was rightly
focused on sorting out Europe’s economy by doing what we are
doing in Britain: getting a grip on spending and supporting private
enterprise to create jobs and growth. On spending, the Council
finalised, with the European Parliament, the seven-year budget deal we
successfully negotiated in February. This agreed new flexibilities
between different years and between different budget headings.
Crucially, the deal delivers, for the first time, a real-terms cut in
the credit card limit for EU spending for the next seven years. There
was no change to the February deal, which set total payments at
€908.4 billion across the next seven years. That compares with
€943 billion in the past seven years. However, in this process
there was a further attempt to unpick the British rebate. In February,
after repeated attempts to water down the rebate, we reached a clear
deal that it would remain unchanged. This was reflected in the Council
conclusions that I reported back to this House. The discussion that
took place was not necessary and frustrating, and it was frankly
unacceptable that we had to go through it all over again. The proposal
to remove our rebate on agricultural spending in new member states
would have cost the British taxpayer more than £1.5 billion.
That has now been categorically rejected. We will continue to get the
rebate in the years ahead on the same basis that we do now. It is fair,
it is right, and, unlike the previous Government, this Government will
not agree to weaken it or give any part of it away.</hs_Para>

scrap unnecessary EU regulation, which ties up our businesses in red

Government and the Afghan President. That is how it should work. My
right hon. Friend is right to say that we still need to work on the
balance of the different ethnicities in the Afghan national army, but
Pashtuns are being recruited to it. I recently had the great honour of
speaking at the passing-out parade of new officers at Sandhurst, and I
gave an award to a Pashtun from Helmand who had passed out of Sandhurst

the Afghans want to avoid it. That is why it is so important that we

get under way is the fact that, in recent statements, the Taliban have

other countries. I believe that the decoupling of the Taliban from

one example my hon. Friend might be interested in: I think the phrase
“ever closer union” should be disapplied from the United

comfortable with. It was something we never really wanted to sign up to

went on for years, with plummeting living standards, rampant poverty,

before 2001 Afghanistan was a haven for terrorists who were plotting
actively to do harm to people in this country and elsewhere, but since
2001—he can ask the security services about this himself if he
wants—there have not been major, serious plots hatched in
Afghanistan and carried out against us. That is a big and important
achievement, but we also have to look at the capacity Afghanistan has
today to continue to deliver that. When I first visited Afghanistan in
2006, there were no Afghan security forces in Helmand province; they
did not exist. They have been built from scratch. I do not think we
honour those who have paid this price by talking down, in any way, the
extraordinary achievements that we have seen there. That is not to say
that things are perfect—of course they are not—and it is
not to say that there is not more that needs to be done, but on the

ties the transatlantic relationship together will inevitably loosen. So
may I ask the Prime Minister to comment not on the security matters,
but on the political implications of the allegations in the newspapers
about electronic eavesdropping by the United States on the EU? Will he
say specifically what Britain can do to help to heal that rift between
the US and other countries in the

point, I do not believe that the ending of combat operations in
Afghanistan will in any way loosen the bonds between Britain and
America. I think the Americans are deeply appreciative of the fact that
we have been the second largest troop-contributing nation, understand
the very high casualties that we have taken and also welcome the role
that we play at the heart of the command structure. The commander of
ISAF is an American general and the deputy commander is a British
general, Nick Carter, with whom I spent some of the weekend. On the
second issue, I have said all that I want to say. I do not comment on
intelligence and security matters, but in this country we operate very

agree not only that there is a need for a tough security response, but
that we need to drain the swamp of extremism, including by reforming
education. He particularly praised the work that British aid has
delivered in the Punjab, where his brother is the Chief Minister. Sir
Michael Barber—a well-known British civil servant—has
worked his socks off making more than 30 visits to the Punjab and

modest additional amount. It is in Britain’s interests that the
EU continues to enlarge and expand. Croatia has been added to what is

We must recognise that the Commission has made some progress and we
will probably get further if we credit it with that but push it harder
for more, which is my tactic. It has consulted business on the top
10 most burdensome regulations. For the first time, it has
committed to exempt micro-businesses with fewer than 10 employees from
new EU proposals and has also looked through the forthcoming regulation
and removed 17 new regulatory proposals. Overall, the burden on
business is down by some 25% in recent years. There is some progress,
but it is not going fast enough, which is why I am setting up a
regulation review panel comprising Marc Bolland from M&amp;S, Ian
Cheshire from Kingfisher, Glenn Cooper from ATG Access, Louise Makin
from BTG, Dale Murray, who is an angel investor, and Paul Walsh, the
former CEO of Diageo. That is a list of very senior businessmen and

public.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070275000354" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0002.htm#13070275000354">Police
officers have been given the right to stop and search people by several
Acts of Parliament, although most searches are conducted through the
Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.
These Acts say that officers must have “reasonable grounds to
suspect” that the subject is guilty of some form of criminal
behaviour before they are allowed to conduct a search. Owing to the
sensitivity of stop and search, officers are required by law to record
various pieces of information about each search they
undertake.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070275000355" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0002.htm#13070275000355">I
would like to start by making it clear that the Government support the
ability of police officers to stop and search suspects. It is an
important power in their daily fight against crime, and it is
especially important in relation to combating gangs, knife crime and
drug offences. For example, in the last 12 months, stop and search in
London has resulted in 45,000 criminals being arrested, including 3,212
criminals carrying weapons and guns, 7,287 criminals in possession of
suspected stolen goods and 1,484 criminals in possession of tools used
to steal or cause
damage.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070275000356" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0002.htm#13070275000356">As
long as I am Home Secretary, the police will maintain their right to
stop and search. But as important as stop and search undoubtedly is, we
have to be frank about widespread public concern regarding its use.
Official statistics show that more than 1 million stop-and-search
incidents are recorded every year. But on average only about 9% of
those incidents result in an arrest, and that figure prompts me to
question whether stop and search is always used appropriately. In fact,
the search-to-arrest ratio varies considerably across forces: in
Cumbria, the figure is 3%; in Kent, it is 19%. In London, where most
stop-and-search incidents take place, it is 8%; in Greater Manchester,
it is 8%; and in the West Midlands, it is 7%. Now, of course, we should
not expect all stop-and-search incidents to lead to arrest, but those
percentages are far too low for
comfort.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070275000357" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0002.htm#13070275000357">The
Government are concerned about the use of stop and search for two
reasons. First, it must be applied fairly and in a way that
builds community confidence in the police rather than undermining it.
Secondly, given the scale of recording requirements placed on the
police, when stop and search is misapplied, it is a waste of police
time.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070275000358" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0002.htm#13070275000358">I
want to deal first with fairness and community confidence. The official
statistics show that, if someone is from a black or minority ethnic
background, they are up to seven times more likely to be stopped and
searched by the police than if they are white. Now we should not rush
to conclusions about those statistics, but everybody involved in
policing has a duty to make sure that nobody is ever stopped
just on the basis of their skin colour or ethnicity. The law is clear
that in normal circumstances, stop and search should only ever be used
where there is a reasonable suspicion of criminality—and that is
how it should be. I am sure we have all been told stories by
constituents and members of the public about what it is like to be a
young, law-abiding black man who has been 
<?notus-xml column=774?>stopped and searched by the police on more than one occasion. If anybody
thinks it is sustainable to allow that to continue, with all its
consequences for public confidence in the police, they need
to think
again.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070275000359" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0002.htm#13070275000359">The
second reason that I am concerned about stop and search is that if it
is being used too much or with the wrong people, that is a dreadful
waste of police time. It is estimated that a police officer
spends 16 minutes conducting a stop and search and then
completing details of the incident in compliance with the
law. Given that there are just under 1.2 million stop-and-search
incidents every year, we are talking about a total of 312,000 hours per
year—the equivalent of 145 full-time police officers.</hs_Para>

election, I have made it a priority to cut red tape and free up police
time, and the changes that we have made, including changes to
stop-and-search recording, should save up to 4.5 million police hours a
year—the equivalent of an extra 2,100 officers on the streets.
There is no point in making all those changes if police officers then
spend their time conducting pointless stop and searches, with all the
bureaucracy that goes with
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070275000361" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0002.htm#13070275000361">In
London, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe,
has changed the Met’s guidance, improved training and set a
target that at least 20% of stop and searches in London should result
in an arrest or drugs warning. And since then, they have made good
progress. The latest figures suggest that in the last year 18.3% of
stop-and-search incidents in London led to an arrest or drugs warning.
In Hackney, it was as high as 26.3%, and the overall use of stop and
search in London has fallen, too, from 500,000 to 350,000 in the past
year.</hs_Para>

that it is possible to make changes to stop and search without
jeopardising public safety. So, too, do the changes I made in March
2011 to the operation of stop-and-search powers under the Terrorism
Act 2000. Then, I introduced a much more limited power that
enables the police to stop and search people and vehicles without
reasonable suspicion, but only in exceptional circumstances where there
is a real threat of terrorist attack. This power has not been used
outside Northern Ireland since it was introduced in March 2011, and
there has been no effect on public
safety.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070275000363" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0002.htm#13070275000363">Last

to conduct a comprehensive inspection into the use of stop-and-search
powers. Its report is due to be published next Tuesday. I have not seen
it yet, but the report should provide us for the first time with a

on an issue as important as stop and search, it would be wrong to
consult HMIC and work with the police without also consulting the
public. So I can tell the House that today I am launching a
consultation, lasting six weeks, that will give members of the public
the chance to have their say about the future use of stop and search.

the end of the year, the Government will respond formally to both the
HMIC report and the public consultation. That response will then inform
our work with HMIC, the College of Policing and police forces up and

everybody’s interests. I want to see stop and search used only
when it is needed; I want to see higher search-to-arrest ratios; I want

Secretary that the stop-and-search powers are important and can help
the police tackle serious problems. However, the way in which they have

powers are useful for the police—for example, enabling them to
search for weapons or stolen goods without needing to arrest someone.
The Home Secretary knows about Operation Blunt, run by the Met in 2009,
which delivered a 13% reduction in knife crime and a 23% reduction in
youth killings and seized over 1,000 knives and which did use
intelligence-led stop and search as part of that strategy. People have
been arrested for possession of guns, knives and other offensive
weapons as a result of stop and search, too. But where stop
and search is used inappropriately or too widely, it can cause a very
wide range of serious
problems.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070275000369" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0002.htm#13070275000369">Given

has been a number of reports on the operation of stop and search. The
EHRC, whose report was published a matter of weeks ago, looked again at
the issue in five forces, including the Met and Thames Valley police.
It identified that it had been possible for those forces to reduce the
number of stop and searches, perhaps by targeting them better on an
intelligence-led basis, and that doing so had also had an impact on the
search-to-arrest ratio, but no discernible effect on public safety. The
EHRC reinforced the view that we can get stop and search right; that if
we get it right, it can be the valuable tool we want it to be; but that
we can reduce the number of stop and searches without having an impact

Multiple charges for administration, inventories, references, credit

include a legal right to a written tenancy agreement, a ban on agency
charges beyond a deposit and rent in advance, a comprehensive redress
scheme when things go wrong, and mandatory national licensing for all
agents, with core standards and a “fitness to practise”
test. For those rightly concerned about the cost of regulation, the

the changes simply cannot be done from the centre. Local authorities
must be at the heart of improvements in the lettings market. That is
why my Bill would also give councils strong enforcement powers and new
powers to set up their own local letting agencies as public sector
comparators and competitors to their private sector counterparts. That
model of market challenge by the public sector already works well for
low-end rented properties in places such as Derby, Lewisham and Newham.
I believe that a new system of mid-market local letting agents, run by
the public service, would help drive up standards and drive down fees.
Councils could run such operations under their existing trading powers,
so local tenants and landlords would benefit and local council tax
payers could too.</hs_Para>

speaking, appeals against a decision by Her Majesty’s Revenue
and Customs on a tax matter are appealed to the tax tribunal. This
system is provided for in statutory tax legislation and is the standard
route of appeal for a taxpayer who disagrees with a decision by
HMRC.</hs_Para>

is no procedure for the granting of interim payments under this system.
Instead, tax is paid or repaid as appropriate when a decision is made
on the case. This is a sensible arrangement. The interim award
procedure was not designed to be a remedy in a tax dispute. Its common
application is to victims who have suffered serious injury to their
health but the long-term prognosis leaves it unclear how much they
should receive. An interim payment allows them to have enough money to
make adaptation to their homes and to pay for care. Clearly, the
complex adjudication of a tax dispute is a very different circumstance
unsuited to the application of anticipatory payments in advance of
final judgment. It is therefore right that the normal practice in tax
disputes is not to grant an interim
payment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070275000438" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0002.htm#13070275000438">However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T14:21:58"></hs_TimeCode>,
difficulty arises where a tax claim originates in common law. In such
circumstances, it would currently fall outside the scope of the
tribunal system and would therefore be appealed instead to the High
Court. Here claimants may obtain interim payment before the matter is
finally settled. Such payments may then need to be returned to the
Revenue as the direction of jurisprudence changes at different stages
of litigation. This back-and-forth process is administratively
burdensome on both parties and adds to the cost of the litigation.
Furthermore, it exposes the Revenue to a risk of non-recovery in the
event that the taxpayer becomes insolvent after obtaining an interim
payment that it is later required to hand
back.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070275000439" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0002.htm#13070275000439">Let

operate by limiting the power of a court to grant an interim payment to
a claimant whose application for such payment is founded, at least in

court will, however, still be able to grant an interim payment to
whatever extent is necessary to fund the ongoing litigation, as well as
in some other defined circumstances where there is a strong case for
granting such award. The measure relates only to those

Gauke:</Member></B> The first point to make is that this does not
ultimately change the amount of tax at stake, because a litigant will
either win or not win. If a litigant who ultimately wins has not had
access to an interim payment as a consequence of this measure, that
does not change what they will ultimately receive. Some of these cases
involve large sums of money, sometimes 
<?notus-xml column=789?>many millions of pounds. In some cases, interim payments have been very
significant. However, I stress that this does not ultimately change how
much money will end up in the pocket of the litigant. It is a question
of timing and ensuring that we have some
consistency.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070275000448" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0002.htm#13070275000448">Turning
to why we are doing this now, it follows recent jurisprudence of the
Court relating to the application of the interim awards procedure. This
jurisprudence has crystallised our view that the interim payment
procedure is not suitable for complex tax disputes. There is also an
element of risk management in this. HMRC is routinely involved in
litigation where the tax at stake may be for very high sums of money.
The granting of payments on an interim basis before a final decision
has been reached contributes to the volatility of tax revenues. By
limiting the application of the interim payment procedure in common law
court claims relating to taxation matters, and bringing the system into
better alignment with what is standard practice in the tax tribunal,
the new clause will cut down on complex work associated with
calculating claims on a contingent basis before matters relating to
liability and quantum have been resolved by the
judiciary.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070275000449" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0002.htm#13070275000449"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T14:29:31"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Catherine McKinnell" PimsId="5703" UID="13070275001727" xid="1212" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0002.htm#13070275001727">Catherine

the debt is paid after

concerns about this measure were raised in Committee, and also

35 to 51 seek to focus the new rules more tightly, and clarify the
legislation where appropriate to minimise the impact on those with
innocent arrangements. Despite the amendments, there are still a number
of concerns about clause 174 and schedule 34. I have already asked the
Minister whether he is confident that those concerns have been
addressed, because even despite the amendments, concerns continued to

concern expressed by the Chartered Institute of Taxation relates to
debts that are not discharged from the estate of a deceased person. New
provisions in clause 174 appear to mean that if a debt has not been
discharged directly out of an estate, it will not be deductible for
inheritance tax purposes. For example, if the deceased’s estate
contains a house subject to a 
<?notus-xml column=795?>mortgage, the mortgage debt might be repaid from the proceeds of an
insurance policy, payable directly to the beneficiary. Although a
spouse or civil partner would not be subject to inheritance tax under
such circumstances, a cohabitee or orphan child would be.
Alternatively, if there is no insurance to pay off the mortgage, the
beneficiary might take on the mortgage debt. In either case, as
liability will not have been discharged directly out of the estate,
which is a requirement of the new provision, it appears that it will
not therefore be deductable.</hs_Para>

existing loans, or hinder anyone whose loan comes to an end, where the

other groups, so perhaps the Minister will confirm that both sets of
changes will not have the detrimental impact on small businesses and
business lending that many tax professionals are

Gauke:</Member></B> I will try to address the hon. Lady’s
points. First, on inheritance tax and non-domiciled spouses, she
correctly mentioned the costs of the policy, which are largely due to
an increase in the lifetime limit set out in the Budget documents.
Clause 176 increases that limit from £55,000 to
£325,000—it has not been increased since 1982, and we
wanted to address that to be fair to non-domiciled spouses. That is the
reason for the cost.</hs_Para>

measures in clause 134 and schedule 34 comes from two main
types of avoidance scheme that will be closed by these provisions. The
main impact on one will be relatively short-lived. The hon. Lady is
right to point out that we expect tax agents providing tax avoidance
schemes to move on to new schemes in other parts of the tax code, and
that will have a behavioural impact. That explains the peak in one
year—2014-15—and the £15 million yield for
subsequent years.</hs_Para>

mentioned the impact on business and I refer her to my earlier
remarks—as you will have noted, Mr Deputy Speaker, I covered
quite a lot of ground in a fairly lengthy speech. Estates will continue
to get a deduction for loans or liabilities, provided they are not used
to acquire assets that are not chargeable to inheritance tax and are
repaid after death, unless there are genuine commercial reasons for
non-repayment. Business and investment decisions are made on a range of
factors, including tax. One of the Government’s key principles
for good taxation is that the tax system should be efficient. It should
neither favour nor penalise one form of lending or security over
another. The new provisions will ensure that this is the
case<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:01:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

hon. Lady referred to a point raised by the Chartered Institute of
Taxation that debts not discharged directly out of the estate will not
be IHT deductable. The definition of “out of estate” will
be extended by amendment 45 to include indirect assets not normally
included in the estate, such as excluded property. Otherwise, no
deduction will be due, but this reflects the economic consequence of
incurring a liability and repaying it. It would disadvantage the
Exchequer to provide for relief where debts are not repaid and do not
reduce the inheritance tax being passed on.</hs_Para>

whether that will harm business, and whether the amendments deal with
concerns that have been raised, it is worth pointing out that
independent research published in the SME Finance Monitor suggests that
the majority of business overdrafts and loans are unsecured. Where
security is provided, it is typically in the form of a charge on
business property, such as commercial mortgages. That is supported by a
review of recent IHT returns. Most estates with such liabilities will
therefore be unaffected by the changes.</hs_Para>

consultation, the provisions are designed primarily to tackle avoidance
schemes, such as those involving debts between connected parties. As is
normal practice for such measures, there was no consultation and draft
legislation was not published in advance. To do so would have exposed
the avoidance schemes to greater publicity, potentially encouraging
more schemes to be set up. Following the publication of the Finance
Bill, the Government, as expected, received comments from interested
parties and are responding to the many concerns raised by tabling
amendments on Report to clarify and improve the

Gauke:</Member></B> I can appreciate why the hon. Lady raises that
point, but recent evidence from inheritance tax returns suggests that
the majority of business overdrafts and loans continue to be unsecured.
There may well have been changes to the balance between secured and
unsecured business overdrafts and loans in recent years, but it remains
the case that the majority are unsecured. Where security is provided,
it is typically in the form of a charge on a business property. I
understand why she raises the point, but the evidence suggests that
this will not cause the concern that she anticipates. All measures are
kept under review and this will be no exception, but we believe that we
have got the balance right. This will address a distortion and an
avoidance opportunity. I therefore hope that these proposals, as
refined by the amendments, will become part of the
Bill.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070275000508" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0002.htm#13070275000508"><I>Amendment

Javid:</Member></B> Amendments 17 to 29 make a number of technical
changes to schedule 9 of clause 25 to ensure that the qualifying
insurance policy regime works as intended. Let me set out some brief
background to these changes. The qualifying policy regime was
introduced in 1968 to preserve pre-existing tax treatment for
traditional moderate value, long-term, regular premium savings policies
that contain a significant element of life
insurance.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070275000536" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0002.htm#13070275000536"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:09:03"></hs_TimeCode>No<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:19:47"></hs_TimeCode>
upper limit was set for the investment premiums that could be paid into
a QP, which allowed individuals to obtain unlimited relief from higher
rates of income tax. In the 2012 Budget, the Government announced a
restriction to the tax relief available for QPs. Clause 25 and schedule
9 introduce an annual premium limit of £3,600 on qualifying life
insurance policies. This restriction limits the amount of premiums
payable into QPs for an individual to no more than £3,600 in any
12-month period, with effect from 6 April 2013.</hs_Para>

Consultation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:10:22"></hs_TimeCode>
since the Bill was introduced has continued and identified the need for
Government amendments to clause 25 to deal with points of detail in 13
areas. None of these represents a change of policy; as I have said,
they are technical adjustments to ensure that the rules operate
effectively and as intended. The amendments have been discussed with
industry representatives and have benefited from the comments
received.</hs_Para>

me briefly explain the amendments in slightly more detail. The purpose
of the changes is to provide flexibility to deal with potential future
exclusions from the non-assignment rule and potential future exclusions
from the circumstances under which beneficiaries must make statements,
to extend the period by which an individual must first make a statement
and to clarify what information an insurer must provide and obtain from
a policy beneficiary and what an insurer must provide to HMRC. In
addition, a number of amendments make minor corrections or
consequential changes to the more material changes that I have
described.</hs_Para>

tabled these amendments to schedule 9 after being alerted recently to
the consequences of the proposed changes to the life insurance
qualifying policy regime for a small business in Malvern in my
constituency, which is a market maker in traded endowment policies. The
business provides a price at which it will both buy and sell an
endowment policy, which creates welcome liquidity in these financial

Association of Policy Market Makers estimates that the traded endowment
policy market involves about 7,000 policies a year, out of the 20
million policies outstanding, and has a value estimated at
approximately £150 million. The reasons why someone might want
to sell an endowment policy vary. The most significant
reason —accounting for 20%—is poor investment
performance, although someone might be selling their house or trying to
get some equity release. People sell endowment policies when they want
to reduce their mortgage or improve their home—perhaps at
retirement or when they lose their jobs, are bereaved or are getting
divorced. Someone might want to buy a second-hand endowment policy to
get a better rate of return than cash without a stock market
risk. Endowment policies
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:13:43"></hs_TimeCode>are also popular
products with people with lump sums—such as victims of accidents

completely understand, support and appreciate the Chancellor’s
desire to restrict tax relief for higher-rate taxpayers to
£3,600 a year for all new policies that are issued. What I am
raising is the impact on existing qualifying policies, which have
hitherto been subject to 
<?notus-xml column=802?>capital gains tax after they change hands. However, the tax treatment
might now become so unattractive that the secondary market will dry up.
I fear that the Chancellor and the Exchequer will lose out on the
potential capital gains tax created by future transfers of such
policies. The potential capital gains from the industry as a whole are
estimated at £750 million, depending on how much changes hands
and the rate of capital gains tax at the time. That is a not
inconsiderable sum of money.</hs_Para>

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:15:29"></hs_TimeCode>setting the
£3,600 annual limit for new policies, the Treasury needs at the
same time to limit the number of qualifying second-hand endowment
policies that any one individual can buy. My amendments simply seek to
set the same annual premium limit for existing policies as that for new
policies under this legislation. That would create a fair and level
playing field between new policies, which are being restricted, and any
outstanding existing policies that might change hands. I know that the
Minister would not want to close down small financial services
businesses because of this change in the tax treatment of policies
issued many years ago. I think that we can all agree that that would be
excessive and retrospective.</hs_Para>

hope that by considering my amendments the Government will find a way

still allowing the secondary market in existing qualifying policies to
continue—and continue to allow those capital gains tax revenues

specialised secondary market—I was not aware that it existed
until 10 days ago. I also appreciate that the industry was not able to
feed into the consultation at the end of the year—it was not
alerted to the potential change—but it has now fed into the
process, via the business in my constituency. I hope that by giving
serious consideration to my amendments—and, I hope, accepting
them—the Government will allow the industry and the endowment
policy market to die of natural causes in due course, as the policies
mature, rather than killing it off suddenly with the

<hs_Para UID="13070275000548" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0002.htm#13070275000548">Let me
respond to some of the points raised by my hon. Friend. She commented
that seven small businesses selling second-hand endowment policies
could close as a result of the change to the tax treatment of
qualifying policies. We recognise that these policies are likely to
sell for less on the market where the purchaser is an individual who is
a higher or additional rate taxpayer, due to the income tax charge when
the policy matures. Let me reassure her that there is currently no bar
to the sale of non-qualifying policies on the market and that research 
<?notus-xml column=803?>from the industry shows that non-qualifying policies are currently sold
in the market. We envisage that this market might actually increase as
a result of fewer QPs being available for
sale<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:19:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070275000549" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0002.htm#13070275000549">Let
me reassure the House that any adverse impact of the tax changes will
be limited to those purchasers who are higher or additional rate
taxpayers. Where a second-hand endowment policy is bought by a
corporate investor or a basic rate taxpayer, there will be no impact on
the tax position of the buyer when the policy matures. As a result, the
loss of QP status will not make these policies any less attractive for
those
investors.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070275000550" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0002.htm#13070275000550"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:19:20"></hs_TimeCode>My
hon. Friend made a point about capital gains. Previously, the purchaser
of a traded endowment policy would have been liable to tax under the
capital gains tax regime. That tax treatment was based on the maturity
proceeds, less what the purchaser paid to acquire and maintain the
policy. Capital gains tax treatment was more favourable, in that no
additional tax would be payable unless the gains exceeded the annual
exempt amount. In practice, it is likely that higher or additional rate
taxpayers structured their affairs so as to ensure that little or no
capital gains tax would be payable by using their full annual exempt
allowance for a tax year. For 2013-14, that amount is
£10,900<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:20:26"></hs_TimeCode>.
There is an additional safeguard for basic rate taxpayers who fall into
the higher tax bracket as a result of the policy maturing. If that
happens, the individual will get top-slicing relief, which reduces any
additional tax payable. The relief is not available if the taxpayer is
already a higher or additional rate taxpayer when the policy
matures<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:20:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070275000551" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0002.htm#13070275000551">My
hon. Friend has stated that her amendments would set the same annual
premium limit for traded endowment policies as that set for new
policies and existing policies. The annual premium limit of
£3,600 applies to each individual rather than to a single
policy. The effect of amendment 52 would be to exclude a policy from
the limit if it had an annual premium payable of £3,600 or less.
Purchasers of traded endowment policies will already have an annual
premium limit of £3,600 applying to their own policies. As a
result of that amendment, they would also be able to acquire as many
traded endowment policies as they could afford, so long as each of
those policies had premiums payable under the
threshold<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:21:46"></hs_TimeCode>. That
would put an individual who had taken out a qualifying policy from the
outset at a disadvantage to an individual who later acquired a
policy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:21:57"></hs_TimeCode>.
Amendment 52 would not result in a level and fair playing field.

hon. Friend understandably referred to the restrictions on assignments
for consideration, which are an essential part of the policy. The aim
of our measure is to help to promote fairness in the tax system by
limiting the tax relief available to higher rate and additional rate
taxpayers. Without this restriction, individuals in a financial
position to purchase traded endowment policies would be able to acquire
qualifying policies without limit, while everyone else would be subject
to the £3,600 annual premium limit. That would put an individual
who had taken out a qualifying policy from the outset at a disadvantage

considers that there is an element of retrospection about applying the
annual premium limit to any QPs existing before 6 April 2013. Let me
reassure her that there is no element of retrospection. The sale of a
traded endowment policy on or after 6 April 2013 is treated no
differently from an individual varying an existing policy after that
date either to change the term or to vary the annual premiums payable.
In all those cases, an individual will have made a conscious decision
with regard to an existing product in full knowledge of the tax
consequences resulting from that decision. The Government’s
position is therefore that it would be unfair, inconsistent and

that amendment 19 proposes giving HMRC a power to deal, in regulations,
with any additional circumstances for which exclusion may be
appropriate. I will ask officials to meet my hon. Friend’s
constituents and to work with the industry to ensure that the annual
premium limit remains proportionate as it beds in. I want to reassure
her that if the evidence shows that the impact of the annual premium
limit would prematurely bring to an end the traded endowment market, as
she fears, the Government would consider using their power in amendment
19 to address the matter in a proportionate way, following discussions
with interested parties. I hope that that provides her with a degree of
reassurance that the Government are listening, and I respectfully ask
her not to press her amendments to a vote.</hs_Para>

suspect that its conclusions would be pretty short, given the
Chancellor’s comprehensive failure to deliver the economic boost
that this country so desperately needs. It was a dead duck of a
spending review, and it was even more disappointing, given the context
in which it was made. The Chancellor did not want to come to the House
to announce a spending review last week, but he was forced to announce
a further £11.5 billion of spending cuts in 2015-6. Why? Because

which gets to the crux of the matter. The Chancellor had to come here
last week to announce further spending cuts in 2015-16, planning for
future failure, because he is failing to deal with the economic reality
that we face today. Ultimately, we are tabling this new clause because
we hope that the Government will take stock of the situation in which
they are leaving households up and down this country. The price of the
failure of the Chancellor’s economic plan is not being paid by
those at the top. We debated at great length yesterday the fact that
the top-earning taxpayers are getting a tax cut from this Government,
while it is ordinary families that rely on public services that are
paying the price for this economic failure throughout the

Ultimately, it is about what we hear in our communities when talking to
businesses about confidence—the confidence to invest, the
confidence to take seriously the Government’s commitment to
investing in infrastructure and growth. The reality on the ground is
deeply worrying. Members of the public will be concerned about the
complacent tone that the Government adopt towards the economic
situation. The Government are apparently ignoring the fact that they
promised 6% growth and delivered only 1%, that they promised 576
infrastructure projects and have delivered only seven, that they
promised 261 rebuilt schools and have only put spades in the ground in
one. Members of the public will be worried to hear how complacent this
Government seem to be. That is why we tabled the new clause—to
give the Government the opportunity not just to make the announcement
and walk away, hoping that nobody will notice that they are doing
nothing about economic stagnation, but to spend some time reflecting on
what these announcements will mean in real terms in respect of expected
tax
receipts.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070275000636" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0003.htm#13070275000636">There

Sawford:</Member></B> I am very pleased to hear my hon. Friend
highlight the important role that HMRC plays in our economy. Whatever
the review shows about the implications of the spending review, one of
the key aspects is HMRC’s effectiveness in bringing in tax
revenue. Will my hon. Friend therefore urge the Government, in this
review, which I hope they will support, to look at the implications of
underpayment of wages to people, particularly minimum wage avoidance
issues? HMRC recently sent a team to my constituency, and found that
£100,000 was owing to local workers. There are huge implications
for receipts at

McKinnell:</Member></B> My hon. Friend raises a very important point. I
have tabled several parliamentary questions to the Minister on that
subject, and I look forward to his response outlining what action the
Government are taking, alongside HMRC, to ensure that it not only
collects tax throughout the country but ensures that employers abide by
the national minimum wage legislation to ensure that employees do not
fall short despite the fact that they are working. It is imperative
that HMRC has the Government’s support and also has the correct
resources to ensure that workers are not 
<?notus-xml column=816?>exploited in the way that my hon. Friend suggests is prevalent in his
part of the country and which I have no doubt is a phenomenon that
impacts on hard-working people
countrywide.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:59:26"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070275000640" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0003.htm#13070275000640">Despite
the headlines suggesting that everybody is avoiding tax, we are
generally a tax-compliant nation—I believe the current figure is
approximately 93%. Of course, it is the 7% for which HMRC needs
extra support and resources to get the returns. The
Association of Revenue and Customs estimates that a senior tax official
earning £50,000 a year can expect to generate additional yield
of at least £1.5 million a year—a return 30 times greater
than the cost of their salary. That is a good investment, I think most
would
agree.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13070275001425" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0003.htm#13070275001425">4

the Chancellor announced a further £11.5 billion of
cuts to public expenditure, what did that mean for HMRC, a department
already faced with a net reduction in funding of £2 billion over
this Parliament and the loss of an additional 10,000 staff? Well, the
right hon. Gentleman announced that HMRC’s target for additional
revenues raised, including from tax avoidance and evasion, would be
increased to £24.5 billion in
2015-16—£1 billion more than the 2014-15
target and £10 billion than the 2010-11 target. According to the

under the funding settlement announced by the Chancellor last week, at
the same time as it is required to bring in those additional revenues,
HMRC must cut its costs by a further 5% in 2015-16, on top of the
significant efficiency savings and cuts it has already been expected to
make. Can the Minister confirm, for the benefit of the House and as
part of the review for which we are calling, precisely how much funding
will have been cut from HMRC between the coalition coming to power in
2010 and the end of financial year 2015-16? A clear picture of the
figures would be useful. Also, will he confirm the total number of HMRC

she share my concern that some of the measures in the spending review
will have serious implications for tax collection unless HMRC has

the Member for Corby (Andy Sawford), it is vital that when additional
tax avoidance opportunities are created, HMRC has the resources to deal
with them, and that it does not take its eye off other aspects of its
activity, such as enforcing national minimum wage legislation and
general customer service. We know that the National Audit Office report
on HMRC’s customer service performance, which was published in
December last year, contained some worrying figures on HMRC’s
ability to handle customers.</hs_Para>

support they need in order to pay their tax—not just
individuals, who are often dealing with tax credits and find that they
need support from HMRC, but small businesses that need support in order
to pay the right tax. It is not right that individuals and small
businesses in particular, but large businesses too, are left struggling
to pay the tax that they wish to pay HMRC voluntarily. The Government
should be aware that there is a limit to the extent to which HMRC can

much-publicised announcements about increased investment in tax

conclusion, the Government had the opportunity last week to boost tax
receipts by announcing measures that would provide the short and

for the country, yet despite the catastrophic failure of their economic

would continue ploughing the same infertile furrow he has been on since
2010. He just cannot bring himself to admit that it has gone badly
wrong. We believe that conducting the review set out in new clause 10
might just help the Government to take stock and note the error of

clause 10. It is quite laudable, in a way, because it would link
spending to taxation and get us to engage in retrospective analysis,
and frankly we do not do enough of that in this place. We talk about
policy a great deal, but the long-term effects are often hidden from
us. It can be quite counter-intuitive. We had an interesting debate
yesterday on the 50% tax rate, the Laffer curve and the effect that
such a rate might or might not have. There are plenty of other examples
where the effect of taxation needs to be adequately scrutinised. In
Committee we debated what tax avoidance measures would do to
people’s behaviour, what petrol taxation would do to
people’s behaviour and to the revenue we get, what landfill tax
would do to councils’ behaviour, and what the video games
industry would make of the various changes that will affect
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070275000657" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0003.htm#13070275000657">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:11:54"></hs_TimeCode>

Parliament does not have enough good, accessible data and that we make

any systematic, thorough, regular or routine way. When it comes to
spending, there is a very similar picture. There is no real scrutiny of

economy expands and responds positively to acts by the Exchequer or the
behaviour of individuals, the Government or business. At the time of
the 2010 election, our economy was not in great health but was steadily
moving in a positive direction. There was growth and good stimulus in
the economy through, in particular, the strong infrastructure spending
that was driving it forward. The then Government were, properly, using
their resources to drive forward spending, confidence and movement in
the right direction.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:16:28"></hs_TimeCode>This Government
came into office in a state almost of panic and switched 
<?notus-xml column=820?>off of the tap of infrastructure spending. The figures now show that
infrastructure spending is much less than it would have been if the
plans that were in place and were helping to drive the economy forward
had been continued.</hs_Para>

has had an impact on business confidence. We have already highlighted
the crucial importance of construction as a driver of the economic
health of the nation. Construction businesses have been having a torrid
time over the past few years. Sadly, a serious number of subcontractors
have gone out of business. Local construction companies tell me that
the difficulty they are having in getting sufficient credit from their
builders merchants to do the jobs which are now beginning to emerge in
the economy presents another structural problem. The root cause of that
is the fact that so much Government infrastructure spending was taken
out of the economy in 2010, 2011 and 2012.</hs_Para>

but they are wisely holding on to them for a rainy day. They are not
spending and making the investments in the future direction of their
businesses that they might otherwise have done because they do not have
the confidence to do so. The Government are not spending, businesses
are not spending, and, equally, individuals are lacking confidence and
not spending. When we debated VAT earlier, the Minister posed an
interesting question, and rightly so. However, the reality is that
putting up VAT when his Government did had an immediate hit on
individuals’ spending confidence which has helped to create this

where the Government must come back to the House to account for the

his emergency Budget, which has led us to the sorry pass we are in
today, he was confident that we would be in a completely different
place. If he had implemented the provision in new clause 10 at that

promise on infrastructure 
<?notus-xml column=821?>spending is to spend tomorrow—most of it in 2014, 2015, 2016 and
even 2017—rather than now. It is spending decisions taken now

tax revenues and reduce the scale of the cuts needed in 2015. Taking
action now to boost economic growth—by, for example, bringing
infrastructure plans forward so that they happen now rather than
tomorrow—would make a real difference. That is why the new
clause would be helpful: it would test the impact of the spending round
on tax receipts and, as my hon. Friend has said, do so in time to make

promised in 2010. In spite of being told how important austerity was
for economic confidence and low interest rates, the triple A rating has
been downgraded by not one but two credit rating agencies. The
Government tried to blame everybody except themselves and said that
austerity was the only way, only to receive an embarrassing rebuke from

public spending cuts wiped 1.4% off growth last year. The International

of the impact on tax revenues of the measures set out in the
2013 spending review. I note that the Labour party again seems to be
interested in discussing matters that are not in the Bill as such.
Rather than discussing the Bill, Labour Members want to discuss the

me explain briefly why new clause 10 is unnecessary. The House will be
aware that in 2010 this Government created the Office for Budget
Responsibility in order to 
<?notus-xml column=825?>ensure that the impact of Government policies is independently
scrutinised. The OBR routinely publishes economic and fiscal outlooks,
which provide a transparent and independent assessment of the impact of
Government policy on the public finances, including receipts, and the
economy. The impact of the policies announced in the 2013 spending
round will be reflected in the OBR’s autumn forecast, which will
be published alongside the autumn statement, so there is no need for a
parallel review, which is what new clause 10 would involve.</hs_Para>

also heard the Opposition make the argument that we should take steps

endorsement of changes such as planning deregulation, which can help
growth, or a more competitive tax system. Indeed, we have tried to work
out exactly what Labour believes in this area, but it was not clear. We
have consistently heard about a five-point plan from the Opposition,
including a cut in VAT, which was the flagship of that plan. On three
occasions the hon. Lady was asked whether Labour still favoured a
temporary cut in VAT under the current circumstances; on three

Jamieson:</Member></B> I am tempted to start by saying that I am sure
this is the part of this afternoon’s proceedings that everyone
has been waiting for, and that there is much excitement about the
prospect of talking about real estate investment trusts, and that many
Members will want to contribute on this very important
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T17:02:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070275001263" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0003.htm#13070275001263">Amendment
57 is another amendment that I have regularly described as very
mild-mannered. It proposes that the Government must ensure that the
impact of their policy is examined and reported on, and that all
Members are subsequently able to access information on its impact from
the House of Commons Library. In this amendment, we are asking for that
information to be examined and made available before schedule 18 is
implemented.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T17:03:24"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

also asks that the Government conduct a review of the interaction of
real estate investment trusts with the housing market and that the
Government consider in particular measures that are in place to support
house building and what measures they have taken to support

I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T17:03:55"></hs_TimeCode> suspect that
the Minister may well say this is not necessary because everything is
always kept under review so far as the Government are concerned, but he
will be aware—because he has heard me say this before both in
Committee and on the Floor of the House—that I think Governments
always tend to say things are under review, but there is a great
difference between something that sits on a shelf that may be dusted
down and had a look at if someone asks a parliamentary question or
writes to a Minister, and something that is a proactive review, whereby
policy is examined and modelling work is done and different facts and
figures are placed in the House of Commons Library so that we can all
benefit from that information. That is really why we have tabled this
amendment now. I keep making this plea to the Minister to take up, at
least once, the opportunity to look more favourably on such
reviews.</hs_Para>

last year’s Finance Bill Committee and once again this year, we
have had important discussions about real estate investment trusts, or
REITS. For hon. Members who have not followed the Committee musings
over the two years or had the opportunity to read in <I>Hansard</I> the
record of the excellent contribution from
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T17:05:26"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie), who said just
a few words about REITs during those deliberations, I shall outline
briefly what this is about and why our amendment is so
important.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13070275001266" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0003.htm#13070275001266"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T17:05:49"></hs_TimeCode>REITs
are securities that sell like a share on stock exchanges and invest in
real estate directly, either through properties or mortgages. As of
September 2012, 34 nations had REIT-like regimes in place.
REITs are tax-advantaged vehicles set up to encourage investment in the
property 
<?notus-xml column=832?>sector. I will, of course, be developing that theme, and people may wish
to consider my comments in the light of the need for the review. REITs
are exempt from corporation tax on profits and gains arising from their
property rental business as long as profits are distributed. In that
way, taxation of income from property is moved from the corporate level
to the investor level. REITs have been given tax advantages to
encourage diverse investment in the property sector, where fellow
investors can have a different tax status.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13070275001267" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0003.htm#13070275001267"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T17:07:00"></hs_TimeCode>We
seek to amend a simple, one-line clause introducing schedule 18, which
of course contains considerable detail. I am sure the Minister will
speak to the Government amendments in some detail in due course, but
these provisions would allow UK REIT income derived from investing in
other UK REITs to be treated as income of its tax-exempt property
rental business. Until now, REITs have predominantly invested in
commercial properties—for example, office and retail properties.
We had lengthy discussions about that when debating a previous
financial Bill. According to Treasury consultation documents published
in April 2012, there are more than 20 UK REITs, with a market
capitalisation of more than £20 billion, so this is
obviously an important issue.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13070275001268" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0003.htm#13070275001268">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T17:09:22"></hs_TimeCode>
I said, the Committee discussed in detail why it is important to reform
the REIT regime. We did not oppose clause 38 in Committee
and we are not seeking to do so now; we are simply seeking this review
and reporting back.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T17:09:22"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Nottingham East recognised that REITs are important
investment vehicles that have changed the investment scene relating to
property and those financial instruments. He spoke about that in
Committee, also acknowledging that the Government appeared to be
proposing relatively sensible pieces of housekeeping on the cash flow
and investment profiles of the REITs. He further acknowledged the
argument that REITs could make better returns on such cash if they were
allowed to invest short term in other REITs. That was seen as promoting
greater liquidity in the property market and potentially attracting
additional investment income, particularly into the built environment.
However, at that time my hon. Friend also raised a number of specific
points with the Minister. For example, he asked what the
policy’s effect would be on revenues to the Exchequer. He probed
further the broader impact on tax treatments and also sought to
discover whether HMRC had done any modelling on how the arrangement
might affect yields.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13070275001269" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0003.htm#13070275001269"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T17:10:04"></hs_TimeCode>My
hon. Friend was interested in what the REIT vehicles are investing in
and in how they are linked to commercial property arrangements and the
circumstances in which residential property REITs exist. In Committee,
he also sought further information from the Minister on the impact of
REIT arrangements on the residential property market and its prices,
given that there has been some concern in various quarters about the
Government perhaps looking more at the demand side of the housing
market equation than at the supply side.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13070275001270" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0003.htm#13070275001270">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T17:10:50"></hs_TimeCode>
shall say a little more about the housing market later, but in
Committee my hon. Friend specifically pressed the Minister on whether
the Treasury had analysed the general impact of REITs on property
prices in the residential sector and whether there was any overlap
between the Help to Buy arrangements and investment in REITs.</hs_Para>

<?notus-xml column=833?><hs_Para UID="13070275001271" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0003.htm#13070275001271">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T17:11:12"></hs_TimeCode>
Committee also heard during that debate that although the Government
originally consulted on the idea of using REITs as a vehicle to support
social housing investment, they decided not to take that forward. There
was no REIT vehicle arrangement to help with what the Opposition
believe to be the priority—that is, of course, dealing with the
need for social housing and affordable housing. I shall say something
further about that in due course.</hs_Para>

be fair to the Minister, he advised the Committee that only 15 written

generate positive benefits for the industry and his Government’s
wider objectives, as he saw them.</hs_Para>

I can see the logic in that argument—it comes from a factual
perspective—my hon. Friend was probing a question on which I
invite the Minister to say more today. Has the Minister considered
whether he would use some of the extensive resources at his disposal to
do some further modelling work, not just to consider what is happening
now but to make projections for the future? That would give us some
idea of the advantages and disadvantages of the proposal, particularly
as regards the impact on house prices, and would allow us to identify
the concerns and, if any were identified, to see how they could be
mitigated. That was what my hon. Friend was seeking and is part of the
reason why we have tabled the amendment once
again.</hs_Para>

social rents alone would be unable to generate sufficient returns to
attract investors. I hope the Minister will say something more on that.

to another town, village or even another street. If homes of a decent

landlords, but many bad ones too. There are chronic problems of

social housing; and, now, the Housing Minister talking about the need
to convert to the affordable rent model, which is unaffordable for many
people and will push up housing benefit bills. We also see the

Just<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T18:05:06"></hs_TimeCode> when the
country needed a sense of urgency and ambition, the Government let the
country down. That is why our amendment argues for a serious approach,
designed to get Britain building. First, we have to tackle the biggest
housing crisis in a generation. There should be decent homes for all,
to rent or buy, at prices people can afford. Secondly, history tells us
that there has never been a recovery from a depression, such as that in

2015. They need to build now, in order to get people back into work now

programme. If we were to invest in retrofitting as well as in new
build, we could tackle some of the chronic problems that are costing
the national health service £2.5 billion a year. We could also
tackle the problem of a whole generation of young people being held
back at school because their overcrowded homes impact on their ability
to do their homework. That impacts on their exam results, which in turn
impact on their lifelong earnings potential.

is paying the price of failure, with £245 billion
more being borrowed because of it. Ultimately, it comes down to this:
it is a choice between paying for the costs of failure or investing for
success. All the evidence shows in transmission times that investing in
house building is the quickest way to get a sluggish economy moving. It
would build badly needed homes for people to rent or buy; it would put
building workers back to work; it would create apprenticeships and hope
for the nearly 1 million young people out of work; it would
progressively bring down the cost of housing benefit; and, ultimately,
reduce borrowing rather than increase

Dromey:</Member></B> I would make two points in response. First, the
single biggest factor that would make a difference is, of course,
significantly increasing supply. What is so wrong about the
Government’s approach is that it has been too much focused on
demand and not sufficiently focused on supply. On the issue of demand,
we have heard criticisms from the IMF, the Treasury Select Committee
and others about the impact of Help to Buy on pushing up house prices,
without necessarily seeing a significant increase in supply.</hs_Para>

we definitely need to look at a very different type of private rented
sector for the future, where quality standards will be raised and where
there will be longer-term tenancies and flexibility for those who wish
it and security for those who need it. Index-linked rents, for example,
could see people having predictable and more affordable rents. If we
look at existing evidence of such longer-term tenancies with the
indexation of rents, we find that tenants pay significantly less and
landlords have a reliable income stream, so it works for good landlords
and tenants alike. The time has come for a very different private
rented sector in the future. Sometimes we refer to “the
continental model” of security, affordability and higher
quality, where people enjoy a higher status in a sector of
choice—not what we have at the
moment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T18:13:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070275001376" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0003.htm#13070275001376">Millions

had was hyperbole from the Chief Secretary to the Treasury. I have to
say that I sat gobsmacked at his contribution. When it comes to writing
the history of hyperbole, he will deserve a chapter of his own, as we
have heard it all before. The simple reality is that this
Government’s housing policies, like their economic policies,
have failed and will continue to fail. Whether it be “First
Buy”, “NewBuy” or “Help to Buy”, the
British people know from experience that getting a decent home at a
price they can afford and getting Britain building once again will

the housing market in Britain today can only cause alarm, for a variety
of reasons. Output is far below the level that would enable it to meet
the current need, and that is bad for people who are themselves in
need. It is bad for people who want to buy their homes but find it
impossible to do so at prices that they can afford; it is bad for
people who are looking for social housing, because the waiting lists
are overstretched and the supply is inadequate; and it is desperately
bad for people who risk homelessness. The number of homeless people

state of the market is also bad for people in private rented housing,
which, curiously, is the one of the few success stories of recent
housing history. The amount of private rented housing has increased,
but unfortunately it has increased on the back of very steep rent
increases. That has created a huge problem for people who simply cannot
afford to pay such rents without the help of housing benefit, and it
has created a real problem for the Government. All the
Government’s rhetoric is about reducing housing benefit, but the
policy that is being promoted by both the Treasury and the Department
for Communities and Local Government is leading to increased calls for
it. Increased dependence on private renting and higher rents in the
social housing sector, both of which are explicit policies of the DCLG,
inevitably drive increased demand for housing benefit. The Government
have got themselves into an extraordinary mess. One arm of Government

supposedly, the panacea for the problem of opposition among some local
communities to new house building in their area. The theory was that if
a financial incentive was given to councils and to communities for
agreeing to build new homes, we would get a different

cumulative bonus that is paid for a six-year period. I have given only
the individual one-year costs. When we add in the cumulative costs
derived from previous years’ awards, we find that by
2018-19—that is six years ahead, so at the end of the six-year
period—on current trends, expenditure on the scheme would be
£7.5 billion. It is a very, very expensive use of public money,
which is mostly taken from local authorities. The Government talk about
it as though it is a Government scheme, but they are putting in only

about the new homes bonus, which is top-sliced from local authorities

homes and retrofitting, local authorities that have had their income
reduced substantially, and are in low-demand areas like mine and unable
to build new homes, encounter 
<?notus-xml column=852?>a perverse incentive, whereby a slew of issues, such as empty homes and
dealing with the private rented sector, cannot be dealt with. The money
is simply given to authorities that are cash rich and are building more

Gauke:</Member></B> It is a pleasure to return this debate to the
amendments to clause 38 and schedule 18 of the Finance Bill before us.
Before I discuss Opposition amendment 57, I shall say a few
words about amendments 30 to 34, which are designed to ensure that
clause 38 and schedule 18 work as intended. The clause and
the schedule make improvements to the REITs regime. This year’s
Finance Bill improves the REITs regime by allowing a UK REIT to treat
income from another UK REIT as income of its tax-exempt
property rental business. Therefore these amendments do not affect the
policy, but rather ensure that it works as intended. The change would
generate positive benefits for the REIT industry, and also meets the
Government’s wider objectives.</hs_Para>

provide some background. During the technical consultation in February,
stakeholders told us that the changes as drafted might not work quite
as intended. HMRC has consulted further with interested parties, and we
agree that minor changes are necessary to achieve the desired policy
aims. The problem, as presented by interested parties, concerned the
balance of business test, which requires that at least 75% of the
REIT’s profits must come from a property business. Interested
parties were concerned that in certain circumstances, a REIT that
invests in another REIT might fail that test even though the lower-tier
REIT derives all of its income from a property business. Consideration
of the issue has revealed that minor amendments are required both to
the new and the pre-existing legislation. These amendments together
will ensure that the Bill’s changes correctly implement the
intended policy, which is that profits of a property rental business
comprising the new type of tax-exempt income do not include amounts
attributable to capital allowances and other tax
adjustments.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070292000051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0004.htm#13070292000051">Turning

the Government’s view is that there is no need to postpone the
changes to the REIT regime, as the proposed review would add little
value at this time. There is something of a routine here of the hon.
Lady requesting a review and me turning it down, and she asks so nicely
that I feel almost pained in doing so, but the reason we believe in
this case that a review would add very little is 
<?notus-xml column=855?>that there are not yet any REITs with substantial housing assets on the

hon. Lady made a couple of points on how the REIT regime works: the
first, which I believe we touched on in Committee, was whether the
regime could support people who want to own their own home. It
is worth pointing out that residential REITs can
provide accommodation only in the private rented sector, so they are
not designed, nor could they be used, for the purpose of home
ownership.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070292000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0004.htm#13070292000058">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T18:42:20"></hs_TimeCode>
second point, on which the hon. Lady intervened, was on the
relationship with social housing and what role REITS could play in that
sector. There was full consultation in summer 2012 involving a number
of one-to-one and group meetings with interested parties in the social
housing sector. The reality is that yields on, for example, affordable
rents do not appear to be high enough to attract investors into that
sector, but I assure her that discussions are ongoing with non-social
housing entities and other interested parties to explore the
possibility of residential REITs. If a workable residential model can
be found, it might be possible to use it to further a move into social
housing, and we certainly would not rule that out. At the moment there
appears to be no interest in using REITs for those purposes, but
we<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T18:43:53"></hs_TimeCode> are entirely
pragmatic about
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070292000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0004.htm#13070292000059">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T18:43:42"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T18:43:53"></hs_TimeCode>

delay the implementation of the schedule while we conduct a review from
which there is little to be gained. For those reasons, I urge the hon.

discussed wider housing policy, but I do not intend to be drawn into a
lengthy, general debate on housing. I just point out that we announced
£5.4 billion of additional support for housing in the last
Budget, building on the £11 billion this Government have already
committed to investment in housing over the spending review period.
Last week’s spending round announcement confirmed a total of
£5.1 billion-worth of investment to support housing in England
from 2015-16 to 2017-18; £3.3 billion of that new funding is for
affordable housing over those years and will support the delivery of
165,000 new affordable homes in England over the next three years. I
can also point out some of the recent housing numbers. Housing building
starts in England rose by 4% in Q1 2013, seasonally adjusted. Housing
starts are 15% higher than in the same quarter last year. Starts are

I said earlier, we did not seek in Committee to strike clause 38 or the

Government to consider a wider review. The Minister said that our
debate had gone wider than real estate investment trusts. That is true,
and it is because the Opposition are so concerned about the
Government’s lamentable record on housing. I was disappointed
that the Minister did not see fit to deal with some of the issues that
were raised, particularly the criticisms arising from the work of the
Treasury Committee on the Help to Buy scheme and National Audit Office
report on the new homes bonus. I noticed also that the Minister was not
tempted to respond to the concerns expressed by my hon. Friends about
forward planning, housing strategy, how that would be funded,

am disappointed that once again the Government have come up with warm

scrutinise their policies and report back to the House, they have
refused to do so. For that reason, I unfortunately cannot accommodate

he is terribly disappointed but not surprised. I therefore intend to

was introduced in schedule 19 to the Finance Act 1999. It is
essentially a proxy for stamp duty on the return of units in unit
trusts to the investment managers who deal in those transactions. If
individuals buy units in unit trusts and then surrender or sell them
back to the investment manager, a stamp duty of 0.5% has not

reflect Britain’s place in the world and what proportion of the
global asset management industry was in Britain in 1999 and is still

country life is getting harder. I confess, however, that I have not
been lobbied by or seen those poor, unfortunate City investment
managers knocking at my door, coming to my surgeries, or writing
e-mails and saying, “Please, the one thing we need is the
abolition of the stamp duty reserve tax. There is massive hardship
among investment managers at this time, which demands a £150
million tax giveaway.” Frankly, I think the investment
management community is doing reasonably well relative to the rest of
the country. Moreover, I do not think that the City of London is
uncompetitive. Indeed, all the evidence suggests the opposite and that
the City continues to thrive and do exceptionally well—something
like £5 trillion in funds is under the management of
those investment managers affected by this tax change, and a tax cut of
150 million quid is small change to that community.</hs_Para>

pregnancy grant was given to mums-to-be to ensure they ate healthily
and had a little help at that time. That was slashed; that had to go
because £150 million had to be saved, yet in next
year’s Budget the Chancellor 
<?notus-xml column=864?>is introducing a £150 million tax cut for the investment
management community. That is about the same amount of money as was cut
from the child tax credit supplement for one and two-year-olds in that

pasty tax and the caravan tax were supposed to save—I am sure
the Minister will remember that from the ill-fated omnishambles 2012

trust transactions, what will be next? What else will they give away to
this particular set of fortunate investors? Will the Minister rule out

in the Budget or what will happen in future Finance Bills; but for the
time being, it is incumbent on the Minister to do at least this one
thing: let us have the distributional analysis showing who benefits

will gain the most from this £150 million tax cut? The case for
it has not been made. It has not been high on the public agenda. There

changes made since 2010. Those who have found themselves pushed into

their failure to repeat the bonus tax, the millionaires’ tax cut

hire people in the community, on a commission basis, to persuade their
neighbours to take out loans at exorbitant rates of interest that they

misconceptions need to be cleared up. The hon. Member for Swansea West
(Geraint Davies) talked about banking, but this measure has nothing
whatever to do with banking. A regrettable consequence of what has
happened in recent years is that the financial services sector as a
whole has too often been equated with the banking industry and
associated with its frequently catastrophic misjudgments and regulatory
failures, and people have been tainted unfairly by that association.
Just as there are hundreds of thousands of ordinary working
people employed by banks who bear no responsibility for—indeed,
are sickened by—some of the misdeeds that were committed by
those at the top before and during the crisis, there are people who
work hard for a living elsewhere in financial services, who contribute
to our national income, the taxes that pay for our public services and
our foreign exchange earnings, and who have certainly not put
taxpayers' funds at risk in the way that characterised the worst
excesses of the banking
industry.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070292000658" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0004.htm#13070292000658">The
investment management industry in this country is a case in point. It

about those who are ancillary to it—are based outside London and
the south-east. A large number of them are concentrated in
Scotland—I should have thought that the hon. Member for Dumfries

the north-west and the north midlands. In fact, 12% of the asset
management industry is in Scotland. I am amazed that

not to recognise the problem that existed. As I have said, given the
position that he enjoys, I would expect him to be aware of the
long-standing damage to the competitiveness of an industry that employs
people in his constituency. There are some very distinguished firms in
his constituency. The Nottingham office of Brewin Dolphin has been

investment management industry has a strong reputation internationally,
yet—here we come to the reason for the reform—since 2000,
countries such as Luxembourg and Ireland have increased their market
share of domiciled funds dramatically in comparison with the United

dwindled to less than half that of Luxembourg and has been overtaken by
Ireland.</hs_Para>

is the reason for that? It cannot be because the reputation of British
fund management has declined, as many of the funds domiciled elsewhere
in Europe are in fact managed remotely by fund managers within the UK.
It cannot be because the fundamental competitiveness of UK financial
services has declined, because we have maintained, and very often
increased, our market share in other parts of the financial services
industry. For example, twice as many euros are traded in the UK than in
the entire eurozone. One of the principal reasons for this competitive
decline is a consequence—unintended, I am sure—of a
change in the tax system that was made in 1999, and whose effect
everyone agrees has been deleterious.</hs_Para>

19 of the Finance Act 1999 imposed a special stamp duty reserve
tax—SDRT—on the investment management industry when fund
managers match investors leaving a fund and surrendering their units
with those joining the fund and purchasing the units. Because the fund
manager is not buying any UK shares, no stamp duty reserve tax is
payable, but schedule 19 imposes a tax of 0.5% on the fund manager, as
if the shares have been bought.
Of<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T19:41:16"></hs_TimeCode> course,
whenever a fund manager buys UK shares within a fund, full stamp duty
is paid. As well as being complex and burdensome—requiring
frequent tax calculations and returns to be sent to HMRC—there
is a major flaw with schedule 19. Anyone who does not wish to pay
schedule 19 can simply invest in otherwise identical funds, have them
managed by a UK fund manager, but have them domiciled elsewhere, and
that is what has happened in recent years.

should this matter? <I>[Interruption.] </I>I think the shadow Chief
Secretary should take an interest, since he was not aware of the
problem to which this is the solution. What are the advantages of
having funds domiciled in the UK? First, there are advantages in terms
of jobs, particularly in the regional economy. While fund managers can
operate from anywhere, most jobs in fund management come from ancillary
services and the professional services associated with them. These are
high-value jobs in IT, legal services and accountancy support, and they
are typically in the jurisdictions in which the funds are
domiciled.</hs_Para>

there are advantages in terms of tax revenue. Although schedule 19
imposes SDRT on fund managers matching investors for UK funds, the
Exchequer would be advantaged by having more funds domiciled in the UK,
as that would involve the paying of income tax, national insurance,
VAT, business rates and other taxes by people who would be employed
here, rather than in Luxembourg, Ireland and other countries, and
corporation tax by the companies supplying ancillary
services.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070292000666" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0004.htm#13070292000666">Finally,
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T19:43:02"></hs_TimeCode>who pays? It is

absolutely right. Already 81% of investors in UK funds are pension
funds or insurers, meaning that people’s income in retirement is
impaired and fewer funds are available for investment in the real
economy. Two-thirds of individuals approaching retirement are
contributing to a pension fund from where these charges are taken, and
the introduction of automatic enrolment will mean that many more
ordinary working people will be saving into a pension for the first
time and will be
affected.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070292000669" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0004.htm#13070292000669">So
there is a double imperative to act now to correct this situation in
which funds are moving from being domiciled by choice in this country

the critical mass and prominent global position that the industry has
had. Secondly, we are on the cusp of a once-in-a-generation opportunity
for the UK fund management industry, and, with it, the UK economy,
because in July the EU’s alternative investment fund managers
directive comes into force, creating a much more effective single
market across Europe in fund management. It is estimated that
€250 billion of funds 
<?notus-xml column=872?>may be available for the UK, and other competitors, to play host to.

terms, the abolition of schedule 19. The measure will be included in
next year’s Finance Bill. The draft legislation, including a tax
information and impact note, will be published for consultation in the
autumn, to inform the consideration of next year’s Finance
Bill—that never happened under the previous Government; this is
totally transparent. The costs that have been included very prudently
in the Red Book represent a conservative case; they do not include any
of the effects or any assumption of what would happen if we reverse
this relative decline compared with jurisdictions such as Ireland and
Luxembourg so that we have an increasing tax take from people being
employed there. The included costs do not reflect the potential boost
to stamp duty reserve tax revenue— empirically, investment funds
tend to have more active investment strategies than direct investors
and are more likely to incur it. Those aspects will be further
elaborated during the consultation and the tax information and impact
note during the next six
months<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T19:46:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

managed to keep a straight face throughout that, but I can almost hear
the thumping of those trading desks across the City of London as people
are delighted at the largesse of a £150 million tax giveaway to
those poor, downtrodden investment managers, who really need that
helping hand just now. That £150 million is the same
amount as the Government saved when they abolished the health in
pregnancy grant—that was not a priority; making sure that they
abolish stamp duty reserve tax on unit trust transactions is where that
£150 million had to go. That is completely crazy. They cannot
even agree to a distributional analysis because they know that it is
the wealthiest in the society who benefit from this. Therefore, we
shall be pushing new clause 11 to a Division.</hs_Para>

am delighted to have the opportunity to speak to new clause 1, albeit
very briefly. It is rather ironic that this issue has probably been one
of the most over-reported aspects of this Finance Bill, when it was not
even in the Bill and we have only a minuscule amount of time to discuss
it. Many colleagues here would like to speak to the new
clause, and many others have come up to me to express their
support.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070292001172" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0004.htm#13070292001172">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T20:00:44"></hs_TimeCode>
has been a lot of misreporting about the new clause, which has commonly
been referred to as some sort of “rebel” amendment. It is
strange when a manifesto commitment, which was also in the coalition
agreement, to a measure of which the Prime Minister himself is a huge
fan becomes a rebel amendment.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T20:00:45"></hs_TimeCode>We are not
rebels. There has been no campaign to orchestrate some sort of
rebellion; in fact, there was never any intention to force the new
clause to a vote, as anyone who had asked would have found out. New
clause 1 is simply a helpful amendment, tabled solely in my name, to
nudge the Chancellor to give a formal commitment in law to a
Conservative party pledge—a popular one at that—and to
name the day, and so dispel the concerns caused by vague references to
the measure being introduced “in due
course<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T20:01:15"></hs_TimeCode>”.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070292001173" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0004.htm#13070292001173">The
measure was good enough to be in the Conservative party manifesto. It
was good enough to be argued out in the coalition agreement, with
accommodation for the Liberal Democrats. It has been good enough for
the Chancellor and Treasury Ministers and the Prime Minister quite
rightly to reaffirm its importance, so surely it must be good enough to
get on with now, to lay to rest any uncertainty about the commitment to
its implementation and to end any delay in its becoming a reality. I am
therefore delighted, even if I have little time to express my delight
this evening, that the Prime Minister has indicated that the measure in
the new clause will now be brought
forward<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T20:01:56"></hs_TimeCode>. I hope
that the Minister will be able to assure me from the Dispatch Box this
evening, or, if there is no time, by writing to me and other hon.
Members, that the measure will be in the next autumn statement, with a
view to putting it in the next Finance Bill, so that, hopefully, the
money will be in people’s pockets by the time of the next
election<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T20:02:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070292001174" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0004.htm#13070292001174">I
have framed the new clause to give the Chancellor maximum flexibility
to determine the exact details of its execution. Spouses,
civil partners and indeed the beneficiaries of same-sex marriage, if
that Bill goes through, will qualify. There is no prescription
about whether the provision applies to basic rate or higher
rate taxpayers, or whether the whole or part of an
allowance should be 
<?notus-xml column=878?>transferable. That can be specified by order to suit
the Chancellor. It is suggested that the tax relief should focus on
couples with at least one child under the age of five—that is,
under school age—and therefore correspond to the child care
allowances to be introduced from 2015, but that, too, can be changed by
order. This is not a prescriptive
amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T20:03:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070292001175" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0004.htm#13070292001175">What
is uncertain is the timing. I hope that the Minister will be able to
confirm what the Prime Minister said in the briefing that he and

the most extraordinary aspect of this debate has been the reaction of
the left to the proposal. This is a popular proposal, and a modest one.
It is popular among the public and among the majority of Labour voters.
The Lib Dems are split on it, but one would expect that: it is party
policy to oppose it, but only recently the Business Secretary attacked
the prejudice against stay at home mothers. When we have an
organisation, Don’t Judge My Family, apparently formed solely to
oppose the measure, saying that it is a throwback to a 1950s fantasy
family image, that is deeply insulting not only to the many millions of
married couples who decide to make a lifelong commitment to each other
in front of their families and friends that is recognised in law, but
to the 90% of young people and the 75% of cohabiting under-35s who in
recent opinion polls have said that they aspire to get
married.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070292001177" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0004.htm#13070292001177"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T20:04:22"></hs_TimeCode>There
are many different forms of family in the 21st century, and
most do a fantastic job of keeping together and bringing up children,
often in difficult circumstances, yet almost uniquely among large OECD
countries, the UK does not recognise the commitment and stability of
marriage in the tax system until one of the partners dies. Worse still,
one-earner married couples on an average wage with two children face a

why. For a 15-year-old living at home with both birth parents, there is
a 97% chance that those parents are married. For a five-year-old with
parents at home, there is a one in 10 chance of those
parents splitting up if they are married, but a one in three

the Government abolished child benefit for higher rate taxpayers, they
did an injustice to the tax system. May I briefly recall why? The
background to this, which you will remember, Madam Deputy Speaker, is
that we used to have family allowances and child tax allowances. The
tax allowance and the benefit were merged into the single payment of
child benefit. Child benefit then had two functions: it was a cash
payment to mothers but it also maintained tax equity between people
further up the income scale who have children and those further up the
tax scale who do not have children. By abolishing child benefit for
higher-rate taxpayers, the Government forewent the one instrument at
their disposal to maintain tax equity for higher-rate taxpayers between
those who have no children and those who do have children.</hs_Para>

they abolished the tax-free income for higher-rate taxpayers if they
had children and therefore put them on the same level as people who do
not have children? We never had that in the tax system before; we have

I pay tribute to the invaluable work that it has done. The Bill takes

introduces two optional simpler income tax schemes for small
incorporated businesses and a new time-limited disincorporation relief

this issue involves raising topics that people often do not want to

me begin by saying that it is important to acknowledge the success of
the programme. Since its launch in 2008-09, it has successfully
screened and vaccinated more than 80% of applicable girls. Last year
the original HPV vaccine was replaced with the quadrivalent HPV
vaccine, which provides protection against the two strains of HPV that
cause at least nine in 10 cases of genital warts. Of course this added
protection is above the primary purpose of the vaccination
programme—to bring down rates of cervical and vaginal cancer in
women<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T20:59:55"></hs_TimeCode>. Men are,
however, up to six times more likely than women to have oral HPV
infection, thereby increasing the risk of cancers of the throat, neck

is not just a matter for England and Wales, but the whole of the United

immunity is valuable, but it is not foolproof for heterosexual men. I
have mentioned that it is valuable where heterosexual men are having

subject to herd immunity, and that is another element of inequality.
E<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T21:03:11"></hs_TimeCode>vidence from
other countries suggests herd immunity will eventually prevent most,

HPV-related cancers are on the rise in the UK, despite the vaccination
programme. Throat cancer has overtaken cervical cancer as the leading
HPV-related cancer in the UK. Men who have sex with women who are not
vaccinated remain at risk. This is of concern to men who, for example,
have sex while on holiday or while living outside the UK, or who have
sex with unvaccinated migrants to the UK—but men, straight or
gay, remain at risk.</hs_Para>

vaccination programme to be
widened.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070292001789" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/debtext/130702-0005.htm#13070292001789">The
key issue I wish to press is the health inequality in respect of gay
men and anal cancer, an inequality perpetuated by the current
vaccination policy. Gay men already experience poorer sexual health as
a group; they are at an increasing and far higher risk of HIV and other
sexually transmitted infections compared with the wider population.
Rates of anal cancer in gay men are now equivalent to those for
cervical cancer in women before the cervical cancer screening programme
was introduced in 1988. HPV is associated with 80% to 85% of anal
cancer in men, yet it is not yet possible to screen for or effectively

HPA, now part of PHE, to undertake that study. The study is under way

this country, we elect a Parliament, but we do not elect a Government.
A Government without legitimacy must find that legitimacy elsewhere; in
our case, they do so by taking over and running our Parliament. Almost
all the problems of our democracy can be traced to that fundamental
failure to have a genuine separation of powers. For example, the
public, and even some Members of Parliament, see the parliamentary
interest and the Government interest as one.</hs_Para>

be truly a pluralist democracy—one in which many independent and
legitimate institutions interact—we need belatedly to tread the
path of virtually every other western democracy and to be allowed
directly to elect our Government. Only then will Parliament, free from
Executive control and domination, be fully functional and fit to fulfil
its purpose which, in Gladstone’s words, is not to run the
country, but to hold to account those who
do<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T09:31:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070256000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/halltext/130702h0001.htm#13070256000009">Until
then, those of us who believe in building a broad-based democracy need
to point out, not least to Ministers, that by dominating Parliament,
the Government cheat themselves of an effective partner, as well as
denying the people their separate legislature and their democratic
voice. That system has been seen to fail over and over again, and we
are still in the midst of it.</hs_Para>

education and reform effort involves demonstrating how an effective
Parliament could work. There is no better example of that than the work
of the Wright Committee. Its creation was a fluke; its
legitimacy—it was the first parliamentary Committee elected by
MPs themselves in a secret ballot—was a miracle; and the timing
of its report, which appeared just before the radical and
never-to-be-repeated first year of a new Government, was fortunate. The
strength of its cause, the determination of its members and the
masterful maximisation of opportunity by its Chair led to some
significant change.</hs_Para>

although a tired Government, strong leadership and a radical Leader of
the House meant that some change happened, the window soon closed. When

also congratulate him on being an obvious example of those colleagues
in the House who put the parliamentary interest above the alternative
Executive interest, and he is always courageous in doing so. He makes a
good point about the coalition agreement, although I do not wish to
intrude on private grief between the Conservative and Liberal Democrat
partners. However, the Liberal Democrats were always great reformers
when they had no chance of being in government. On many of these
issues, I agreed very much with their views—even more than with
the Labour party’s views. However, the appeal of those views
seems to have lost its glitter for them in the past three years, as the
seduction of being in government, and of being seen to be the leading
personalities in the Government, has overtaken the desire actually to
do something about this issue. The Labour party should take cognisance
of that.</hs_Para>

the specific point about why the Government have done nothing, I will
let the Minister respond, because he is better placed to do so. He will
be able to tell us the ins and outs of why the problem has occurred and
why nothing has happened. What we have seen is, however, part of the
process of integration; it is almost reminiscent of the old show
trials, in that people are put through the fire and made to recant.
Sometimes they have to appear in the dock, holding up their trousers
because their belt has been taken away, as in the 1930s movies of the
reformed Communist party in the Soviet Union. However, perhaps the
Minister is wearing a belt today—I look forward to finding
out.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070256000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/halltext/130702h0001.htm#13070256000016"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T09:36:24"></hs_TimeCode>It
is strange that the indignity involved here is  crystal clear
because, as the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr Hollobone)
said<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>, the words
are in the coalition agreement. There is no room for equivocation in
the words he read out, as the agreement says the changes
“will” happen. None the less, the Minister, whom I have a
lot of time for, and the Leader of the House get up in public to recant
and deny; they tell us what their sins were and say they will not
repeat them, even though their earlier words are written, as the hon.
Gentleman said, in blood in the coalition agreement, which apparently
governs the country.
That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T09:37:09"></hs_TimeCode> is a great
shame, because hard-won manifesto commitments and sacred commitments in
coalition agreements between parties should not be cast aside lightly

been broken.</hs_Para>

reforming the House. We should do that not in a starry-eyed way, but in
the certain knowledge that if we press too far, the Executive will

hon. Gentleman has tempted me to talk a little about the coalition. My
assumption is that there will be an attempt before the 2015 election to
differentiate the two coalition partners. I hope that the Conservative
party takes the opportunity to restate its commitment to this issue,
particularly as it may, in the past few years, have witnessed
Parliament operating more effectively than at any point during my time
in the House. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T09:38:55"></hs_TimeCode>I
also hope that the Liberal Democrats will rediscover their tradition of
democratic reform, which is much needed. I hope, too, that Labour party
Front Benchers will see that just running the machine without an
effective Parliament—that keeping Parliament down and placated

one hand tied behind our backs. Let us become an effective partnership,

Wright process introduced much of which we can be proud, but still
there is a great deal to be done. Many in the large 2010 intake of new
Members thankfully take the progress for granted, but they should know
that much of it was incredibly hard won, and was fought for over
decades. It needs to be preserved and extended in the face of Executive
power—a power that is unfettered by a clear constitution. That
power will always try, when the opportunity arises, to regain total
control over its parliamentary vassal and vehicle, if there are no
bulwarks against that inevitable process to prevent the internalised
culture in Whitehall from making its mark. That process has been made
more difficult by the fact that the Government are a coalition.
However, a return to one-party business as usual will bring a strong
revival of Executive retrenchment and many people will be licking their
lips at the prospect of putting Parliament back in its place where it
belongs, to do what it is told. I speak not out of fantasy, but as one
who served some time in the Government Whips Office and saw that
process. I saw a clear demonstration of how that power is used against
the parliamentary interest.</hs_Para>

window after 2015, if all the other astrological conjunctions occur as

political lifetime, done differently, and that, if parliamentarians are
not vigilant, those days could return. The second achievement was the
election of Select Committee Chairs by MPs in a secret ballot of the
whole House, meaning that they now speak for 
<?notus-xml column=172?>Parliament and their colleagues, rather than being awarded their
chairmanship as a consolation prize for losing office, as often
happened. That has led to a glimmer of an alternative path for
parliamentarians who want to pursue a legitimate, respected and
honourable trade as a member of the legislature, disdaining offers of
office and feeling that their role is not to be in office, but to hold
the Government to

their post as the most incredible honour—particularly now that
it is awarded by colleagues. The quality of Select Committee work has
improved immeasurably in the past few years. The quality of the
reports, and the fact that Chairs speak not only for their Committees
but for the House, mean that there is greater strength in what they
say. Their effect as well as their status has improved. I can give only
a personal answer to the hon. Gentleman, who is strident in his support
of the parliamentary interest as opposed to the Executive interest,
often at some cost to himself. For me, the honour of being a Select
Committee Chair is a great thing, and I did not seek it for recompense.
I would be happy to have a personal assistant for the
Committee—not a Committee Clerk—because I would regard
that as a greater advantage and help to me, in the job that I do, than
the extra payment. I do not even know what that payment is, but perhaps
we should all put those sums into a pool to strengthen the efforts of
our Select Committee structure and build it even more

is the unfinished business? The main thing is the creation of a House
business committee. Parliament is not allowed to set its own agenda, or
even to be consulted on it, other than in the most ritualistic,
formulaic way. Remarkably, the very Government who are meant to be held
to account set the agenda of the institution that, theoretically at
least, is meant to do that holding to account. If this were any other
walk of life, the average High Court judge would throw out such an
arrangement as counter to natural justice, but in Parliament we swallow
the mythology and treat it as part of everyday life, without challenge.
It takes centuries of self-deception to get normally intelligent people
to swallow that without question, but we are now being given the
opportunity, through the Wright Committee proposals, to question that
seriously—perhaps for the first

do not mean that the Government should not get their business. I am
clear about that, as was the Wright Committee. We introduced stringent
safeguards, up to and including the nuclear weapon enabling the
Government to vote through the business statement if they ever felt the
slightest bit challenged. It is not a weapon that we give the
Government gladly, but it is there if they want to take it up. However,
the Government getting their own business need not mean that Parliament
cannot be properly involved and consulted on its own agenda. The
Backbench Business Committee proved that that can happen without
civilisation collapsing. The Political and Constitutional Reform
Committee that I chair will report on that issue soon, and it is no
secret that we shall try to propose ways forward—being
co-operative, and being partners in the process—that will not
make the Government anxious. Parliament might be the emaciated pet
mouse of the 800 lb gorilla of Executive power, but we are ever

what further the House could do. At the time of the recommendation,
people were saying, “This is ridiculous. These people will be
out of control. They will be doing pet topics. It depends who seizes

the House can proceed with a small number of Bills—perhaps only
three or four—that are guaranteed to be given a Second Reading

occasional debates, but early days could be found so that some
credibility is restored to early-day motions, rather than their being
used to buy off constituents who have raised a particular issue with
their Member of Parliament and feel that signing an early-day motion

respond.” If people wish to petition and e-petition the House
separately asking for a proper debate, the House should take that
seriously, but it should not be given a ceiling. Editors in newsrooms
tell their journalists they have to pump up the numbers so that they
can press the House to have a vote on something that is  on
their agenda; petitions should be given back to the

Peter Bone</B> (Wellingborough) (Con):</Member> It is a great pleasure
to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Crausby. I congratulate the hon.
Member for Nottingham North (Mr Allen) on a powerful speech. I entirely
agree with its content, so I shall go a little—in fact, a
lot—further and faster. I think that his reluctance to do so is
due to the fact that unfortunately, he has spent a bit of time in the
Whips Office, which does something to dent the spirit.</hs_Para>

came to the House in 2005, I had a whole mound of mail, which I spent
most of my time throwing in the bin. I opened an envelope, and there
was a little book signed by the author, Graham Allen. It was an
interesting book about the relationship with the Prime Minister: was he
now actually the President? I could not put it down, and I have
treasured it. It was nice to get it, but it was also a well-argued
book.</hs_Para>

debates that the book raises is whether we should have separation of
powers and an Executive that is completely independent of Parliament.
On balance, I think that is a bad thing, because we have the wonderful 
<?notus-xml column=178?>opportunity, even if only on a Wednesday now, to ask the head of the
Executive questions. There are still advantages to how our system
works. However, the problem is that people in opposition who want to be
in Government or become Prime Minister can analyse things correctly and
sensibly. When the current Prime Minister was in opposition, he
produced a wonderful speech called “Fixing Broken
Politics”, which I urge every Member to read. Everything in it
is right. He decided how he was going to correct things. He is now
Prime Minister, and none of those things have been corrected. I argue
that in many cases, they have got worse.</hs_Para>

lot of things that we could easily do to bring Parliament back, even
just a little. We can only move the pendulum back a bit at the moment,
but one simple thing that we could do is restore Prime
Minister’s questions to twice a week, and have one occasion on a
Thursday. At the moment, Members come down late on Monday for a vote in
the evening, and on Wednesday evening, after Prime Minister’s
questions, they want to go. One thing that I have never understood is
why so many Members work so hard to be elected and come to this place
when, once they are here, all they want to do is get away from it. It
is an extraordinary state of affairs. Regrettably, this debate is not
particularly well attended. It should be packed. This is what

about 50 Bills last week; we took that power away from the
Executive, so that we could introduce Bills. One of the Bills that I
introduced was for an allowance for married couples, which I did not
realise that the Chancellor was to take up this very week. In a small

argue differently. Absolutely, we need to reform how private
Member’s business is done. I do not like the idea of, in effect,
reducing the amount of time Members are in Parliament, so I like
sitting for 13 Fridays a year. We do not sit that often in the House,

passionately enough to turn up on a Friday. That is one of the hurdles
that we should have to overcome; it should not be easy to get a private

do not want to speak for long, because other eminent Members wish to
contribute, but I will run through some of the things that annoy me
about how the system works. One is programme motions. When the
Conservative party was in opposition, we routinely opposed programme
motions; we thought they were the worst things because they reduced
scrutiny, as happened to a terrible degree under Prime Minister
Blair’s reign. Yet what have we done? We have come into power
and made it 10 times worse. Every single thing, even if it is an
amendment to the Scottish provisions for something or other, is
timetabled, which is patently absurd. An important issue will be
timetabled to such an extent that some of the amendments that we want
to debate on Report will not be
reached<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T10:12:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070257000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/halltext/130702h0001.htm#13070257000011">I
tabled an amendment to the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill, for
example, proposing a referendum, but it was not discussed, because it
was not reached in time. When a controversial issue is due to be
discussed, it is a sure bet that there will be two statements on the
same day, reducing the time even further. If statements are made, we
should be able to go through the moment of interruption on a timetabled
motion and add on the amount of time taken by the
statements.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T10:13:30"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

away from programming; the House is quite capable of running its own
affairs. We would not be sitting to 4 o’clock in the morning
every night, but if an issue needs proper discussion, we should let it
be discussed; if Members want to be here, let them. I do not understand
how we have allowed the Executive to make the House of Commons so
ineffective that we  do not scrutinise Bills properly. Without

detailed scrutiny that is

their position. Having said that, however, if I was sitting on the
second Bench on the opposite side of the House of Commons, the Labour
Whips would be saying exactly the same as the Government Whips, and
that is the problem. It is not as if the Opposition are pushing for a
business committee; they are not. The Opposition are muted—they
say nothing—and I am really sad about that. I hope that what

purpose of the House business committee, as proposed by the Wright
Committee, was, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T10:23:16"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Nottingham North said so eloquently, to enable the House
to gain control of its own agenda. At present, the Executive, under
Standing Order No. 14, overwhelmingly control the use of parliamentary
time, even following the creation of the excellent Backbench Business
Committee. The Executive not only decide what business is put before
the House, but the scheduling of that business.</hs_Para>

Wright Committee’s proposal was that the House agenda should be
determined not unilaterally by Ministers, but rather by the House
itself, working in collaboration with Ministers. Ministers would still
have adequate time to carry through their own business—no one is
challenging that—but the rest of the business should be not a
matter for the Executive alone, but for the House as  a
whole.</hs_Para>

main reform recommended by Wright for that purpose was that the House
as a whole should be able to vote on the agenda for the next week or
weeks, rather than, as we all know is the case at present, the agenda
being delivered to the House ex cathedra by the Leader of the House,
although sometimes, of course, that is after prior consultation with
the Opposition through the usual channels. I repeat again, because this
must not be used as an argument against change, that that process would
in no way prevent the Government—indeed, this could be written
into the Standing Orders if necessary—from being able to bring
forward all their business for proper debate and a vote on the Floor of
the House, and within an agreed time scale, so there would be no threat
to the Government at
all<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T10:25:01"></hs_TimeCode>. Instead,
the aim was to ensure that the remainder of parliamentary business was
managed in a way that required the consent of the House and that was
not manipulated in a manner designed to suit the interests of the
Executive.</hs_Para>

Meacher:</Member></B> Yes, but it is also true that when more
controversial issues are discussed—although the great advantage
of the Backbench Business Committee is that a lot of issues that would
never arise in the House, but are of great interest to a significant
proportion of the public, are debated—as the last vote is often
on Wednesday at 7 pm, those debates are not sufficiently well attended
to secure a vote that would properly reflect the balance of the whole
House. Of course, many Members depart for other commitments on a
Wednesday. That is their choice, even if many of us think that they
should not do so, but the temptation to do so, because of the
organisation of the agenda, is considerable.</hs_Para>

Member’s Bills are largely marginalised because they are

constraints, and they can be readily squeezed out due to filibustering
on prior Bills taken the same day.</hs_Para>

Report stage of Bills is crucial, but it is often a caricature of
scrutiny: inadequate time is allotted to consider extremely important
issues; many Members—I will return to this point—are not
properly informed about what they are voting on; and many significant
amendments are simply not reached at all. Equally, Lords amendments,
which generally focus on issues that are not only the most
controversial, but the most important, are frequently not given the
time and consideration that they clearly deserve. Given the time
pressure, less important business is often given a measure of priority
that could be challenged.</hs_Para>

those drawbacks and deficiencies could begin to be redressed by the
principle of a votable agenda. I repeat that the Government would still
command a majority in the House, but they would have to listen much
more carefully to the strongly held views of Members, particularly when
there was a consensus between the Opposition and Government Back
Benchers. Crucially, it would introduce transparency into setting the
agenda, which could involve all Members, not simply Front Benchers
engaged in discussions through the usual channels behind the
scenes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T10:28:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070257000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/halltext/130702h0001.htm#13070257000038">The
Wright Committee envisaged that the votable agenda motion would
supersede Thursday’s business questions, and that it would be
subject to debate and amendment, with the Speaker having the right to
select and group amendments as happens now with other business. If an
amendment was selected, it could be debated for up to 45 minutes, with
time-limited speeches of perhaps five minutes. If no amendment was
tabled, there could of course still be a question and answer session,
which would be similar to what happens
now<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T10:29:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070257000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/halltext/130702h0001.htm#13070257000039">Clearly
a votable motion could be presented by the Leader of the House and
amended via the formalities of open debate on the Floor, followed by a
Division. However, the whole process of agreeing the business
agenda—agreement is the key point—is likely to be far
better negotiated, in a more inclusive and participative manner, if
there have been detailed discussions between representatives of both
the Executive and the legislature beforehand. Surely all Members must
agree that openness is key to achieving better democratic
accountability. Regular meetings—perhaps weekly—between
both sides, in the forum of a House business committee, are much more
likely to secure the outcome that the management of Government business
is a genuinely shared process that is not subject to hidden traps that
the House discovers only later, at considerable
cost<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T10:30:27"></hs_TimeCode>, as happens
all too often at present. The object of the exercise is not in any way
to aggravate the Executive or to contest votes, but to build a
consensus. It is about involvement in the actual decision making for
the scheduling of Government business, not merely the scrutiny of
decisions already taken.</hs_Para>

quick word about how the House business committee might work, as
several questions need to be settled. First, it should not pre-empt,
incorporate or supersede in any way the excellent work of the Backbench
Business Committee, which has been referred to strongly 
<?notus-xml column=184?>in the debate. That Committee has an entirely separate function and, by
general consent, has fulfilled it extremely well. It has established
the right of Back Benchers to debate issues that otherwise might never
have been debated, which often does not accord with the wishes of
either Front Bench team. That should continue and not become confused
with the very separate role of specifically scheduling Government
business.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13070257000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/halltext/130702h0001.htm#13070257000041"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T10:31:51"></hs_TimeCode>Secondly,
if the House business committee is not to be the usual channels writ
large, it should not be chaired by either the Government Chief Whip or
the Leader of the House. Since the essential characteristic of the
chair should be exercising a non-partisan role, the obvious person to
chair it would be the Speaker.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13070257000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/halltext/130702h0001.htm#13070257000042"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T10:32:17"></hs_TimeCode>Thirdly,
the membership of the House business committee—of course,
considerable discussion of this issue is needed—should be
equally balanced between the legislature and the Executive. In a
Committee of 15 members, for example, the Executive could
choose its own seven representatives, while the other seven might be
composed of, say, three chosen by the Opposition parties and two
elected by Back Benchers—in other words, excluding Front
Benchers—with two ex-officio members, whom I would suggest could
be the Chairs of the Liaison Committee and the Backbench Business
Committee.</hs_Para>

the secretariat would have to provided both by the seconded civil
servants who work for the Executive and by the Clerks whose broad role
is to support Parliament in holding the Executive to account. Any
disputes between them would have to be settled by the House business
committee itself.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13070257000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/halltext/130702h0001.htm#13070257000044"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T10:33:26"></hs_TimeCode>I
want to make another key point very quickly. An utterly essential and
fundamental way of improving the scrutiny of Government legislation is
to ensure that Members have a clear and readily available opportunity
to ascertain exactly what they are being asked to vote for when
amendments or new clauses are considered in Committee and on Report. At
present, especially on Report, Members who have not participated in the
Bill’s Committee stage often do not know, or have made little
effort to find out, precisely what they are voting for. Many times,
when the bell rings and, like everyone else, I troop down the escalator
through to the Palace, I turn to whoever is standing beside me, of
whichever party, and ask, “By the way, what are we voting
for?” Perhaps a third of Members shrug their shoulders. Another
third say, “Oh it’s the Social Security Bill,” and
when I ask, “Yes, but what exactly are we voting for?” I
doubt that more than one or two Members actually know. I am guilty of
that too—I am not being holier than anyone else, but that seems
to be a huge failing.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13070257000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/halltext/130702h0001.htm#13070257000045"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T10:34:55"></hs_TimeCode>This
is a matter of great significance because Report is often the only real
opportunity—especially if the Minister and Government Whip have
kept the Committee stage of a Bill on a tight leash—for the
House to modify a Bill. The debates on Report are usually focused on
important issues about which the public hold strong views. It is a
reasonable assumption that if the public were aware that matters of
considerable importance to themselves were treated in such a cavalier
fashion by many Members, if not most, and that they vote blind without
even knowing what they are voting for, there would be a huge outcry
that Parliament was abusing its proper functions.</hs_Para>

a Member is diligent—and some are—it is necessary to
obtain a copy of the Bill, a copy of the amendments and, on the day of
consideration, a copy of the grouping of amendments selected by the
Speaker. Of course, a number of Members with a particular interest will
do that but, in most cases, they will be in the minority. In the
absence of obtaining the necessary documentation, applying it to
understand the point at hand, which is quite difficult, and reaching a
considered view—perhaps after taking account of arguments
advanced by letter or e-mail from interested individuals or
organisations—the default position is for Members to troop in,
see on which side their Whips are standing, and just follow them into
the Lobby like sheep.</hs_Para>

if a Member took the trouble to get and read the relevant documents,
however, it is often difficult for someone who has not been following a
Bill closely to understand precisely what an amendment is
designed  to do. Some amendments—even important
ones—may seem obscure to someone who is not familiar with the
underlying arguments behind a Bill, and I think that that is a very
serious flaw.</hs_Para>

key proposal to remedy that problem from the Wright Committee and the
Parliament First all-party group, which I chair, is that every
amendment or new clause tabled by the Government, the Opposition, the
smaller parties or individual Back Benchers should have a short
statement attached to it of no more than 50 words that
explains the measure’s purpose. Those statements would be set
out on the amendment paper, and one would appear at the bottom of every
amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T10:37:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070257000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/halltext/130702h0001.htm#13070257000049">Let
me turn, for one minute, to the objections to that
proposal—apart, of course, from those of the Whips, whose
control over every aspect of the parliamentary process might begin to
be questioned more. The only objection raised, as far as I know, is
that while the Government have their civil servants to deal with
amendments and to provide explanatory statements, the Opposition do not
have the same resources, and adding a requirement for explanatory
statements would impose too great a burden. To put it simply, I think
that that is utterly untenable. It takes a great deal of time to get to
grips with a new Bill, to consult outside experts over all its detailed
aspects, to identify areas in which modifications need to be sought and
to draft amendments in an acceptable parliamentary form. However, once
all that has been done, drafting a short statement that distils the
essence of the amendment would take no more than seconds. I hope that

Mr Crausby, to have the opportunity to serve under your chairmanship.
As I said to you last night, I think that this is the first time that I
have had such a pleasure. I congratulate
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T10:40:26"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Nottingham North (Mr Allen) on securing the debate. The
discussion has been quite lively and thought provoking. Unfortunately,
I do not agree with all his analysis, not least the point about
separation of powers. There is an excellent book called “Plain,
Honest Men”,
which<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T10:41:15"></hs_TimeCode> I commend
to him. It is about the constitutional convention in Philadelphia. It
is a thought-provoking book that gives some idea as to why the United
States has a separation of powers between the Executive and the
legislature, but like many things from the United States, it is in
itself a reason not to go down that route. Parliament would be weaker
if we separated our Executive from our legislature in the way that I
think my hon. Friend was alluding

are seven or eight points that I would like to respond to in the
limited time that I have. First, this might be heresy to some
colleagues, but the Wright report is not a panacea. There is now this
mythology that somehow it got everything right. I think that it is
about time that a reality check was applied to that. This Parliament
has made huge strides towards modernisation, but not just because of
the Wright report. There are three other factors that have changed the
dynamic of this Parliament compared with previous
ones.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070258000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/halltext/130702h0001.htm#13070258000010">One<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T10:42:18"></hs_TimeCode>
factor is the 2010 intake of Members. I do not say that just because
that was my intake; we have seen that it has been the most rebellious
of intakes. In the excellent blog by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T10:42:31"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Wokingham 
<?notus-xml column=187?>(Mr Redwood), he busts the myths about some of the rebellions that have
taken place on the Government side and he points out that some of the
most effective and important rebellions were led by Members who were
part of the 2010 intake. I am referring to the entirely sensible
pushing back against the Deputy Prime Minister’s nonsensical
ideas for House of Lords reform, the EU budget vote that took place and
what happened on the EU referendum. Those rebellions were all led by
Members from the 2010 intake. They have been much more effective and
much more willing to challenge their own Government than perhaps was
the case in previous
Parliaments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T10:43:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070258000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/halltext/130702h0001.htm#13070258000011">The
second factor is Mr Speaker. I am a huge fan of the current Speaker. He
has changed how Parliament engages with the wider public and the use of
urgent questions. I think that in the last Session, there were
130 days on which an urgent question was granted to hold the
Executive to account. That should be
commended<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T10:43:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070258000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/halltext/130702h0001.htm#13070258000012">Thirdly—this
is not a good change—there is the Independent Parliamentary
Standards Authority. IPSA has changed how Members of Parliament
operate. It has driven Members away from taking part in Parliament. I
think that, so far, Professor Wright has failed to change IPSA now that
he is a board member and that he needs to be held to account for that
failure to curb IPSA’s worst
excesses<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T10:43:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070258000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/halltext/130702h0001.htm#13070258000013">On
Select Committees, I agree that we have some very effective Select

contradiction today. My
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T10:44:00"></hs_TimeCode>hon. Friend the
Member for Nottingham North applauded the fact that the choice of
Select Committee members has been taken out of the hands of the Whips,
but later he bemoaned the fact that keeping hold of Select Committee
members as we get closer to the general election becomes harder and
harder. This is a valid point. One problem that we have is that because
they were elected by colleagues from their own party, many Members went
on to Select Committees on the basis of their name. They arrived in the
House in the 2010 intake with a reputation from outside and were
elected on to Select Committees, but they have not been very effective
performers in many cases. We must recognise the

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T10:45:37"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Nottingham North said, some Select Committees are
struggling to get quoracy because Members were put on them at the start
of the Parliament and have lost interest, been promoted or whatever
else. There is also a broader point about whether Front Benchers should
routinely be allowed to serve on Select Committees. I think that, in
the previous Parliament, that happened. Many members of what was then
the Conservative Opposition served on Select Committees.
<I>[Interruption.] </I>I am sorry, but on the Education Committee, the
Defence Committee and others, there were Front Benchers who served, and
there is merit in that, because Select Committees have more opportunity

we are doing is changing a date, for example from “2017”

statements. I gently refer my right hon. Friend to the Procedure

are in the third year of this Parliament, which provides an opportunity
to reflect on the success of recent reforms and allows time to deliver
further reform in this Parliament, where the case for such reform is
made. Before addressing the points raised by Members, which relate to
the outstanding recommendations, I would like briefly to reflect on
what has been delivered, because there is a positive story to tell. The
reform Committee made 50 recommendations in its report, and a majority
have been implemented in full or require no further action—in
other words, those cases where there was a statement of principle, for
example. Specific achievements that directly relate to the
recommendations include the election of Select Committee Chairs; the
election of Deputy Speakers; the ability to debate substantive motions;
the provision of Monday afternoons in Westminster Hall for debates on
e-petitions, which I hope we are about to renew; the endorsement of
September sittings; and, arguably the most important change, the
establishment of the Backbench Business
Committee.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070258000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/halltext/130702h0001.htm#13070258000030">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T10:51:33"></hs_TimeCode>
addition, I remind Members of the changes we have introduced for the
scrutiny of legislation, which a few Members have suggested is wanting
in some respects. 
<?notus-xml column=190?>Some of those changes were made in direct response to recommendations of
the reform Committee. They include an increased number of multi-day
report stages, so two days on Report is now common for major Bills,
although I would not say that it was routine; the increased use of
pre-legislative scrutiny, which Members welcome, with 17 sets of
measures published in draft last session; and more time for scrutiny:
most Public Bill Committees—nearly 80%—in the 2012-13
Session finished early. The changes also include successful pilots on
public readings—for example, the Protection of Freedoms Act
2012, Small Charitable Donations Act 2012 and the Children and Families
Bill; and successful pilots of explanatory statements on amendments,
and I welcome the fact that that will proceed. I wondered whether the
Opposition’s initial reluctance was because they were not
certain what their amendments were going to do, but given that they are
going to support explanatory statements, that is clearly not the
case<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T10:52:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070258000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/halltext/130702h0001.htm#13070258000031"><B><Member ContinuationText="Thomas Docherty" PimsId="5686" UID="13070258000102" xid="1052" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/halltext/130702h0001.htm#13070258000102">Thomas

for Nottingham North (Mr Allen) on securing the debate. I do not share
his rather apocalyptic vision of our parliamentary democracy. He knows
that Parliament and the Executive are not separate. I do not believe,
as he seems to, that Government are dominating Parliament. The Chair of
the Backbench Business Committee,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T10:53:34"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for North East Derbyshire (Natascha Engel), might have been slightly
offended by that suggestion, because it is widely recognised that her
Committee has grasped a substantial proportion of what was previously
Government time and on the back of that initiated a series of important
debates, a third of which have taken place on days other than Thursday.
They do not always take place on Thursdays, but as she commented,
Thursday is a sitting day. Many of us spent many years campaigning to
secure our positions in Parliament, so one would expect Members to be
willing to work or stay on Thursdays to participate in debates that
take place then.</hs_Para>

think the <hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T10:54:27"></hs_TimeCode>hon.
Member for Nottingham North encouraged me to push reform, if not in
government then certainly in a future Liberal Democrat manifesto. David
Howarth, who is no longer a Member of Parliament, did a good job of
pushing that agenda when he was here, and he continues to do so. I am
sure we will want to return to this matter in a future manifesto. We
have achieved a substantial amount. The hon. Gentleman threw down the
gauntlet to me—as did other Members, including
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T10:55:05"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Wellingborough (Mr Bone) and
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T10:55:07"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Oldham West and Royton (Mr Meacher)—over the creation
of a House business committee, and I will throw down the gauntlet
gently in his face, to mix my metaphors. The Government’s
position is that if there were a House business committee 
<?notus-xml column=191?>proposal on the table it would have to pass certain tests, and some
Members outlined what those tests should be. The Government should
retain control of their legislative programme, and the committee should
respect the remit of the Backbench Business Committee; it should take
into account the views of all parts of the House; it should retain the
flexibility to change the business at short notice in response to
fast-moving events; and it should co-ordinate business with the House
of Lords, to which I do not think any Member referred. If any Members
came forward with such a proposal, I am sure that other Ministers and I
would want to look at it
carefully<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T10:56:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

oppressive investigation by Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs.
They have had to fight against an unjustified tax charge and to
struggle ultimately for proper redress and compensation. As so much

2—review is carried out by a different case handler to help to
provide an independent perspective on the case. Again, it is worth
noting that the vast majority of cases are resolved over the first two
tiers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T11:21:38"></hs_TimeCode>. In the

my hon. Friend is aware, a customer can also ask their Member of

investigates complaints impartially, specifically on allegations of

organisation. The original investigation was not handled well, and that
was further compounded by the failure of HMRC complaints handlers to

the case of all complaints that are referred to either the adjudicator

elsewhere<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T11:24:27"></hs_TimeCode>. One
area in which HMRC has learned lessons from such complaints and
improved its processes is alternative dispute resolution. It uses the
skills of an independent HMRC facilitator  to work with
customers, agents and caseworkers to try to reach an agreement and
resolve
disputes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T11:24:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070259000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/halltext/130702h0001.htm#13070259000012">HMRC
has held a successful pilot and is now rolling out that approach more
widely, and I hope that that provides some reassurance that action has
been taken, following the ombudsman’s report to improve
performance

Friend’s constituents raise concerns about the
“agenda” of the ombudsman in failing to uphold entirely

reached by her, I am condoning “dishonesty, deceit and
collusion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T11:25:10"></hs_TimeCode>”.
Although I have every sympathy with my hon. Friend’s
constituents, and I understand the frustrations that they have
experienced, I strongly contest that suggestion. There can be no doubt
about the independence of the ombudsman from HMRC—or indeed any

hon. Friend’s constituents have been critical  of the
level of payment awarded, as it is significantly  below the

expense incurred as a result of the extended investigation and,
additionally, a compensation payment has been made for the unnecessary
suffering caused by HMRC’s handling of the matter, in accordance

authorities in England, Scotland and Wales were surveyed for the
report, and 155 of them replied, which is roughly a third of the total

report was not all rosy, and it highlights the concerns expressed by
some authorities. Those concerns can be grouped into three areas.
First, there is an issue with the “people” capacity for
councils and faith groups to engage with each other, and it can be
difficult to ensure that they make enough space to understand each
other. Examples were given of situations either where a council could
not allocate staff to co-ordinate service provision with faith groups,
or where churches, on occasion, were unable to deliver a service that
they might have undertaken to
provide<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T14:32:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070276000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/halltext/130702h0001.htm#13070276000010">A
second challenging area is the potential for organisational culture
clash. The financial and governance requirements of councils can be
quite onerous and difficult to meet for faith groups that want to
provide a service to their community. Sometimes local authority
terminology and the complex protocols can be a bit of a barrier to
success<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T14:33:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070276000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/halltext/130702h0001.htm#13070276000011">For
me, however, the most worrying hurdle to good co-working between
councils and faith groups relates to the fears and suspicions about
what each partner might require the other to do. Councils expressed
concern that faith groups might provide services only to their own 
<?notus-xml column=202?>faith community and might refuse to support people from other faiths, or
from the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community. Another
barrier was cited by Rochford district council, which said

Northern Ireland, I think that many of the things that she referred to
apply to Northern Ireland. We have CAP in my constituency: it started
just over a year ago and it is doing great work. There are also food
banks, set up by Christian organisations, that are doing great work.

right that CAP and other faith-based groups work right across the

between people; everyone benefits from the services. However, the
reason that such groups are set up is because people of faith want to

Christian gentleman who handed out food to rough sleepers—food
that he had paid for himself. As more volunteers began to help him, the
borough council began to provide small grants to help to pay for the
food. By 1984, there were 30 volunteers—mainly
Christians—and a daily food service for rough sleepers was
provided all year round. In 2006, the charity officially took the name
of the Hope Centre to reflect its broader range of support and
services, which now included providing training and activities
alongside food, showers and clothing. In 2008, the Northampton Hope

offering practical help to often vulnerable people. I blogged about
this in 2006, under the heading “Flip-flops and
lollipops”, because, as it was described to me, the street
pastors would go out and help young people who were often
extraordinarily drunk, providing lollipops to the young men, who would
rather suck a lollipop than get in a fight, and flip-flops 
<?notus-xml column=204?>to the young women, who often lost their high heels on their first steps

local authorities and grant-making bodies often seem to be pretty
uneasy about faith playing a part in service delivery, as is
highlighted in the report that prompted this debate. Consequently,
faith-based organisations often feel that they ought to downplay the
role and importance of faith in their work. Such organisations are
absolutely clear that they cannot take faith out of their faith-based
work, and if they attempted to do so, there would not be much left.
That would result in a lack of integrity on their part, because faith
is the heart and driving force of what they
do<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T14:52:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

is difficult to explain what the faith-based organisations call
“faith logic” to local authority service commissioners.
Jewish Care, for example, talked to us about its struggle to express
the faith needs of the Jewish community in a particular local authority
area to local authority officers in an understandable way—and
that is in a community in which 20% of the population is Jewish.
Similar concerns were raised in other discussions, and there is a
widespread perception, as the hon. Gentleman suggests, of religious
illiteracy among local authority officers—not malice, I do not
think, but difficulty in understanding what such organisations are
about and how best to relate to
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070276000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/halltext/130702h0001.htm#13070276000043">Such
religious illiteracy has led to local authorities being hesitant to
work with faith groups. One organisation that presented to us described
how there was often scepticism about whether its services are
professional, even though the organisation in question is accredited by
Ofsted. Another organisation found that its local authority is
reluctant to work with a single faith group in case doing so offended
other faith groups. Such problems are often the result of a

we can all see that there are big challenges ahead for our communities.
The pressing question is how we can make the most of the potential

basis for a fresh conversation between local authorities, and public
authorities more generally, on the one hand, and faith communities on
the other hand. Similar things have been considered in the past, and I
know that the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T14:58:02"></hs_TimeCode>

work on that. The idea of a covenant would be to commit the faith
communities that sign up to it to playing their part  in
addressing some of the pressing community needs and to meeting a set of
very high standards, including providing assurances that they would not
do the things that sometimes people suspect they might do, while also
permitting them to be faithful to the convictions that are the reason
for what they do. I hope we will be able to make some specific

the Church of England. The Church of England is, of course, a national
church. The whole point of the Church of England is that it divides the
whole of England into parishes, and every parish has a priest who is
responsible for that parish. Archbishop Temple once observed that the
Church of England was one of very few organisations that existed for
the benefit of people other than its own members. The Church has a
mission to the whole community. It must be, and is, a national
Church.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070276000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/halltext/130702h0001.htm#13070276000065">Recent

churches throughout the country play an active role in their local

clubs for children in deprived areas, and helping to run food banks, as

interesting about the Church Urban Fund’s research findings was
that parishes based on council estates and in inner cities were the
most likely to be active in the community. Some 80% of Church of
England parishes on council estates run activities to address at least
one social need. In my experience, they do so with other faith groups.
The street pastors, food banks and other initiatives that I have seen
involve faith groups working together, and I do not think that there is
any problem with that.</hs_Para>

Member for East Ham, is extremely interesting and probably well worth
pursuing, but I would hope—and I see this throughout the
country—for partnerships between faith groups, and local
government and other organisations. When I recently went to
Wellingborough and Kettering to see street pastors at work, what
impressed me was that at the beginning of the evening, senior police
officers came in to brief them about what was happening in the
community that night, how things were in the town and what they
expected. Those street pastors had the full support and respect of the
local police and the local authority, which was much appreciated.
Whether helping to tackle isolation, family breakdown, debt or
homelessness, or supporting people on low incomes, or with mental
health or drug and alcohol abuse problems, people of faith are present.
I would hope that central and local government will continue to work
out how to maximise that synergy.</hs_Para>

reality breaks out in the Palace of Westminster, and one reality that
has broken out in the past couple of weeks is that the welfare budget

including the shadow Chancellor, have acknowledged that, so we will all
have to be smarter, cleverer and wiser about how we work within the
parameters of the existing welfare budget, which is huge. The House of
Commons Library tells me that the total spent on welfare is forecast to
be £204.1 billion this financial year. In 2016-17, that will
rise to £218.2 billion in cash terms, or £206.9 billion
at this year’s prices, so we will go from £204 billion to
approximately £207 billion in three years’
time, and we will all have to work within that budget. Given the
opportunity, faith groups have the capacity and ability to do much with
central and local government.</hs_Para>

such good engagement does not always happen. How, then, can local and,
indeed, national Government better engage with and support faith groups
to develop their voluntary work and undertake it in as professional a
manner as possible, as the great majority wish to? The “Faith in
the Community” report clearly states that the first step is for
faith groups and local authorities to talk and to develop closer
working relationships to break down barriers, whether perceived or
real. Such barriers might relate to the language used, concerns about
motives, local authorities’ concerns that faith groups’
beliefs will be expressed in a way they consider inappropriate, or
faith groups’ concerns that local authorities will not be
interested in them and that resources and support will not be available
to them just because they are faith groups.</hs_Para>

me turn now to the “Hidden Treasure in Cheshire East: Faith
Action Audit” report, which was produced by the faith community
and the local authority in which my constituency lies. I pay tribute to
Carolyn McQuaker, who spearheaded the report. The clue to what it is is
in the title: an audit of the voluntary and community work of faith
groups. The report is interesting because it takes the overview in the
“Faith in the Community” report, which the all-party
group on Christians in Parliament and the Evangelical Alliance have
just produced, and focuses on just one local authority area.</hs_Para>

interesting that although there was a connection between those groups
and local authority agencies, such as the council for voluntary
service, children’s centres and youth services, only 12.5% of
the responding faith 
<?notus-xml column=213?>groups said they had any such active connection with their local

statistics from the local authority show, the reach of the various
faith groups and the impact that they have on tackling challenges in
our society are immense, and I hope that hon. Members will bear with me

communities that responded are responsible for running 536
projects—an average of between three and four regular caring
projects per group. Incidentally, those projects exclude any that are
established and held for the purpose of teaching religion, which were
not counted in the report. More than 16,300 people engage in those
weekly projects. Some 2,239 toddlers and their carers attend 79 groups
each week, while 5,087 children and young people take part in 207
projects run for them across the area. Some 1,700 elderly people join
in 81 activities, while 2,365 people take part in 64
projects to develop life skills and to help with physical, mental and
material well-being. Nearly 5,000 people take part in other community

addition to the projects run directly by faith groups, their members
also contribute regularly to the life of schools. Some 254 members of

school projects. Many church members also give time regularly to the

representative of the faith groups in Cheshire East as a whole, 862
projects are being run for more than 26,000 people every week, at a
value of many millions of pounds. Of course, that is probably still
vastly understated, because many hours go unrecorded, and the figures

local authorities by sitting on local boards set up by, or in

is important for local authorities to encourage church groups to engage

be a barrier, and staff need to be aware of that. Councils might
consider developing a dedicated faith-based support agency to enable

bridge to the wider voluntary community services and statutory sector,
and to provide a resource to enable faith groups to understand what

partnerships of trust should respect and honour people’s values

reference to the “Faith in the Community” report. People
working with faith groups must connect with them in a way that will
enhance, rather than detract from, what they are doing, and protect the
ownership of the vision and worth that motivates people of faith.

help it to work in partnership with groups that have a faith identity,
to help them to maintain that, and perhaps to avoid the heavy

hon. Friend the Member for Banbury (Sir Tony Baldry) said. I do not
blame the current Front Bench, but undoubtedly faith, and particularly
action in faith, and faith groups, have suffered during the past
century, because the state has become a kind of giant mustard
tree—if we are to use biblical references—and all other
activity has gradually been drained of irrigation. Faith groups, like
other voluntary groups, have suffered from the attitude of mind that it

wide-ranging debate about that, and we all know the arguments on both

there is something much more serious going on, and I want to amplify
the two points I made earlier. I made an intervention about the
Plymouth Brethren. I think that that is an interesting case, because it
is almost a throwback to the politics of the 16th and 17th centuries.
There is a religious group whose beliefs, frankly, the 
<?notus-xml column=216?>state thinks are weird. Most Members of Parliament either have no faith
at all or belong to well established faith groups with broad views. We
find it difficult to understand the viewpoint of a group such as the
Plymouth Brethren, who, frankly, treat life in literal accordance with
the
Bible.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070276000103" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/halltext/130702h0002.htm#13070276000103">As
a result<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:36:18"></hs_TimeCode>, they
want to have closed services to an extent, which is their right; they
also want to mix and work together and to educate their children in
their own schools. That sits oddly with the modern ethos of
audit—that everything has to subscribe to general notions of the
right way to do things—but we should consider the attack on the
Plymouth Brethren by the Charity Commission as an attack on freedom of
belief and association, and it is therefore very
important<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:30:23"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
important not only for that admittedly small group of people, but for
those of us who belong to Churches that are far more numerous, because
we are also under attack from the same
attitudes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:30:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070276000104" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/halltext/130702h0002.htm#13070276000104">I
mentioned the Catholic adoption agencies earlier, in an intervention on
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:30:51"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for East Ham (Stephen Timms). I noticed that he did not answer
my question—perhaps he did not want to, or the answer was too
difficult. The situation, however, is serious: a mainstream Church was
indulging in extraordinarily important work with by far the most
difficult families in the country, trying to place children from very
disturbed backgrounds with foster parents, but all those adoption
agencies have now closed. An important faith group was doing important
work that we all lauded and thought was marvellous, but the agencies
have closed because the state said that the adoption groups had an
ethos that did not fit with its equality ethos. That is extremely
worrying<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:31:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070276000105" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/halltext/130702h0002.htm#13070276000105">We
have heard a lot about covenants, and we will no doubt hear more.
Furthermore, in the wind-ups, we will hear a lot about the good work of
faith groups and about how we want to encourage local authorities to
work with faith groups. If we look at what is happening on the ground,
however, we see that serious things are occurring. We have had a big
debate about same-sex marriage, and I do not want to repeat all the
arguments, but the Government have been loud in their acclamation that
they want to protect the position of Churches. I believe that the
marriage services carried out by Churches in their own buildings will
be protected, for a time anyway, but will freedom of speech in Church
schools be protected? Will freedom of action in Church groups be
protected? Those are much more difficult questions to
answer<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:32:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070276000106" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/halltext/130702h0002.htm#13070276000106">Frankly,
I am not so interested in covenants and all the rest; I am interested
in the state leaving faith groups alone. Leave them alone! Let them run
their voluntary organisations, schools, Churches and adoption agencies
in the way that they want to run them. Often, the way that the faith
groups want to run such organisations will be counter to modern,
secular ideas of equality. The trouble with faith, however, is that it
is often demanding. The books of faith in any religion make difficult
demands of people. Sometimes, admittedly, they are exclusive in their
demands; they proclaim a particular truth, and it is difficult for all
people to subscribe to those truths. Some people may be excluded
because of their set of beliefs, but that is the nature of faith. We
have to recognise that they have those strong beliefs, whether on
same-sex marriage or anything else, and they are entitled 
<?notus-xml column=217?>to run their own groups how they want to. In spite of all the warm words
that we will shortly hear from the Minister and the shadow Minister,
that is not happening, and there is now a war of

people say that the faith groups are whinging and whining and that they
live in an entirely tolerant and free country—thank God that we

with many others in the world—but I do not believe that our
country is as free for and as tolerant of the faith groups’
views, which are often difficult, as it was 10, 20 or 30 years ago. No
one sitting in the Chamber now can gainsay that point of view. No one
can deny that the faith groups, although still largely free to carry on
their own services in their own churches, mosques, temples or whatever,
are not as free as they were, although they are much freer than in many
other parts of the

faith groups reach out to the community with their voluntary
organisations. The Charity Commission said to the Plymouth Brethren,
“The reason why we want to take your charity status away is that
you are not reaching out to the community.” The Brethren know,
however, that when they reach out to the community, their beliefs
immediately run counter to the demands made on their organisations by
the local authorities. Paradoxically, that is why the Plymouth Brethren
want to retreat into themselves: they feel under threat from the wider
world—their ethos is under threat. Therefore, they want to
protect their young people, but, having come to the conclusion that the
only way in which they can do so is to educate themselves, they find
that the Charity Commission says, “That is not good enough. You
are not reaching out to the wider world.” They are in an

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:36:55"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Congleton (Fiona Bruce) referred to the need to build the capacity
of faith groups. That is an important goal to enable faith groups in
the community to provide the support facilities that they might wish to
see and from which the community might benefit. She also cited a number
of good examples of the excellent work that faith groups are doing in
her constituency and in the wider area. We can probably all cite such
examples of faith groups doing excellent work. She also referred to the
partnership activities in her constituency, such as the work of the
fire and rescue service with a faith group. The fire and rescue service
is doing a wonderful job throughout the country, so it is good to see a
collaboration taking place as she
outlined<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:38:05"></hs_TimeCode>. The
hon. Lady mentioned a low level of engagement in 
<?notus-xml column=218?>some parts of the country, which we need to be mindful of and to tackle.
It is helpful to raise the issue in today’s debate as one
that needs to be looked

considerable experience in this area, and he does some excellent work.
I am sure hon. Members know of his contribution to the whole agenda. He
identified the fact that faith groups not only of Christian
denominations, but right across the piece—faith groups of all
persuasions—do some excellent work in the community. He also
highlighted some of the obstacles to collaboration, which we need to
tackle<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:39:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070276000114" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/halltext/130702h0002.htm#13070276000114">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:39:02"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Banbury (Sir Tony Baldry) said that the state cannot be
responsible for delivering everything. I agree, but the state has a
role, and the debate is all about how the state can work alongside
faith groups. Nevertheless, I take issue with him on his point that the
state cannot be responsible for compassion: the national health service
is the very embodiment of the state showing compassion to
its citizens. Similarly, the establishment of the welfare state is an
example of the state showing compassion to its citizens.</hs_Para>

true that the welfare budget has grown, and the hon. Gentleman made the
point that it cannot continue to grow exponentially, we should not
expect faith groups and the wider voluntary sector to pick up the
pieces, if the cap is set at such a level. In such circumstances, the
state should not put the onus on faith groups, but ensure that any cap
is imposed compassionately. That means ensuring that employers do not
exploit their work force but pay appropriate wages, so that people are
not reliant on the state. It also means ensuring that landlords do not
profiteer and charge excessive rents, leading to a ballooning housing
benefit bill, and that unemployed people are guaranteed employment. By
doing those things, we can ensure  that no unreasonable burden
is placed on voluntary organisations. I hope that the hon. Gentleman
was not suggesting that having a cap means that it would fall to faith
organisations to fulfil the role that the state, rightly, should

out, as the hon. Lady did, that the debate is about how we can
facilitate and enable faith groups to fulfil their full potential and
work in collaboration. However, such groups should not be a
substitution for the role of the state. I think the issue is about a

Edward Leigh:</Member></B> I may have expressed myself badly, and I
apologise. The hon. Gentleman has obviously misunderstood what I said.
I was trying to say that if faith groups are put in a position where
they feel that they must be supported by local authorities and conform
to the authorities’ ethos—he who pays the piper calls the
tune—there is a real danger that they gradually become
impoverished in their belief. It will be a kind of vicious circle: as
they can survive only because of the money that is provided, they will
have to subscribe to secular beliefs and culture. They will lose their
very vitality, which is formed by faith. That was the point I was

Williamson:</Member></B> I am grateful for that clarification. That is
a pessimistic view, to be honest. In my experience, local authorities
work well with faith groups and try to facilitate their activities. A
shared approach is a partnership approach, and sometimes there will be
tension. Part of the reason for having this debate is, I hope, to
discuss that and look at ways in which some of those obstacles may be
overcome.</hs_Para>

difficulties relate to a lack of understanding, and to expectations.
Indeed, sometimes there is a lack of awareness or understanding between
faith groups. It is important that local authorities try to come up
with ways of ensuring that such misunderstanding is overcome. There are
some good examples of that happening around the country. In my own
constituency, the forum of faith groups, which was established by the
local authority, works extremely well. It brings all the faith
organisations in the city together and facilitates working between
different faith groups and alongside the local authority and other
statutory agencies.</hs_Para>

than faith groups doing their own thing and public service agencies
doing theirs, much more can be achieved by working together. Where

groups should provide services that are already being provided; they
are just adding to them. The hospice movement, which the hon. Lady

provided.</hs_Para>

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:50:28"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for South Northamptonshire (Andrea Leadsom) on securing the

underlying my hon. Friend’s powerful argument was her question
of plurality, although I do not pretend to have an immediate answer to
that. I totally understand the point made by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:50:48"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Gainsborough (Sir Edward Leigh) about the danger of a
society and Government mindset 
<?notus-xml column=221?>that becomes ever narrower, perhaps for the best of intentions, but
nevertheless does not take account of the fact that there are different
perspectives that we need to respect in society as a whole.</hs_Para>

strongly feel that faith communities play a very important role at the
local and national level. It is about helping many people to strengthen
their moral outlook, and about the way in which such groups help people
and provide a service to others, by being good neighbours. It is also
about the way in which we help those in genuine need. As several people
have said, it is true that Governments of whatever political persuasion
have tended to ignore or misunderstand the role of our faith groups,
and today’s debate gives us an opportunity. I am a Minister in a
Department with a Secretary of State who takes this issue seriously, as
my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury (Sir Tony Baldry) mentioned, and
we not only welcome the report, but applaud its contents and the work
that it records. As we have heard, Governments have perhaps been
cautious in the past about engaging with such things. They have perhaps
been wary of being seen to take too strong a role in the direction of
certain faiths in a society in which, as has been rightly described,
aggressive secularism has a strong and powerful voice. As a Government,
we welcome the report and the work of faith groups.</hs_Para>

debate and the report have informed us of the huge range of activities
in which such groups are involved. Hon. Members have mentioned food
banks, fostering services, the work of CAP debt agencies and street
pastors. I have been out with the street pastor group in my
constituency. Among the flip-flops and the lollipops, they play an
important pastoral role. In my case, that was in Bishop’s
Stortford, but the project that my hon. Friend the Member for South
Northamptonshire visited sounds even more exciting. The fact that
senior police officers take it seriously and recognise the role of
people in the community who give their time to help others is an
interesting sign of what can be achieved.</hs_Para>

I come to the specific questions that have been asked, I will touch on
faith groups’ role in homes and homelessness. I have seen
marvellous work undertaken, whether that is through the Passage, the
Salvation Army, or St George’s Crypt in Leeds. People are making
a difference, not only by providing shelter to those who are homeless,
but by helping them to change their lives and get back to being able to
stand on their own two feet, and that is very much led by
faith.</hs_Para>

hon. Members mentioned the role of Churches Together, and churches and
faith groups around them can help new communities as well. In
Devon—in Cranbrook, near Exeter—alongside the work that
we are doing as a Government with bricks and mortar to establish a
lasting community, I was delighted to see the role of the Churches
Together, which has ensured that, from the start, there is a
minister—not a Government Minister—for Cranbrook, Mark
Gilborson, who is helping to bind the community together. Whatever I
may do as Minister for Housing, communities will not be defined by
bricks and mortar; they will be defined by people and how the community
binds together.</hs_Para>

to hon. Members’ specific points. It is right to say that there
has been a perception in national and local government—sometimes
falsely, on the basis of misconceptions or fear, but perhaps also due
to a lack of understanding—about what faith groups can 
<?notus-xml column=222?>be, and of what they do and add. To counter some of the more cautious
discussion in the debate, the survey by the Evangelical Alliance, which
underpins the report, suggests that things have moved on and that many
councils are now positively engaging.
There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:53:56"></hs_TimeCode> are
problems, however. We as a Department are actively involved in ensuring
that some problems relating to what is termed overstretch, and to the
bureaucracy that can often be overwhelming for small, faith-based
groups, can be overcome. It is also important to tackle the problem
that even if councils have recognised that faith-based groups are
strong, and they are willing to commission services from those groups,
we have seen a minority of cases in which they have made it clear to
such groups that they need to be quiet about their faith.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13070276000139" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/halltext/130702h0002.htm#13070276000139">The
Government do not regard it as reasonable for local authorities to
impose such conditions in contracts, even though they may legally be at
liberty to do so. We are, of course, not talking about public money
paying for specific religious worship—indeed, we all want to
ensure that services are open and for a common cause when public money
is involved. However, let us face it: the vast majority of church and
faith groups are perfectly capable of sticking to those rules. The key
point is that people need to be able to be honest about their faith,
without necessarily needing to impose it on somebody else. That is the
balance that I would encourage councils to consider.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13070276000140" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/halltext/130702h0002.htm#13070276000140"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:56:28"></hs_TimeCode>I
am not complacent about the challenge, but more can be done to
establish a more productive working relationship with some councils, so
I want to offer two or three practical points in response to what hon.
Members raised. The Evangelical Alliance is planning a series of road
shows to bring together church leaders and senior local government
officials to work through the report’s findings jointly.
Th<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:57:00"></hs_TimeCode>e point made
by the right hon. Member for East Ham (Stephen Timms) about a covenant
might well fit into that dialogue. I am pleased to say that my
departmental officials are actively involved in that process, and I
strongly encourage councils to take part. In fact, I go further and
encourage hon. Members in the Chamber to encourage their councils to
ensure that they
participate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:57:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070276000141" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/halltext/130702h0002.htm#13070276000141">There
is an issue about the term “religious literacy”. There
are ways to improve things, whether that is by starting with those
groups who are more actively engaged in the community, or by having, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:57:34"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Congleton (Fiona Bruce) suggested, a dedicated officer
or councillor who can take the lead, change the culture, open minds,
and understand that there is a different perspective, because such a
process can start to break down some of the misunderstanding.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:57:48"></hs_TimeCode>It is also

me turn briefly to the question of the Plymouth Brethren. As hon.
Members will know, I need to be cautious, in that the Charity
Commission is independent of Ministers and it is not for me to
interfere in any individual decision. We should not rush to any
judgment about changing the definition of charity. An appeal has been
lodged, and I think it will be held in September. As
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:58:28"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for South Northamptonshire and others pointed out, the
Brethren do good work, as do so many other faith groups. I want the
case to reach 
<?notus-xml column=223?>a speedy resolution and for both sides to resolve the matter. This needs
to be done with open minds, not closed
minds.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:58:50"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

excellent points have been raised. Inter-faith is an absolutely crucial
issue, and the Near Neighbours programme and the £5 million we
are investing is important. However, let me conclude by saying that
this has been a timely debate. It is right to say that, in the past,
some of our faith groups have felt either ignored or misunderstood by
both central and local government, and that is why I welcome the
report. I know that my noble Friend Baroness Warsi, who leads on the
issue in the Department, will want to take matters further,
particularly with regard to how we increase co-operation between
councils. Perhaps rather than using my words, however, I may conclude
with those of Dr Sentamu, the Archbishop of York:</hs_Para>

Secretary to the Treasury announced further plans to roll out superfast
broadband across the UK, so that it will reach 95% of the population by
2017. No one doubts that Government investment in that type of

with other parts of Scotland, Glasgow ranks as one of the best for
superfast broadband availability and is also benefiting from the Future
Cities spending. However, one reason why I have requested this debate
is to caution that collectively we may have become too fixated on the
rate of installing hardware, compared with the level and depth of usage
by our citizens. The two are interconnected, but very often our
strategic priorities and procurement policies do not match those needs
together. I believe that the Government should do more to link their
substantial investment in broadband with investment in citizens’
participation. I hope today, as well as setting out the scale of the
challenge, to suggest some practical ways in which the Government could
better adapt their policies to provide a more comprehensive
strategy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:01:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070276000146" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/halltext/130702h0002.htm#13070276000146">I

fails to understand how, and to what extent, the general public absorb

2012 consumer market report showed, as my hon. Friend mentioned, that
only 60% of Glasgow’s households had access to fixed broadband,
compared with a UK average of 76%. We know that at-home access is vital
to allow our citizens to gain the most value from use of the internet.
Against that UK average of 76%, it is perhaps not surprising that the
Government, in moving to digital by default from this autumn, are
working on the assumption of moving 80% of benefit applications online,

Glasgow.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070276000151" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/halltext/130702h0002.htm#13070276000151">Last<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:04:06"></hs_TimeCode>
month, I was pleased to host a seminar at Westminster with the Carnegie
UK Trust, which has recently published a report called “Across
the Divide” by Douglas White that is an in-depth review of
200 families in the city and how they are affected by the
digital divide. There is much to commend in that excellent report,
which is instructive not only for Glasgow but for other areas of the
country that suffer from high levels of socio-economic deprivation. It
should not surprise the Minister that the author pointed to very
similar figures in parts of North Ayrshire, West Dunbartonshire and
North Lanarkshire, which surround the city area, but I particularly
draw the Minister’s attention to the charts at the start of
chapter 3, which show the gap, in terms of both age and socio-economic
groups, between Glasgow and the UK average. For the social group
C2—a group that is often affected by our social security
systems—the divide is an astonishing 25%. Against a UK average
take-up of 72% for that social group, the Glasgow figure is only 47%.
What happens when age is added to the equation? In the city’s
entire 35-to-64 age group, only 35% have access to broadband in their
house<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:05:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070276000152" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/halltext/130702h0002.htm#13070276000152">In
some of the most deprived areas of the city, housing associations and
other community groups estimate that only 20% of their tenants at most
have direct broadband access. However, as the figures reveal, this
issue affects all sections of the community and all demographics. There
are a multitude of reasons for the gap, and the report goes into them
in some depth, but cost is the primary one. For people on a low income,
a fixed phone line is now a luxury that many drop in favour of
pay-as-you-go mobile phones. As the Carnegie report showed, the monthly
communications budget for the city’s lowest socio-economic
groups is about £30, compared with a UK average spend of about
£100<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:06:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070276000153" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/halltext/130702h0002.htm#13070276000153">The
Government’s aim to move to digital by default is certainly
doing more to raise the importance of the issue, but there is a real
fear that we simply do not have the scale of resources required, not
only for hardware access but for appropriate software and access to
training and support. This is not a problem for which a

Advice Scotland, in a report issued in May called “Offline and

complete a benefits application online said that the main barrier was
that they had never used a computer. Research conducted this year by

pause it, go away and look for some other bit of information and come
back to it, but this is the classic “The machine won’t

Last year, I started to carry out a survey in my own constituency of
where free-to-use computers were available and what training or lessons
might be appropriate and accessible if people wanted to go online and
complete CVs. I then began to realise that I was the only person trying
to collate that information and I was eventually contacted by a
Scottish Government agency, which agreed to fund the publication of the

no mapping has been done of where computer access is available. I know
that the DWP is now trying to establish local job clubs in my

an informal basis. That is all well and good, but it has only just
begun that process and it takes time for community groups to find the
finance, to get organised and to get the equipment—yet we are
facing that radical change in a few months’ time. That is why I
urge the Minister to scrap the Government’s aim of starting with
a target of 80% of benefit applications being made online. It is
unrealistic, grossly unfair and runs the risk of vulnerable people
losing essential financial support.</hs_ParaIndent>

Minister will respond by saying that there has to be a target. We
should all want greater online access for our constituents, because it
means not only the ability to apply for benefits and search for jobs,
but the opportunity to benefit from cheaper utility costs, new sources
of information and knowledge and greater connectivity with the wider
community. Such targets are useful to measure and drive success, but
they need to be based on evidence, with a clear strategy to improve
take-up. There are good examples to follow, and I point to the
programme that introduced digital TV switchover as an excellent
example: it adapted messages for different segments of the public; it
worked with all tiers of government and local community organisations
to ensure efficient delivery; and it constantly analysed evidence
throughout the 
<?notus-xml column=227?>project and adjusted its work to suit, to ensure that  it became
one of the most successful Government programmes of recent years

that is always asked in these difficult economic times is,
can<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:11:04"></hs_TimeCode> we find the
finance for such work? The answer is yes: to return to the point I made
at the beginning of my speech, we need to integrate funding solutions
with the provision of the hardware that delivers the service. I suggest
that we take a small slice of the funds that we set aside for mass
broadband coverage and use it to finance a public community access

that we in Glasgow need to learn.

part of its new digital strategy, which is good, but we need the UK and
Scottish Governments to respond positively to that initiative. Both
Governments should look at using Glasgow as a pilot for the wider task
of tackling digital exclusion wherever it occurs in the country. We
need a comprehensive and segmented approach based on good-quality
evidence and clear messaging. We need clear branding, which everyone in
the community understands at all levels. The Carnegie UK Trust
recommended creating local role models or digital

Glasgow Housing Association, are piloting special deals for their
tenants that directly address the issue of cost, which is good, but
given that more and more people are finding themselves in private
residential properties or renting from much smaller landlords, we need
to extend such schemes to everyone on low incomes. The Government can
disseminate best practice, co-ordinate action and ensure that services
are delivered to the public we serve. I hope that both Governments and

Carnegie UK Trust report says that Glasgow has one of the lowest
broadband take-up rates in the UK, which is true, but we should not
allow that to overshadow the progress that has been made in the city.
Take-up in the greater Glasgow area increased by 20% between the start
of 2011 and 2012, exceeding the Scotland-wide rate of increase, which
is closing the historic gap between Scotland’s broadband take-up
and the UK average. Catch-up is taking place in Scotland and in Glasgow
itself, so we can point to a relatively positive picture, but that does

all hon. and right hon. Members that we all need to do our bit to
dispel any scare stories or myths that suggest that people will not be

Jim Cunningham</B> (Coventry South) (Lab):</Member> I think this is the
first time you have chaired an Adjournment debate that I have secured,
Mr Walker. I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:27:59"></hs_TimeCode> am
pleased to have been able to do so. As politicians,
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:27:56"></hs_TimeCode> is easy to
find ourselves speaking about statistics and general trends, but it is
important that we take stock and reflect on what it is like to live in
our country. What sort of lives are people living? What sort of
hardships are they suffering? We have to put ourselves in the position
of the poorest and most vulnerable in our society to remind ourselves
how much more work needs to be done. We should judge our society on how
we treat the worst-off, not on how we treat our millionaires, and we
are failing that
test.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070276000180" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/halltext/130702h0002.htm#13070276000180">A<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:29:18"></hs_TimeCode>
key issue that I am keen to stress is that monthly expenses have been
bloated by debt repayments and rising transport and fuel costs, leaving
families with less spending power. For the fourth consecutive quarter,
monthly expenditure by UK families has grown, with current typical
outgoings up by 3% since August 2012 and by 22% since November 2011.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:30:26"></hs_TimeCode> rise in
living costs has been clearly visible over the past 12 months. Since
2008, the consumer prices index has risen by 17%, but other measures
suggest that inflation over that period has been much greater. The
minimum income standard used by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation
indicates that the cost of a standard basket of goods and services has
increased by
25%.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070276000181" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/halltext/130702h0002.htm#13070276000181">Based<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:30:25"></hs_TimeCode>
on those figures, the minimum earnings required to secure an adequate
standard of living would be £16,850 for a single person,
£19,400 for a working couple and £25,600 for a lone
parent. All those are well above the salary of a job that pays the
national minimum wage, and they are dangerously close to the average
income level in the UK.
Although<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:31:09"></hs_TimeCode> it is
true that the average income in the UK has increased in recent years,
those figures show that the increase has been accompanied by a
disproportionate rise in the cost of crucial commodities. The obvious
effect is that standards of living are falling, as people cannot
purchase as much of a commodity as previously, meaning that less is
spent on luxury items, personal items and leisure goods.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:31:25"></hs_TimeCode> biggest
declines in the percentage of people spending on a certain items
between November 2011 and January 2013 involve furniture, appliances,
clothing, sports equipment, make-up and the motor industry. I am
concerned about the broader impact on the economy, as British industry
finds that demand in the consumer base is
low.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070276000182" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/halltext/130702h0002.htm#13070276000182"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:29:21"></hs_TimeCode><Member ContinuationText="Mr Iain McKenzie" PimsId="5988" UID="13070276000312" xid="1236" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/halltext/130702h0002.htm#13070276000312"><B>Mr

most basic expenditure to affect living standards is surely food.
Despite the growth in the popularity of own-brand food labels and
budget supermarkets  
<?notus-xml column=232?>during the recession, outgoings on food shopping are
still rising. Inflation of 3.13% means that a typical family now spends
£234 more on annual food bills than they did in November 2011,
which puts significantly more pressure on the earnings required to
secure an adequate standard of living for the whole
family.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070276000185" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/halltext/130702h0002.htm#13070276000185">An<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:32:44"></hs_TimeCode>
inability to respond to that pressure has left families with an
unacceptable standard of living. There is evidence of that across the
country, including in my constituency and surrounding areas. Research
has shown that about one in five people in the west midlands have to
skip meals and go without food to feed their family.
Some<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:33:10"></hs_TimeCode> 70% of
families who are suffering from food poverty have to rely on food
supplied by schools in the form of free school meals, breakfast clubs
and other school clubs. As a result, more than a quarter of families
suffering from food poverty are unable to provide all the meals for
their children during school holidays.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:33:31"></hs_TimeCode> am sure that
we all agree that that situation is
unacceptable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:33:16"></hs_TimeCode>. If
we judge our society on the basis of the situation faced by the
worst-off, it is clear that something needs to be done to improve the
ability of families to provide meals for their children without having
to go without food
themselves<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:33:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070276000186" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/halltext/130702h0002.htm#13070276000186">Another
significant section of expenditure is on travel. Average rail fares
increased by 5.9% in January 2013, combined with inflation of 4.96%.
Expenditure on everyday travel has grown more than any other costs
since November 2011. The typical UK traveller spends £341 more
every year, and the fact that there was a further average price rise in
January 2013 means that such rises are likely to
continue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:34:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070276000187" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/halltext/130702h0002.htm#13070276000187">I

right hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr Hammond), described
high-speed rail as “a rich man’s toy”, I have not

increasing prices applied by utility providers are putting significant
pressure on households. The resulting energy bills have drained an
extra £221 from their budgets every year since this Government
came to power. Such increases have caused the cost of living crisis
that afflicts millions of families across this country, reducing their
ability to secure an adequate standard of living.
Those<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:34:49"></hs_TimeCode> issues are
compounded by the fact that, according to a study by the Institute for
Public Policy Research, 5 million homes are overcharged by energy
suppliers. Yet the Government have backed “business as
usual” in the energy market, with energy companies having paid
out £7 billion to shareholders, which is a clear refusal to
challenge the practices, pricing and structures in the energy market
that are causing such difficulties for families and individuals
alike.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070276000189" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/halltext/130702h0002.htm#13070276000189">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:35:19"></hs_TimeCode>

kept at a manageable level for families. When Labour left office, there
were 1.75 million fewer households living in fuel poverty, including
500,000 fewer vulnerable households, because our
policies—such as winter fuel allowances, cold weather payments
and improvements in energy efficiency through the Warm Front
scheme and tough requirements on energy
companies —ensured that they could spend the amounts of
money required to secure an adequate standard of living, rather than
having to overspend on energy

from 64% in November 2011 to 59% in January 2013, which is the result
of families increasingly shifting to rented properties. The increasing
trend towards renting means that 25% of UK families are now in rented
accommodation, which is a significant rise from 19% in November 2011.
Meanwhile<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:37:57"></hs_TimeCode>, rent

one household bill. I find it particularly striking that clients over
60 have the highest overall levels of arrears and single parents have
the highest levels of rent, council tax and water arrears. The sad

people—360,413—contacted StepChange for help with payday
loan problems in 2012 than during the previous year. The data show

that we are seeing more and more of those shops opening up on our high
streets but, more importantly, nothing is being done about the
television advertising that is leading people up the garden path.
Payday loans can have a profoundly negative impact on people’s
finances, but the problem is wide as well as deep. In March 2013, a
compliance review by the Office of Fair Trading estimated that up to
8.2 million payday loans were made in 2011-12, and that a third either
could not be paid back on time or could not be paid back at all. We are
talking about some 2.7 million loans that could not be paid back on
time, which demonstrates the difficulty and the strain felt by the
public with regard to payday loans, and that pressure affects
people’s standard of living. I fully support any action the

me comment now on the backdrop of public sector pay freezes. In the
spending review last week, the Chancellor announced yet another cap on
public sector pay. He said wage rises would be limited to an average of
up to 1% in 2015-16, thereby extending the clampdown by a further year.
He also announced plans to seek savings by reforming the system of pay
progression in the public sector. The incomes of millions of teachers,
nurses, firefighters, council workers and civil servants will be
squeezed even further in future.</hs_Para>

the long-established and simple principle of pay progression based on
experience looks to be the next target. That will be far more complex
and potentially damaging to services. I am particularly concerned about
the disproportionate impact that the measure will have on equality.
Those who will suffer the most from such a freeze in increments will be
low-paid women, who tend to have shorter service and not to have
reached the full rate for the job. Given the sheer numbers of public
sector workers affected by the pay squeeze, the effect on the economy
cannot be ignored. Each public sector worker who suffers a continued
pay freeze, combined with the rising cost of living, will have a much
squeezed budget indeed. If we limit the spending power of such a large
sector of the country’s work force that will be sorely felt in
other
industries<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:43:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Government’s cuts are being felt in many other areas. However,
they are perhaps most keenly felt in local government. Local authority
services can have a significant impact on people’s lives, and
they are being hit very hard by the cuts. In the spending review last
week, the Chancellor confirmed that a further 10% in local government
funding will be cut. Coventry city council has already lost £24
million of Government grant funding in the last three years and will
lose a further £19 million next year. Last week’s
announcement made it clear that councils will lose a further £18
million in resources. This year’s budget means that the council

discussion of current living standards would be complete without
reference to the bedroom tax. It has been discussed at length in the
House, so I do not wish to dwell on the matter now. The Government
estimated that 660,000 claimants will be affected by the removal of the
spare room subsidy in the social rented sector, and the average loss in
benefit is £14 per week. Those affected include 60,000

being forced to suffer a cut in housing benefit because they are unable
to downsize. Like many other MPs, I have heard greatly distressing
stories from constituents about how they are being hurt by the bedroom
tax. I want to make it clear that I am extremely saddened by the tax

would begin immediately on the priority school building programme,

only one has been started. Although the completion of that programme

let us consider for a moment what should happen to people who come into
contact with the law. Unfortunately, that is something that happens to
many people during the course of their life and, often they are totally
unprepared. Equality before the law is fundamental to our society.
Quite simply, we do not want to live  in a society in which the
rich can win legal disputes by 
<?notus-xml column=236?>hiring lawyers, and poor people lose because they have to represent
themselves. The Government’s cuts to legal aid threaten that
basic equality. Funding has been removed for private family law such as
divorce and custody battles; personal injury and some clinical
negligence cases; some employment and education law; immigration where
the person is not detained; and some debt, housing and benefit
issues<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:47:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070276000210" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/halltext/130702h0002.htm#13070276000210">Access
to justice through judicial review will be restricted, as lawyers will
be more reluctant to take on such cases due to the threat of not
receiving payment should the case not get past the permission stage.
That also restricts consumer choice for the public. The focus on the
quantity of cases, rather than the quality, will lead to more
miscarriages of justice, as providers will become motivated by case
volume and efficiency, rather than the right to see justice served
correctly. There is a good chance that the quality of legal service
provided will deteriorate, as the lower fixed fees paid to lawyers
under the new proposals cause them to focus on the quantity of cases
that they take on, rather than the quality of each case. I am raising
the issue of legal aid in the context of living standards because I see
treatment before the law and access to justice as an integral part of
our quality of life.</hs_Para>

we saw last week, the latest figures from the Office for National
Statistics show that not only was that the most recent recession, but
it was far deeper than originally thought. Originally, it was thought
to be a 6.3% contraction in GDP, which would in itself have been the
deepest peacetime contraction in GDP in this country, but it turns out
to be even deeper, at 7.2%. No doubt it would have hurt many families
throughout the country. This Government are trying to help those
families with the cost of living and other issues, and trying to repair
the damage done by the previous

hon. Member for Coventry North West mentioned it—which is down
by a third. We still have a long way to go, but our policies on the
deficit have brought economic credibility, which has lowered interest
rates to a near record level. In fact, interest rates on Government
debt are almost half what they were when this Government first came to
office. That has a direct impact on the cost of living for families,
most notably through their mortgage bills. If interest rates rose by
just 1%, the average mortgage bill for a family would rise by almost

is right to mention the impact on employment of our economic policies.
As we heard in a statement from the Chancellor last week, we were told
by the shadow

of unemployment. Some left-wing economists were even predicting that
unemployment could reach the record level of 5 million. In fact, the
opposite has happened. The private sector has created more than 1.3
million net new jobs in the last three years and employment

one of the best ways to deal with cost-of-living challenges. Of course,
we have to do more.

evidence that 
<?notus-xml column=239?>some families, despite the action we have taken, are turning to payday
lenders to meet their monthly bills, but he also rightly recognises
that the Government are taking a lot of action, both on their own and
with the regulators. As he knows, the Office of Fair Trading has been
responsible for regulation in the sector until now. We have introduced
a step change to that regulation, which will now be under the Financial
Conduct Authority. The FCA will be a lot more pervasive, and it is a
regulator with teeth. Payday lenders will feel the hand of the
regulator on their shoulder. Yesterday, I attended a summit set up by
the Government with lenders, charities and other interested groups, and
the head of the FCA made it clear that he will not hesitate to take
action. He has broad powers if he sees further evidence of consumer
detriment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T17:13:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070276000229" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/halltext/130702h0002.htm#13070276000229">Finally,
distribution and fairness have also been mentioned. Before 2010, the
richest 20% of society contributed about three and a half times as much
in tax as they received in public spending; that has now increased to
about four times as much. In fact, in every year of 
<?notus-xml column=240?>this Parliament, the rich will pay a greater proportion  of
income tax revenues than they did in any one of the 13 years under the
last Labour Government. We have taken steps to ensure that the most
vulnerable groups on low incomes are protected against the effects of
the economic circumstances. For example, pensioners have seen
above-inflation increases to their state pension, and the introduction
of universal credit will make 3 million households better
off, the majority of which will come from the bottom two fifths of the

the event of a vote for independence, introducing an international
border of whatever form will create a barrier to the free flow of
goods, capital and labour. This will be to the detriment of firms,
workers and consumers in both states and risks making it more
challenging to attract overseas investors. Creating new rules,
regulatory systems and institutions–for example to replace key
UK regulatory institutions such as HMRC, Companies House and the
Intellectual Property Office, which would operate on behalf of the
continuing UK as before–would create uncertainty, additional
costs and confusion for businesses and investors operating in Scotland.

of that market brings opportunities to trade, move jobs, collaborate to
develop new and future technologies, travel and communicate with each
other efficiently and benefit from economies of scale. In 
<?notus-xml column=41?>the event of a vote for independence, the bodies that support the UK in

Prisk:</Member></B> Electronic commerce and mobile commerce are
changing consumer preferences on how and where they shop. This is
changing the nature of retail, and thereby the nature of the high
street. But it is not a matter of internet versus high street, it is
both a challenge, and an opportunity. The high street can offer so much
more: a bustling centre to a community, where people can gather for
cultural, entertainment and social activities as well as shopping,
eating, and evening activities.</hs_Para>

that high streets and the retailers who trade there develop their own
strategies to adapt to these massive structural changes that they face.
Many small businesses and independent retailers are trading very
successfully online and many have grown as a result of trading this
way. We should recognise that changing technologies have benefited
consumers, in the form of greater choice, more convenience and
competitive prices. This should be welcomed rather than something to be

been made. Local authorities have extensive powers to tackle poor
property conditions in their area, including being able to prosecute
landlords who fail to repair properties that are in a hazardous
condition. We encourage local authorities to use those powers where
appropriate. Prosecution is generally a last resort undertaken where
the landlord has failed to comply with an improvement notice or
prohibition order and is not necessarily a good indication of the scale
or effectiveness of enforcement
action.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13070280000013" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/text/130702w0001.htm#13070280000013">Out

By 2060 we expect sea levels to be at least 200 mm higher and probably

the National Crime Agency (NCA) by the end of 2013 and is well on track
to do so—the NCA will be delivered in October this year.
Following Royal Assent of the Crime and Courts Bill on 25 April 2013,
the NCA became a legal entity on 27 May 2013. The NCA top team is
almost complete and the four new Commands have all been established and
are leading shadow operations. Staff and property transfer schemes
which will enable (SOCA) staff and assets to be transferred to the NCA

those with expertise in all areas of science. Three of the current CSAs
are engineers, including the CSA in BIS. They, like all CSAs,
contribute their expertise across Government. The Government therefore
does not consider it necessary to create a specific post of Government

or number of commitments the Green Investment Bank should make in any
given year. To date the Bank has committed £635 million and its
senior management is confident of committing the full £3.8
billion that has now been allocated to the Bank for the period to April
2016. The Bank has full flexibility to carry over funds between years
within the current spending review period to April 2015. It also has
scope to make commitments during this spending review period which only
crystallise as spending after April 2015. This flexibility is limited
to a maximum of £500 million per

The Government has also previously announced its intention
to devolve around half of the existing Bus Service Operators Grant
budget to local authorities to give them greater say over how that
money should be spent. An announcement will be made very shortly on the

Government’s First World War Commemorations Advisory Group by
the Dean of Salisbury. The Dean and the Church of England have been in
contact with the Assistant Chaplain-General and Archdeacon for the army
to discuss commemorations. It is our understanding that specific
commemorations relating to the role of military chaplains will be
managed by regiments and corps rather than centrally by the Church of
England. Military Chaplains will of course be remembered and
commemorated alongside all those who gave their lives and service
during the great
war.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070294001405" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130702/text/130702w0004.htm#13070294001405">The
Church of England and Westminster Abbey are planning alongside the
Government and other partners a number of commemorations the first of
which will be a number of candlelit vigils across the country with the
participation of the other faith communities, ending at 11.00 pm on 4
August 2014–100 years after war was declared and reflecting Sir
Edward Grey’s famous remark that “the lamps are going out

Liturgical Commission of the Church of England has assembled resources
to assist parish churches both in sharing in the planned vigil and also
for use throughout the several years of commemoration. The Church
Buildings Council of the Church of England is working with the Imperial
