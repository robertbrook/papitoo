proposals and the extensions to them that she has just announced are
enormously welcome to everybody in the retail trade? Nevertheless, two
dimensions are hitting Britain’s high streets today. The first
is low demand for the past two and a half years, which we all 
<?notus-xml column=522?>understand, because of the state of the economy and what we inherited in
that dimension. The second, however, is business rates. Business rates
have now reached the extent that they are the largest single overhead
of any retailer, particularly the independent retailers. Against that
background, can my noble friend confirm that there will be a commitment
from the coalition Government to find a fairer way to tax both the high
street and the online
traders?</hs_para>

Hanham:</Member></B> My Lords, as the noble Lord will know, the
Government have doubled the level of small business rate relief for the
past three and a half years, and the higher level of relief will be
available throughout the next year. Approximately half a million small
businesses in England are estimated to benefit from that. We have also
given authorities powers to grant their own business rate discounts,
and central government is funding 50% of that. We have also reduced,
and are reducing, corporation tax for larger businesses and corporate
structures. Although I understand that concern is expressed by some
about their business rates, I am not aware of any plans to change the

seeing a great increase through mini-expresses and other means employed

forward with schemes for business rates but those schemes lack a
certain breadth and viability for many people. Will my noble friend

Business rates, as the noble Lord knows, are levied on the rate of rent
paid so that, whatever happens, payments will be consistent. I am aware
that there is concern about this, as I have acknowledged. However, I
think that the Government feel at the moment that there is nothing to
do to change that except to give small businesses the relief that I

interpretation. Independents, of course, are small retailers which, as
the term suggests, are not part of a chain. On the other hand, small
retailers may be part of a chain. It depends on the size of the
business. To be clear, we are looking to ensure that small businesses
can thrive in high streets. I have outlined the measures that we have
taken to try to ensure that and to support them over the coming

the fact that we are, in our times, seeing a decrease in the cohesion

also, more importantly, very often support local community activities
in a way that the supermarkets totally fail to do. Will the Government

that local, small and independent shops help provide community
cohesion. There are many in my area which I know are very valued for
the work that they do. One of the reasons why we are very anxious to
see the high street flourish is that these independent traders are
there, as well as others. After all, they are the centre of local
communities, and they should be the generator. You meet people in the
local butcher’s, and you meet people on the high street. They
are also keen to take part. I fully accept that from my noble

the Government have made changes to the planning regime which will
enable local shops to become residences if that is a suitable change. I
totally agree with the noble Baroness about the empty space above so
many shops. Yes, we are very anxious to see those brought into use, and
under permissive development they could be, but there are often
structural reasons why they cannot, for example because they have no
separate entrance. However, I take the noble Baroness’s point,

to initiate novel treatments provided that they are evidence-based, in
the best interests of the patient, and with patient consent. While the
law does not seek to block innovation, it does require new forms of
treatment to be rigorously tested before being

Saatchi:</Member></B> My Lords, would my noble friend allow me to share
the latest figures with your Lordships’ House? The number of
lawsuits filed against the NHS last year was double the level of four
years ago. Last year the payout of claims against the NHS was
£1.2 billion. The current Treasury provision for
likely payouts in the future for litigation against the NHS is now over
£19 billion. Against that backdrop, is there not a danger that
the growing fear of medical litigation leads to a growing bias against
medical innovation? Will my noble friend consider the warnings of
judges about the tendency of current law to inhibit medical progress?

element of that bill relates to medical innovation. We need to reflect
that all treatments in routine use in the NHS today began as innovative
treatments. We continue to support the introduction of new and
innovative treatments in the NHS. I think that, if anything, doctors

expanded is very rapid. This is not a matter simply for the Government.

Government have listened carefully and understand the concern that has
been expressed that same-sex married couples will be in a different
position from opposite-sex married couples as regards occupational
pension benefits. The effect of the difference in treatment, which is
permitted under the exception in Schedule 9 to the Equality Act 2010,
is that currently civil partners and, by virtue of the provision made
in Schedule 4 to this Bill, people married to someone of the same sex
may not benefit from their civil partner or spouse’s pensionable
service prior to 2005 in respect of any survivor benefit payable on the

at some length in Committee and on Report, when we had a full debate on
Amendments 84 and 84A, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Alli. I am

will begin by making clear that we are talking here about which period
during which contributions were actually made to a pension scheme will
be taken into account when calculating survivor benefits on the death
of the pension scheme member. Therefore, this issue does not affect
people whose pensionable service began in 2005 or later. For those
whose pensionable service began prior to 2005, the concern is that
contributions that they have made will not benefit their partner on
their death. I should also make clear that if the Government were
confident that equalising these benefits was straightforward and
sustainable, we would be happy to support a move towards equalisation.
But as a matter of principle, and as I have explained previously,
successive Governments have avoided imposing retrospective costs on
pension schemes, particularly private sector pension schemes, which
have not been taken into consideration in their funding
assumptions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071513000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0001.htm#13071513000078">It
would be irresponsible of any Government to commit themselves to
imposing potentially significant costs on businesses and the taxpayer
without first undertaking an assessment of all the implications and
knock-on effects, and assessing the scale of the costs involved. This
group of amendments therefore requires the Government to arrange a
review of the differences in survivor benefits in occupational pension
schemes between opposite-sex couples and same-sex couples in legal
relationships, both marriage and civil partnership. It will look at the
issue in the round and will include looking specifically at the effect
of eliminating differences in treatment because of sexual orientation
in terms of survivor benefits between people married to someone of the
opposite sex and people married to someone of the same sex. I can
therefore assure the House that the review will include an exploration
of the issue which is the focus of the concern of the noble Lord, Lord
Alli.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071513000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0001.htm#13071513000079">As I
have said, we must also look at the full costs and implications of any
change. This means looking at the effect of equalisation across the
board, because any changes made for one group could have significant
wider implications. The review will therefore also consider the
differences in treatment between widows and widowers of marriages of
opposite-sex couples and the impact of removing the current exception
permitting these gender-based differences of treatment provided by
Section 67 of the Equality Act. It is important to emphasise, however,
that these existing gender-based differences in treatment for widows
and widowers in relation to survivor benefits arise from changes that
have been made over time as a result of societal change. These
longstanding differences reflect the historical fact that in the past
many women were not economically active and relied on their husbands
for their pension. These differences are therefore not consequences of
the measures in the Bill, but it is important that the review considers
all the interdependencies between the arrangements for different groups
in occupational pension schemes in the round.</hs_para>

that interested parties are consulted and that all relevant
voices are heard. The review will also therefore include consultation
with those interested parties that the Secretary of State considers
appropriate. This point was raised by my noble friend Lord Higgins. I
can assure him and the House that consultation will include, for
example, pension scheme trustees and industry bodies, as well as
organisations representing the interests of lesbian and gay
employees.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071513000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0001.htm#13071513000081">Following
this comprehensive review, the amendments require the Secretary of
State to publish a report of the outcome before 1 July 2014. The
amendment also includes an order-making power. This ensures that if on
consideration of the outcome of the review the Secretary of State
thinks that the law needs to be changed in order to reduce or eliminate
differences between survivor benefits, this can be achieved through
secondary legislation, subject to the affirmative

benefits we would do so with an understanding of the full implications

Lester of Herne Hill:</Member></B> My Lords, I am glad that I put my
name to these amendments. I add my support to the Minister
for the wisdom of the amendments. It is an open-ended consultation that
is not prejudged, it is time-limited so there will not be undue delay,
and if there are changes it will be subject to affirmative procedure,
which means that Parliament will be able to be properly consulted, as
the public and all the interested groups will have been.</hs_para>

if change is brought about it will avoid the need for further
litigation that could finish up in the European Court of Human Rights,
as I read its case law, because if there is to be change it will remove
a source of discrimination that, it could be strongly argued, is not
compatible with convention rights. For all those reasons, I am very
glad to support

Alli, has described me in the past as a lone ranger, but I was not sure
that that was a compliment. I sit among my Liberal Democrat tribe not
as a lone ranger; we are full of support for that team. I should say,
though others will also say it from these Benches, that we are very
proud of the fact that we were the first to think of civil partnership,
to do civil partnership in a Private Member’s Bill and then to
support the admirable Equality Act, so I do not think that I am a lone
ranger. Anyhow, I do not watch cowboy films because I am too frightened

to the Minister and her extremely skilled team. Part of that team was
responsible for the Equality Act 2010, which I have described as the
best civil rights legislation in the world, and that I believe to be
the case. The Minister has had to deal with the Bill in difficult
circumstances; there are some in the House who are strongly
opposed to it. However, the way in which amendments have been
considered and debated across the House honestly and transparently has
been extremely important, and I have learnt a great deal from listening
to those debates.</hs_para>

been quite inconceivable for the House to have been able to

of this House through appointments, and I pay tribute to the previous

have secured a House that is truly countermajoritarian and truly
concerned with individual rights and with protecting minorities against
the abuse of powers by the tyranny of the

Rowlands:</Member></B> My Lords, I rise to make a brief
contribution—my one and only contribution to the
Bill—because listening to the debates and reading the
correspondence has brought vivid memories back to me of voting at 4.27
am, 46 years ago this month, by 99 votes to 14 for Mr Leo Abse’s
Sexual Offences Act decriminalising homosexuality. I was a
27 year-old Member of Parliament who had only been elected the year
before, totally unexpectedly so because I was not expected to win a
Conservative stronghold. That brief political experience did not
prepare me for the vehemence of the reaction to my stance in that year.
I have never since come across anything quite like the level of abuse
and vehemence that I received in certain quarters of the constituency
because of my support for that Bill. How could I possibly legitimise
such horrid, heinous and sinful practices? The church, at that time,
took rather a curious position on the Bill. It kind of supported it
because it could help in the mission to save the sinful souls of
homosexuals. The Bishop of London of the time said that it would
allow,</hs_para>

alluded to this past experience for two reasons. First, I have been
impressed and pleased by how much more measured, more sensible and more
mature a debate we have had this time on such sensitive issues
as opposed to way back in 1967. It shows that society itself
has matured and, I believe, become more capable of handling such issues
in a sensitive and helpful manner. Nevertheless, passions and fears
have been aroused by the Bill. Therefore, the second reason why
I have referred to this past experience is that, in
such situations, I have always found that a bit of
historical perspective is helpful. Has anyone ever tried to repeal that
heinous, horrible Bill of 1967? No. Did all the dire consequences,
which my constituents at that time said would
happen to society if we supported the Bill, come to pass? I
do not think so. Therefore, I believe that, with the passage of time,
we will also find with this Bill that some of the fears that have been
expressed will prove unfounded, as they were after
1967<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T15:31:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071513000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0001.htm#13071513000093">In
my personal relations, I am as old fashioned and strait laced as can
be. I had a 35-year marriage to one woman until death did us part, so I
have had the experience and joy of a long and happy marriage. I do not
believe that I should deprive gay people of that same opportunity. It
is about equality before the law. As I said, the vote to which I
referred earlier took place at the uncivilised time of 4.27 am. We can
support the Third Reading of this Bill at a civilised time because the
Bill itself is
civilising<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T15:32:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071513000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0001.htm#13071513000094"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Higgins" PimsId="962" UID="13071513000757" xid="1263" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0001.htm#13071513000757">Lord
Higgins:</Member></B> My Lords, I join other noble Lords in
congratulating my noble friend the Minister on the Front
Bench on the way in which she has handled this Bill throughout. Indeed,
I join all those who expressed appreciation to the noble Lord, Lord
Alli, and others who have carried on the debate in such an
eloquent and satisfactory manner. I am particularly grateful to the
Minister for saying that the review will take into account the position
of pension fund trustees and other beneficiaries in ensuring that
equality is maintained. I would ask particularly whether the position
will be protected so that those in a same-sex marriage do not gain
access to a closed pension scheme in a way that would prevent members
of the company’s other scheme entering it. Perhaps that point
might be taken into account by the review. Can my noble friend say what
the composition of the review is to be? I am at rather a loss to
understand what interests of Her Majesty are involved in this; that
came straight out of the blue. Can my noble friend clarify that
particular
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T15:33:42"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071513000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0001.htm#13071513000095">Finally,
I am glad that the order resulting from this review is to be subject to
a resolution so that the House will be able to debate the result of the
review without having to resort to a prayer. Overall, I think that we
have made significant progress. I still have grave reservations about
the position of registrars and so on, which I understand was a whipped
vote on the 
<?notus-xml column=537?>other side. In any event, on this particular aspect of the Bill, the
Minister has certainly done an excellent job and I am very grateful to
her.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071513000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0001.htm#13071513000096"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T15:34:31"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="The Lord Bishop of Norwich" PimsId="2146" UID="13071513000758" xid="1686" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0001.htm#13071513000758">The
Lord Bishop of Norwich:</Member></B> My Lords, I support this group of
amendments. A review of the benefits accruing to all survivors under
occupational pension schemes is both desirable and necessary. The
principle of equity under the law for those whom the law holds to have
the same status in relation to the deceased is a sound one.
Hard-pressed pension schemes must be tempted to limit benefits, and the
complexity of some schemes may hide inequity, so this principle is
clear and just and I support it. Indeed, the Church of England pension
scheme already treats surviving civil partners in precisely the same
way as widows and
widowers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T15:35:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071513000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0001.htm#13071513000097">There
is a wider reason for supporting these amendments. It is no secret that
the majority of Christian churches and other world faiths do not
believe that same-sex marriage accords with their understanding of
marriage itself. However, many of us, including on these Benches,
welcome the social and legal recognition of same-sex partnerships and
believe that our society is a better and healthier one for such
recognition. That is why I support this group of amendments. This point
has sometimes been obscured in public commentary on what has been
taking place here, but not in the debates in your Lordships’
House. The courtesy and clarity with which your Lordships have listened
to each other represent our very best traditions, and I echo all that
has already been said in this brief

too, thank the Minister for her work and the Government for
accommodating the needs of the Church of England and other faith
traditions, and for wanting to do so. That has also been a
characteristic of this House as the Bill has been debated. While the
Bill is necessarily complex as a result of meeting many
needs—and we are making it a bit more complex again—it
will serve very well both its supporters and those who are still
unconvinced about it, and that is a signal
achievement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T15:36:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071513000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0001.htm#13071513000099"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Royall of Blaisdon" PimsId="485" UID="13071513000759" xid="1719" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0001.htm#13071513000759">Baroness

name to this group of amendments. I thank the Government for listening
and recognising that action should be taken in order to get rid of this
last inequality, which in my view is an anomaly. However, it is of
course right that consultation, a review and an assessment should be
undertaken before any final action is taken. I especially thank the
Minister, who steered through the discussions on the compromise with
her usual aplomb, skill and understanding. I am glad that we can all

noble Lords who have spoken in this debate and for their support for
these amendments. I will respond to some of the questions that were put
by my noble friend Lord Higgins. He asked whether those who are
currently excluded from a defined benefit scheme would not get access
to such a scheme to a greater advancement than anyone else as a result
of this review. I can assure him that that is not the case. The purpose
of the review<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T15:38:54"></hs_TimeCode> is

comprehensive response to that question except to say that that was
just a formality that is sometimes necessary on the government Chief
Whip’s part before a Bill passes on to the Commons. It is all to
do with various, specific interests that Her Majesty may have in a
piece of legislation. In no way does it pre-empt proper process or the

broadly to this debate and to those that we have had on the Bill in
your Lordships’ House over the past few weeks. At Second
Reading, I urged the House to ensure that the protections that allow
the church and other faiths to maintain their legitimate belief that
marriage is only between a man and a woman should work properly. I also
said that this House should debate and scrutinise whether the Bill
protects freedom of speech. Your Lordships have done that, and I am
grateful to all who have contributed. Those of us who have supported
the Bill in principle, and those who have been concerned about
protections for those who did not, have together made this an even

through both Houses, the Government have made 23 substantial
amendments, 17 of them while the Bill has been in this House. The most
significant include the reviews to which we are committed—on
civil partnerships, humanist marriages and the equalisation of survivor
benefits for same-sex and opposite-sex married couples—as well

same-sex couples, wanted us to strengthen further the clause in the

against it. I am aware that that did not happen—my Benches were
evenly split—in the Division on registrars that my noble friend
Lord Higgins has just mentioned. I am 
<?notus-xml column=540?>hugely proud of and grateful for that. We do not go in for emblems on
these Benches, but many of us on this side of the House very much
support the Bill. I pay particular tribute to one of my noble friends
for helping me so much over the past few weeks. Without her support, my
job would have been so much harder. She is my noble friend Lady
Noakes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071513000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0001.htm#13071513000111">As
always, I have enjoyed working closely with my noble and learned friend
Lord Wallace of Tankerness, and with my noble friend Lady Northover.
All of us on the Front Bench have enjoyed fantastic support from a
brilliant team of officials. I cannot name them all, but I mention in
particular Melanie Field, Suki Lehrer, Wally Ford and Philip Bland. I
will also give a shout-out to the special advisers who worked so hard
in supporting us in this House. I will not say their names, but they
know who they
are.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071513000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0001.htm#13071513000112">I thank
noble Lords from all four quarters of this Chamber who played a pivotal
role in the passage of the Bill, in particular the right reverend
Prelate the Bishop of Leicester, who is not in his place, and my noble
friends Lady Barker and Lord Lester on the Lib Dem Benches.
I was very pleased that my noble friend Lord Lester contributed to the
debate and reminded noble Lords how much he has done to advance civil
rights over many decades. I pay tribute to many noble Lords on the
Cross Benches, including the noble Lord, Lord Pannick. Also, while we
have been on opposing sides, I pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord
Dear, and his colleagues for their commitment to their
cause.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071513000113" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0001.htm#13071513000113">Finally,
I pay tribute to the Labour Benches. It is often said that politicians
should try harder to work together for the greater good. On this
important, historic piece of legislation, I am proud to say that that
is what the government and the opposition Front Benches did. It has
been a real pleasure over the past few months to work with the noble
Baronesses, Lady Royall and Lady Thornton. It was characteristic of the
noble Baroness to pay me such a generous tribute, and I am grateful to
her. I have great respect for both noble Baronesses and will always be
hugely grateful to them for their full support during the passage of
the Bill. Although we will not agree to the same extent on all
legislation that comes before the House in future, through the Bill I
believe that we have strengthened our mutual understanding and personal
trust. I am sure that that will be of great benefit to the work of the
House.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071513000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0001.htm#13071513000114">I
cannot pay tribute to the Labour Benches without mentioning the noble
Lord, Lord Alli, who today gave a very moving speech. The other day, in
a meeting with me, he declared in frustration at one point when I was
disagreeing with him about a request he was putting forward,
“But I am a gay rights campaigner”. Never was a truer
word said, and, based on his record of achievements, he is undoubtedly
one of the—if not the—very best. He has been a very
active participant in the passage of the Bill and I am grateful to
him.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071513000115" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0001.htm#13071513000115">Unlike
the noble Lord, Lord Alli, I cannot claim to be a gay rights
campaigner, but I am a firm believer in justice and fairness. My belief
comes from two guiding principles that my parents taught me: that you
are as good as anyone who thinks that they are better than 
<?notus-xml column=541?>you, and that you should always stand up for anyone who is treated worse
than everyone else. Therefore, it has been a privilege to be part of a
Bill that puts right something that is wrong: namely, the exclusion of
same-sex couples from the institution of marriage. I am delighted that,
very soon, it will be possible for gay couples to marry. They will be
able to affirm publicly their commitment to each other, and accept all
the responsibility and joy that comes with it, just like any other
couple.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071513000116" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0001.htm#13071513000116">I
say to any noble Lord who remains concerned that some gay couples will
not take seriously the responsibility of marriage that it is likely
that some will not. However, they will be no bigger in number than the
small minority of straight couples who sadly end up disappointing each
other and their families. Most importantly, we should celebrate and
congratulate every gay couple who embarks on this special enterprise of
shared endeavour in exactly the same way as we do straight couples,
wishing them a long and happy life together, but knowing that that
requires effort as well as the love and support of family and friends.

Cormack:</Member></B> I understand that this is the time that one would
make a brief contribution on this Motion. I am very sorry to be doing
it now in a sense because my noble friend the Minister in effect wound
up the proceedings on the Bill when she was answering the amendments.
However, I was not to know that she was going to do that. I want to
make a very brief speech and congratulate all those who have campaigned
for this measure on their success. However, in doing that, I ask them
to bear in mind that although this may be a day of unqualified
rejoicing for them, many in our country, who by no stretch of the
imagination could be called either homophobic or bigoted, are unhappy
about this Bill. They are unhappy about it because it changes the
structure of society by changing the definition of
marriage<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T15:52:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071513000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0001.htm#13071513000120">I
hope that all those who enter into marriage under its new definition
will, indeed, live happily every after, but the sincerity of that wish
in no sense prevents my saying to them, “I understand that you
feel euphoric today but please have a thought for those who have
different views and for the many, not just thousands but millions of
people in this country, for whom marriage will always be equated with
what remains in this Bill the Christian definition of marriage”.
I hope that in recognising that, they will also remember the great
Churchillian motto: magnanimity in
victory<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T15:54:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071513000121" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0001.htm#13071513000121">Those
who support the Bill have won; there is no doubt about that. It would
be churlish and ridiculous to pretend otherwise and I, for one, would
never do so. I hope that the divisions in our society which I fear will
not come to pass. For my part, I will do my best, in whatever way I
can, to ensure that they do not. However, if we are to have a society
that is not embittered, and bitterness is the most corrosive of all
emotions, it is important that both sides of this argument recognise
the validity of the other side. The noble Lord, Lord Alli, for whom I
have developed a very real regard during these debates, is, indeed, a
doughty campaigner and has every right to feel pleased with 
<?notus-xml column=543?>the result of his campaign. However, I say to him, and through him,

not a day of
rejoicing”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071513000122" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0001.htm#13071513000122"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T15:54:42"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Framlingham" PimsId="5910" UID="13071513000770" xid="2120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0001.htm#13071513000770">Lord

simple truth is that the coalition Government have colluded with equal
love campaigners and the European Court of Human Rights in bringing a

long-established and settled position on marriage. There was a
suggestion—some would call it a threat—that if

cynical and how dangerous. Given the huge effect the Bill, if passed,
will have on millions of people, what an abuse of the parliamentary

great concern have been left unresolved and hanging in the air, such as
the effect on teachers, faith schools, the issue of adultery,

Fowler:</Member></B> My Lords, in some humility, I say that I disagree
with both my fellow Conservatives who have just spoken, and in
particular with the last speech. I do that in the context of paying
tribute to the very high standard of the debate that has taken place. I
pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Dear, and his colleagues for the
way it has been conducted.</hs_para>

our case—those of us who want reform—that opposition is
homophobic. That is not remotely the case that we have been putting.
There is a central division between us. When opponents of the
Government’s legislation have said, “Remember what people
outside are saying”, that goes two ways. We might remember also
what many tens of thousands of gay and lesbian people outside are
saying. It is important to them, as the noble Lord, Lord Alli, so
movingly said, in personal terms. I am struck and touched by the
numbers of people who have been in touch with me to say what an
important decision this is. It is, of course, after years and years of
discrimination. That is what makes their support so moving.</hs_para>

that it is important in another way. During the passage of the Bill, I
have been, as it happens, to a range of countries where discrimination
against gay and lesbian people is not only an underlying feeling, but
it is set out either in legislation or in official attitudes of those
countries. I think in particular of a country I am recently back
from—Russia. I think of Ukraine and Uganda. Personally, I hope
that the message of this House of Lords is that there is a better way
of doing these things than the way that those countries are doing them.
It is a plea for equality and for non-discrimination. That is the hope
and the message that I hope goes out from this House. I believe that,
very shortly, the Government will have done a great thing here and I
congratulate them on it.</hs_para>

Dear:</Member></hs_speaker> My Lords, I start my brief but sincere
comments by thanking very much the Minister for the compliments she
just paid me. I am grateful to her. I 
<?notus-xml column=545?>also thank all of those who have spoken on all sides of the House in the
numerous debates that have taken place about the Bill, and especially
those who supported me in the passage of the Bill through your
Lordships’ House. All of us from my side were more than a little
surprised at the level of support that the Bill has attracted within
the House. If one looks at the opinion polls taken outside among the
general public, it runs at about 57% in favour of the Bill. The votes
in your Lordships’ House ran 20% or so ahead of that. I make no
comment about that except that it surprises, and others will take
considerable pleasure from that.</hs_para>

sincerely, is that despite the serious doubts that some parts of our
society harbour about the wisdom of the Bill, I—and I am sure I
can speak on behalf of my supporters—fully recognise the
parliamentary process and willingly accede to it. We all hope very
sincerely that if passed by the House of Commons, the Bill will prove
to be a success.</hs_para>

Farrington of Ribbleton:</Member></hs_speaker> Earlier today in your
Lordships’ House, there was a reference to grandchildren being
able to teach those of us who are grandparents about information
technology. I have also found through listening to children out in the
country that, unlike some of us from our generation, we are not
actually changing what is happening in the country, we are recognising
it. As a 12 year-old said to me, “What is the problem with that?
Two people love each other”. Our grandchildren’s
generation, and many of our children’s generation, live in what
the Japanese call the house of tomorrow. I thank all my colleagues
around the House who have been involved in steering the Bill through,
but in particular the Minister, who, if she does not get George
Clooney, perhaps could be on her way to sainthood because of the
patience she has shown during the passage of the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T16:05:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071513000135" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0001.htm#13071513000135">My
only worry comes from my experience in the education service, where
stories appear which say that a school is going to ban Christmas or
going to do this or that. I am proud of this House for the trust it is
putting in trustees, governors, local vicars, parents, communities and
teachers through the passage of the Bill and make a plea to all
concerned for when the stories start appearing, as they will.
Fortunately, in August, which is known as the funny month, most schools
are not sitting—with the exception, I believe, of those in
Scotland—so the press stories will not start just yet. However,
my plea to anybody who reads a critical story connected with the
passage of the Bill, such as one saying, “We told you so”
or that it is not working, is to remember the story of the local vicar
in Lancashire who was castigated in the press for saying that you could
not put “gran” on a monument in the churchyard because it
was not serious enough. That turned out not to be true and the poor man
spent the rest of his clergyman’s life being castigated for
something he had never done. When the stories start, as they will,
please wait to hear the outcome of the due process and whether somebody
is found guilty of something by the governors through appeals and the
disciplinary procedure. Do not get caught out by the knee-jerk reaction
that the media will try to create in certain circumstances. Let us make
certain that this Bill is a success and that this House has
done a good thing. Yes, there are 
<?notus-xml column=546?>people who do not want change—there are always people, of course,
who do not want change—but we have recognised change and we
should be proud of

Barker:</Member></B> My Lords, the passage of the Bill has been a
remarkable thing. Having sat through every bit of it, I have to say
that the discussions in your Lordships’ House have been not just
of the highest calibre but deeply thoughtful about the nature of the
society that we wish to pass on to future generations; none more so
than the contributions from the Bishops’ Benches. The Bill
represents a real sea change for gay people and for our
society—a good one that heralds the start of new relationship
between minority groups and faith groups. All those groups have an
important part to play in building strong communities for the future
and that is why we on these Benches have supported this Bill at every
stage<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T16:09:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071513000137" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0001.htm#13071513000137">We
have been helped enormously by the Front Bench team in dealing with
some quite difficult, tricky and intricate issues. I say to the noble
Lord, Lord Cormack, that, no, there is no room for triumphalism.
However, he will perhaps allow some of us today to celebrate what for
us is a really important step towards equality and equal treatment.
There is no room for intolerance but this House should be very
proud.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071513000138" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0001.htm#13071513000138"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T16:09:27"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Thornton" PimsId="4281" UID="13071513000775" xid="1466" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0001.htm#13071513000775">Baroness
Thornton:</Member></B> My Lords, the custom at this stage of the Bill
is for all of us to look at each other and congratulate ourselves on
the piece of legislation that we are just about to sign off. Of course,
I realise that not all noble Lords feel the same sense of satisfaction
at a job well done that the Minister, other noble Lords who have
supported the Bill and I feel at this moment. I regret that they are
not sharing the sense of joy and happiness that some of us are
experiencing. Certainly, if the London Gay Men’s Chorus’s
tuneful offerings outside the House are anything to go by, very many
others feel the same. Some of us, indeed, could not resist wearing pink
carnations. However, I note that even the noble Lord,
Lord<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T16:10:10"></hs_TimeCode>

opposed the Bill I say that you have tested the Bill to within an inch
of its life, and for that I congratulate you. No one expected that
getting the Bill through your Lordships’ House would be a walk
in the park, and I think that noble Lords have done their job as they
see it with dedication and
commitment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071513000140" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0001.htm#13071513000140">There
were moments at midnight when we were again discussing adultery when I
thought we were never going to reach this point. Those moments were
made all the more memorable by the description by the noble Baroness,
Lady Stowell of Beeston, of what is adultery and what is not. I refer
noble Lords to column 146, 8 July 2013, if they are in any doubt. I
wish her well with George Clooney, and I myself do not think that he is
anything like worthy of the noble Baroness.</hs_para>

very sincerely hope that time will change the views of noble Lords who
are still concerned about the Bill. I hope that the happiness the Bill
will bring to thousands of same-sex couples will persuade everyone
that, after all, Parliament was right in its huge majorities on free 
<?notus-xml column=547?>votes, which led us to where we are today. I hope that your own

as ever, and that marriage itself will actually be strengthened and

his steadfast support, my right honourable friend the leader of the

those powerful friends, free votes ran through the Bill on all the

majorities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071513000143" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0001.htm#13071513000143">I

this Bill, and I am glad of it. The Bill team were always helpful and
friendly, and are to be congratulated on their very hard work. I know
that the demands that were made on humanism, pensions and a host of
other issues meant that they and the Ministers had to go back and
persuade their colleagues in government that they needed to revisit or
revise matters they thought already settled. I know how hard that
is.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071513000144" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0001.htm#13071513000144">Across the

side receive bulletins and information about what was going to happen
and when votes were taking place, but he also organised some light
entertainment for Labour colleagues. On Monday the actor Richard Wilson

anyone who disagrees with me on this point. I have been pleased to say
repeatedly that the belief that marriage should be between only a man

Seventeen of them have been made while the Bill has been in your

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, in moving the amendment, I

noble Lords will doubtless recognise, Amendment 1 is a paving amendment
and the substance is in Amendments 6 and 9. Amendment 9 is
consequential on Amendment 6.</hs_para>

straightforward, and we had understood there was consensus.
Notwithstanding this, we have not seen a government amendment to give
it effect. The amendments provide a route to securing a central
procurement of auditors in the future. As we discussed on the first day
in Committee, by the time the key provisions of this Bill come into
force, it is expected that all the audit contracts with principal 
<?notus-xml column=550?>local bodies will be undertaken by private sector firms, under
arrangements entered into with the Audit Commission. This will comprise
some 800 principal authorities, including local authorities, NHS and
police bodies, and so on.</hs_para>

think that there are 10 of them—run to March 2017, but can be
extended for three years. When these contracts have run their course,
the authorities will make their separate appointments, although there
is flexibility for authorities to jointly procure, together with other
bodies. It is generally accepted that the central procurement exercise
undertaken by the Audit Commission has generated substantial savings
for local bodies—some 40% reduction in fees—and had some,
albeit limited, impact on broadening the diversification of provision
in the audit
market.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071513000158" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0001.htm#13071513000158">The
Government’s own impact assessment has recognised that
individual audit procurement is unlikely to match central procurement
in generating reduced fee levels. Research shows that market
concentration in audit services leads to higher audit fees, and while
there is a credible argument that individual procurement will act
against market concentration, major providers in the market are large,
economically powerful entities with resources to invest in tackling the
new opportunities.</hs_para>

larger authorities will fare well in this, because they will be more
attractive clients to the big firms. In practice, smaller authorities
will end up with less choice, being the junior partners in joint
appointments and perhaps missing out on the services of the larger
firms or being unable to afford them. The Government will doubtless
remind us that authorities can group together. They can, but there is
no clear framework to support this. Indeed, there is no explanation,
for example, of what happens if there is joint provision when a
conflict develops between one of the authorities and the firm
involved.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13071513000160" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0001.htm#13071513000160">The
amendments, particularly Amendment 9, which is at the core of it,
adopts the approach already included in the Bill for potential central
procurement for smaller authorities. It enables regulations to specify
a person to appoint auditors with relevant powers relating to fees, et
cetera. It especially encompasses the prospect of authorities being
able to opt either in or out of the arrangements, which we know is a
key requirement of the Minister. The Minister has expressed an appetite
for facilitating ongoing central procurement, provided that it is not
mandatory, and a hope to be able to return on Report with some ideas.
Perhaps we can now hear what they are. We know that the Minister and
officials have been having discussions with the LGA, but we do not
necessarily think that arrangements run by it are the only, or, indeed,
the best approach. If we are to preserve central procurement, we need
the legislative basis to do that. That is what the amendments provide.

with the point made by the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, if one was always
looking in terms of

have almost the demise of all local authorities. It would be a case of,
“Let us have it all done nationally and then we would save some
money”. We as a Government are committed to localisation. The
idea that local authorities should be to a degree able to choose their
auditor is part of that localisation. There was a feeling of despair in
the noble Lord’s comment about how local authorities would be
less hard negotiators than the Audit Commission. I doubt whether that
will be the case. Many local authorities would be very hard negotiators
on their own behalf in fixing the audit fees, the level of audit taking
place and how it will dovetail with the internal audit systems of the
local authority. A local authority that has a good local internal audit
system can probably negotiate much harder with the external auditors,

Government Association have made strong recommendations that we should
consider further the current situation, which is that the Audit
Commission has purchased the contract for all local authorities. We
have made it clear that there must be optional arrangements about this.
Local authorities must be able to get their local auditors in the way
that they wish. However we accept—and did accept—that
there was potential for wider procurement, with a procurement body such
as the Audit Commission, which did not require local authorities to

2 and 6 is clearly to try to improve the transitional arrangements. It
seems to be felt that we need a certain overprotection for
transitional arrangements, but when private corporate bodies change
their auditors and way of management, some transitional arrangement
always has to take place. It works in a natural way, without the
Secretary of State being involved in every
item.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071513000186" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0001.htm#13071513000186">Amendment

the external audits of local authorities has been a very important and
costly factor in terms of the time that the Audit Commission and

charged for them. Two or three years ago, the value-for-money audits

virtue in that localisation. Different firms of auditors will possibly
take a different view on what is needed within that particular local
authority, and that view will have an effect on the fees charged to
that authority and on how much work needs to be done. As the years
progress, it will be interesting to see how different local authorities
have their value-for-money details published. We hope that all local
authorities will publish these, and there may need to be some national
gathering of that information for comparison purposes. However, that

decided universally to extend the contracts again en bloc—which
is completely outside what we are talking about today, and it is
probably unlikely—it is for the local authorities to make their
own decisions about the contracts: where they want them to be, and with
whom. Following 2017, within that interim period between 2015 and 2017,

for her response and to the noble Lord, Lord Palmer, for his
challenges. I will start with the noble Lord. I sought to focus on the
contracts that are in existence, not the subsequent regime, in which
local authorities may or may not appoint their own auditors. However,
there is a bundle of contracts, to which my noble friend Lord
Christopher referred, which are ongoing at the moment but which will
need management. That management is more than just a passive affair, so
it needs to be put in

thought that the arrangement about extension was that it would
ultimately be a decision for the DCLG about its 10 bundles of different

I did not say that there should be some standardised approach to
value-for-money issues. I sought to ensure that there was security of
the value-for-money profiles that the Audit Commission currently
produces—data that are available to all authorities and others
as well—so that authorities are able to make their own judgments
and undertake their own exercises, whatever they may be. After the
Minister’s response, this is the area I feel less confident
about. We do not know from the reply whether they will be maintained,

the key

some clarity on the value-for-money profiles. Is it intended that the
data will still be collected, maintained and available to relevant

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, this is a rerun of the
amendment we moved in Committee concerning hybridity. It was prompted
by the report of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee
which drew attention to Clause 47 of the Bill relating to regulations
under Clause 2. Clause 2 enables the Secretary of State, by affirmative
resolution, to include someone as a relevant authority and to make
provisions about how the Bill affects them. This is the case even
though the regulations might be a hybrid instrument, although Clause 47
requires it to be treated as not being a hybrid
instrument<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T17:15:23"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee made it clear that if
the hybrid instrument procedure is not to afford protection in cases of
hybridity, there should be another form of protection—hence our
amendment concerning publication and
consultation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T17:14:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071513000210" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0001.htm#13071513000210">In
Committee, the Minister told us that instances of hybridity will be
rare. Indeed, I do not think that we have yet had an example of one.
There was, however, acknowledgment that, where they arose, there would
be an especially compelling reason for the Government to consult. In
response to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, the
Minister reiterated the Government’s acceptance of the need to
consult and promised an announcement on Report. We look forward to that
announcement and, specifically, to hearing why the commitment should
not be carried in the Bill. I beg to

Hanham:</Member></B> My Lords, as the noble Lord said, I was
sympathetic about his amendment in Committee. It would ensure that if
the Government were to bring forward what might amount to a hybrid
instrument under the powers in Clause 2, the bodies affected would be
consulted before regulations were laid. This, indeed, would need to be
through
regulations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T17:16:21"></hs_TimeCode>. We
do not expect that the need to bring forward regulations would be
anything less than rare.</hs_para>

I said in Committee, we recognise that in these cases there would be
especially compelling reasons for the Government to consult. In our
previous discussion I referred the noble Lord to our forthcoming
response to the DPRRC’s report. We have accepted the
committee’s point and informed it that we would announce our
commitment, which I am doing, and consult affected bodies at Report. We
confirmed that this will not entail the need for any amendment to the
Bill. I am happy to give that commitment today, and to consult relevant
persons on a draft of any statutory instrument containing regulations
or an order falling under Clause 40(7) of the Bill. Any such
regulation would be subject to the affirmative process, so Parliament
would have the opportunity to scrutinise it. In the light of that
commitment, I hope that the noble Lord will feel that we have satisfied
his
requirements<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T17:17:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071513000214" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0001.htm#13071513000214"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord McKenzie of Luton" PimsId="1827" UID="13071513000797" xid="1824" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0001.htm#13071513000797">Lord

Palmer of Childs Hill:</Member></hs_speaker> My Lords, I would also
welcome the Minister clarifying some issues, particularly if there is,
indeed, a problem of a practical nature. At present, most local
authorities are audited by a professional firm. A fairly small
proportion is audited by the commission. Those audited by professional
firms will be audited under the continuing contracts until 2017. The
local authority will then have the ability to appoint a new auditor.
This is what happens in the commercial world. One has an auditor, the
auditor audits for a period—generally for the year, in this case
for slightly longer—and then there is a new appointment. This is
quite the natural way of things. I am not sure—and I hope that
the Minister and the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, will clarify
this—why we need to have this because, in a practical sense of
the word, auditors are there for a period, they finish their term of
office and then they, or another auditor, are appointed. That is the
natural way of things whatever we decide or do not decide in your
Lordships’ House.</hs_para>

Hanham:</Member></hs_speaker> My Lords, first, I confirm that it is
possible to introduce different parts of the Bill at different stages,
and the order in the Bill can be switched around. I think the noble
Lord asked whether Clause 4(2) could be introduced before Clause 4(1)
and the answer is that it could—it is a case of whatever is
convenient. The Bill introduces powers to commence different parts of
the Bill at different times and to make savings on provisions relating
to the Audit Commission Act 1998. Therefore, we would expect to
commence this reference in line with the introduction of the local
appointment, which I think we were discussing when the noble Lord, Lord
Christopher, was here.</hs_para>

to know our wider intention of how to manage the overall transition to
the new audit framework, it may be helpful if I say a bit more about
that. Our intent remains, as I said, to close the commission in spring
2015. The existing audit contracts will continue to run until 2017, but
management of those will transfer to an interim body. We have discussed
these over the three previous amendments. As the contracts will run
until 2017, authorities will not need to make their own appointments
until that stage, but they will have to have made those appointments so
that there is a smooth transition between the contracts currently
managed by the Audit Commission and whoever manages them subsequently,
into the local authority’s own regime. We therefore expect that
much of Part 3 of the Bill, which deals with local appointment, will
not be commenced until closer to 2016, which then gives them a year to
do that. It will be 2016 when procurement of auditors for 2017 is
likely to begin.</hs_para>

Palmer of Childs Hill:</Member></B> Before the noble Lord, Lord
McKenzie, sits down, I will just comment on the point about the
appointment of the auditor by the Audit Commission. In practical terms,
the Audit Commission currently suggests who the auditor should
be—for example PricewaterhouseCoopers, or Grant Thornton, which
has a large number of these audits. The local authority is the one that
appoints the auditor, under its own constitution, although it accepts
in practice the auditor that has been put forward by the Audit
Commission—whether it is the Audit Commission itself or a
professional firm. I would have to go back to the constitution but, as
I understand it, the local authority has a constitutional duty to
appoint an auditor, which it currently does on “the
instructions” of the Audit Commission. However, the appointment
cannot be foisted on a local authority, because it is a legal body in
itself<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T17:27:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071513000225" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0001.htm#13071513000225"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord McKenzie of Luton" PimsId="1827" UID="13071513000806" xid="1824" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0001.htm#13071513000806">Lord

also speak to Amendment 8, which between them make small changes to
Clause 7. These amendments enable two or more auditors to be appointed
to exercise jointly one or more functions and enable a different
auditor to be appointed to act separately to undertake one or more
functions. The noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, first raised this issue by
tabling two amendments in Grand Committee, which would have enabled
auditors appointed jointly to issue advisory notices or to seek
judicial review either individually or jointly.</hs_para>

consider the drafting of Clause 7 to check that it provides
the desired level of flexibility for auditors to work jointly and
individually. The two amendments that we are bringing forward are a
result of those deliberations and give relevant authorities greater
flexibility in the way in which they can appoint more than one auditor.
Authorities will of course be able to appoint just one auditor.
Alternatively, they will be able to appoint more than one: jointly, to
exercise one or more functions; separately, to undertake different
functions or different parts of the accounts; or some combination of
those. We consider that it will very rarely be the case that
authorities wish to appoint more than one auditor to act jointly
throughout the whole audit. However, where they choose to do so, the
auditors must act jointly. The clause already enabled auditors
appointed separately to undertake some functions jointly if those
functions overlapped, but it did not allow auditors to be appointed
with the purpose of undertaking some functions jointly and others
separately. I am grateful to the noble Lord for raising this matter. I
hope that the amendment will enable a more flexible approach, and I beg

have reflected on the proposition that all principal authorities must
have an audit committee whose functions include those required of an
audit panel, and we see some merit in the Government’s argument
that this could be too restrictive. We consider that all principal
authorities should have an audit committee to undertake the range of
functions with which we are familiar. Given that the appointment of
auditors is a new function, the audit committee would be a natural
place to provide the appropriate scrutiny and oversight of the
relationship with the external
auditor.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071529000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0002.htm#13071529000003">However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T17:39:27"></hs_TimeCode>,
given the importance to that scrutiny and oversight role of the
independence requirements, we think these should be paramount. These
independence requirements are not mirrored in audit committee
arrangements, and the CIPFA guidance is more focused on the separation
of engagements of executive and scrutiny members. That guidance does
not require a minimum number of independent, non-councillor members. So
if we insist on audit committees to carry out the auditor panel role,
and on the independence requirements to be satisfied, it seems to be
the case that many local authorities would have to substantially
restructure their arrangements. We encourage them to do so, but to
require them to do so where audit committees are currently functioning
well is perhaps against the spirit of
localism.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071529000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0002.htm#13071529000004">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T17:39:27"></hs_TimeCode>
suggestion that the auditor panel might be a small sub-committee of an
existing audit committee almost gets the best of both worlds, and may
at least provide a transitional solution. However, the primary 
<?notus-xml column=568?>purpose of the amendment was to address the definition of independence.
For this purpose, the Bill requires members of the audit panel to be
independent of the authority for which the auditor is to be appointed.
In the Bill independence is defined in terms of individual positions;
that is, membership and relationships—so parent or grandparent.

Palmer of Childs Hill:</Member></B> My Lords, the amendment of the
noble Lords, Lord McKenzie and Lord Beecham, says that an individual
will be ineligible if that individual has a disqualifying interest. Yet
it seems, by all the purposes of any law there is, that if you have a
disqualifying interest you are by nature ineligible. I listened to the
noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, and I still struggle to see why one needs to
clarify and why one needs the amendment, because if one has a
disqualifying interest one would be ineligible. I raised this matter at
early stages of the Bill. As for who should sit on these panels, yes,
the members of the local authority who are qualified may sit on the
panel, and there then seems to be a great emphasis on independent
members.</hs_para>

this stage I declare an interest, and I probably should have done so
earlier in the course of this debate. I am currently a chairman of a
local authority audit committee. I do not think that this disqualifies
me, and perhaps it qualifies me particularly to comment on this. One of
the interesting things which I hope the Minister will address in her
answer is that it is currently quite the custom in many local
authorities, including my own, for a member of that local authority who
is of a different political party from the ruling party to be the chair
of the audit committee. That very often provides a very independent
chairman or chairwoman of that
committee.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071529000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0002.htm#13071529000008">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T17:39:22"></hs_TimeCode>
am worried that if we change that and require an independent committee
chair, will that chair be as independent as an opposition chair? By the
nature and appointment of audit committees, when looking for people who
will be independent, particularly in the case of chairs, there is in
some cases a possibility that those appointing will look among people
they know who may have political sympathy with the ruling
administration. The current arrangements seem to give chairs greater
independence. This is probably wider than the amendment of the noble
Lord, Lord McKenzie, but it seems to me to follow on from what is a
disqualifying interest. I think we are giving that too much
concentration, rather than the actual and real independence of the
person who chairs that
committee<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T17:38:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

McKenzie<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T17:38:13"></hs_TimeCode>, raised
several issues, seeking clarification about the auditor panel. I start
by reminding noble Lords how the auditor panels will operate, and how
we are moving to keep arrangements streamlined and flexible in terms of
whom the auditor panel is made up of. First, I want to confirm what I
said in Committee, that we do not expect these auditor panels to be
large. We expect them to be quite small, probably three or five people
at the most. This does not exclude members of the audit committee being
members of the panel, as long as they are independent members. If the
audit committee has an independent member, than that member can be a
member of the audit panel. I do not think that there would be anything
to exclude them being chair of the panel, if that is required. It would
not actually preclude a member of the opposition being chair of that
panel. We can see that that is how they will be made
up.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071529000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0002.htm#13071529000010">Other
than that, they can appoint a completely separate auditor panel outside
the audit committee regime. There again, they will have to make sure
that the members of that panel are majority-independent. Again, that
would not preclude any member of the local authority being part of it,
even though they might be considered to have some relationship with
what is going on because, by definition, they were a member of the
council. None the less, we think that there might be some virtue in
having a councillor or councillors on the auditor panel to help with
the
selection<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T17:40:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071529000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0002.htm#13071529000011">Amendment
10 goes back to our discussions on wider issues; that is, the
assessment of the independence of auditor panel members beyond direct
personal links to the audited authority. I hope that I have explained
that we need them to be really independent. Some concern was expressed

time, about significant business relationships. By any definition, a

to say that they must be pretty clear that nobody on the panel has a

affiliation that should be declared so that, before the auditor panel

that, but the briefing note again confirms that the auditor panel could

recent amendment to the Companies Act 2006 made by regulations. As I am
sure noble Lords are instantly aware, paragraph 21 of Schedule 5 to the
Bill modifies Section 1253(5) of the Companies Act 2006. That section
specifies the conditions for delegating functions, such as the function
of recognising supervisory bodies, to an existing body and refers to
Schedule 10 to the Companies Act 2006, which is also applied by
Schedule 5 to the Bill. On 8 July 2013, the Statutory Auditors and
Third Country Auditors Regulations 2013 were laid. One effect of these
regulations is to insert a reference to paragraph 23A(1) of
Schedule 10 in Section 1253(5) of the 2006 Act. Paragraph
23A of Schedule 10 to the Companies Act is expressly omitted by
paragraph 27(2)(f) of Schedule 5 to the Bill. This is because paragraph
23A of Schedule 10 concerns arrangements for independent monitoring of
third country audits, which are outside the scope of this

this and other related discussions since Grand Committee, and consider
that there are benefits to placing an explicit requirement in the Bill

between the audit requirements for health bodies in Clause 20, and
those for local government bodies in Clause 19. Furthermore, presenting
accounts that are “true and fair” is an established

amendment will make clear that the accounts of the larger relevant

the Government do not consider it appropriate that the “true and

auditors in Clause 19 will effectively require the authority to prepare
to true and fair standards. We will confirm that requirement in the
regulations that will be made under Clause 31, by requiring the chief
finance officer of larger relevant authorities to certify that the
accounts show as true and fair. This is similar to the approach for

Clause 20—are funded by Parliament to commission health care
services. As such, they are accountable to Parliament for how they

in Committee, as the noble Lord said. We had drawn attention to the
disparity of wording in the Bill between the general duties of auditors
of relevant bodies which are health service bodies and those which are
not. The requirements for local authority accounts to show a true and

is a section of that auditor separated by a Chinese wall—audits
the pension fund of that local authority. That is treated by external
auditors as a separate audit. Because of national accounting
requirements introduced about three years ago, those pension fund
accounts had to be incorporated within the accounts of a local

same question about 40 years ago when the phrase was first coming into

will be true but they may not be fair because they do not answer the
question which accountants never ask at an audit stage: that is whether
there is a working capital certificate sufficient to support the cash
flow. Therefore, you have to say that the accounts are true, but they
may not be fair because they may not highlight the pitfall that the
cash is going to run out. So “true” and
“fair” belong to each other, but they have a separate and

these amendments are not only about increasing transparency, they also
set out to tackle a decrease in transparency brought about by the new
arrangements. The Audit Commission, which is being replaced by the
provisions of the Bill, was covered by the Freedom of Information Act.
My understanding is that, in addition to information that it held for
its own purposes—which was of course covered by the Freedom of
Information Act—some information held by auditors would also
have been regarded as being held by the commission in certain
circumstances; for example, when it was investigating a complaint
against a specified auditor, when it was conducting a quality control
of their work, or when it had required an auditor to provide
information for the discharge of wider Audit Commission functions, such
as making judgments on local authorities’ use of resources. In
such circumstances, the information would have been deemed to have been
held by the Audit Commission and so subject to the Freedom of
Information Act.</hs_para>

the Government appear to believe that there are already sufficient

income stream for auditors. In my experience, it would take a quite a
lot to deter accountants from such an income stream, especially as the
costs of complying with a freedom of information regime would be
relatively small. The Government, for example, estimate that the total
compliance costs for local bodies will be £4.43 million. The
cost of freedom of information compliance will be considerably less
than that, especially since, as the Minister has pointed out, auditors
will have to set up some form of statutory and regulatory compliance
regime anyway. In addition, there will a relatively small number of
firms doing this work and they will be able to amortise the central
costs of compliance over a relatively large number of contracts.

that works in practice is that the local authority and its internal

trouble with audits—this is where the noble Lord, Lord Wills,

historical and you are looking at what went wrong. The noble Lord, Lord
Wills, gave two good examples of what went wrong. The question to the

large portions of their services to firms such as Capita, questions

some councils will be handing over control of critical council services
such as planning, licensing and environmental health to private,
for-profit companies. This will make it harder for local residents to
get answers and action on issues affecting them. It will also make it
harder for elected councillors to monitor and scrutinise these services

services if councillors and residents decide that they want things done
differently. My noble friend and others have mentioned the G4S and

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, this has been quite a
wide-ranging debate and I recognise the importance of the issue that is
being raised. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Wills, for the discussion
that we had the other week and for the determination with which he is
pursuing this. The Government are not persuaded that these amendments
serve the cause. It seems to us that the current arrangements provide
the requirement for transparency in outsourcing, but I recognise the
much wider issues that the noble Lord is raising, such as the growth of
outsourcing over the past 25 to 30 years, the potential
conflicts of interest that then arise and the rise of substantial
amounts of public money that are now being spent by private
contractors. The current 
<?notus-xml column=583?>and recent cases of alleged fraud and error that have arisen in a number
of areas of outsourcing of the work programme have not been mentioned.
However, noble Lords will also remember that there have been a number
of worrying
cases.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071529000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0002.htm#13071529000080">This
has grown up over a long period, from well before this Government took
office, but it is with us now and we certainly need to look at it. I
promise the noble Lord, Lord Wills, that if he would like to pursue
this we are open to further discussions. This is the sort of subject
that is perhaps appropriate at some stage for a Committee of one or
other of the Chambers to look at, to see whether the current rights of
freedom of information, rights of access, and challenges from electors
and others are adequate, or whether there is a systemic problem that
needs to be addressed by
legislation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071529000137" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0002.htm#13071529000137">Local

consultation asked whether local auditors should be brought into the

the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, for his support. The noble Lord, Lord
Palmer of Childs Hill, and the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, brought
invaluable experience to bear on these issues, and I am grateful to

discover problems only after the fact, and the noble Lord, Lord Palmer,
asked me directly why I thought that these amendments would still be
valuable in the light of that. They would be valuable for many reasons.
Perhaps 
<?notus-xml column=584?>the most important one is that knowing what you do will be subject to
public scrutiny is a powerful incentive to getting it right. If you
know that what you are doing can be covered up successfully, that is
more likely than anything else to ensure fraud, incompetence and

to look at two issues between now and Third Reading, because they bear
on the whole purpose. First, in his response the Minister did not
really address my arguments about the inadequacies of the current
regime. With all respect to him, he just repeated the arguments in the

there is the question of cost. This has not been the time to get to

government policy to be made on that basis. So I hope that the

keeping with the amendment that we moved in Committee. In Committee we
sought to strengthen independent around the process of an auditor
issuing a public interest report, and without sight of the government
amendment we have retabled our Amendment 20. The sequence has been: in
the draft Bill, a requirement to consult with the audit panel; in the
current Bill, a requirement to notify the panel before the public
interest report is issued; in our amendment, a requirement to notify
when it is issued; and now, in the government amendment, to notify as

amendment moved in Committee, which we consider is unresolved business.
Its intent is to add to the purposes for which data matching can be
used the prevention and detection of maladministration and error. At
present, data matching can be used for the prevention and detection of
fraud. The relevant Minister can add certain specified purposes by
regulation, but only after a consultation exercise. The prevention and
detection of maladministration and error is not currently one of these
additional purposes. Accepting the amendment would not immediately
bring this purpose within the scope of data matching but would allow it

purpose for data-matching exercises: to assist in the prevention and

he brought to the House’s attention the need for very careful
consideration of these matters, Perhaps I should say that as a liberal
in every sense, I am battered on both sides on the question of the
convenience that the digital revolution provides us with but also the
enormous threats that it offers to individual privacy if we are not
careful about how we manage data holding, data sharing, data matching
and data mining. I am sure that all noble Lords are aware of the
distinctions between all of those. This is a very difficult area, and
while the detection of error as well as of fraud is inherently
valuable, it would allow the new owner of the national fraud initiative
to continue the Audit Commission’s work. Any amplification of
ministerial powers in this area therefore requires careful
consideration. I assure the noble Lord that my officials are working

and benefits that such an extension might entail. I look forward to
meeting the noble Lord in due course to update him on progress in this
area, recognising that we are tip-toeing around the edges of one of the
major issues that any future Government will be facing in the next
three to five years: how we cope with the explosion of digital
information available on cloud computing. I hope with those assurances
that the amendment can now be
withdrawn<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T18:50:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071529000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0002.htm#13071529000100"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord McKenzie of Luton" PimsId="1827" UID="13071529000184" xid="1824" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0002.htm#13071529000184">Lord
McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, I must express some
disappointment with the Minister’s response. I am grateful for
the information on the transfer of the 
<?notus-xml column=588?>NFI to the Cabinet Office and I am reassured that it will be in the safe
hands of the noble Lord as the Minister in your Lordships’
House. I share the concern about the enormity of some of the data
holding, data sharing and data mining privacy issues. I took it,
perhaps from what the Minister said, that there was the prospect of
some broader legislation not too far down the track. However, I hang on
to my point that this amendment would not extend one little bit what
happens at the moment.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T18:52:26"></hs_TimeCode> fact, the
amendment would not even take us as far as we are today with the Audit
Commission because it would need those further processes before it came
into being. Whatever else is going on and whatever the scale of these
other issues—I share the noble Lord’s concerns over
those—I fail to see why this provision cannot be taken forward.
It seems to me that there is a diminution in the Government’s
task of tackling maladministration and error without these powers being
available. I do not think the noble Lord explained how they would be
dealt with differently once the Audit Commission goes out of existence
and how this range of opportunities would be replicated under the new
arrangement. I do not know whether the noble Lord would like another go
at trying to convince me on that, but it would be helpful if he could.
What will happen to the Audit Commission’s current audit powers
to deal with maladministration and error? What will replace those just
to have an equivalent process when the Audit Commission
goes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T18:53:09"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071529000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0002.htm#13071529000101"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Wallace of Saltaire" PimsId="4501" UID="13071529000185" xid="1482" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0002.htm#13071529000185">Lord

issue of fraud and error in government as a whole in a wider context
and would like to examine the experience of the Audit Commission
further and to feed that into our wider discussion about the future of
data sharing, data mining, data matching and that whole area. We do not
intend to leave a long-term hole but to treat this within the broader
context of what is happening. Some of us have been concerned in rather
a different context with the shift from household electoral

happens, some of the same issues

explanation. I take the point that this will not just be left lying
fallow but that there will be some active consideration of it. I still
hang on to my point that the active consideration could take place
without implementation by having the amendment in the Bill. If not, we
will need primary legislation of some sort in the future to bring it
into being as part of the data-matching process, if that is what the
conclusion is on further analysis. Having the amendment in the Bill
does not mean that it has to be activated, because the Minister has to
go through a consultation process to do that. As there is going to be
this broader look, it seems to me that the Government have reached the
wrong conclusion. They could have adapted the Bill to include this
amendment even if they never implemented it. I think we have probably
been around this enough, unless the Minister wants to say something

Regulatory Reform Committee published its report on the Local Audit and
Accountability Bill. The report made a recommendation regarding the
provisions in the Bill to prevent local authority newsletters unfairly
competing with local newspapers. We have considered the recommendations
in this very useful report carefully, and this group of amendments is
the result of those
considerations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T18:56:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071547000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0002.htm#13071547000002">The
committee said that in certain circumstances it is inappropriate for
powers to make the code mandatory to be exercisable by directions
rather than by statutory instrument, and subject to no parliamentary

wishes to exercise his power to issue a direction to all local
authorities in England or to a specified description of authorities,
the affirmative resolution procedure should apply. While recognising
that there can be circumstances where it is appropriate for the
Secretary of State to be able to give directions to a class of, or to
all, local authorities, we accept the committee’s recommendation
that the exercise of this power in relation to classes of, or to all,
local authorities, should be by affirmative statutory

the power is exercised in relation to a single authority otherwise than

Beecham:</Member></B> My Lords, we are now coming to that part of the
Bill that reflects several of the obsessions of the Secretary of State,
not necessarily of the Minister. It is interesting that the draft Bill
committee had, of course, no opportunity to consider these matters
because they were not part of the original Bill; they were tacked on to
the Bill at a later stage. I suppose we should be grateful that at
least the Delegated Powers Committee has had an opportunity to comment
on it. In fairness, I am grateful to the Minister and to
the Government for accepting at least part of its
recommendations, the part that referred to directions given to all
local authorities. However, I find it difficult to follow the reasoning
for the rejection of the second recommendation about directions to an
individual
authority.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071547000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0002.htm#13071547000006">The
committee indicated that a power does not merely afford a specific and
targeted enforcement mechanism but could—and would, if the
relevant subsection is relied on—have the character of a
legislative power. It took the view that it is inappropriate for powers
of this kind, to make the code mandatory, to be exercisable by
directions rather than by statutory instrument. Hence the two
recommendations it made; in fairness, the Government have accepted one
of them, although they did not accept the other. That decision was
communicated to the committee and is reported in its sixth report,
which was printed as recently as 11 July. In fairness, the report was
written in June, but it does not indicate exactly when. However, it was

am not sure what concerns the Government have. In introducing the
government amendments the noble Baroness spoke to the competition
offered to local newspapers by local authorities. That is an issue to
which we will return a little later, probably at some length; I am

competition cannot be stopped, or indeed produced overnight. It is an
ongoing process.</hs_parafo>

the noble Baroness seemed to hint at
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T19:02:03"></hs_TimeCode> other
aspect, of some impropriety about the nature of the publications. In
other words, presumably, she meant that it would be wrong for political
propaganda to be published at public expense. Again, we will return to
some of those issues. I do not follow the urgency in this context. I do
not see why censorship— 
<?notus-xml column=591?>which is effectively what this becomes—should take place without
parliamentary approval or at least the possibility of Parliament
negating such a step. After all, what is the recourse to be? We might
find ourselves in a position of judicial review. Fortunately, councils
would not have to apply for legal aid, which presumably will not be
available under other of the Government’s measures.
Nevertheless, one can see the scope for litigation
here.</hs_para>

do not see the urgency that the noble Baroness adduces as a reason for
the Government’s stance. Perhaps she could exemplify some of the
instances in which, had the Government had the power, they would have
used the power they are now giving themselves to intervene in a
particular situation. Are there examples of this or is there evidence
of the kind of abuse—whether that is competitive or political
abuse—to which presumably the Government’s proposals are
directed? If that evidence is not there, the Government should rethink
their position. This is a significant incursion into the
responsibilities of local government, given the existence of a code,
and given the steps that could be taken by a variety of
sources—to which we will, no doubt, refer again later—if
breaches are carried out by

other aspect is, as I understand it, that the directions could be given

their particular concerns. I and my colleagues on these Benches are
extremely sceptical about both the motivation and the effect of this,

should have been accepted in full rather than in part. Parliament and
not a Minister should be given the unfettered right to determine steps

Hanham:</Member></B> My Lords, as the noble Lord knows, on the code of
conduct, as regards publicity, and in general, it would be fair to say
that the code is probably reasonably well observed among the majority
of authorities. There could be occasions—I say “could
be” because that is how we need to put it—in which a
number of authorities breach all or part of that code, in which case it
would be essential that the Secretary of State was able to take action.
If it is a large number, there would, presumably, by definition be some
really serious element that had come about so that the Secretary of
State needed to be aware of it. However, this could do with a further
look at in Parliament, and further consultation. We fully accept that

accept that I, too, am bound by that agreement. My clutch of amendments
is therefore an attempt to meet the terms of the agreement which I
personally signed up to, as did my party. However, it is targeted,
rather than the broad-brush approach that the Government seem to have
at present.</hs_parafo>

problem with Clause 38 is that it is rather more than a catch-all,
although it does apply to all local authorities. It gives the Secretary
of State power to intervene, regardless of whether the local authority
is complying with the code or not. That is not in accordance with the
coalition agreement which is quite specific about dealing with unfair
competition. In reality, it means that those authorities—if
there is more than one—which are producing a weekly newspaper,
paid for by commercial advertising that arguably might have gone to a
local commercial newspaper, are in competition with that local
newspaper. That part of the agreement attempts to give some protection
to local newspapers going through a difficult—probably
terminal—period. Whether that is a correct analysis of the
situation for local newspapers—and it certainly is not a
complete analysis, nor is it a subject for debate today—that is

seek to limit the rather wide-ranging power that the clause currently
gives to the Secretary of State and to target it on those authorities

insufficient at the moment—to deal with a real problem and not
just the threat of a possible problem. We all accept—and the

37 asks the Secretary of State to take into account whether acting
outside of the code is in the best financial interest of the local

more about what exactly is to be caught by making this code
statutory. Local authorities seem to have a lot of concerns that
restricting their publications is inadvertently going to cause them to
spend more money promoting policies or matters not of political but of
public interest—such as public health. There is quite a lot that
a local authority has and will have to do in raising and publicising
such issues and in campaigning. The briefing quotes examples ranging
from job advertisements to information about bank holiday opening hours
of recycling facilities. I find it hard to believe that the Secretary
of State is going to intervene because he believes that a local
authority is in breach of a publicity code over the bank holiday
opening hours of recycling facilities. However, this is an example of

group of amendments to try to remove the blunderbuss approach that
seems to be worrying a very wide range of authorities. That is
why all parties in the LGA are concerned. It is not because
their local authorities are in breach of the code; it is because of the
wide-ranging powers that it is giving to the Secretary of State. These
are entirely contrary to the much talked about—but not so often
seen in practice—localism to which my Government, and many of us
in my Government, are committed, which is a targeted approach. I think
that most of us here would accept that there is a problem with the
activities of one or two local authorities going too far perhaps with a
commercial weekly newspaper, or occasionally in party-political rather
than in general political terms, and that that problem needs to be
dealt with. Clearly the Secretary of State feels that the powers he has
at present are inadequate—although I do not recall the Minister

this a little further and obtain some clarification about what exactly
may be caught by these provisions. I have seen it said that when this
is enacted it will mean that local authorities will no longer be able
to lobby their own local MPs. That has been said, although I find it
hard to believe. Perhaps I may ask the Minister what will be the
position for those local authorities that, for instance, might wish to
oppose a third runway at Heathrow Airport, should that become a
probability or even a government policy. Are they able in the interests
of their own local taxpayers to express a view, which is almost
certainly an all-party view within that local authority, even if it is
contrary to government policy? Will the local authorities on the line
of HS2 be allowed to express a view—again, I suspect that it is
likely to be an all-party view as well as the view of an overwhelming
majority of residents in that area—which may not comply with
government policy or with views that I personally hold, although that

welfare reform issues. Of course all of us accept that a council should
not use public money to operate on a party-political basis, but how far
can it go in being able to reflect the views of local residents on an
issue of wider national concern, regardless of party politics? I
suspect that all of us would say that it is the responsibility of the
local authority to represent and to argue the views and interests of
its local residents, and if it did not, or it felt inhibited in doing
so, then it would be failing those residents. So these are the sorts of

Hanham:</Member></B> My Lords, I am probably in danger of saying the
same thing three times as there is no doubt that these amendments stray
into each other. We have heard some pretty wide
comments on the code as it stands, which probably go slightly wider
than the intention behind the noble Lord’s amendments. None the
less, we should be very clear that we are talking about the publicity
code. I think that guidance is given to local authorities on seven
aspects of the publicity code, their behaviour in relation to it and
what it involves. It is a statutory code but compliance is voluntary at
the moment. If the Secretary of State had to intervene, it would become
mandatory only as regards the aspects on which he gave
directions, if that was done across the board. If the Secretary of
State gave an individual direction, that would be mandatory
only for the relevant local authority. This
is not a case of putting the whole code on a
mandatory basis but of directing local authorities where they are
seriously breaching the current code. We are interested only in those
local authorities—and there are some—which are giving
rise to concern about their publicity because they are producing far
too many weekly or fortnightly publications—the terms
of the code are three monthly—or are going beyond the
reaches of propaganda or stepping outside what they should
be doing and producing publicity which is too political. Those are the
areas we are dealing
with<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T19:32:46"></hs_TimeCode>. As I have
said several times, I totally accept that the majority of local
authorities comply with the code without thinking about it. It is part
of their lives, as it were, and they do not set out to breach it.
However, some do and this Bill gives us an opportunity to make sure
that they are put under some
constraint.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071547000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0002.htm#13071547000041">Amendment
25 would require the Secretary of State to be satisfied that a local
authority had failed to comply with the code under Section 4. The
amendment is not necessary and inappropriate. It would needlessly
complicate and risk delaying the exercise of the power of direction,
which, as I have explained, needs to be quick. Having the making of a
direction formally 
<?notus-xml column=598?>conditional on this simply opens the door to even more debate, argument
and delay. That is not compatible with our aim of rapid, targeted
action.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071547000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0002.htm#13071547000042">Amendment
28 would remove the power for the Secretary of State to give a
direction to an authority whether or not he thinks that authority is
complying with the code to which it relates. This would remove the
Secretary of State’s power to issue a direction where there was
doubt over compliance with the code in the future. It is right, when
legislating for a new provision, to ensure that as far as possible the
provisions cater for different eventualities so that you do not have to
keep coming back to the various aspects but cover them so that they do
not need to be followed
up.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071547000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0002.htm#13071547000043">Amendment
30 would lengthen the period a local authority might continue not to
comply with the publicity code. The noble Earl, Lord Lytton, agreed
with my noble friend Lord Tope that the 14-day period was too short.
Local authorities will know perfectly well when they are breaching the
publicity code, so a two-week notice period is perfectly reasonable
under those circumstances. The notice must be given in writing. A text
message or an e-mail will not do. A formal notification must be given,
marking the start of the 14 days’ notice. I am sure that the
local authority concerned would have plenty of time to raise its
concerns.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071547000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0002.htm#13071547000044">I
return to the important point made by the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, on
the form of the code. The Secretary of State cannot just change the
code any old how. Any changes to the code would have to be
approved by both Houses of Parliament, and any revision to it can be
made only through the negative resolution procedure, so it would have
to come before this House. The noble Lord shakes his head but a
negative resolution can be turned into a proper debate in this House,
as he knows as well as I do. The revision must be laid in draft before
each House of Parliament and cannot be laid until after 40 days. This
is the norm. If you laid the changes before 40 days, the noble Lord,
Lord Beecham, who keeps an eye on these things, would leap on it after
day three. If either House votes against the proposed change, it cannot
go ahead. I think that is more or less the situation with any such
proposal.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071547000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0002.htm#13071547000045">Amendment
35 is similar to the amendment on the notification. I think it is
intended to require the Secretary of State to write to individual local
authorities—I have already indicated that he
will—modifying or withdrawing a direction. Any notification

in
writing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071547000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0002.htm#13071547000046">Our
amendment, which makes provision that the exercise of the power by the
Secretary of State to ensure compliance with the code in relation to
all local authorities in England of a specified description, or to all
local authorities in England, should be made by an affirmative
statutory instrument, removes the need for these amendments. It would
be highly unusual for an order-making power to be subject to a
requirement for the Secretary of State to bring it to the attention of
relevant authorities. To make special provision for the publicity code
in this instance would bring confusion to other order-making powers,
and is
unnecessary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071547000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0002.htm#13071547000047">Amendment
36 would build on Amendment 30 which, as I have said, would lengthen
the period a local authority might continue not to comply with the

move swiftly where there is an abuse of taxpayers’ money, I see
no reason to extend the 14-day

Amendment 37 would require that a direction must take into account
whether the authority has demonstrated to the external auditor that
acting outside the code is in the financial interests of the authority
to whom a possible direction may apply. This amendment would, I am
afraid, once again delay the process. Local authorities know when they
are spending too much money. In some circumstances, local authorities
can act outside the code and issue notices, leaflets and newsletters as
long as they are straightforward. I think that we will discuss that
later.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071547000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0002.htm#13071547000049">This is
also unnecessary. The provisions already allow local authorities to
make representations before a direction is made requiring them to
comply with the code. The 14 days does give them an opportunity to
comply. Those representations could include a view from the auditor if
the local authority wants it, but we would not require it. Taken as a
whole, we do not consider the amendments necessary. I do not suppose
that the noble Lord will be entirely reassured by what I have said but
we have other amendments and we will no doubt consider them even
further. I hope that from what I have said so far, the noble Lord will

I am surprised more than disappointed. The Minister will know that
these provisions are causing widespread alarm, much of which I believe
to be understandable but misplaced. I hope that in her further replies,
which she herself said she will have to make, she will give greater
reassurance on a number of the examples that I gave in moving the

raised at a meeting of the all-party group inquiry into electoral
conduct, to which I referred in Committee. Doubts have been expressed
about whether it would be possible for local authorities at any time,

statements that might apply to particular groups.</hs_para>

of some comfort to electoral officers and local authorities

likely that at some point local authorities will feel constrained to

Hanham:</Member></B> I am happy to confirm what I have written to the
noble Lord and I will read it out. The publicity code explicitly
provides for a local authority to correct or rebut misinformation,
making explicit provision in the sections about objectivity and care
during periods of heightened sensitivity. Moreover, it contains
provisions about equality and diversity, specifically allowing local
authority publicity to seek to influence the attitudes of local people
or public behaviour in relation to matters including equality,
diversity and community issues.</hs_para>

an election period, for example, local authorities may publish factual
material. A local authority should take care when issuing publicity and
should not be issuing publicity that seeks to influence voters.
However, this does not prevent an authority from fulfilling its role in
seeking positively to influence people in terms of equality and
diversity. Hence if there is disinformation in circulation promoting
harassment, a local authority may take action to correct it at election
time or indeed any other time. The provisions in the Bill do not change
the contents of the publicity code that have been agreed by Parliament.
Rather they give the Secretary of State the power to ensure that
taxpayers’ money is not being wasted by local authorities by
disregarding the publicity code. Nothing in the publicity code prevents

Beecham:</Member></B> My Lords, in the parallel universe occupied by
the Secretary of State, Pulitzer prize-style municipal correspondents
can no longer haunt the corridors of town halls, rigorously holding
local authority leaders and councils to account. They have now been
supplanted in his imagination by what he describes as 
<?notus-xml column=603?>“town hall <I>Pravda</I>s”. To adapt a phrase, it seems
that the local authority devil wears <I>Pravda</I>. In so doing, the
local civic newspapers disseminate propaganda at public
expense.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071547000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0002.htm#13071547000061">As
I have demonstrated, there is very little evidence to support any of
that, still less that the effect has been damaging to the local media.
On the contrary, local media have very consciously and over many years
withdrawn from reporting local government. I remember in the early
1980s, when I was leader of Newcastle City Council, urging the BBC to
appoint a local government correspondent. They had a very good reporter
there who has now made a national reputation, Mr Michael Blastland, who
covered local government and much else. That was rather unusual for a
local television and radio station, but it was not by any means a
full-time job and the idea did not seem to catch on.</hs_para>

point, the local papers in Newcastle, the <I>Journal</I> and the
<I>Evening Chronicle</I>—which, strange to say, my constituents
and those of the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, when he was a councillor and
leader of Newcastle City Council, were able to distinguish from the
city council newspapers occasionally distributed, contrary to what the
Government appear to think happens in the real world—apparently
decided that they would reduce the amount of coverage of local affairs.
They attended meetings and contacted members of the council, me and
others, less frequently.</hs_para>

them and made it nationally as well. The <I>Journal</I> in Newcastle,
the morning newspaper, said that it had conducted a survey and its
readers were not interested in local affairs. Therefore, it ceased to
be to any extent, a paper of record, which is what good newspapers
ought to be. It did this not because of competition from half a dozen
issues of Newcastle <I>City News</I> but because, in its judgment, the
readers were not interested. Some of us like to think that the virtue
of local media is that they seek to educate and inform the local
community. They have abdicated that responsibility; they have done it
of their own volition and it is ridiculous to suggest that that has
been caused by local authorities.</hs_para>

variety of issues that have been adduced to support the
Government’s position on the whole issue of a code of publicity

authorities. There is no evidence, as I have already reported, via the
National Union of Journalists, that it has had an impact on the
circulation of local papers and the decline of revenue. On the
contrary, there are many other explanations, which I will not rehearse
again. As for the other main argument, that there is a danger of
political abuse by some of these papers advocating a party line or
support of the authority in control of the local council, of course
that can and should be dealt with without a code, because it would be
unlawful as matters stand to conduct propaganda in that way.</hs_para>

considerable length the role of the auditors. The auditors have a
responsibility in this and other matters. They are entitled to look at
whether council expenditure, in the area of publicity, for example, is
lawful and appropriate. In addition, there are other sanctions that can
be applied including, in extremis I suppose, judicial review.
Therefore, both props of the

the hypocrisy of a Government that allows, possibly promotes, its Civil
Service spokesman to make statements using the personal pronoun.
Therefore, government spokesmen—not Ministers, or even MPs or
Peers—in the form, presumably, of press officers or civil

action on it”. It might be on welfare benefits or whatever. That
is a politicisation of the Civil Service that is a step too far. It
happens all too regularly. I do not say that it did not happen under
the previous Government. I cannot recall such events, but it may still
have happened. Under any Government, it is wrong for that to happen. If
that were to happen in local government, there would be a legitimate
outcry. It would be quite wrong for a chief executive or an officer of

opposed to saying that it is the council’s policy.</hs_para>

Hanham:</Member></hs_speaker> My Lords, the trouble with clause stand
part debates is that they tend to come after everything else has been
said. The danger is that one says it all over again. As I said, three
groups of amendments have all covered more or less the same ground. I
must ask the Chamber to forgive me if I cover some things that have
already been said. It is clear that the Government do not see the
situation in quite the same way as the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, has
laid out tonight, nor as the Local Government Association has seen it
in wanting all these provisions removed. We do not believe that should
happen. We accept, as I said, that the great majority of local
authorities will never breach the code. They will always do, and be
guided by, the right thing.</hs_para>

local authorities we already know are breaching the code. I have them.
I could do it, but I think it is probably not helpful. I hope noble
Lords will accept my assurance that at least a dozen are breaching them
at the moment. Either they are publishing publications, very
frequently, outside the terms, or they are including propaganda or
their own political statements. It is there and it is wrong; that is
not what was meant to happen. As I say, with legislation the
opportunity comes to try to put that right. Once again, it is putting
it right for a minority—I totally accept that—but put it
right we must. The Secretary of State is not taking very draconian
powers. If the Secretary of State would have to put a broad direction
out to a whole lot of authorities, we would be very worried about what
local authorities were doing. That

of this, as I have said right from the outset. The provisions are
necessary to make sure that taxpayers’ money is not abused; to
see that local authorities produce publicity, not propaganda; and to
ensure that local newspapers—which the noble Lord, Lord Beecham,
slightly downgrades—hold local government to account. They are
often full of what is going on; they are the proper means by which that
should be done. The provisions do not change the publicity code itself;
the guidance remains the same, allowing local authorities to
communicate effectively with their communities. However, the clause
provides the Secretary of State with the power to direct one or more
authorities, as I have said. The clause also sets out the procedure to
be followed, as we discussed—14 days’ notice
in writing—and provides for a direction to be modified or
withdrawn in

that these provisions are necessary. A recent Ofcom ruling criticised
one local authority for spending taxpayers’ money on political
advertising, which showed that weekly local newspapers are not the
limit of ambition, nor the limit of disregard, for a publicity code
agreed by Parliament. The provisions are balanced, because once a
Secretary of State gives notice of issuing a direction, the local
authority has the opportunity to make representations about the need
for that direction but has a default two weeks in which to do it. They
are sensible, because the clause, along with these provisions, includes
provision to withdraw or modify the
direction<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T20:00:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071547000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0002.htm#13071547000072">The
provisions give the Secretary of State the flexibility to make a
direction requiring compliance. As there is currently widespread
compliance, we hope and expect that these measures will not be
necessary, although effectively they may be. We are not opening the
door to action that could be detrimental to local authorities. As I
have said, if local authorities are complying with the publicity code,
they have nothing to fear. There is certainly nothing to prevent local
authorities combining to oppose something which is not in the interests

year as a councillor in 
<?notus-xml column=606?>Newcastle and have seen very successful journalists, now on the national
stage, cutting their teeth as municipal correspondents on both the
morning and evening papers in Newcastle. I have seen them coming to
council and committee meetings and telephoning and speaking to members
of the council, leaders and opposition leaders over the years. There
was then a gradual decline, from about the late 1980s. Journalists now
very rarely attend council meetings and hardly ever attend a scrutiny
meeting—a function that ought to be made more of in local
government and in the local media. As I understand it, they rarely
contact
officeholders.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071547000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0002.htm#13071547000076">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T20:09:28"></hs_TimeCode>
all agree that the local broadcast and print media should be informing
people and helping to hold local government, and indeed other public

they are not doing it because they are facing a cyclical decline as
they are overtaken by other forms of media, to which I fear most of us
are contributing these days on our BlackBerrys or iPads. The world has
moved on, which is unfortunate, and it seems entirely wrong that the
Government should seek to restrict what councils themselves can do to
explain what is happening to their communities in the way that is being
described. It would of course be wrong for them to use these
publications for political purposes; as I have already indicated, that
can and ought to be dealt with under existing audit procedures or
otherwise. However, it is clear that the Government are not going to

Government’s proposal—which, again, was not subjected to
scrutiny by the draft Bill committee—to introduce, effectively,
an element of retrospection into the question of whether a referendum
should be held. The Bill affects councils that have set council taxes
for 2013-14 that would have been excessive if the clause becomes law,
by virtue of the change that the Government are imposing in relation to
levies by other organisations. Fortunately, it turns out that only a
small number of authorities would be affected by the
Government’s proposals. Those authorities are
Wandsworth—an authority well known to the noble Baroness and
other noble Lords—Bolton, Bury, Manchester, Oldham, Rochdale,
Stockport and Tameside. There is clearly a clutch around the Greater
Manchester area, which presumably relates to some joint organisation in
that area which collects a levy. Why Wandsworth should be affected, I
really cannot say, although that does not really
matter<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T20:07:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Minister indicated that councils had been notified by, I think, 31
January, that this might happen. However, that is a very late stage in
the budget-making process, and it would have been very difficult at
that stage to have reduced their council tax to the level which, if the
Government were to apply the new rules, would have been operative. I
repeat that the problem is not about the council’s own budget,
it is about the levy imposed by other organisations. Had it been a
precepting authority, the precepting authority itself could have had to
call and finance a referendum on its own
budget.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071547000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0002.htm#13071547000079">Many<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T20:09:28"></hs_TimeCode>
of us are extremely unhappy about the whole concept of these compulsory
referendums, which of course do not apply when the Government increases
taxes, with a considerably greater effect on the household budget than
a corresponding increase in council tax. A 2% VAT increase takes a lot
more out of people’s pockets than a 2%, or even slightly higher,
council tax increase. Be that as it may, the effect is curiously
different between a levying body and a precepting body; a levying body
simply passes the cost on. The total amount of money is not enormous
and would seem to amount to some £7.3 million. If the councils
had been able to reduce their council tax to match the levy that they
have had to impose, that would have been the cost to them, to be taken
out of services. Nevertheless, it is a significant encroachment and, of
course, if that were now to trigger a referendum—because the
referendum limit becomes lower in future and councils may feel that
they have to go for one—the cost of that, across these
authorities, is likely to be pretty much the amount of the total levy
across all those authorities. It is a bizarre situation. Given that it
is now clear that it applies only to a very small number of
authorities, in one particular cluster—in what, by the look of
it, must be the special circumstances of Greater Manchester—I
hope that the Government will reconsider this

suppose the Government do not have to apply the provisions of the Bill.
If they do not want to amend the Bill and they want to reserve the
power, so be it, but I strongly urge the Minister to think again about
imposing this. It is wrong in principle, and it is an unnecessary
reaction to what turns out in any event to have been a pretty small
problem in terms of the number of authorities and the cash affected. It
would be a statesmanlike move on the part of the Government to accept
that perhaps, in the circumstances, they rather overreacted, fearing
worse than has actually transpired, and to indicate that at the very
least they would reconsider whether to proceed with the implementation

Beecham. I think it is bad policy to backdate the definition of an
excessive council tax rise so that it includes a levy from April 2013.
I understand that in January this year letters were sent out to local
authorities, suggesting that the Government might take this course of
action. I will say two things about that. The first is that it is
simply not enough notice. 
<?notus-xml column=608?>Council tax-setting takes much longer than just a few weeks. There is a
requirement that council tax is effectively set by the beginning of
March, so that bills are can be sent out. In my view, given the lengthy

second reason for objecting to the Bill as it stands is that one should
have respect for the law at the time at which the law is applied. I
believe that councils and levying authorities abided by the law at the
time. As the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, quite rightly pointed out, it is
a comparatively small problem. Retrospective change, whether or not
there was a warning, seems to me to be wrong in principle, and should
therefore be resisted. The noble Lord, Lord Beecham, said that he felt
that the Government was overreacting. I concur with that, because I
believe that it is an overreaction to backdate in the way the
Government
propose.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071547000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0002.htm#13071547000083"><B><Member ContinuationText="The Earl of Lytton" PimsId="1589" UID="13071547000298" xid="2156" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0002.htm#13071547000298">The

43, I would like to voice my support for the point that has just been
made, and was also made by the noble Lord, Lord Beecham,
about the undesirability of retrospection. Notwithstanding the comments
made by the Minister at a previous stage of the Bill, there
is no question in my mind that Clause 39(15) and (16) are,
beyond peradventure, retroactive in their effects. Apart from the
self-evident difficulties that that will create within the continuum of
local government finance, one supposes that there must be some reason
why this has been put in the Bill. I would like to enquire what that
reason is, because to date we seem to have had reassurance that there
is no intention that this should be retrospective. I do not wish to
work out how many angels dance on the head of a pin between
retrospection and retroactivity, but I prefer the term
“retroactive”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071547000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0002.htm#13071547000084">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T20:16:31"></hs_TimeCode>
seems to me that this is almost calculatedly destabilising, and I
cannot believe that that was really the intention. It seems to me that
there is a necessity for some further words of qualification, so that
the clause is targeted at whichever particular issue needs it, and it
is not capable of any sort of generic destabilisation of previous years
of local government finance settled business, or what should be settled
business. I hope the noble Baroness will be able to give an

Hanham:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendments 42 and 43 would remove
subsections (15) and (16) from Clause 39. Amendment 45
allows for transitional provisions to be made in respect of previous
arrangements or contracts entered into prior to 2013-14. As noble Lords
have said, subsections (15) and (16) are not linked and they fulfil
different purposes. However, I understand that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T20:15:50"></hs_TimeCode> noble Lord,
Lord Tope, originally tabled these to address a single concern,
although he has not spoken
tonight<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T20:16:01"></hs_TimeCode>. It was
made clear in Committee by the noble Lord, Lord Tope, and now the noble
Lords, Lord Beecham and Lord Shipley, that Clause 39 and
subsection (15) in particular have a retrospective effect,
and that the clause would be impractical and councils would have
insufficient time to take account of the changes.</hs_para>

respect to the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, I must restate the
Government’s disagreement with this view. Neither the clause nor
subsection (15) is retrospective. They do not interfere with the
council tax and levies set last year. Those increases have been made
and are in authorities’ tax base for future
years.</hs_para>

allows the Secretary of State—should he so choose—to set
a referendum principle for 2014-15 focusing on authorities where the
council tax, including levies, increased by a large amount in 2013-14.
The Secretary of State will consider whether he wishes to do this later
in the year as part of the usual round of principle-setting.
Authorities and levying bodies will have an opportunity to make
representations on principles, which will be put to the other place for
approval.</hs_para>

authorities will have the opportunity to set an overall increase in
council tax and levies in excess of the principles, making the case to
the local population in a referendum if that is where they need to go.
If noble Lords work it out—as I think the noble Lord, Lord
Beecham, has done—they will find that very few authorities are
likely to be affected because the combination of the levies and the
council tax potentially gives a bigger pot for the percentage
increase.</hs_para>

approach proposed in the clause is entirely consistent with previous
and current practice. Perhaps I may go back to the unhappy word of
capping. As part of the setting referendum principles, the Secretary of
State considers all relevant factors. These always include council tax
decisions taken by authorities in previous years. It is worth
highlighting that 2012-13 and 2014-15 have been the only two years
since the 1980s when levies have not been part of excessiveness
considerations. We are simply reverting to the definition of
excessiveness used by successive Governments from 1984 to 2010. This
approach resulted in some smaller authorities with a history of lower
council tax being set more generous referendum principles in 2013-14.
No one accused the Government of taking retrospective action when they
took this
approach.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071547000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0002.htm#13071547000090">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T20:18:28"></hs_TimeCode>

them. His speech to the New Local Government Network and his Written
Statement of 30 January 2013, and letters to all authorities, could
have left them in no doubt as to the possibility. Council tax and

ensuring that all the money raised through council tax is potentially
subject to a referendum if it is in excess of the principles. At
present, there are areas where more than 50% of the local council tax

remove subsection (16) from the clause. It may be helpful for me to
explain the purpose of that subsection, which is not, as noble Lords
have already admitted, directly linked in purpose with subsection (15).
To be able to determine whether an excessive increase has been set in
2014-15, all authorities will need to make a like-for-like comparison
between the council tax in 2014-15 and that set in the previous year.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T20:21:14"></hs_TimeCode> principles
will be based on an amount including levies in the next year, so the
removal of the provision would not be helpful for many local
authorities. It would mean that their previous year’s relevant
basic amount of council tax would be at a much lower level than that of
the subsequent year, against which it was being compared.
Subsection<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T20:21:38"></hs_TimeCode> (16)
simply means that the 2014-15 figure can be compared with the one for
2013-14, which includes the levies that were set for that year. Without
subsection (16), authorities would be effectively required to compare
apples with pears, and the whole clause would be unworkable. I am sure
that that was not the noble Lord’s

45 replicates one which was proposed in Committee, so I shall expand on
the response that I made then. The issue here is city deals and the
levies that are envisaged by combined authorities in future years
following the agreement between the Government and local authorities,
particularly in West Yorkshire. The city deal implementation plan
agreed between government and the Leeds City Region included the
following summary

have looked at these figures carefully. These levy amounts would
produce a council tax increase in Bradford of 0.7% in 2014-15, falling

figures apply across authorities in West Yorkshire. There is
therefore no need for any transitional or other provisions to be made
for contracts already entered into, as the levies envisaged by the
authorities in the Leeds city deal area are substantially below the
current 2% referendum threshold. I therefore hope that the

have a system which takes no account of levies, you change that system
weeks before the statutory date for the budget so that the levy in that
year can be taken into account in settling a referendum limit for the
following year—and yet that is not considered retrospective. I
seem to speak a different language from the Minister and the

is a complicated matter for authorities. The noble Baroness referred to
the city deal in West Yorkshire. This was entered into months before
the budget. The Minister, with respect, rather airily dismisses the
impact of the potential application of the principle in terms of the

in the area. It will gradually build up a contribution until it reaches
£15.5 million. That represents a council tax increase of 0.2%,
then 1% in 2015-16 and 0.7% per annum right up to 2022-23; 0.7% is a
third of the referendum increase threshold. That is quite a substantial
chunk, given the pressures that we all know are—and will
continue to be—visited on local authorities, as envisaged by the
LGA. The Minister’s successor by one or two as leader of
Kensington and Chelsea is, of course, the LGA’s chair. As a
percentage it does not sound large, but as a percentage of what is

28% rate that we inherited. However, we want to do more to relieve the
tax burden on business. Clauses 4 and 6 will reduce the main rate of

MacGregor of Pulham Market:</Member></B> My Lords, I am very pleased to
introduce the report of the sub-committee of the Economic Affairs
Committee on the draft Finance Bill 2013. In the time available, it is
right that I should focus not on the Finance Bill as a whole, tempted
though I am to do so, but on our report, much of which is technical but
nonetheless important for that. Indeed, my noble friend has referred to
the three measures

always, we had to work at speed. I am grateful to our witnesses,
professional and official, to Bill Sinton, our committee clerk, and his
team, and to our special advisers Trevor Evans and Tony Orhnial, who
served us well in previous years and have done so again, not least
because of their expert knowledge and experience of HMRC and Finance
Bills. I should also like to thank my fellow members of the
sub-committee for their knowledge and wisdom, their objective approach
and their speedy and intensive
work<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T20:38:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071547000121" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0003.htm#13071547000121">I
particularly want to emphasise an important and, as it turned out, for
us valuable change this year, to which my noble friend has just
referred. In December 2010, the Government introduced a new approach to
tax policy-making which set out a number of stages at which
consultation should be undertaken. It involved a draft of the Finance
Bill being published in December, some three months before it was laid
before Parliament.
This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T20:37:39"></hs_TimeCode> was a very
welcome change from many points of view, not least the work of the
sub-committee. In previous years, we could start our work only after
the Finance Bill had been published. Therefore, we had to work in great
haste to have any influence at all on the debates in the other place.
Inevitably it was always late in the day. However, outside
commentators, including 
<?notus-xml column=615?>most chartered accountancy and taxation bodies and one former Treasury
Minister, had frequently alluded to the expertise in our committee and
the more useful role it could
perform.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071547000122" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0003.htm#13071547000122">Consequent
to this new approach, this House revised the terms of reference of the
sub-committee so that it could start its work earlier in the year and
examine the provisions of the draft Finance Bill. The draft Finance
Bill was published in December 2012 and we began our inquiry in January
2013. Starting earlier provided us with the opportunity to influence
the content of the Finance Bill as published, as well as the Committee
stage debates in the House of Commons.</hs_para>

the shortage of time, the sub-committee has to focus and this year it
examined three topics concerned with the avoidance of tax: the general
anti-abuse rule, or GAAR; the annual residential property tax, later
renamed the annual tax on enveloped dwellings; and the cap on the
availability of certain reliefs. I can touch on only some of the main
points.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071547000124" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0003.htm#13071547000124">The
sub-committee devoted the majority of its time to the general
anti-abuse rule, which is a radical approach to countering the
avoidance of tax. The GAAR is narrowly targeted at abusive transactions
that fail a stringent “double reasonableness” test; the
provisions also include the formation of an advisory panel to agree
guidance and give its opinion on the application of the double
reasonableness test to a given set of tax arrangements. It followed the
recommendations of what became known as the Aaronson study.</hs_para>

the narrow GAAR a “reasonable starting point” but
recommended a wider post-implementation review after five years, which
would look in particular at how the double reasonableness test had been
applied in practice, and its deterrent effect. We thought it important
that it be made clear to the press and the wider public that the GAAR
would not apply to structural issues involving the taxation of
multinational groups. These have to be dealt with by reviewing the
international tax rules in fora such as the G8, the G20, the OECD and
the EU. We argued that the Government need to communicate much more
clearly what the GAAR can and cannot achieve.</hs_para>

report in March, there has been a huge amount of publicity and debate
in Parliament and the press about corporate tax avoidance among
multinational companies, with the spotlight on Google, Starbucks and
Amazon—not least from the Public Accounts Committee in the other
place. Of course, we welcomed—and our report argued
for—the lead given by the Prime Minister and the British
Government at the recent G8 summit and the decisions taken there. It is
important to recognise that the GAAR is only a small part of that and
the two are in many ways
separate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071547000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0003.htm#13071547000127">I
should add that having dealt with Scottish independence, in the spring

agreed with our witnesses on the importance of guidance from HMRC and
the advisory panel on how the GAAR would apply to particular
transactions. We 
<?notus-xml column=616?>recognised that progress was being made in drafting this guidance but we
remained concerned that our witnesses felt that it was far from
acceptable as it stood at the time of our inquiry. We thought it
important for the guidance to include as many examples as possible,
illustrating up-to-date arrangements on both sides of the boundary
between abusive and
non-abusive.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071547000129" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0003.htm#13071547000129">We
also thought it important for the advisory panel to have a balance of
views and we recommended that the opinions of the panel on whether
proposed tax planning schemes are caught by the GAAR should be
publicised so that taxpayers can see how the GAAR is being applied.
There were also concerns about the application of the GAAR to
inheritance tax planning transactions, and a specific concern
concerning the imposition of the charge where adjustments arose from
the application of the
GAAR.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071547000130" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0003.htm#13071547000130">The
Finance Bill as published on 28 March was redrafted to deal with the
point concerning the imposition of the charge and we were pleased to
see this. The finalised guidance was published on 15 April and had been
very substantially redrafted, consistent with the recommendations in
our report. There was specific recognition that the GAAR could not
apply to most structural international tax planning, and the number of
examples had doubled, including an increase in the number of
inheritance tax
examples.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071547000131" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0003.htm#13071547000131">In
the Commons debate on the GAAR, our report was quoted with approval.
The Opposition had tabled an amendment to require a post-implementation
review after two years. I have ploughed through all the <I>Hansard</I>s
of the Commons in relation to these issues and have noted the number of
times that our report was commented on. The Government rejected the
requirement to have a post-implementation review after two years,
arguing that a two-year period was too short. We agree with this.
However, while we welcome the Government’s acceptance that the
operation of the GAAR will need to be monitored carefully, we continue
to believe it necessary to set a timeframe for such a review,
notwithstanding the difficulties that the Exchequer Secretary
highlighted at Report stage in the Commons. Our report had suggested
five years and we recommend that with a change as important as this the
Government should commit themselves to a post-implementation review
around the five-year
point.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071547000132" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0003.htm#13071547000132">The
application of the GAAR to the sorts of multinational company
tax-planning issues to which I have referred was raised by several
Members of Parliament. The tendency to promote the GAAR as a panacea
for dealing with the problem of tax avoidance was deplored and we agree
with that. “The valuable scrutiny” of the Bill provided
by our report was commended. Building on this, the need for the
taxation of multinational groups to be tackled in international fora
was discussed in the debate on the GAAR and other clauses, including at
Report stage. As we know, at the G8 summit the Prime Minister and other
G8 leaders set the ball rolling by asking the OECD to draft a template
for multinational companies to report the tax that they pay in each of
the jurisdictions in which they
operate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071547000133" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0003.htm#13071547000133">It is
important that this first step is treated as urgent and that the
momentum achieved at the G8 is maintained. We argued for that in our
report. The need for the 
<?notus-xml column=617?>advisory panel to have a wide balance of views was discussed in the
Commons debates and the Exchequer Secretary assured the House that the
panel would be broadly based and have commercial expertise to provide
reassurance that the GAAR would not be abused, with too much power
being placed in the hands of a part of the Executive. We welcome that
too.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071547000134" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0003.htm#13071547000134">The
annual tax on enveloped dwellings is part of a package of measures to
address stamp duty land tax avoidance by using companies to buy
expensive residential properties, a practice known as
“enveloping”. We agreed with our witnesses that the
Government’s proposals might have been more appropriately
designed had they consulted interested parties at the outset, but we
recognised that once consultation was under way, the Government
responded to the need to exempt certain businesses and other
organisations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071547000135" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0003.htm#13071547000135">We
remained concerned about the relief for farm houses and thought that
this needed further work. We shared the concern of witnesses about the
practical workability of this tax and encouraged HMRC to set out in
detail how it would implement the provisions and we recommended a
review of its operation after three years. We thought that further work
was needed on the capital gains charges on de-enveloping properties. We
agreed with a widespread concern about whether the problem that the
legislation sought to address justified its length and
complexity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071547000136" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0003.htm#13071547000136">The
Finance Bill as published responded to the need for further work on the
relief for farm houses and the two clauses implementing this were
substantially redrafted. Our concerns around the length and complexity
of the legislation were not alleviated by what appeared in the Finance
Bill as published. Much of Part 3 of the Bill is devoted to this
particular tax. Some 107 pages involving 84 clauses and four schedules
is hardly tax
simplification.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071547000137" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0003.htm#13071547000137">Finally,
on the cap on income tax reliefs, our report expressed concern about
the potentially adverse effects of limiting relief for genuine trading
losses and recommended a review of the potential impact of this measure
in time to inform the Finance Bill debates in the House of Commons. It
was disappointing that the Government did not respond to this
recommendation. However, the measure’s impact on businesses,
particularly smaller ones, was raised in the debates in the Commons. We
continue to believe that it is important to monitor carefully the
potential disadvantage to small businesses of restricting relief for
genuine trading and other losses so that remedial steps can be taken if
this proves to be a
problem.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071547000138" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0003.htm#13071547000138">In
conclusion, we were gratified by the extent to which the
recommendations in our report were acted on by the Government and also
informed the Finance Bill debates in the Commons. We continue to
believe it important that the effect of these measures is
assessed by way of systematic and independent
post-implementation reviews. It is our view that a commitment to carry
out post-implementation reviews is as important as the
Government’s very welcome commitment in their new approach to
tax policy-making to consult on the design and implementation of a
measure.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13071547000139" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0003.htm#13071547000139">To
sum up, I believe that the new system overall has proved its worth and
that it makes even more relevant the work of the sub-committee on
Finance Bills of the

consultation with all the many relevant companies, private sector
experts and tax and accountancy committees, not least through the
medium of our committee, and it gives the House the opportunity to make
recommendations to the other place in a timely manner, not, as in the

Wakeham:</Member></B> My Lords, my noble friend Lord MacGregor has said
in his usual clear way virtually all that needs to be said about our
report, so I want to add very little. I would like to reflect for a few
minutes on the process by which Parliament approves Finance Bills and
how it has changed over the years. I have been involved in Finance
Bills, year by year, for some 40 years, sometimes as a Minister in the
Treasury, sometimes in opposition and sometimes as a Back-Bench
supporter of the Government. In some ways things have improved and in
some ways they have not, but there really is nothing more important in
the parliamentary year than the granting of supply to the
Government<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T20:51:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071547000141" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0003.htm#13071547000141">Many
years ago, when I had some responsibility for these matters, one of the
things that I tried to get agreement to was two annual finance Bills,
one at this time of year dealing with rates of tax and major matters
and one in the autumn to deal with technical and other smaller matters
that otherwise get crowded out. For a number of reasons we were never
able to get agreement to that and I do not think it has been pursued
since, but it is an improvement that ought to be reconsidered. As a
result, the passage of the Finance Bill is done mainly in a bit of a
rush just before we rise for the
summer<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T20:52:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

year is that we have a draft Bill, which is an excellent innovation.
The Minister has given us a good account of it and I
congratulate him on what he said. What has also changed substantially
in those 40 years is the ministerial representation in the House of
Lords. For many years, under both Governments, we did not have a
Treasury Minister in the House. That has now changed, and very good
Ministers they have been, but quite often we did not have
one.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13071547000143" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0003.htm#13071547000143">I recall
one instance when I was Leader of the House, when a Minister not in the
Treasury made a very good speech from the Dispatch Box introducing the
Finance Bill. Something made me ask to see the briefing that he had

was appalled. I put it in a brown paper bag and sent it to the
Permanent Secretary, saying, “If you think this is the briefing
a Minister in the Lords should be given to introduce your Finance Bill,
it’s not my idea”. I got a very good letter of apology
from him and I think that things have improved since, although of
course now we also have Ministers who are able to look after
themselves. Still, I hope that the message was received loud and clear
in the Treasury that in this House there are many noble Lords who are
more experienced than many Members of the House of Commons, and that
that experience ought to be
used<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T20:53:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

always treated on their merits; sometimes they get caught up in a wider

levy from opting in to opting out. We were told that if this was true,

government Chief Whip at the time and I knew this not to be true. I
eventually managed to persuade the Opposition that it was not true, and
the then opposition Chief Whip claimed credit for the whole thing. He
had persuaded the Government not to go ahead with their proposal, but
he had to agree to give us the Finance Bill in, I believe, one week,
which was the object of the exercise in the first place. It was a great
victory for their wonderful Chief Whip. The concession was given. The
whole purpose of the exercise was to get a very difficult and
dispirited Opposition into some sort of order and disciplined enough to
pass the Finance Bill, with proper scrutiny but no filibustering, and
to get both Houses up before the Summer Recess. I will not mention the

things change and some stay the same. One thing that has changed, of

disapproved of it and did what he could to get rid of us because he did
not approve of the House of Lords having any say on taxation matters.
He was quite wrong. The House of Lords, of course, has an absolute
right to discuss and debate Finance Bills in any way it wishes. What we
do not have the right to do is to amend or delay them. The terms of
reference under which the sub-committee operates are a self-denying
ordinance that we, as the House of Lords, have imposed on the

often detailed suggestions that will make the legislation work better.
One part of our work that I find particularly valuable is the hearing

year our deliberations on the so-called GAAR—the general
anti-abuse rule—were especially important. We thought that the
Government were right to bring this in, but it was never going to be
able to solve all the problems of what we now call aggressive tax
avoidance. We explain ourselves in some detail in our report, but I
will make a further suggestion to HMRC to tackle these matters. Each
new rule sets off clever people to think of ways to avoid it, and the
more specific the rule, in some ways the easier it is to find a way
around it. I was brought up in a different age, when “true and
fair” were the watchwords. In a way, the GAAR seeks to replace
them. However, the more we can relate our 
<?notus-xml column=620?>taxation, and particularly tax planning, so that the taxpayer is under
an obligation to demonstrate that the records of the enterprise to be
taxed show a “true and fair” view of what has been going
on, the sooner aggressive tax avoidance will become yesterday’s
problem. Years ago, in the Ramsay case in the House of Lords, which was
a very special case, the courts gave a very clear signal that they
would support that straightforward way of looking at things. The
Government have certainly made a start in these matters, but there is
still a long way to

achieved and the consensus that existed right across those from
different political parties and on the Cross Benches. Like the noble
Lord, Lord MacGregor, I emphasise that the work we looked at,
particularly on the GAAR, does not cover international and
multinational tax abuse. It does not cover issues such as forms of
avoidance by deferring income from one year to another, as that is not
its purpose. We have to emphasise that, as so often friendly

more effective in partnership with specific rules in managing the
constant attempts of companies to find mechanisms around attempts to
get them to pay their fair share of tax, we will need to start to think
through whether or not we should consider an anti-avoidance GAAR. Like
many others—I notice that the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, who spoke

am one of those who are somewhat concerned by the narrowness of the
GAAR, not because it is anti-abuse but because we have the double
reasonableness test. I understand where the Government are coming from
in introducing such a test, but I have two concerns. One is that there
is quite a lot of deference by the Government to the accounting
profession. It would be wise sometimes to be more cynical and
challenging to that profession around these issues. Also, if it is
taken to its extreme so that nothing is ever an abuse because somebody
can always come up with a reason as to why it has some economic basis,
this whole exercise will have been in vain. Therefore we need to look
at the application; that is a very particular vulnerability, and one in

move quickly to the issues around stamp duty, land tax avoidance and
the annual residential property tax which we also examined. I know the
legislation is complex, but I believe that it is a crucial step. For
many people the unfairness of watching those with very large and
expensive properties avoiding the stamp duty and the inheritance tax
that they bear on their smaller properties has tended to undermine the
sense of common bond that is necessary in our tax system. My concern is
less about what is in the legislation than the fact that, as yet, it
does not capture some of those opportunities for abuse—for
example, the use of the Cayman Islands for trusts and companies that
have also been used by those seeking to avoid those kind of taxes. If I

other item in the Finance Bill that I will talk about probably needs

unintended consequences could mean that entrepreneurs are restricted in
what they do at a time when we need businesses to flourish, and young
businesses in particular to grow and invest. It would be perverse to
bring in something that could involve an individual facing a tax bill

have seen the evidence put forward by the Chartered Institute of
Taxation, which is deeply concerned about how this may work. In the

Deighton:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank all noble Lords for their
excellent and insightful contributions. I will do my best to respond to
them. Let me take first the attack of the noble Lord, Lord Davies, on
current government policy. When I entered the Treasury I found myself
confronted with the financial
state<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> which this
Government inherited from the previous Government. I find it quite
difficult to know where to begin in comparing and contrasting a
government strategy which left this nation financially on its knees
with the steady and consistent plan which this Government have put in
place to recover the
situation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071547000196" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-0003.htm#13071547000196">This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T21:39:29"></hs_TimeCode>
Government have succeeded in reducing the deficit by a third, and have
the confidence of international markets. This Government have put in
place a growth strategy in terms of reducing taxes, and making sure
that this is an economy in which investors want to invest and companies
want to grow. This is the basis for sustained improvement in the decade
to come. I agree that issues on infrastructure need addressing. This is
because over generations—I think that this really applies to
many previous Governments—we have not put in place the long-term
approach to sorting out the economic infrastructure that was needed.
This Government deserve credit for actually taking the right long-term
steps to sort that out, which I hope will put in place a regime that
will work very effectively for many years ahead.</hs_para>

me get to the specifics of this particular debate and the Finance Bill.
The Bill reflects the Government’s continuing commitment to
making tax policy in a transparent manner through improved
consultation. Many measures in the Bill have been subject to extensive
consultation and scrutiny. I take great comfort from the
comments at large that the consultation process has been
extraordinarily effective. My noble friends
Lord<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> MacGregor
and Lord<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> Wakeham
made the point that we gave the Committee the
ability to look at the draft and at the changes we put in
place. I think that that is progress all round, which we should
enjoy. That robust approach to making tax policy
ensures that we can effectively legislate to restore the economy to
growth and address the enormous deficit that was inherited. This
Finance Bill is part of our plan to put the country on the right path
through supporting enterprise, helping families and ensuring that
everybody pays their fair share of
tax<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T21:39:51"></hs_TimeCode>. Part of
this plan includes the biggest ever cash increase in the income tax
personal allowance, as my noble friend Lady Kramer noted. In her view,
that was the most important part of the Bill.</hs_para>

we also take firm action against those who do not pay their fair share
of tax. There has been quite a detailed discussion of GAAR in this
evening’s debate. Given the amount of consultation that has gone
on around it and the debate that we have had, I am not sure that there
is much more I can add. Insightful comments on it were made by my noble
friends Lady Wheatcroft and Lady Kramer and the 
<?notus-xml column=630?>noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria. GAAR is part of an overall approach and
works together with specific tax rules. It does not attempt to address
the broader question of the tax behaviour of big multinational
companies, which I think we all agree and understand needs to be dealt
with through international collaboration. I am proud to be part of a
Government who are leading on that issue. We will hear later this week
the OECD’s proposals to the G20 to move forward on these issues
following up on the ball that we rolled into play at the recent G8
meeting, so that is well under

when we should review GAAR, we rejected the two-year suggestion. On
whether five is the right number, the Government reserve the right to
keep all taxes under review. I agree with the general sentiment that
the way this works needs to be bedded into the system and therefore
needs particularly careful management. Overall, I think that the
Government’s approach of driving down taxes generally to make
this economy more productive, and avoiding the Winston Churchill
problem of the man in the bucket, is the right one. Combining that with
our rigorous approach to the collection of taxes that are due is
exactly the right balance for this age. I wish that our predecessors
had got to grips with those two important issues much earlier so that
we did not have to deal with them right from basics now.</hs_para>

Enterprise Investment Scheme, the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme and

crime, with particular reference to their interaction with the criminal
justice system and its agencies. The panel was also to offer views on
the prevention of crime from a victim’s perspective. The
Secretary of State was required to consult the panel on appropriate

effective way of ensuring that the views of victims are sought and can
influence the development of justice policy. During her tenure, the
previous commissioner, Louise Casey, met and received correspondence
from hundreds of victims who shared their views and experiences. She
used this feedback to inform her advice to government, including
reports and a review of the needs of families bereaved by
homicide.</hs_para>

commissioners. For that matter, all of us who heard it were deeply
moved by the speech made by the noble Baroness, Lady Newlove, on these

the Explanatory Notes to the order the Government cite three criteria

including a requirement for political impartiality. Having said that,
and I repeat that this is no reflection on the noble Baroness, I find
that a slightly surprising conclusion in respect of this position
because there are potentially significant issues in this area, such as
restorative justice, community sentencing, which is now very much part
of the political debate under the Offender Rehabilitation Bill, and
criminal injuries compensation, which is a sensitive political issue
where changes were recently made. No doubt the commission will comment
on all these in due course. However, despite the unique qualifications
of the noble Baroness, it might be thought to be better in future

approached the commissioner—it e-mailed her—and got a

enough. The caller repeated that the issue had not been commented on,
and matters were left there. However, it turns out that the person at
the other end of the phone was a press officer at the Ministry of
Justice. This gives rise to the question whether the staffing and
support for the commissioner—any commissioner, not just the

it raises the issue that future appointments need to be considered. The
way in which resources are made available to the present commissioner
might be looked at again, given that she may feel on called from time

McNally:</Member></B> My Lords, I am slightly surprised that the noble
Lord raised the question of political appointments, even in the terms
in which he couched his remarks. I find it extraordinary that somehow
we back away from making appointments from the rich vein of political
talent that is in the House. The idea that someone has to be
politically neutral to be a victims’ commissioner is, I think,
absurd. I can think of some likely Members on Labour Benches, including
the noble Lord, who would make an excellent victims’
commissioner. The noble Lord is tempting me to express my views on the
Cross-Benchers. I have always said that I find it extraordinary that
people can reach 60 or 70 years of age without deciding about their
political opinions, but that goes way beyond this brief.</hs_para>

Lady<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T15:48:12"></hs_TimeCode> Newlove, we
have somebody who has tragic personal experience but beyond that has

within the MoJ family various bodies that carry out independent and
arm’s-length functions. How we handle that is important. We must

basic point is that we have already brought forward a range of measures

vulnerable and intimidated victims and witnesses to help them give
their best evidence in
court<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T15:50:24"></hs_TimeCode>. As I have
said, the appointment of the noble Baroness, Lady Newlove, as
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T15:50:24"></hs_TimeCode>

understand that the noble Baroness has Press Office support as
victims’ commissioner and has a dedicated press officer who
works part-time. However, that press officer is based in the MoJ.
Whether that has caused the confusion or the call was from part of the
MoJ press team, I do not know; I have only just heard the point made.
The press support which the noble Baroness will receive is fully
independent of the MoJ, although it is within our building. I
appreciate the noble Lord’s point—it will be duly
recorded and pondered upon—and I am grateful for his more
general support for this action. I commend the order to the

Faulkner of Worcester:</Member></B> My Lords, the short speech I was
planning to make has changed dramatically as a result of the
Minister’s opening speech, which I very much welcome. I was
going to raise the conflict of interest between the Gambling Commission
and the National Lottery Commission, an issue which the Secondary
Legislation Scrutiny Committee picked up on and which I referred to
during Committee on the Public Bodies Bill in March 2011. I made the
point that from the inception of the National Lottery, the National
Lottery Commission has operated with an inherent conflict of interest
in that, as the Minister said, it is required to maximise the return
for good causes but at the same time is supposed to protect
players’ interests. I do not believe that the National Lottery
Commission has, up to now, succeeded in doing that.</hs_para>

this during Committee  on the Public Bodies Bill, I expressed
the hope that  the merger of the two bodies would be resolved
in future. The Minister was not quite right to say that  the
previous Administration had supported this  merger. The Joint
Committee on the draft Gambling Bill supported it, but the Government
of the time unfortunately rejected the merger of the two bodies. To
avoid wearying the Committee now, I will not quote what Lord McIntosh
said for the Government on that occasion about those being two
different jobs.</hs_para>

carefully to what the Minister said about how in future this conflict
will be resolved. I want to read carefully what he has said, but the
objections that I raised in March 2011 on the Public Bodies Bill seem
substantially to have been met by what he has said this afternoon. I
would like just one assurance, if he is able to give it to me: that he
feels that the resources available to the Gambling Commission will be
sufficient to do this job properly, because along with the obvious need
for the National Lottery to be a
success<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T16:03:00"></hs_TimeCode>, player

Jones of Whitchurch:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister very
much for his explanation of the order. I also thank him for the helpful
information that he sent in advance of the debate, including the letter
from Hugh Robertson to the chair of the Gambling Commission. I will
return to that letter and that issue
shortly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307159000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-gc0001.htm#1307159000047">First,
I make the more general point that I understand that much of the
impetus for this merger is to save money, and I do not doubt that there
are savings to be made. I know that the House of Commons Culture, Media
and Sport Select Committee report questioned the figures provided and
felt that the overall savings should be greater. It is of course
incumbent on any organisation in receipt of public money to spend that
money wisely. I hope that the Gambling Commission will be held to
account for this expenditure in due
course.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307159000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-gc0001.htm#1307159000048">However,
I will not focus on the financial implications as I want to explore
other, more pressing issues with the Minister this afternoon. We share
the growing concern that gambling is running out of control. The
spiralling rise of online gambling, now a £2 billion a year
industry, risks damaging the health and well-being of a generation. We
already know that nearly 1 million people are in danger of becoming
problem gamblers and that there are already 500,000 hard-core addicts.
Meanwhile, one of the Gambling Commission’s clear functions is
already to protect children and vulnerable adults from being harmed or
exploited by gambling, so by most measures it would appear that it is
failing in that task. In that context, we need to be satisfied that the
proposed merger is in the public interest and that the new, merged
Gambling Commission is fit for purpose in the light of this crisis.
Therefore, I should like to ask the Minister some
questions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T16:04:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1307159000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-gc0001.htm#1307159000049">First, is there a danger
that we are rushing  this decision without giving the proposal
adequate consideration? The Commons Select Committee  that
considered this matter made two important recommendations, which need
to be addressed before 
<?notus-xml column=202?>a final decision is made. Regrettably, I do not think that Hugh
Robertson’s letter adequately addresses these issues. I take the
point that we have had very little time to consider that letter. For
example, the Select Committee recommended that the Gambling Commission
outline the governance arrangements that it will put in place to ensure
that there is a robust separation of its duties to oversee the lottery
and gambling organisations to avoid the conflicts of interest to which
my noble friend referred. It recommended that the details be published
by the Gambling Commission in time for consideration of the order in
this House. I agree that this information would have been extremely
useful if it had been before us today, but it does not seem to have
been provided by the Gambling Commission, unless my internet searches
have failed on this
occasion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T16:06:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

believe that its original suggestion that it would set up a
sub-committee  to deal with lottery issues is adequate to
address  the governance issues. The Select Committee also
recommended that the DCMS outline what steps it would take to monitor
the Gambling Commission’s execution of its combined duties and
what action it proposed to take if it was seen not to be acting
even-handedly. I understand that Hugh Robertson’s letter is
intended to address this issue by setting out what the DCMS would like
to see in the management agreement with the Gambling Commission.
However, we have not seen the response to Hugh Robertson’s
letter from the Gambling Commission, and I should like to hear what it
has to say on the
matter<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T16:06:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Minister also asked the Gambling Commission to put his letter on its
website in time for this debate, but at midday today I could not find
it there. Again, that might be a failure on the part of my internet
search skills, but at the moment there seems to be an ominous silence
from the Gambling
Commission<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T16:07:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Minister’s letter does not adequately address the Select
Committee’s question about what action the DCMS would take if,
for example, there was evidence that the funding of good causes was
suffering as a result of the merger. Therefore, first, given that the
Select Committee’s report on this issue was published on only 2
July and that, as I understand it, the Commons will not be considering
this order until September, does the Minister not think that a decision
on the order should be delayed to allow all the information to be
presented to this House and fully
considered<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T16:07:47"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

will be aware that there are anomalies in how the National Lottery is
treated compared with other society lotteries—for example, in
the specified percentage required to be given to good causes and the
duty of 12% that is paid to government. I gather that the DCMS is due
to hold a consultation on the minimum that should be donated to good
causes, and I welcome that. Also, as I understand it, the recent High
Court judgment on the status of the Health Lottery, run by Richard
Desmond, ruled that this was a matter for government rather than the
courts. Would this merger not have been a convenient time to address
these issues and the protections that need to be put in place to
regulate other society and commercial lotteries that may be
established<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T16:08:32"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

satisfied that the Gambling Commission is operating in a sufficiently
transparent way? The vast majority of society lotteries raise
significant sums of money for the causes which they support, but the
percentage of income which they donate varies considerably. I tried to
explore this a little in a recent Written Question to the Minister. In
his reply, he said that the commission publishes aggregates of the
financial details of these schemes. However, is that really good
enough? Does the Minister feel that the Gambling Commission could do
more to share information about the individual profits and donations of
these lottery schemes, and, again, does he feel that this could have
been addressed as part of the
merger<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T16:09:23"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

has to be the need to protect the £2 billion given to good
causes by the National Lottery, which has become a respected national
institution. The Gambling Commission could do more to reassure us that
it has robust governance systems in place to ring-fence and nurture the
development of the lottery while cracking down on exploitative
commercial and on-line
gambling<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T16:09:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

address these concerns and more fully consider a postponement of the
final decision on this order to allow for the letters to be read and

scrutiny can take place. I look forward to hearing his response to

balance the enjoyment of the large majority who gamble safely—of

an amendment to the alternative completion conditions for English

precondition of any apprenticeship. Indeed, experience of genuine

apprentice and employer have a real stake in the apprentice’s

issue was thoroughly debated during the passage of the Apprenticeships,
Skills, Children and Learning Act, and there was agreement on all sides
that some specific groups should not be denied access to
apprenticeships because they could not meet the requirement for
employment. Regulations were approved last year to cover three types of
exception. First, there are apprentices who begin their training while
in employment but are made redundant during the course of the
apprenticeship due to changes in the employer’s circumstances.
Secondly, the provisions support athletes hoping to represent the
nation in an Olympic, Paralympic or Commonwealth Games discipline.
Thirdly, there are a very small number of jobs or occupational areas in
which employed status is not the norm. A few of these were approved for
apprenticeships last year, and today I am looking for the
Committee’s support to add one further

decided that only one of the three submitted should be taken forward.

otherwise able candidates are not excluded from the possibility of

very important that we continue to train sufficient numbers of these

not expecting an answer from the Minister today, but I was somewhat
surprised to see that the number of under-19 apprenticeship starts as a
proportion of the total for all ages in England shows a decrease in
2010-11 and 2011-12 at the same time as the total annual number of
vacancies for apprenticeships increased from around 43,000 to just over
100,000. Furthermore, the proportion of candidate applications for
apprenticeships for under-19 year-olds had decreased from 2009-10,
while it had been increasing for over-19s. I find it surprising that
demand is less than supply. My experience is that it is usually the
other way round. I like to quote British Telecom apprenticeships; you
can get into Oxford or Cambridge more easily than you

thing I can think of is that the figures do not compare like with like

need for caution as we recover from this recession. Even though the
economy remained weaker in 2012 than had previously been forecast,
levels of employment in the low-paying sectors have been relatively

year’s  minimum wage regulations, noble Lords discussed
the Government’s decision to accept the Low Pay
Commission’s recommendation that the youth rates should be
frozen at the same level as 2011. While this was not an easy decision,
it was one that we felt was needed to avoid jeopardising the employment
of young workers. The Low Pay Commission found that the labour market
position of young people has stopped deteriorating and that there were
some signs of improvement, although it is too early to know if these
will become a trend. As a result, the commission concluded that a
further freeze in the youth rates was not necessary. However, it
recommended a smaller increase than for adults in order to help to
protect the labour market position of young people. The draft
regulations increase both the 16 to 17 year-old rate and the rate for
18 to 20 year-olds by 1% to £3.72 and £5.03 per hour

am sure that noble Lords share the Government’s concern about

prospects have suffered more than those of other workers in the
difficult economic circumstances. We believe that the tough decision
that we made last year has helped to stabilise 
<?notus-xml column=210?>their position and that the 1% increase in the youth rates set out in

I shall explain why the Government rejected the Low Pay
Commission’s recommendation to freeze the apprentice rate and,
instead, are increasing the rate by 1%. I should start by saying that
the Government fully recognise the challenges that the commission has
faced as a result of the uncertain economic environment. Its report
contains substantial detail about the evidence that it considered and
we thank the commissioners for all the hard work that they have put
into developing their
recommendations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307159000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-gc0001.htm#1307159000092">The
commission’s underlying analysis of the labour market is of its
usual high standard and the Government entirely accept its assessment
of the low-paid labour market. However, rather than accept the freeze
that the commission recommended, we have decided to take a different
approach. The Government entirely share the concerns expressed by the
commission about non-compliance with the apprentice rate. We are clear
that employers must pay their staff at least the minimum wage. The
Government are fully committed to the minimum wage and its effective
enforcement. That is why we are increasing compliance activity, raising
awareness with employers at risk of unintentionally falling foul of
minimum wage rules, and ensuring that individuals are up to date about
their rights. We are also ensuring that our guidance it is as clear,
comprehensive and consistent as possible. However, we believe that
concern about non-compliance does not translate into a freeze in the
apprentice minimum wage
rate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307159000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-gc0001.htm#1307159000093">After
careful consideration, we concluded that there are important reasons
why we should make a modest increase in the apprentice rate.
Apprenticeships are a key government policy and it is important that
they are truly beneficial for both employers and apprentices.
Increasing the apprentice rate by 1% will maintain its relative
position compared with benefits and the youth minimum wage rates. This
should ensure that apprenticeships remain an attractive route into work
for young people.</hs_para>

wage rates, the apprentice rate needs to balance affordability for
employers with a fair deal for the lowest-paid workers. Many employers
go further and pay more to reflect the value that a worker adds to
their business. However, the apprentice rate acts as a safety net for
many, and we do not want to see these young people falling further
behind their peers in other areas of the labour
market.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307159000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-gc0001.htm#1307159000095">Although
we are increasing the apprentice rate, I emphasise the need for
caution. That is why we concluded that a rate which reflects the

of apprentices paid on or just above the apprentice rate are young

was a founding member of the Low Pay Commission when it was first
established. We created its infrastructure and recommended the first
minimum wage. The Low Pay Commission has always been thorough and has
always acted on an evidence-based footing. It is fair to say—the
Minister implied this—that it has always been conservative with
a small “c” on the issue of youth rates and apprentice
rates for the reasons he set out. It had to get the balance right
between making sure that the rates were not so large as to discourage
employers but not so small as to discourage apprenticeships. Therefore,
the Government have got this
right.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307159000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-gc0001.htm#1307159000100">The
only additional point I would make is that there is an extra challenge
coming in from the side on the issue of unpaid internships, which
complicates apprenticeships in many areas. It is extremely important
that we support the recommendations but also bear in mind that the
issue of youth rates, internships and the application of the minimum
wage is becoming more and more of a grey area.</hs_para>

always maintained, and I do now, that although there were staff whose
job it was to maintain the application of the minimum wage, there were
never enough. I would like the Minister to respond on that. Certainly,
in many areas of industry it was quite clear that there were two levels
of pay—one declared and one undeclared—but the difficulty
was in getting people to complain. In areas such as the textiles centre
in the south-west of Birmingham, people might go to their advice centre
but they would not want their name reported because they knew that they
would probably never get another job in the area if they made the
complaint. They worked the legitimate number of minimum wage hours but
then, off the books, they would be asked to work an extra seven or
eight hours and, therefore, the average made it clear that it was not
any longer the statutory national minimum wage. That practice is still
happening and, if anything, is probably
worse.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307159000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-gc0001.htm#1307159000102">So,

is good to see that there now seems to be an enthusiastic endorsement

do not want to be in a situation where it decreases the number of jobs.
We could argue that what has a major impact on jobs and the number of
jobs available is the amount of growth we can get in the economy, but I

draft order introduces an additional limit on the compensatory award
for unfair dismissal, which is based on 52 weeks of an
individual’s pay. This limit will exist alongside the existing
overall limit, currently at £74,200, with the applicable cap in
individual cases being the lower of the two caps. This order is an
exercise of the power found in Section 15 of the Enterprise and
Regulatory Reform Act 2013. The power allows the Secretary of State to
vary the limit on compensatory awards for unfair dismissal in certain
ways.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307159000115" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-gc0001.htm#1307159000115">There are
two ways in which the limit can be varied. This first is in the order
before us today: the introduction of a cap based on an

weeks’ pay. The second way is to change the overall level of the
cap. This power is also limited. The overall level of the cap cannot be
less than median annual earnings or more than three times median annual
earnings. The current overall limit of £74,200 falls within this
range. We do not intend, at this time, to use this aspect of the power
in Section 15 to change the overall limit
further.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307159000116" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-gc0001.htm#1307159000116">The
purpose of this order is to address the effects that the recent rapid

£74,200, greatly in excess of the average unfair dismissal award

<?notus-xml column=214?>which includes both the basic and compensatory elements of the award.
The potential, however unlikely, for high awards creates unrealistic
expectations among both employers and employees. The uncertainty that
this potential creates for employers can discourage them taking on new
staff while claimants may believe that if they pursue the claim, rather
than accept a settlement, they will receive large
sums.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307159000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-gc0001.htm#1307159000117">I am sure
that noble Lords will agree that it is important, particularly if we
are to achieve our shared objectives of growth and increased early
dispute resolution, to manage expectations about the level of tribunal
awards. The Government consulted on the unfair dismissal compensatory
award cap through the <I>Ending the Employment Relationship</I>
consultation. Following analysis of responses to the consultation, the
Government are not minded to change the overall specified cap but have
decided that it is appropriate to introduce a cap based on an
individual’s salary to run alongside the overall cap. The
Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee highlighted this decision in
its 27 June report, and I am thankful to it for providing the
opportunity to put to rest any concerns about the consistency of the
Government’s approach to
consultation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307159000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-gc0001.htm#1307159000118">As
the Committee pointed out, statistically speaking, there was not
unanimous support for or against any option. Half of respondents were
in favour of the cap before us today and 45% were not, while 37% felt
the overall cap was appropriate, and 39% felt it was not. If these
numbers were the only evidence that we had from the consultation, our
decision would indeed be inconsistent. However, these data are only a
part of the evidence we received. As we have only 30 minutes today, I
will refer to only a few key
points.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307159000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-gc0001.htm#1307159000119">First,
among respondents who opposed the pay-based cap, almost 40% opposed any
cap at all on rewards. Noble Lords will appreciate, however, that all
Governments have agreed that it is necessary to have a limit on
compensation for unfair dismissal. Secondly, as our government response
clearly stated, very few respondents made any suggestion of an
alternative level for the overall level of cap. Of the 26 respondents
who suggested an amount, eight suggested £26,000, six suggested
£78,000, five suggested £52,000 and three suggested
£50,000. The remaining four suggested amounts in the range of
average annual earnings and three times that amount. Moreover, these
suggestions were not backed by supporting evidence. Without support or
evidence, the Government chose not to initiate a legislative change to
the overall cap at this time. I am sure noble Lords will agree that we
do not want to choose a new cap arbitrarily.</hs_para>

of consultation analysis is to consider the quality of evidence
provided. We were, on balance, convinced by respondents’
arguments for a salary-based cap; it is a tailored approach to unfair
dismissal awards that is fair to claimants. It is right that the cap is
based on pay because the compensatory award is meant to reflect loss
caused by the employer’s actions in dismissing the employee.
Since the compensatory award is based on financial loss, it makes sense
to link it to the individual’s pay. Let us also not forget that
this change is about correcting perceptions.</hs_para>

partly because the last time this issue was considered the Government
were not enthusiastic about a pay-based cap but they have changed their
position in the intervening period. That is an argument with the

the top award. It seems far-fetched in the extreme to say that the
picture being presented is a real one. I instead come to the
conclusion, which I would test on the Minister, that this is simply
about reducing the amount of money that some employers have to pay to
some employees. It is a step at the expense of the employee in favour

a number of other changes. I suggest that this is another salami cut
into employment rights at work. It is not the biggest—I do not
want to exaggerate my case—but it is one under which some
employees will lose, while some employers

that that is really what it is about rather than this romantic story
that the Government seem to be advancing: that all this reduced
compensation will mean fewer claims, which means more employment, to
put it in the reverse way from how I put it before. Is this not simply
about reducing the amount that employers have to pay to workers who

overall position about compensation awards from employment tribunals
has always been a matter of enormous propaganda. I remember during my
seven year period as chair of ACAS having to convince Ministers that
the median award for unfair dismissal was £5,000. Some of them,
frankly, did not believe the figure, even though I would point out the
statistics. I would say that is the median award, and that is of the
minority of cases which get to tribunal and the minority of cases at
tribunal where the applicant wins. But the propaganda seems to have a
firm grip. I probably praise the tabloid press for their headlines on
this for so firmly fixing these non-existent but super-duper awards as
the norm.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1307159000130" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-gc0001.htm#1307159000130">I
cannot help thinking that the Government are to some extent trying to

compensation”, so that it carries on their deregulation and

Young of Norwood Green:</Member></B> My Lords, we have had a fair
amount of consensus this afternoon on previous statutory instruments
but I think that this is the one where we part company, as we have
signalled in previous debates on this issue under the Enterprise and
Regulatory Reform Act. If there was one move that the Government made
that we firmly endorsed, it was to encourage the mediation process
through ACAS. We supported that; we thought that it was constructive
and sensible. If only the Government had pressed the pause button after
having done that and had waited 
<?notus-xml column=217?>for a period of time to see its effect, that would have been profoundly
important. However, the Government were not satisfied with that. As my
noble friends have commented, they have gone on to introduce a number
of other significant changes. One change was increasing the period of
service required before a claim for unfair dismissal could be entered
from one year to two years, and my noble friend Lord Monks has referred
to that. That is a profound change in itself.</hs_para>

consultation process that the Government went through was, as someone
somewhere else said, “a damn close run thing,

cases, they swing the other way on whether or not there should be caps.

for Government to decide on policy-formulation in the light of
consultation responses. We note, however, that there was a lack of
consensus on both the key issues relating to compensation for unfair

the overall cap, the Government saw this as reason to make no change.

is about allowing employers and employees to take informed decisions on

single option, when considering the totality of the evidence and not
only the bald figures that we received from this information, the
Government were convinced by the response argument for a salary-based
cap. The cap applies to many different circumstances. A pay-based cap

the potential level of award while still fairly compensating

Young of Norwood Green:</Member></B> My Lords, the Minister said that a
pay-based cap will make the system more consistent. It may make it more
consistent, but is it fair? The impact for someone on lower pay of
losing their job can be far higher than on someone on a significantly
higher pay rate. It is not just consistency that you look for when
making this kind of legislation, it is whether it treats people fairly.

tribunal for unfair dismissal have resulted in compensation of
£74,200, but 90% of the cases that have gone to the tribunal
have resulted in compensation of just under £5,000. Therefore,
even somebody on the minimum wage will probably be able to get the
right level of compensation. All parties recognise the need for a cap.
As I said earlier, the median award is £4,560, which is below
the median salary. Therefore, for 97.5% it is quite reasonable for
low-paid people to have this cap or the maximum of
£74,200<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T17:26:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Donaghy:</Member></B> I was making a general point about the Government
allowing, if you like, propaganda about excessive amounts of money to
simmer around in the pot, whereas we all know that the reality is that
the award figure is very low. I should have mentioned 
<?notus-xml column=219?>earlier that, even when the minority of the minority of the minority are
awarded compensation, 40% of them do not receive it. They have to
either accept nothing or go through the civil courts to chase the
employer for the award. Therefore, the talk about caps and limits and
about putting employers off employing people goes along with the
propaganda about large amounts of money, when the reality is that those
amounts are small and 40% of them do not get paid. Does the Minister
not feel that he could at least put forward a consistent point of view
about this and not put a cap on the pay-based
awards<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-15T17:27:41"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

Popat:</Member></B> The noble Baroness raises a very important issue.
This large amount of £74,200 has been in place for some time. We
are trying to clarify matters, and the most reasonable or most
equitable way of doing this and of speeding up the tribunal process or
the agreement 
<?notus-xml column=220?>between employers and employees is to bring in a cap of either 12
months’ salary—which is quite reasonable because it gives
the employee 12 months to find an alternative job—or
£74,200. As I mentioned earlier, 95% of the awards given in the
past have been settled for less than the median of £4,560. We
have put information on median awards on ET1 claim forms to help to
address issues of perception. We are also improving the guidance to
help employers and employees to have better information.</hs_para>

campaign for the Arms Trade Treaty has enjoyed the strong support of
Members in both Houses for over seven years. From before the first
Diplomatic Conference in July, 2012 through to the Final Diplomatic

Minister of State for International Development, I attended the
Diplomatic Conference in July 2012 and I attended the Diplomatic
Conference in March this year to support the efforts of our diplomats
and to urge the international community to agree on this important
issue. The negotiations were hard fought and compromises were necessary
on all sides, but the treaty that emerged is robust, implementable and
will make a significant difference to international peace and
security.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307158000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715-wms0001.htm#1307158000004">In

that when the Liverpool Care Pathway is operated by well-trained,
well-resourced and sensitive clinical teams, it works well. However, it
also heard too many examples of poor practice and poor quality care,
with families and carers not being properly involved and supported.

I can announce at this point our intention for the Liverpool Care
Pathway to be phased out over the next 6-12 months. Instead,
an individual approach to end of life care for each patient will be
introduced, with a personalised care plan backed up by

NHS hospitals asking them to undertake a clinical review, led by a
senior clinician, of each patient who is currently being cared for
using the Liverpool Care Pathway or similar plans for the final days

appropriate. I have also asked them to ensure that arrangements are put
in place to provide assurance that every dying patient now and in the
future has a named senior clinician responsible for their care. I will
be writing in similar terms to those responsible for dying patients
being cared for outside of hospital;</hs_WAIndent><hs_WAIndent>- it is
equally important that the concerns about care are properly
investigated and resolved. I will ensure that people who have a
complaint about the care given to a dying patient on the Liverpool Care
Pathway or similar plans have access to an
independent assessment of their case should they want it. I have also
asked all NHS hospitals to appoint a board member with responsibility
for overseeing any complaints about end of life care and for reviewing
how end of life care is provided; and</hs_WAIndent> <hs_WAIndent>- the
review also recommends that incentives paid to hospitals to promote a
certain type of care for the dying should cease. In response, I am

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment,
Food and Rural Affairs (Lord De Mauley):</Member> This paper needs to
be considered alongside the other available evidence on the impact of
GM crops. On yields, it should be recognised that the current GM
herbicide-tolerant and insect-resistant crops are intended to
facilitate weed and pest control rather than confer an intrinsic yield
benefit. However, a number of other studies point to GM
insect-resistant crops increasing output by reducing levels of pest
damage. That includes in respect of the only major experience so far
with GM cultivation in the EU, where Spanish farmers growing GM maize
have had better yields than their non-GM counterparts in areas of
significant pest pressure. Other evidence also suggests that GM
insect-resistant crops lower pesticide usage, and that GM
glyphosate-tolerant crops have a lower environmental impact than the
crops they replace, because glyphosate is less toxic and more
biodegradable than other
herbicides.</hs_para><hs_TabledBy UID="13071510000454" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130715w0001.htm#13071510000454">Asked

De Mauley:</Member> In his speech about GM technology at Rothamsted
Research on 20 June, the Secretary of State noted that the EU has
funded more than 50 projects on GM safety. None of these involved
long-term animal feeding studies. As a minimum, the EU assessment of
proposed GM food and feed products is based on repeated-dose 28-day
oral toxicity studies in rodents to demonstrate the safety of newly
expressed proteins. Recognised good practice for GM safety assessments
envisages that in certain circumstances it may be necessary to conduct
a 90-day feeding trial with the GM food, and the need for and extent of
additional feeding trials is considered on a case-by-case basis. In
April 2013 a standard requirement for a 90-day rodent feeding trial was
introduced by the EU for many types of GM crop.</hs_para>
