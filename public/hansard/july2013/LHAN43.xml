Answer. Everyone in this House who has taken part in debates on this
matter will welcome the very strong analysis and recommendations made
in the report of the high-level panel on the issues of conflict,
security and development. In fact, the recommendations are perhaps
surprising given the hostility that there may be elsewhere in the
United Nations system towards these issues. What action  will
the Government take to build a broad coalition  in the United
Nations and elsewhere to secure these recommendations and to make sure

that it would be very difficult to secure something as focused,
streamlined and effective as this one is, following on as it does from
the previous one, which was negotiated almost in isolation. Many
different groups and organisations from countries across the globe have
been involved, which is a good omen for taking this forward. However,
the noble Lord is absolutely right to say that it is going to need a
lot of work, and this Government will be putting that work in to ensure

Low of Dalston:</Member></B> My Lords, the Prime Minister is much to be
congratulated on the report of the high-level panel, which he
co-chaired, given its emphasis on no one being left behind and the
recommendation that targets should be considered achieved only if they 
<?notus-xml column=1412?>are met for all the relevant income and stakeholder groups. Given all of
that and the fact that progress towards the current millennium
development goals has been limited by the great increase in global
inequalities, will the UK Government press for a stand-alone goal on

emphasises leaving no one behind and that targets can be considered
achieved only when they are met across all social and income groups.

Jenkin of Kennington:</Member></B> My Lords, I returned this morning
from Myanmar which—although it was a fascinating week—is
still in a very fragile state. It is one of the states that has failed
to achieve any of the MDGs. It is still a very poor country where one
in four people lives below $1.25 a day, and it has terrible capacity
issues. Given the feeling of hope in that country now, what does DfID

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, a reduced VAT rate of 5% already applies
to the installation of various energy-saving materials, including
insulation materials, in residential properties. There are many
instances where people incur expenditure in a way that helps to reduce
energy use, but given the current fiscal pressures, it is not possible
to relieve such expenditure from

efficiency has a major role to play in meeting carbon reduction
objectives while reducing energy costs for consumers, and the process
of doing that can and does generate jobs. That is why we  have
introduced the Green Deal, which, as noble Lords will be aware,
encourages home energy-efficiency improvements, paid for by savings on

efficient, and I pay tribute to the work being done in that respect.
Sadly, under EU legislation, the scope for a reduced rate of VAT on
non-residential royal palaces is, I am afraid, non-existent. However, I
commend, and refer the noble Lord to, the work that the National Trust
is doing on green energy projects—for example, installing a

Development Select Committee’s report this morning. I was then
astonished to look at the report itself, and wondered how on earth the
press came to the conclusions that they did. They were reviewing
DfID’s multilateral aid review. They pointed out that it was
extraordinarily important for DfID to review how its aid is given, and
suggested that there were strengths, but also some areas where DfID
might 
<?notus-xml column=1418?>want to investigate further, including—to pick up the noble
Baroness’s question earlier—ensuring that multilateral
organisations focus on gender. I welcome the Select Committee’s

instances—such as the boy who was brought up by his grandmother
in a marginal area of Tanzania far from hospitals and schools, who
experienced kwashiorkor, and who came to speak to Members of the House

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, I do not share the noble Lord’s
analysis of the problem. A&amp;E departments are currently meeting
targets, but the long-term pressures have been building up for many,
many years. Over the past decade, emergency admissions have risen by
35% and an extra 1 million patients have attended A&amp;E compared to
three years ago. This is not anything recent. The Government’s
reforms will, if anything, help to ease the pressure because doctors
now have the freedom to provide the health services their patients
really need. The action we are taking in the immediate term is to
encourage doctors and all the key players in the health system to get
together in urgent care boards to make sure that next winter we see a
much easier
picture.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072523000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0001.htm#13072523000067"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Trefgarne" PimsId="4328" UID="13072523000307" xid="1470" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0001.htm#13072523000307">Lord

is no doubt that the GP contract severed the legal responsibility that
individual GPs had to look after their patients out of hours. It would

frail elderly who often turn up at A&amp;E with a crisis in their

local decisions by doctors, nurses and all those with a stake in the
system. It is not for Ministers to issue edicts from the top. We are
clear that any reconfiguration of A&amp;E services has to take into

Education England is looking at that area very carefully. A&amp;E is a
discipline that has not traditionally proved attractive to trainee
doctors for a number of reasons. It is very stressful and the
remuneration is perhaps less than in other areas of medicine. That

Chairman of Committees (Lord Sewel):</Member></B> My Lords, the report
covers a number of different areas, which I will cover briefly in turn.
The first part deals with the detailed implementation of two proposals
by the Leader of the House to allocate more time for Back-Bench
business. The first proposal is for a weekly one-hour topical QSD, to
be selected by ballot and debated between the two party or balloted
debates on Thursdays. The ballot would open at 10 am on Monday morning
and be drawn at noon on Tuesday for Thursday of the following
week.</hs_para>

with topical Oral Questions, a topicality test would be applied: we
suggest that the subject must have been covered by at least two
mainstream media outlets on either the Monday or Tuesday that the
ballot was open or over the preceding weekend. The second proposal
focuses on balloted debates. We propose three changes: first, that the
practice of rolling over Motions from one ballot to the next should be
discontinued; secondly, that Members should be able to have either a
Motion for balloted debate or a QSD on the same subject on the Order
Paper at any one time, but not both; and finally, we propose an element
of flexibility in the timing of balloted debates. Where one balloted
debate has twice as many speakers as the other, there should be
flexibility to shorten the less popular debate to two hours, in order
to extend the more popular one to three
hours.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072523000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0001.htm#13072523000085">Moving
on from the Leader’s proposals, the report proposes a slight
change to the yearly cap on Oral Questions that the House agreed at the
end of April. It has been brought to our attention that some Members
were unaware that Questions tabled since January have been
retrospectively counted as part of the Member’s allocation of
Oral Questions for the 2013 calendar year. To avoid penalising Members
who were unaware of the retrospective nature of the cap, we propose
that the yearly cap on Oral Questions be calculated from 1
May to 30 April. This change will ensure that only Questions tabled
after the cap was agreed to will be counted.</hs_para>

recommends to the House two proposals from the Leader relating to the
High Speed 2 hybrid Bill, which is expected to be introduced
in the House of Commons by the end of the year. The first is to amend
the private business Standing Orders to ensure that the House’s
procedures are compliant with the EU directive on environmental impact
assessment by allowing the public an opportunity to comment  on
the environmental statement for a hybrid Bill and for those comments to
be taken into account by both Houses.</hs_para>

to allow the electronic deposit of documents relating to the High Speed
2 hybrid Bill. Standing Orders currently require hard copies of all
Bill documentation to be deposited in every local authority along the
line of route. Given that there are around 250 local authorities and
the environmental statement alone is expected to run to 50,000 pages,
this proposal simply allows, but does not require, these documents to
be deposited in electronic form. The Government have undertaken to make
all key documents available in hard copy in all deposit locations and
to continue to provide all documentation in hard copy if locations so
wish. I beg to move.</hs_para>

Bates:</Member></B> My Lords, it is an immense privilege to kick off
this debate on the English Premier League. In securing this debate, I
am grateful still to be able to declare a Premiership interest as a
supporter of Newcastle United Football Club. I have learnt to cope with
the disappointment over the years, but it is the hope that I cannot
quite
handle.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072523000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0001.htm#13072523000093">My
purpose in seeking this debate was to highlight the incredible
contribution that Premier League football makes to UK plc week in, week
out. It is by far the most watched league in the world: 212 countries
broadcast the Premier League, compared with the 193 member states of
the United Nations and the 204 countries that sent teams to the Olympic
and Paralympic Games last summer. That is a real penetration rate. Some
1.46 billion people follow the Premier League around the
world—70% of the total population of the televised sport
market.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13072523000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0001.htm#13072523000094">That
market is growing fastest in a corner of the world where our economic
interests are growing fastest: in Asia. Asia now accounts for 31% of
the viewership of Premier League football. The Prime Minister, on a
recent trade mission, mentioned the first time that he enrolled the
substantial figure of the Premier League trophy as a member of his
trade delegation. When he turned up to a dinner in Kuala Lumpur, he saw
businessmen from all over east Asia, and he later
said:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13072523000197" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0001.htm#13072523000197">“I

be such a big
draw”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="13072523000184" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0001.htm#13072523000184">He
then realised that in fact that they all just wanted to be photographed
with the Premier League trophy. It is an immense draw and an immense
asset for British business and
diplomacy.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13072523000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0001.htm#13072523000095">If
we are in a global race—and we are—the Premier League
represents a massive home advantage for British business and diplomacy:
it is our Stretford End and our Kop. It is not surprising that the
Premier League is at the heart of the GREAT campaign to sell British
goods, services and culture around the world. When last year <I>Monocle
</I><I>Magazine</I> carried out its global survey of national soft
power capital, the UK was ranked at number one. The Premier League was
the driving force behind that extraordinary performance. When Populus
carried out an international survey asking respondents to rank what
made them view Britain more favourably, the Premier League out-polled
popular music, the BBC and even—I dare say in the week of a
royal birth?—the monarchy. Showing no hard feelings, Her Majesty
awarded to the Premier League the Queen’s award for enterprise
in international
trade.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072523000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0001.htm#13072523000096">When
the 22 first division clubs met on the morning of 27 May 1992 to resign
en masse from the Football League, thus breaking with 104 years of
tradition, not even they could have anticipated the global phenomenon
that the Premier League has become. In its first season, it earned
£46 million. Last year, it earned £1.28 billion and
generated a further £3 billion for clubs through television
rights. That is more than double the income of the Spanish and Italian
leagues
combined.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072523000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0001.htm#13072523000097">Part
of what makes us British is that we sneer slightly at commercial
success, believing that culture cannot really be culture if it is also
popular. We slightly look down our noses at players with few or no 
<?notus-xml column=1427?>qualifications earning £100,000 per week. However, the salaries
simply reflect the success of the business in which they deploy their
sublime skills. In that they are no different from those in any other
enterprise, such as investment bankers or hedge fund supremos, except
for the level of joy which they give to the public as they ply their
trade. Furthermore, Premier League clubs also paid in excess of
£1 billion in tax to the Exchequer last
year.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072523000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0001.htm#13072523000098">With
wealth comes responsibility, of course, and support for organisations
such as the Football Foundation are a vital way of growing the game for
the future. It would be good to see how more of that wealth at the top
could trickle down to the grass roots and help new talent to
grow.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072523000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0001.htm#13072523000099">People
around the world do not just watch Premiership football, they also come
to see it. VisitBritain announced in October 2012 that 900,000 football
tourists came to the UK in 2012, contributing £706 million to
the national economy. This compares favourably to the 590,000 people
who turned up for the Olympics and
Paralympics.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072523000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0001.htm#13072523000100">It
is not just the staggering commercial success and sheer entertainment
value through which the Premier League makes its contribution to the
reputation of the UK around the world. It is also through its
international engagement. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Bach,
chairman of the British Council All-Party Parliamentary Group, for
pointing out to me the British Council and Premier League’s
partnership through Premier Skills, which has helped 2,300 coaches and
400,000 young people in 20 countries around the world, including
Afghanistan. It is no coincidence that the British Council has paired
up with the Premier League—they both recognise that the Premier
League’s global audience is earned because it is globally
accessible. Clubs are owned by Russians, Chinese, Americans, Indians
and Arabs, with managers from 11 nations and players from 65 nations,
and they are all watched in 212
nations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072523000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0001.htm#13072523000101">For
those of us of an internationalist persuasion nothing warms our soul
quite like the sight of sportsmen of many different nations and
cultures playing on the same level playing field, under the same rules,
demonstrating the same purpose and commitment, working together as a
team in pursuit of common goals. We have Argentinean and English, Greek
and Turk, Iranian and American, Ukrainian and Russian, Serb and Croat,
Japanese and Korean, who all play in the league, for the same teams,
demonstrating the unifying nature of sport and
confirming—whatever the politicians or clerics might tell
us—that we are all human first. It is the ultimate meritocracy
as it matters not a jot whether you are rich or poor, educated or
uneducated, gay or straight; it does not matter how you look—as
Wayne Rooney can tell us—but only how you play and what results
you
deliver.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072523000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0001.htm#13072523000102">The
league is also becoming more religiously diverse. We are all familiar
with the crucifix-kissing and heavenward-pointing finger of Christian
players’ goal celebrations, but more than 40 Muslim players now
play in the league, and when Demba Ba struck a thunderous volley for
Newcastle against Manchester  
<?notus-xml column=1428?>United, I almost converted on the spot. Seriously, however, that is why
it is vital that that the Premier League is ruthless in ensuring that
racism and all other forms of prejudice are trumped by respect for all
those on the field and off, for that is the Premier League brand. All
are welcome, worthy of respect and are subject to the same
rules.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072523000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0001.htm#13072523000103">The
Premier League is a great success story of which we can all be proud.
It can be an immensely powerful resource for British business and

because of what it says about how we believe the game should be

Pendry:</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate the noble Lord on
introducing this Motion. He has chosen an interesting title, which I
would not normally associate with a debate on football in its broadest
sense. However, to narrow a subject down to a particular league is
quite unique and very
welcome<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T12:03:01"></hs_TimeCode>. Before
I go on, I must say that I am sure that noble Lords in this debate who
heard at Question Time that the noble Lord, Lord Bates, will be running
a marathon for charity—and not for the first time—will
want to wish him very well in that
endeavour<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T12:03:15"></hs_TimeCode>. This
debate gives me an opportunity once more to promote an aspect of the
work of the Premier League in so far as it makes a massive contribution
under the aegis of the Football Foundation, and I declare an interest
as president of that
body<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T12:03:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072523000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0001.htm#13072523000106">As
the noble Lord has already said, the incredible global success of the
Premier League product has provided a colossal windfall contribution in
both cash and expertise to the grassroots game here in England.
Although in this Motion we are largely or at least in part referring to
the international dimension of the league’s work, its impact on
our domestic grassroots game cannot be underestimated. In the past year
alone, some £45 million was invested in grassroots and community
activities by the Premier League.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13072523000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0001.htm#13072523000107">In addition, the
contribution made by the Premier League has also attracted £418
million of funding from local businesses, housing developers, the
project’s own funding foundation, as well as other sources.
Furthermore, the Premier League’s payment to grass-roots
infrastructure has helped to improve not just the health of the
population but also the health of the economy. For example, if a local
football club or school needs to build a new playing surface or
pavilion, it thus provides jobs to architects, builders, electricians,
plumbers, and so on. The boost to the health of the UK’s
economy  as a result of the Premier League’s investment
in the Football Foundation can be exemplified through  the
research that has been carried out recently by the Centre for Economics
and Business Research, which showed the benefits to the UK economy in
terms of the jobs, contribution to GDP and growth that result from that
investment.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=1429?><hs_para UID="13072523000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0001.htm#13072523000108">I have in previous
debates referred to the major contributions made to the Football
Foundation by the Premier League and, of course, the Government and the
Football Association, which are partners. Together they have invested
some £200 million each into the foundation’s funds since
2000. That has provided 1,664 new grass-roots sports
facilities, including 402 new artificial pitches, 2,369 new
grass pitches and 759 new changing facilities—I know this can be
tedious, but it is very important to recognise the work that has been
done—and thus has generated an enormous number of jobs and
revenue to the Exchequer. The end of the statistics, I think. As an
example, last season £1 billion of revenue to the Government was
exclusively generated as a direct result of the Premier League,
allowing more than £700 million to be spent in the UK economy.
Almost 1 million foreign football fans came to the UK to watch Premier
League clubs last season and 1,600 jobs and 843 community
club projects were set up as a direct result of the Premier League
funding. Together with the Professional Footballers’
Association, the Premier League Foundation also provides grant schemes
from the television revenues generated by the league. Clubs can use
this money to assist charities financially, such as Tottenham
Hotspur’s funding of London’s disability sport-specific
charity, Interactive, which is just one of a huge number that owe much
to the funding by the Premier League.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13072523000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0001.htm#13072523000109">It was in June 2000
that I stood on the lawn of  No. 10 Downing Street with the
then Prime Minister, Tony Blair, launching the Football Foundation with
representatives of the funding partners. Alongside me that day was
Richard Scudamore, the chief executive of the Premier League and one of
the original trustees of the foundation. Now, 13 years later, he still
remains a trustee of its board. During the time that I was chairman of
the board, I cannot remember him ever missing a single board meeting
which, given the sheer scale and reach of the Premier League’s
operations, shows an amazing level of commitment. While I could list
many quantitative examples of the benefits to the UK’s economy,
community and culture that are created by the Premier League, I should
remind the House that the impact of the Premier League spreads further
than just money or statistics. Football, being a sport, is in its very
nature something that has a huge impact that cannot be easily
quantified. Unfortunately, you cannot quantify inspiration or the sense
of community, education, tolerance and respect. It is, however,
arguably the most high-profile football league in the world. The
coverage of the English Premier League that is seen by young people
inspires them to take up sport and, in this case, football. It takes
them away from activities that could be unsavoury. The sport gives
young people who are surrounded by crime an incredible opportunity to
gain priceless life experiences such as learning the importance of
teamwork, leadership, skills and, ultimately, discipline and hard work.
Any young person can get on to a football field, whatever their
background, colour or creed, and they can learn and flourish
there.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072523000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0001.htm#13072523000110">The

Addington:</Member></B> My Lords, I have a confession to make: I am not
a football fan. It is an odd thing. What does Premier League
football—this great, iconic game in this country—mean to
me? My home city is Norwich. I still look for the result when it is
announced on a Saturday. I still take that bit of time to find it. I
might not take much time to watch the team play, but in a strange way
the result matters. It is part of my identity. That tells us much about
the importance of football in our society. It gets through to people
who play another sport—in my case, rugby. It has a dominant
position, which explains why the Premier League, when it broke away
from all those years of tradition with all the gloom and doom that came
with them, has gone on to be a wholly new, global
thing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072523000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0001.htm#13072523000114">How has
football transformed itself? My memories of it as a young person were
of something that you went to in order to shout abuse—often of a
racist quality—at people and to get into fights. That was the
general impression. The game at professional level has transformed
itself after some very unpleasant experiences, and continues to
transform itself. It now accepts its social role. Parliament is a
slightly reactive body. There has to be a problem, it has to get
reported and then we generally do something about it at some point
after that. We now have interaction with the system, which has broken
down the anti-social aspects of football and allowed this new thing to
flourish. Now the Premier League has gone global and encourages huge
amounts of
expenditure.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072523000115" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0001.htm#13072523000115">What
are the downsides of the changes that have happened from the world I
grew up in? The idea of the local boy playing for his club and coming
good is something that is now almost guaranteed not to happen because
of the free and global market in players, and the international market
structure. That has been used to explain the lack of competition for
our national team. I repeated this argument once and somebody who knew
something about the game said, “Don’t talk rubbish. The
people who are beating us often have their players in our league as
well”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072523000116" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0001.htm#13072523000116">It
is a huge, comparatively new thing. One of its downsides as a sporting
event is that the championship is won too often by the same few clubs.
Manchester United seems to have a timeshare on the championship with
whoever else is coming along in the queue at the time. Greater
diversity would be beneficial. However, as we look through the
briefing, we discover that investment in other sports—for
instance, the Olympics—and their competitors is important. So
are the continuation of talent spotting, and support for the teaching
of training techniques. The Premier League is
showing  
<?notus-xml column=1431?>the way here, and investing in sports science produced by other bodies.
This movement is gaining momentum and reflects the world in which we
live.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072523000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0001.htm#13072523000117">However,
when things go wrong—we remember the disappearance of Leeds
United and Portsmouth—it can be cataclysmic. A club, which is a
great social entity that brings pride to a local community, can
disappear. Under this system, I do not think that there is great
enthusiasm for saying that you have a franchise rather than a place in
a league with the possibility of promotion and relegation. It can all
go horribly wrong. It can even cause losses to the Revenue, as it did
in the case of Portsmouth and other clubs. If we look north of the
border to another great icon of the football
scene—Rangers—and the trouble it has got into, we see the
need to temper the ability to strive for success with realism. It
reinforces the point about management structures and the fact that
things come with a preparation
cost.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072523000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0001.htm#13072523000118">It is a
romantic idea even if much of the romance is being stripped out by
money. However, if you do not prepare, you will lose this thing that
people have a relationship with. The managers of many clubs have been
hounded out because they would not invest sufficiently in their club
for their fan base. The English Premier League as it stands now does
good works and the noble Lord, Lord Pendry, has pointed out one of its
activities. It is an icon of sporting activity. However, it has also
shown that it needs management, investment and to be observed. The
Government cannot totally turn their eyes away from it. To get the best
out of it we have to live and interact with it. It cannot be left to
itself but must link to its community. Politicians must make sure that
it remains linked, too, to our structure. It is simply too big and too

when transfer deals are won and lost, while the new season is rapidly
approaching and the sad lack of achievement by our national squads is
all too recent, it is a good time to reflect on the achievements of the
English Premier League. There is no doubting the scale of the economic
impact, which has already been mentioned by several noble Lords.
Scanning through the Premier League submissions to the House of Commons
Culture, Media and Sport Committee, and Deloitte’s review, we
learn that some of the vast amounts of money that have been earned have
been reinvested in stadium facilities, playing squads and training
standards in wider communities and grass-roots football. It is not only
the football business that benefits from the Premier League’s
financial achievements. 
<?notus-xml column=1432?>Clubs have a significant impact on employment, GDP, national and local
economies, and industries such as broadcasting, marketing, travel,
tourism and hospitality, and on taxation revenues, as has been
mentioned.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072523000121" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0001.htm#13072523000121">With
the projected 25% increase in income from broadcasting, it is
calculated that the revenue of Premier League clubs could hit £3
billion. We are looking at an institution in rude financial health, in
spite of financial downturn, recession and austerity, whereas In the
Spanish and Italian leagues the economic climate has dampened revenues.
In fact, though the German Bundesliga is the most profitable league in
Europe, the Premier League has the highest revenue of any league in
European football. This is testament to its negotiating power, which is
in turn due to its popularity and global drawing
power.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072523000122" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0001.htm#13072523000122">While
revenues continue to grow, the profitability of some individual clubs
gives rise to concern and points to wider issues of financial
sustainability, responsible ownership and accountability to supporters.
Some clubs live beyond their means. The 2011 CentreForum report,
<I>Football and the Big Society</I>, drew attention to the fact that
several clubs were operating at a loss. Two significant issues were the
financial solvency of some of the benefactors keeping clubs going, and
these benefactors’ general suitability. Portsmouth FC has been
mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Addington. It ended up in
administration with unpaid debts of £108.6 million, including
£17 million owed to

the Premier League in wider football issues, the Culture, Media and

course, many football clubs have long-standing community engagement
programmes and activities that are broad and inventive. For example,
football is used to encourage participation in physical exercise, to

through initiatives that bring people together, and for tapping into
interest in football to encourage young people to take up modern
languages

Wei:</Member></B> My Lords, I join my fellow Peers in congratulating my
noble friend Lord Bates on securing this debate. Amid a summer of
sporting success, it is only right that we turn to football, a sport
whose Premier League has become truly world class over the past two
decades, even though as a nation we still eagerly look forward to a
World Cup breakthrough to add to our recent tally. I shall focus on how
we balance the interests of increasingly international club
shareholders and owners in the Premier League with those of the nation
at large and the communities and economies that they are linked with
locally, and why it is of benefit to us all to do
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T12:23:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072523000129" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0001.htm#13072523000129">We
cannot ignore other aspects. Investors and new club owners, combined
with the boost from commercial television and advertising income in
these past decades, have presided over the professionalisation and
increased global prominence of clubs that we could only have dreamed of
when the sport was invented, making the experience whether on or off
the pitch, at home or in the pub, that much richer. At the same time,
footballing history reminds us that clubs initially were formed to
provide a social function enabling local communities to enjoy leisure
and fitness, and to build character. They acted as a linchpin of local
society and local
economy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T12:24:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

potential for global football brands to further benefit the UK
economically. I declare here an interest as a Manchester United
supporter and as a non-executive director of the Manchester-China
Forum. When conducting a survey for <I>A Report on</I> <I>Growing
East</I>, which I recently co-authored, we identified how in China,
Manchester is most closely associated with football, and that
opportunities for promoting the city among Chinese investors and
companies abound when the clubs and local promotion agencies can work
together and co-ordinate their efforts. The very international nature
of football today is able to not only bring investment but create
relationships of a global nature that enable and fuel growth in our
cities to help them develop trade, tourism, retail and infrastructure,
thereby creating
jobs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T12:24:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

very international nature brought about by foreign ownership and
involvement is a huge benefit to the culture of many of our cities and
towns, making them more diverse and interesting both on and off the
pitch. Racism, which has historically been a scourge in football, has
moved on significantly as a result of having players and supporters
represented in our Premier League teams from all over the world and
joining forces through campaigns such as that run by Kick It Out. Some
would say that this has brought disadvantages in that local British
players do not get as much opportunity to play in season. I have to
disagree, because we cannot protect our British players from global
competition since ultimately it will make them more competitive.
However, we could do even more at the national level to identify and
nurture a truly great set of national teams.</hs_para>

this point, the debate over the national interest and the ownership of
major football clubs in the UK can sometimes reach fever pitch. If we
look at other sports where we have seen successes recently, they have
come overwhelmingly from taking an increasingly scientific approach to
developing individuals and teams, with lots of resources being put into
growing a strong pipeline of competitive athletes. The onus is on the
country or the national team to develop this, not always on the local
club or association.</hs_para>

need to borrow from international influences and follow
Germany’s example by vigorously bringing the youth development
of players back into the centre rather than relying solely on our
Premier League clubs. We could add a British free-market twist and
charge clubs if they want to buy some of those players, developed in a
national pool, for their squads. That would help pay back the nation
for investing in them. Indeed, the young people themselves could be
invited to agree to pay back from some of their future earnings, should
they enter the Premier League and earn above a certain threshold. That
could assuage concerns about the high salaries that footballers
receive. Germany has 1,000 part-time scouts and qualified coaches
looking everywhere for the talent it needs for the future. We ought to
invest to a similar degree now that St George’s Park is in place
and not rely primarily on clubs to do all the work, except to provide
the market mechanisms to help make this endeavour
sustainable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T12:27:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

this balance between foreign ownership and local needs plays out
through an aspect that unfortunately is sometimes overlooked, but which
is of the utmost importance: the role of fans. In recent years, there
has been much talk and a few examples of exploring how fans could
theoretically come together and buy out their clubs, in part or in
full, to create structures more akin to that of Barcelona in the UK. I
am very much in favour of such arrangements but we need to be realistic
and perhaps opt for more partnership arrangements, in which fans could
come together via a trust that would take a significant stake with
voting rights—as with the John Lewis Partnership. This would
still allow new investment to come in, yet give fans more of a
voice<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T12:27:46"></hs_TimeCode>.
Ultimately, it seems to me that the Premier League model should
complete a shift away from live spectator fees being the main driver of
income for clubs to what is already starting to happen: having
advertising and satellite viewing fees, combined with diverse
merchandising income from all around the world. Fans who have a stake
in their club financially would have a greater incentive to help
generate followers and fans both in the UK and globally, creating a
virtuous and, hopefully, less debt-fuelled circle.</hs_para>

Minister say what plans there are in this area and whether any legal
incentives could be put forward to make it easier to put such fan-led
shareholder arrangements into place? With such ownership we could start
to see a more holistic set of activities which many of the best Premier
League clubs already engage in, but which can be hard to maintain,
given financial and commercial pressures, and thus develop the social
and cultural fabric of the local community. I will not go into the
countless ways that clubs already get involved in helping local causes.
My personal favourite involves clubs agreeing to host mental health and
job clubs for men, who traditionally find it hard to admit that they
have challenges in these areas, but will turn up to an activity at a
football ground. Given that clubs are not used that much for games on
weekdays, there is huge scope for them to be leveraged further for
public and social benefit, such as through the successful
aforementioned Premier Skills
initiative<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T12:29:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

other examples, it strikes me that we ought to be looking at mechanisms
whereby we can harness global football grounds for local benefit on the
investment front. Where we do that already, we help to improve citizen
well-being and save public money, and club money as well. Could we one
day see impact bonds that would create, in partnership with clubs,
their fans and stakeholders, ways to help save money locally while
creating jobs and fostering well-being in citizens? Promoting cities
for trade through clubs, a football investment bank, incentives and
support for fans to jointly own their clubs and more partnerships to
leverage football brands for social and public benefits are brief
examples that demonstrate how, with a little creativity and leadership,
foreign ownership of clubs and the local and national benefits from the
Premier League’s international nature do not have to amount to a
zero-sum game. Get the balance right, and we  all
win.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-25?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_25_PT_1/9D42CC03DE0DD6EBC8C4DE4D54BA5D720B60E74E" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 25 July 2013">Thursday,

players performing at the highest level. Their findings, which relate
to last season, show that only 189 English players featured in the
Premier League and that as few as 88 of them appeared in more than half
the matches. The top four Premier League clubs used only 29
English players between them. That is in contrast to top European
leagues abroad. In Spain’s La Liga, for example,  there
were 332 Spanish national players, making 6,391 appearances in the
season.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072523000139" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0001.htm#13072523000139">The

The problem is particularly acute with young players. The England

Bates, for initiating this debate and enabling the very interesting
contributions that we have already heard on the Premier League and its
contributions to our society and in a global context. From the outset,
I declare an interest as the chairman of Kick It Out, which was set up
in the second year of the Premier League. I also pay tribute to the
noble Lord, Lord Faulkner of Worcester, for the contribution he made in
supporting the start-up of Kick It Out through his work at the time
with the Football Trust, which has been superseded by the Football

It Out was set up at a time when racism was rampant not only in
football but on the streets of Britain—1993 was the year that
Stephen Lawrence was murdered. Football’s reputation was clearly
in the gutter at the time, so it was very important during the Premier
League’s second year that notable figures such as David Dein,
who was at the Premier League at the time, took an interest in the
formation of Kick It Out and supported the Premier League in joining
the Professional Footballers’ Association and the Football
Association in enabling the challenge to racism, and to other forms of
unacceptable abuse that were going on in football, to be taken up and
supported.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072523000148" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0001.htm#13072523000148">I
suppose that the Premier League owes its creation to many visionaries,
who are probably all queuing up to claim credit for it. In addition to
David Dein, I mention Greg Dyke, the current chair of the Football
Association. He had the vision, way back when he was at London Weekend
Television, in collaboration with others, to enable the formation of
the Premier League, which has led to the successes that we have heard
about. The noble Lords, Lord Bates and Lord Wei, and others have
mentioned that success very
eloquently.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072523000149" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0001.htm#13072523000149">With
all its achievements and its high profile, there is an inevitable
elitism about the Premier League. However, it is
counterbalanced—which is really  what I want to talk
about—by admirable community programmes, some of which have been
mentioned already, which the Premier League sponsors. With  a
focus on vulnerable young people and deprived communities, its
contributions have been crucial for good community relations and social
cohesion, but there is much more that could be done and must be done if
we are to stimulate the next generation of young players, supporters,
administrators and volunteers to be part of a sport that should be seen
as a source for 
<?notus-xml column=1439?>good, not just in the context of the riches it generates and the global
position it holds but how it influences

which I am most concerned that football must do more, particularly in
boys’, girls’ and disabled football. In this regard, the
programmes that support the mentoring, education and upskilling of
individuals will be vital to freeing the game from racist, sexist,
homophobic and Islamophobic abuse, harassment, bigotry, prejudice and
other forms of unacceptable behaviours and attitudes. We have heard of
the transformation that has taken place during the past 20 years, but

have heard already of Premier Skills English with the British Council.
There is also Premier League Reading Stars with the National Literacy

young people. Its current pride and joy is the Creating Chances

of all the deserved acclamation, there are feelings that the relatively
poorer sections of our community are unable to afford to go to Premier
League football matches. In fact, they pay a disproportionate amount of
their income in trying to sustain their interest in the Premier League.
Their BSkyB contributions, as they go up, compete with the need to put
bread on the table for their families and to deal with their essential
costs of rent, transport and fuel against a background of decreased
earned income. Such resentment is understandable when it is known that
many Premier League clubs pay their players considerable sums of money
that can only be dreamt of by the fans. Agents take huge commissions.
An increasing number of clubs are foreign owned, and many carry huge
debts, as we have heard, with their foreign owners bailing them out.
Without that bailout many would be insolvent. There are different
realities at play here.</hs_para>

League continues to grow as a dominant force, it must never be
overlooked that football’s past, present and future development
in England relies on the responsibilities and duties of the Football
Association, the oldest national football association in the world,
currently enjoying its 150th year of existence. The FA is the national
governing body for football in England, charged with running
grass-roots football for the 7 million individuals who play the game
across the country, with 32,000 clubs and 113,000 teams affiliated to
local leagues in a variety of ways. The FA also relies on more than
400,000 volunteers, 300,000 qualified coaches and  27,000
trained referees to facilitate and enable participation in and
enjoyment of football being played regularly across the country. I will
not list the many achievements attributed to it, as time is running

a summit convened in 2012 by the Prime Minister about racism in
football, the FA launched last December the English football inclusion
and anti-discrimination action plan with the full support of the 
<?notus-xml column=1440?>football clubs, the leagues, the PFA, the League Managers Association
and Professional Game Match Officials Limited. One of the main goals of
the plan is to widen football’s talent pool for coaching,
refereeing, licensing tutors, adjudicating and decision-making. For
football to achieve its diversity and equality goals will require all
administrators, decision-makers, managers and power brokers in the game
to accept personal and professional responsibility to pursue the right
actions to achieve the equality outcomes. The present composition of
boardrooms, senior management teams, coaching teams and administrators
in the authorities and in the clubs illustrates that there is a long
haul ahead to take the next generation of fans and players to a point
when it can be seen that all forms of bigotry, discrimination and
hatred in the game have been
eliminated.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-25?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_25_PT_1/424294554CA880A93261C9453946AF403DFC8559" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 25 July 2013">Thursday,

the noble Lord, Lord Ouseley, for trying to jump the queue a few
moments ago. My enthusiasm must have got the better of me. I also
congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Bates, on securing this debate, but
perhaps I can ask him rhetorically why he did not get together with my
noble friend Lady Jones of Whitchurch to combine this debate with the
one taking place later today on the contribution of the arts to the
educational and emotional well-being of society. I think the two could
have been put together and, as I cannot be here to participate in that
debate, that would have served my own interests as
well<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T12:45:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

appropriate that I talk of serving one’s own interests, because
that really was the basis on which the FA Premier League was started in
1992—there are no two ways about it. It was a breakaway from the
Football League on the basis of seeking a greater share of television
revenues and getting more of that for the top clubs. It is unfortunate
that that kind of hubris has also manifested itself in the very fact
that the competition is now called “the Premier League”.
I am sorry but it is not the Premier League. The Premier League was
formed in 1988, and in 1998 in Scotland. When the FA was formed in
1863, it had the right to call itself that because it was the first in
the world, and when the Football League was founded in 1888, it was the
first in the world to have that title, but “the Premier
League” is not a title that this organisation has the right to
use, and I wish that it would not use it.
None<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T12:46:29"></hs_TimeCode> the less, I
think that is symptomatic. The organisation was formerly called
“the FA Premier League” when it started, but the hubris
to which I referred earlier has led to a break with the FA and a
difficult relationship between the English Premier League, as it is
referred to by all people outside England, and the FA. I think that has
to be
recognised<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T12:46:44"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T12:46:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072523000157" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0001.htm#13072523000157">I
turn now to the specific subject of this debate, the question of the
economic and cultural contribution to society of the English Premier
League to the United Kingdom—the international aspect is
different, and I will say a bit about that in a moment. The Premier
League’s contribution is self-evident. Of course it is there;
that is absolutely clear. A classic example is Swansea City, a club
that got into the top level for the first time, I believe, in 2011. In
that first season, a 
<?notus-xml column=1441?>university study showed, it brought about a £58 million boost to
the local economy of Swansea and the surrounding area. That, perhaps,
is not surprising when you consider that, given where Swansea is,
people who travel there for games probably stay there overnight and
spend a lot in the local economy. There are many other examples of
that, and it is very much to be welcomed. Swansea City is an
interesting example because in 2003 that club had to win its last game
of the season to avoid dropping out of the Football League entirely. Of
course, it did win, and eight years later it was in the English Premier
League, which I am very pleased about.</hs_para>

20% of that club is owned by a supporters’ trust. It is the only
English Premier League club that has supporters’ trust ownership
of it, and it has a director on the board as well, which is important.
To some extent, I declare an interest in two supporters’
trusts—not in the English Premier League—one in Dundee
United, ArabTRUST, of which I was a founder member, and, in AFC
Wimbledon, the Dons Trust, of which I am also a member. I would like to
see more of that kind of ownership, as is the case at Swansea, with
other English Premier League clubs. I know that it is difficult because
they are much bigger than the Dundee Uniteds and the AFC Wimbledons of
this world, but it is possible and I hope that clubs will look at some
means of doing
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T12:48:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072523000159" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0001.htm#13072523000159">The
way in which the clubs have developed in the  21 years since
the English Premier League was formed is in some ways unfortunate.
Unlike the noble Lord, Lord Bates, I have not welcomed the
international ownership. He said that he is an internationalist. I am
certainly an internationalist, but it has not always been for the
benefit of clubs in England that some international owners have come in
clearly knowing little about the clubs, the fans and the traditions,
and sometimes knowing little, it would seem, about football. Blackburn
Rovers is a classic example of that. It was a mid-range Premier League
club. It had been in Europe. It had won, I think, the league cup under
Graeme Souness, and it was doing reasonably well without ever seeking
to repeat its feat in the mid-1990s of winning the championship. At the
end of last season, having dropped out of the English Premier League
last year under, I believe, Indian ownership, it very nearly went into
the league below, but it just escaped doing so. That, I think, is down
to bad management. The example of Portsmouth to which the noble
Baroness, Lady Young, referred, is well known. Now run, incidentally,
entirely by a supporters’ trust, it has gone from the English
Premier League to the fourth tier at League Two in four or five years.
I pay tribute to the Portsmouth MP Penny Mordaunt, who has played a
heroic role in saving that club and ensuring that the supporters are
now able to run that club and, I hope, build it back up again. With the
support base of Portsmouth, I see no reason why it should not rise up
again fairly quickly. That is another example of fan involvement, which
is very important. The role of an organisation called Supporters Direct
is absolutely fundamental. It supports supporters’ trusts at all
levels of the professional and semi-professional game. Much of what it
does goes unrecorded.</hs_para>

by the noble Lord, Lord Addington, and my noble friend Lord Faulkner of

English national football teams—I use the plural deliberately.
The noble Baroness, Lady Young of Hornsey, mentioned the women’s
team; although not directly related to the Premier League, it had a
rather bad experience last week as well. At all levels, the English

the English Premier League came into being 21 years ago, there have
been five World Cups and six European Championships. Germany has been

has not reached even a semi-final. That cannot just be coincidence.
Equally, on the performance of clubs since the English Premier League
came into being, in the 21 years before it started England was the best
and most successful country in Europe. Since the English Premier League
came into being, England is the third most successful, behind Italy and
Spain, in terms of wins and places in European

Premier League the best league in the world? It is the best league if
you look at the worth—the TV deal. It is a little unfortunate
that the recently ennobled noble Lord, Lord Livingston of Parkhead, is
not here because he played a major role at BT in getting a huge amount
of money into the television deal that kicks in this season. In terms
of worth, there is no doubt that it is the best in the world. In terms
of excitement, that is subjective. My own view is that the Bundesliga
in Germany is slightly better, but it is a very exciting league. The
average crowds are 35,000 in England versus 42,000 in Germany, so it

great ones from the FA. I will not go into the culture north of the

side to the case, and the House might like the opportunity to hear it.
I thank the noble Lord, Lord Bates, for securing the debate, and we do
have important common ground, because we agree that the Premier League
has international economic and cultural significance. I shall not talk
about the international aspect, but just on the economic aspect: yes,
it is important, but we should not exaggerate. The total revenues of
the Premier League amount to precisely one month’s economic
growth, even at the present anaemic rate. It is not as if it is a

prosperity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T13:01:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072524000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0001.htm#13072524000028">I
had not thought much about the cultural impact—although one
cannot help reading about it—until a researcher for the Premier

comforted by that, because firms and other organisations only conduct
opinion polls when they think they are in 
<?notus-xml column=1445?>deep doo-doo and want to do something about it. As the questions flowed,

overriding overwhelming fact about the Premier League lies behind my
dissent from the general enthusiasm for it today—the fact that
it not only reflects but enormously magnifies one of the disfiguring
sins of our present society: excessive greed. I will not go through all
the cases that illustrate the greed of the people who buy up clubs on
leveraged takeovers in the hope of making money, and then use them as
instruments of profit, not of

example, I checked a website before the debate and found that tickets
for Arsenal against Spurs were on sale for £285. It would take
an adult on the minimum wage 45 hours to earn £285. Football
used to be a melting pot, and its rituals were the privilege of every
class, from the working people in cloth caps in the stands to the toffs
in the boxes. Stanley Matthews got £15 a week, and tickets could
be had for shillings and pence. Now, to go to a Premier League football
match you need “loadsamoney”—or, of course, a mate
or a business contact with a
box<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T13:03:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

reflected—although I do not necessarily blame them for
this—by the greed of the players, and perhaps even more so by
that of the agents. In economics we have a concept called economic
rent, whereby people strip money from an organisation; large economic
rents are generally regarded as rather a bad thing. Yet 70% of the
revenues of football clubs go out in wages to the players. As a result,
the clubs do not make much money, and as soon as they take more
revenue, by putting up the cost of entry or by other devices, the
agents and the players take the money from them. What sort of example
does that set to our
society<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T13:09:34"></hs_TimeCode>? We are
not even surprised when the<I> Sun</I> reports that a Premier League

English Premier League will be 21 next month. By any measure, it has
been an outstanding success. In the 1980s I scheduled ITV at the
weekend. Deeply conservative, the then Football League, fearful that
live coverage would undermine match attendance, would only agree to the
televising of a small number of recorded games. The appeal of football
on television at that time might best be described as meagre. Now we
have a league which is the envy of the world. It earns far greater
revenues than any other—its broadcast income is nearly three
times that of Germany’s Bundesliga—and it attracts the
world's best players. Week after week it offers the most exciting
football. No other league wins such a gigantic global following. About

Premier League were well considered, above all the relatively equitable
split of broadcast revenues. This is in sharp contrast to La Liga, for
instance, where Real Madrid and Barcelona take the lion’s share
of revenues and leave most Spanish clubs impoverished by comparison.
For the Premier League—this is critical—the consequence
is that on its day, any one team can beat any one other team. Last
season, for instance: Norwich 1, Manchester United 0. That
had Delia beaming. The noble Lord, Lord Addington, might not have seen
the game, but no doubt he too noted the result

should concern us about the Premier League? First, it is too early to
call it a trend, but we performed poorly in the Champions League last
year. While an equitable approach to splitting revenue brings evident
benefits, there is a case for favouring the stronger clubs 
<?notus-xml column=1447?>in the split of international revenues if they are to continue to
compete with Europe’s best. Secondly, we need to be watchful
that the rules of financial fair play are enforced here in the UK and
evenly across Europe. We need, for instance, to guard against
sponsorship at above-market rates as a form of hidden
subsidy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072524000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0001.htm#13072524000040">Thirdly,
the FA and the Premier League need to ensure the prudent stewardship of
clubs, which are community, not just financial, assets. Clubs should
spend only what they earn. They should not pile on unsustainable levels
of debt. The fans of 115 year-old Portsmouth FC did not deserve the
long drop to the fourth tier of English football, as the noble Lord,
Lord Watson, reminded
us.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072524000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0001.htm#13072524000041">Fourthly,
in contrast to our club sides, and as many have observed in this
debate, England’s national team has disappointed—1966 is
almost half a century away. We field teams containing world-class
players but which perform poorly. Who here remembers—maybe we
would like to forget—our leaden, lumbering 4-1 defeat at the
hands of a young and fresh-faced but untried German team in the 2010
World Cup? In an era where we have seen our athletes and our cyclists
shine, the FA and the Premier League need to work together to identify
how English football can match those achievements and compete at top
international level, as the noble Lord, Lord Wei,
observed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072524000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0001.htm#13072524000042">One
contributing factor may be that our premier clubs can outbid other
leagues for the best global talent, squeezing English players in the
process. Perhaps I may add to some of the pungent comments made earlier
by the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner: last season in the Bundesliga, 50% of
squad players were German nationals. In the Premier League, the
equivalent was far lower, at 37%. Fewer than a third of the players
representing Premier League clubs in the Champions League last season
were
English.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072524000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0001.htm#13072524000043">While
we should strive to do better still, let us give thanks, on behalf of
the one-third of the population for whom the Premier League is a

for me with Liverpool—for the sheer joy and

because of vested interests, poor financial management and inadequate
standards of governance. This has been backed up by the CMS Select

real concerns about the ownership of clubs and about the fact that the

good enough. There are popular myths that Asians are interested only in
cricket and hockey and that cultural differences remain a barrier to
them playing in the professional game. However, Asian players such as
Michael Chopra and Zesh Rehman have played in the Premier League and

who are graduates of the Saints academy are Gareth Bale, Theo Walcott
and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. More recently, I have delighted in
watching James Ward-Prowse and Luke Shaw, both of whom have been with
the club since they were eight years old. Southampton’s Football
Development and Support Centre is unusual in professional football in
that it looks after pre-academy, academy and professional squads

three pathways: academic, including degree courses at Bath or

support the Spurs”. Half the class would put their hands up.
“Hands up those who support the Arsenal,” the other half
put their hands up. They always used to say to me, “Mr Graham,
who do you support?” and I would say, “Newcastle
United”, and they would all boo. They had learnt how to be
passionate about football, and they still
learn.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072524000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0001.htm#13072524000078">It is
about time the Government took their courage in their hands and did not
listen to people like me who always tell them their priorities are
wrong. We are waiting for them to set up a Select Committee, an
interparliamentary committee, a Royal Committee or whatever. I know,
and noble Lords know, that we are not governed by the British league or
the British system—it is a global system now—but it is
ridiculous that one man performing well commands £250,000 a week
for playing and jibs at accepting that because he thinks he can get a
little bit more. There ought to be some rules and regulations governing
the size of transfer fees and level of wages. It will not be easy. It
always puzzles me that people are willing to starve themselves, if what
we hear is correct. I asked Lee, my driver who brought me in this
morning and supports Spurs, how much he paid for a ticket the last time
he went to Spurs. He said £50. He said if he was to take his two
children with him it would be £100. The ordinary fan cannot find
£100, but the ordinary fan does and is prepared to pay a lot
more. They ought to be stopped from ruining an aspect of the game. I am

the football world’s leading revenue-generating club
competition, with revenues last year of more than €2.9 billion.
The nearest rival was the Bundesliga, with nearly €1.9 billion.
It is a very successful economic entity. VisitBritain says that more
than 900,000 football-watching visitors spent nearly £700
million attending games, so it attracts a wide amount of inward
investment as well. It is an economic success and one that can be built
on and developed. The Premier League can genuinely argue that it
provides huge social, economic and cultural benefits to the UK and, as
we have heard, it is a major soft-power element. The noble Lord, Lord
Bates, 
<?notus-xml column=1455?>mentioned the link with the British Council, and with football being a

of concerns. They are about long-term financial sustainability, the
effectiveness of diversity policies, the way in which the Premier
League deals with its supporters, whether sufficient money is

Faulkner said, the success of the Premier League comes with some
downsides: for young talent, for the other leagues engaged in the game
and, of course, for the national team. Then there is the matter of the
DCMS Select Committee report on governance and related matters in July
2011 and the Government’s response, which was presented to
Parliament as long ago as October 2011. As has been said, it is not for
the Government to run football or indeed any other sport. Sports are
best governed by modern, transparent, accountable and representative
national governing bodies able to act decisively in the long-term
interests of the sport. That is not what we have here. As my noble

have a number of concerns about the way in which the current

debt has to be brought under control. Financial fair play, which was
referred to by a number of noble Lords, provides an opportunity for
clubs to bring their spending under control. However, as it strictly

is astonishing that Premier League net debt last year was £2.4
billion; £1.4 billion of this came from interest-free soft loans

pressure on the lower leagues to keep up. The Championship has a net
debt of some £0.9 billion. That is worrying as the lower
professional leagues have higher wage-to-revenue ratios than the

raised the issue of wages. If wages are to continue to spiral out of
control, particularly with increased TV rights money becoming

70% last year. Of the big five leagues—England, Germany, Spain,

in areas such as harassment, bigotry and homophobia and in ensuring

following the pinnacle of English football. Although for some it was
controversial at its inauguration—a breakaway group of clubs
striking out against the formative traditions of the sport—the

watch top-flight football. The league is supporting the
“Great” Britain campaign, to which my noble friend Lord
Bates made reference, with focal points for soft diplomacy across the
world. In the past week alone, officials in Costa Rica, Vietnam and
Bulgaria have been reporting back on the leverage that engagement with

programme. It is the height of league performance, and its profile

bigger picture of the contribution that football as a sport makes to
the UK. For example, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the
Premier League and the FA jointly fund the Football Foundation, and
have spent £780 million over the past 10 years, investing in
grassroots facilities. The Football Association invests upward of
£43 million each year in supporting the grass-roots game, as the
national governing body. The noble Lord, Lord Pendry, made reference to

referred to governance issues. The sums of money reported in the
business of football jar in the current economic climate. The will of
the ownership is not always consistent with the wishes of the fans. The

£3 billion. This wealth should surely bring with it a share of
responsibilities. The noble Lords, Lord Lipsey and Lord Graham,

matter taken very seriously across government, and if the football
authorities themselves cannot effect change then we have pledged to

This ensures that the entry and exit points of the professional game
support continuing player development, allow young players to keep
playing and potentially allow for their return into the professional
structure, should their future development allow
it.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-25?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_25_PT_1/4CDE12CD0EA91CB9156096C15345E9B37E02E762" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 25 July 2013">Thursday,

Brinton raised the question of football academies. As she says, not
every academy player will make the Premier League and it is vital that
supplementary training prepares them for this eventuality. The best
examples of integrated training do indeed leave youngsters prepared for
a future outside of football. As she says, Ofsted has rated as
outstanding the Premier League in its best practice report of April
2012, noting that apprentices

European 
<?notus-xml column=1460?>sport. We have also been involved in APPG meetings where sport and
languages have been associated. We think that that perhaps will be
wider than the vocabulary that my noble friend Lord Lyell was claiming
to possess in this respect, perhaps reflective of the language that the
noble Lord, Lord Birt, recalls hearing at his local game. Inevitably,
with its international flavour, sport encourages the learning of
languages.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072524000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072524000106">The

and numeracy. These have had a powerful effect, particularly in
disadvantaged areas. Training also extends to the work of many Premier

influence hearts and minds and, as my noble friend Lady Brinton says,
can transform the lives of many young

inclusion and anti-discrimination action plan for English football has
set clear targets across the game and is now reporting significant
progress in initiating its work against discriminatory behaviours. A
better understanding of equality and inclusion in the environment of
football is being created, ensuring that it is open to a wide and
diverse talent pool. I pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Ouseley, and
the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, for the work that they have done against
racism. I note their concerns that there is not an ethnic mix at the
top of the managerial and professional tree. The statistics do not read
well, but we welcome the work that bodies such as Sporting
Equals—funded by Sport England—are doing in partnership
with clubs such as Liverpool, as well as the work that Kick It Out and
Showing Racism the Red Card, mentioned by noble Lords, have been
carrying out successfully to encourage greater diversity of coaching
staff at all levels. This is a key part of the Football For All

we commemorate the Olympic and Paralympic legacy one year on, some have
noted the successful inclusion of British football teams in the London
2012 Olympic Games. It did immeasurable good for the profile of the
women’s game, setting a record attendance figure of over 80,000
at the gold medal match. It offered many more thousands of spectators
the opportunity to enjoy watching Olympic competition, and incoming
Olympic tourists the opportunity to enjoy visiting the hosting cities
outside
London.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072524000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072524000110">The

face. My noble friend Lady Brinton pointed to the lack of gender
balance in this particular debate. I suppose that it is just as well
that my noble friend Lord Gardiner was double-booked on this occasion,
as I have been able to raise, at least slightly, the participation
rate. We also note that the Women’s Super League is expanding to
two leagues in 2014 and that many participating clubs are affiliated
with Premier League sides, enjoying the facilities and expertise
provided, including a new side from the 
<?notus-xml column=1461?>Manchester City stable. Although it may not yet attract the same funding
as the men’s game, the relationship between the two is
improving.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072524000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072524000111">We
entered Olympic football as Team GB for the first time in 52 years, but
the merit of any future Olympic participation in men’s or
women’s football must be left to the football associations and
the BOA. Team GB Football more regularly appears in the Paralympic
roster and squads will no doubt continue to represent us with pride in
Rio 2016 and beyond. We must not forget other British football squads,
such as those who attended the recent World University Games, or
Universiade, which is now one of the world’s largest multi-sport
events. Following a successful campaign, in Kazan, Russia, the British
men returned with silver and the women with gold, with a squad
featuring many players tipped for full international duty. Through
their successes I have no doubt that both teams, and the wider squad of
athletes and support staff, have done much for the global face of
British

that a proportion of that income should be given back direct to the

Lord Faulkner, with the National Football Museum; the noble Lord, Lord
Watson of Invergowrie; and my noble friend Lord Taylor of Warwick, who
is still playing. I felt that it was an excellent debate from that

with a little caution. Some of us were watching last month when the

Rio against Brazil to draw 2-2. The truth will be found out next month

about how inaccessible many Premier League football grounds are. I
encourage the Government Front Bench to consider dispatching the noble

unbelievers crept in for the debate, perhaps ahead of the debate that
will follow on atheism; the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, embarked on a
heresy, but made a very valuable contribution to the debate, as did 
<?notus-xml column=1463?>my noble friend Lord Addington. I will make a brief point about the
number of players, which is that yes, 30% of the players who play in
the Premier League are from England and eligible to play for the
English national team. However, that does not reflect the true picture.
If you take into account the Scottish, Northern Irish and Welsh
players, we move up to 40%. If we followed the example of rugby and the
British Lions and had a team of that nature, we would be on par with
what is happening in Germany. Perhaps we ought to look at that. Why do
the national teams not succeed? That is another debate, and I do not
want to embark on it. It is probably because we over-obsess about past
glory in 1966 rather than future glory, and perhaps also because for
some of the players the greatest pinnacle of success is winning the
Champions League medal rather than a World Cup medal. Again, we shall

walking it—and at a measured pace. However, that pace will be
sprightly during the first half of the walk because I have to get to
Manchester for 17 August, when Newcastle plays Manchester City in the

silent majority, for those of us who do not attend any place of
worship, whether church, mosque or synagogue. It is a silent majority,
whose full contribution to British society has perhaps been unsung for
too long. In contrast, we find that religious voices are ever more
present, and sometimes shrill, in the public square. However, because
atheism is a philosophical viewpoint, arrived at individually and
personally, we are not given to marching in the street chanting,
“What do we want? Atheism! When do we want it? 
<?notus-xml column=1464?>Now!”. As a humanist who senses that religion has neither rhyme
nor reason, I believe that we should ensure that our needs and concerns
are met and satisfied in that public square, as they are in the private

non-religious ethical life stance based on reason, humanity, and a

necessarily describe themselves as humanist, nevertheless a great many
of those who are non-religious are essentially humanist in outlook. The
increase in the proportion of the population which is non-religious is
demonstrated not only by the 2011 census results, in which the
non-religious element rose from 15% in the 2001 census to 25% in 2011,

thoughts for the day. We are told that all other broadcasting is
sufficient to absorb that which we may want to say. There are, however,
true problems for atheists and humanists that should be properly
addressed, knotty problems that we have to confront. I believe that, in
fairness, that should happen. I also point to religious broadcasting
that is of a better nature, such as the “Sunday”
programme, which my wife and I listen to regularly, especially when
chaired by the excellent Edward Stourton, who never allows his Roman
Catholicism to stand in the way of his forensic journalistic instincts.
I was heartened to hear the noble Baroness, Lady Berridge, in a recent

Whitaker:</Member></B> My Lords, I intend to go rather farther back
than my noble friend’s powerful speech. I congratulate him on
giving us this opportunity to go a little wider and deeper than our
usual deliberations. My thesis is that our idea of the good society has
its roots in many traditions, some of which are humanism and atheism,
and that the contribution of humanist thought is significantly
underrated and denied its status in our education and our social
policy. I declare an unremunerated interest as a vice-president of the
British Humanist Association, whose causes my noble friend has so
eloquently described.</hs_para>

“humanism” I do not mean the Christian Platonism of
Erasmus and his followers, although it is perfectly reasonable to call
them humanists because that is what he called himself. For the purposes
of this debate, I mean people whose ethical framework is unattached to
religious belief. Strictly, I leave out later thinkers whose ideas
chimed with humanism such as Montaigne, who would have courted death if
they spoke in those terms. However, rather as early Christians thought
Virgil was one of them, I hope that I can count Montaigne as
sympathetic to the values of
humanism.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072524000144" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072524000144">Democritus,
from fifth century Greece, was clearly an atheist. For our debate,
perhaps his most significant contribution was his idea that there were
systems which controlled how materials behaved—in effect,
physics and chemistry. He also had a clear picture of the difference
between subjective and objective perception. Both these extraordinarily
modern-seeming theories offered an alternative to the supernatural and
shamanic versions of the world available at the time. Bertrand Russell
thought Democritus was simply lucky in his conclusions, but Lucretius,
Democritus’s much later Roman disciple, gave a series of
empirical arguments for the same beliefs. The great beauty of <I>De
Rerum 
<?notus-xml column=1468?>Natura</I> is its idea of a world determined by natural laws. It was
astonishingly prescient—and, incidentally, was saved for our
post-classical world by a Christian scholar. We do not acknowledge
these two giants much as we go about our lives but we still stand on
their shoulders, in Isaac Newton’s graphic
phrase.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072524000145" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072524000145">I
should also like to claim the sceptics of the Enlightenment such as
Voltaire, but more exactly he and some of his contemporaries were
deists, so perhaps I may call them fellow travellers. There were
certainly avowed atheists among them, such as Diderot and the German
Matthias Knutzen, who proposed conscience and reason as the only guides
to behaviour. We could also claim Spinoza, with his idea of the human
mind. To jump a couple of centuries, we teach George Eliot and Thomas
Hardy as civilised and penetrating writers, but do we acknowledge
equally their atheist values? I think we could with advantage put John
Stuart Mill’s pellucid <I>Three Essays </I><I>o</I><I>n

it matter to give humanism its due? After all, world views come and go.
Who today respects the truths of Zoroaster—apart from the folk
my noble friend referred to? Before some eminent Parsee Member of your
Lordships’ House gets up to say, “Ahura Mazda

humanism, at least, because of the enduring nature of its tenets and,
above all, their capacity to unite people of different faiths and none

contribution produce? It would strengthen the part played in ethics by
conduct. It might give some credit to a tradition that goes back even
earlier than the Abrahamic religions—much earlier even than
classical Greece—to the religious tolerance of Ashoka, the great
Indian king of the sixth century BCE, or to the idea of human rights in
the Code of Hammurabi three centuries earlier. It might draw a
continuum from those milestones to the atheist inventors of the United
Nations and its founding charter of human rights. I wish that this
Government respected what human rights are really about, as their
founders down the centuries have. Acknowledgment of humanist traditions
of thought would help to put that in proper perspective. More emphasis
on conduct rather than faith or revealed axioms would be beneficial in
the education of our diverse society. It would make a better way to
educate our children together to form one society, whatever their
affiliation to a particular religion or

Meacher:</Member></B> My Lords, I applaud the noble Lord, Lord
Harrison, for giving us the opportunity to consider this increasingly
important subject. I make clear at the outset that I am not against
religion, so long as religious believers adhere to the basic ethical
principles of empathy and compassion. In my view, any Church of England
member today would adhere to those principles. My other request is that
people of religion should be open to the scientific method when they
come to understand how the universe works, even if this requires them
to adjust their belief in the supernatural. Where a religion departs
from these principles—if, for example, adherence to a religious
belief requires female genital mutilation—I part company with
it, and I am sure that every noble Lord would agree with that view.
That is the issue. Many religions have gone wildly off course over the
ages.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072524000152" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072524000152">To put
my cards on the table, I would probably describe myself as a humanist
Quaker. Yes, there are Quakers who do not believe in a supernatural
God. I wonder how many people who call themselves Christian would also
reject the idea of a supernatural God and would interpret the
resurrection simply as symbolic of the human capacity for
renewal—nothing more. I remember asking a very dear verger who
worked with me on mental health many years ago, “Do you really
believe the words of the Creed?”. He said, “I
don’t really think I believe any of it, but I find it helpful to
be in a spiritual place and to ponder on things other than the
material, and other than the worries of today”. Was he really a
Christian? If he was, perhaps for many Christians the term
“Christianity” is synonymous with
humanism.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072524000153" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072524000153">One
reason to promote humanism is the need to distinguish religious sects
that subscribe to the basic ethical principles of humanity and those
that do not. We cannot just assume that because somebody is religious,
they have to be good, and if they are not religious they have to be
bad. Another reason is the rapidly growing proportion of the population
who are not religious at all. The noble Lord, Lord Harrison, referred
to the figures. It is staggering that about half the population today
do not have a religion. Religion is dying fast. Only one-third of 18 to
24 year-olds belong to a religion, compared with 72% of those over 65.
Humanist values are thus absolutely vital to our society if we are not
to decline into the amoral, brutish existence of which people
speak.</hs_para>

the way in his book, <I>Beyond Religion</I>. He argues that compassion

concern, affection and warm-heartedness. The Dalai Lama—a

know from evolutionary biology and neuroscience that these values are
innate in our biological nature. Humans survive and thrive only if they
espouse these values. We need to promote these values within ourselves
and in others. Many will say that they pursue ethical and humanist
principles because of their religion. That seems fine to me; perhaps I
part company with some of my colleagues in the Chamber today. Others
work towards achieving compassion through mindfulness or meditation.
That for me is good. I am not myself very good at it, but I believe
that others are and greatly benefit from it. The important point is
that we all agree on the humanist values by which the world should
strive to live. It would be helpful if everyone also accepted the
scientific method as the means to understand the universe, but I
understand that not everybody takes that view. Humanists have
campaigned for many of the great reforms of the past century, as the
noble Lord, Lord Harrison, has already
said.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072524000156" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072524000156">I want
to spend a minute to focus on another great humanist and, in my view,
religious challenge over the next year—the Assisted Dying Bill.
The principle of autonomy—the right of every human being to have
control over decisions affecting their health and, indeed, their life
and death—is perhaps the most fundamental ethical principle of
all. I was chair of a clinical ethics committee for a health trust for
some years and we had to consider some very complex issues for
clinicians. The only way to be sure that our guidance would be in the
patient’s best interests and satisfy the ultimate humanist
principle of compassion was to put the autonomy of the patient at the
centre of our
debates.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072524000157" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072524000157">The
same applies to how we die. If patients who are terminally ill can make
their own decisions about how and when to die, society cannot go wrong.
Of course we need safeguards to ensure that callous and greedy
relatives cannot in some way lead a patient to say something that they
do not want to say, but those safeguards are in the Bill and will be in
place if it passes. Last November, Rabbi Dr Jonathan Romain established
Inter-Faith Leaders for Dignity in Dying, an inter-faith group of
clergy who favour the aims of Dignity in Dying, including the Falconer
Bill. This proposed legislation is not contrary to religion, and I hope
that those on the Bishops’ Benches may be able to support us. A
YouGov survey commissioned by Inter-Faith Leaders for Dignity in Dying
found that 62% of people who identified themselves as belonging to a
religion support the legalisation of assisted dying for terminally ill
people with mental capacity. Only

others is interpreted simply as disloyalty to one’s tribe.
Within the church, we are not immune to this problem. None the less,
the Christian tradition points to the wider generosity; when Jesus was
asked for an example of neighbourliness, he told a story about the
Samaritan and not a good religious Jew, such as himself. I hope that,
among many other themes, this debate will challenge intolerant
tribalism in all walks of life wherever we find
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072524000160" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072524000160">While my
Christian faith came alive in Idi Amin’s Uganda when I was 18,
many of my closest friends are more comfortable with atheism or

about life, meaning, the universe and everything else. We may have
different views or come to different conclusions. We may even become
stronger in our own conclusions. I should add that on the subject of
the resurrection that my views on its veracity have not changed much

contribution that people of various beliefs, religious or not, make to

not doubt that we will hear more of those this afternoon—but by
the actions that those beliefs inspire them to take. There are
committed humanists, atheists, Christians, and those of other religions
and faiths and of no faith, in every political party and independent
person represented in this House and in the other place. As we have
already begun to hear, members of the church work regularly,
constructively and happily alongside humanists and atheists in pursuit
of the common good. I am delighted that the noble Lord who has given us

difference is perhaps that religious people and religions usually offer
a collective practice, in worship and social action, whereas one
notices from time to time, in spite of the association, that humanists
and atheists contribute more as individuals. This should not stop us
working together, when we can be allies 
<?notus-xml column=1472?>one day and even if we are opponents another, achieving together what we
can and learning from each other when we are opposed. The boundaries
between belief systems are a good deal more fluid than most people
assume. For example, there is a long and honourable tradition of
Christian humanism, traceable back to the Middle Ages. The noble
Baroness spoke of thinkers such as Erasmus. This tradition focuses on
Jesus’s message about the basic moral significance of human
beings. We tend mainly in modernity to see the opening up between
theistic religion and humanism. I do not suggest for a moment that most
humanists are closet Christians, but there are Christians who espouse
humanist values in addition to the source of their own faith. In Nrimol
Hriday in Calcutta you could see the work of Mother Teresa in caring
for the dying, which was loving presence for its own sake for those
needy
people.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072524000163" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072524000163">I
wonder why the British Humanist Association, which has been mentioned
with such strength, often adopts for instance such a strongly
secularist approach, which would exclude religion from the public
square. Everybody comes from somewhere and every position that we hold
rests on beliefs of one sort or another. The massive contribution
offered to society by atheists and humanists, no less than religious
people, happens because good actions flow out of worthwhile beliefs and
systems. Seeking to confine people’s beliefs to the private
realm and expecting good actions to flow in public seems to me to get
cause and effect rather mixed
up.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072524000164" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072524000164">As an
example of the potential alliances in the public square, there is the
service of registered humanist practitioners in offering humanist
funerals, which the noble Lord has mentioned. The Church of England has
been able to work behind the scenes with the British Humanist
Association to find an approach to humanist weddings that would work
for us both. There have been similar alignments between us on the
important issue that has already been touched on in connection with
freedom of speech. These give evidence that theistic religions and
non-theistic belief organisations can inhabit the public square
together for the benefit of all. There could be more examples if there
were wide agreement that a society marked by plurality of religions and
beliefs is a much more promising model than secularism’s
attenuated understanding of the public realm.</hs_para>

Layard:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, greatly welcome this debate. I
have to admit that I was a founder member of the Cambridge Humanists in
the 1950s when I had 
<?notus-xml column=1473?>great hopes for humanism, but which I think have been only partly
fulfilled. Humanism has done very well on the negative side in
rebutting unreasonable beliefs and unreasonable laws but much less well
on the positive side in providing a thriving and flourishing secular
morality, which is what many of us had hoped it would
do<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T14:51:21"></hs_TimeCode>. I believe
that that failure has had quite serious effects on our society because
more and more people have abandoned a morality based on religion. It
has not been replaced with anything as powerful or with the same
emotional force as that provided through the churches, so the way has
been left open for the increasing growth of a “me first”
philosophy of
life<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T14:51:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that? Two things are needed. First, there has to be a much clearer,
more powerful expression of what humanists positively believe
in—not what they do not believe in. Secondly, there have to be
institutions which embody those beliefs. As the right reverend Prelate
said, the churches provide the social support for religious belief. It
is not easy to lead a good life on your own without social support. You
are much more likely to do so if part of your identity is that you are
a member of an institution committed to ethical living. We desperately
need more such institutions of a secular kind that can support the
majority of our citizens who are not practising members of a
religion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T14:52:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

exactly how these new institutions will develop and what they will look
like. I am involved in an attempt to create one such institution,
Action for Happiness, and I shall tell the House a little about it. We
now have 30,000 members. The first thing a member has to do is pledge
to live so as to create as much happiness and as little misery in the
world as they can. The movement provides them with materials that can
help in that endeavour. Increasingly, it aims to create real
face-to-face communities that are more like the churches in their
physical expression, or perhaps the early Christian cells, in order to
help people to live in this
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T14:53:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072524000169" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072524000169">Action
for Happiness’s ethical stance is very simple. It is really
important that humanism develops a very simple ethical creed which can
generate people’s energy, loyalty and commitment. It says,
first, that everyone matters equally and, secondly, what matters about
them is their quality of life as they experience it—in other
words, their happiness. If you put the two together, you arrive at an
obligation on each of us to try to produce as much happiness and as
little misery as we can in the world. This is the most obvious
foundation for a humanist secular morality which could carry our
society

course, it has much in common with the golden rule that we should do
unto others as we would like them to do unto us. When it comes to what

should not do what we would not like others to do to us. However, there
is a difference in relation to what we should do; that is, how we
should conduct our lives in a positive way to make the world a better
place, as was just said. There are some problems about the golden rule
and whether we should do to others what we want them to do to us. We
may want them to get a job but that does not mean we should give them
jobs:  
<?notus-xml column=1474?>it might not be practical. We need a more practical expression of how
you can live positively. I cannot think of a better or more inspiring

myself saying something like, “If you want to teach morality on

humanists, we need a firm view of what we believe and we absolutely
need institutions. We need to see that our views are taught in schools
and featured in “Thought for the Day”. However, much the
most important remaining task is to build institutions which inspire
and uplift people, and enhance their commitment to ethical living. I
urge all humanists to turn their minds to building institutions for the
promotion of secular morality. Obviously, they should be modelled to an
extent on the experience of the churches and people should meet
regularly. Through that they would uplift their spirits and strengthen
their resolve to live

Harries of Pentregarth:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, am very grateful
to the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, for an opportunity to speak in this
debate and I put my name down to speak in an entirely positive manner.
I believe that we should recognise and rejoice in what is good,
wherever it comes from. I warmly welcome the contribution that
humanists have made to our society. In its modern sense, I take it that
the word humanism refers to a set of values focused on the well-being
and flourishing of human beings without recourse to any kind of
metaphysical foundation or goal. Humanists may be atheist or agnostic
but their value system stands on its own. This is best described as
secular humanism, which I take is what we are focused on in this
debate. It can be distinguished from Christian humanism, which is
grounded in a religious world view, although it shares many of the
values of secular
humanism<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T14:58:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072524000175" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072524000175">The
distinctive contribution of secular humanism to our society since the
19th century can, in general terms, be summed up in one sentence: it
has opposed religious dogmatism when that dogmatism was seen to be
blocking progressive social changes that we now all take for granted.
Humanists can be found supporting all the great causes of the past 200
years from the anti-slavery movement to votes for women, as often as
not working alongside Christians. So I warmly welcome that
contribution<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T14:59:11"></hs_TimeCode>.
However, I have two questions to ask, which I do so as genuine
questions, not in a polemical spirit. First, where do the values of
secular humanism come from? Secondly, what is going to sustain them in
the future?</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=1475?><hs_para UID="13072524000176" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072524000176">The Canadian philosopher
Charles Taylor’s massive book, <I>A Secular Age</I>,<I>
</I>addresses the first question. He argues against all
“subtraction stories”, as he calls them, according to
which modernity sees itself as having sloughed off or liberated itself
from certain limiting beliefs. Instead, he argues that what we mean by
a secular age, in which for the first time a self-sufficient humanism
has become a widely available option, is the product of a long
historical development which he traces back to the medieval age when
new religious orders were founded specifically to live and work in
cities. He continues the story through the Reformation, with its
emphasis on the value of the lay vocation and lay work, and the
development of secular life through to our own times. In short, what we
value today in a secular humanist view of the world is an achievement
brought about by a long process of predominantly Christian history.
Secular humanist values did not simply come from
nowhere<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T15:00:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Lady Whitaker, mentioned George Eliot and Thomas Hardy, two novelists I
hugely admire. George Eliot probably had a greater range of depth and
sympathy than any other writer in the English language, yet until well
into adult life, both were deeply devout and serious Christians. They
lost their Christian faith but they kept their Christian values, or
they kept values which they no longer regarded as specifically
Christian. However, those values had been formed by some process. I
make this point not to take any particular credit for the Christian
church, whose record is of course mixed, but in order to sharpen up my
next question: if these values are the product of a long, substantially
Christian history, what will sustain them into the future? The Nobel
prize-winning poet, Seamus Heaney, has said that, “Some kind of
metaphysics has disappeared from the common life. I think we are
running on an unconscious that is informed by religious values, but I
think my youngster’s youngsters won’t have that”.
If that is true, what can create, inspire, sustain and strengthen a
durable moral consensus into the future? It is a genuine question to
which for so many there is no clear or obvious answer, so it was very
good in particular to hear the noble Lord, Lord Layard, address it
directly with a degree of urgency and
seriousness.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072524000178" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072524000178">This
leads on to my final point. Michael Sandel, the Harvard professor and
Reith lecturer, has argued that for 30 years or more, our society has
been dominated by a combination of social and market liberalism. In
short, the value of free choice has been allowed to override and ignore
all other values. In a series of brilliant examples, he shows that this
is unsustainable and that our deepest instincts want a much thicker,
richer set of values, for our public and our private lives. Our society
is lacking a substantial and widely shared moral vision. I believe that
secular humanists and Christian humanists could be allies in the task
of moving our society away from the rampant individualism that now
dominates our life. Of course there will be disagreements when it comes
to spelling out in detail what that wider set of values consists of and
what their policy implications should be—there will probably be
some disagreement over the assisted dying Bill—but 
<?notus-xml column=1476?>such is the need of society for something better than we have now, those
disagreements are worth facing and working
through.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072524000179" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072524000179">So I
warmly welcome the contribution that secular humanism has made to our
society, but in no polemical spirit I will ask this: what is going to
sustain, nurture and strengthen its values in the years ahead? Finally,
I note the need for a much wider, deeper and richer ethical framework
for our society than the current relentless emphasis on free choice
provides. I suggest that this is a challenge that secular humanists and
Christian humanists might do well to try to meet
together.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-25?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_25_PT_1/0BF600AFB7417EFA5DE1AD2DAA667F43A98EAF54" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 25 July 2013">Thursday,

Maxton:</Member></B> My Lords, first, I thank my noble friend Lord
Harrison for introducing this debate and for the very temperate way in
which he did so. I am an atheist despite once receiving a birthday card
from a sister-in-law which said, “I used to be an atheist until
I realised I was God”. I do not even believe that. I am an
atheist and a humanist, but I am now going to be slightly more divisive
than has so far been the case. I am an anti-clerical atheist. I do not
believe that history proves that the churches and religion have been
good for the world. All right, it may be that I studied history and
that I go back a long way. It used to be the case that churches hanged
people in this country because they did not go to church. Even if you
look at the record of the Church of England and that Bishops’
Bench over 200 years on, for instance, the abolition of capital
punishment when atheists such as Bradlaugh were introducing that
proposal, they consistently voted against it. They wanted to keep
capital punishment right up until the end. I accept that the churches
are now against it, but it took them a long time to come round to

course there have been good Christians and of course there have been
good people from all religions who have tried to help the poorest in
our societies in any way they can. After all, I am a member of the
Labour Party, which in part was formed by people who came from the
Christian tradition and who wanted to help. Kier Hardie himself was an

better society, not just in this country but throughout Europe and the
western world, than we did in the past. We live in a society that looks
after the poor and the elderly, and which helps those who are widowed

of a research institute at Oxford University and was at the
professorial level. He died on 6 May 1951, one day after my
15th birthday. My mother received from the university his
salary for the first five or six days of May, and that was all. There
was no widow’s pension, but now all 
<?notus-xml column=1477?>that has changed. It is interesting to note, although I am not making a
direct correlation, but as our society has improved, so has religion
declined. The number of people who believe has gone down and down as

fact that if you look at the countries which all the research shows
have the lowest number of people who believe in religion, you will find
that they have the lowest crime rates, the lowest levels of infant
mortality, the best education systems and the best social security
systems. They are, of course, Sweden, Denmark, Canada to some extent,
Estonia and countries of that nature. In the United States, the states
with the lowest crime rates and the best systems of education and so on
are in fact those which have the lowest number of people who believe in
religion. I am not making a direct correlation between the two, but it
is difficult not to. The fact is that that is what is happening.

point. We have not yet had the figures for the extent of religious
belief in Scotland—where I come from—but it is likely to
be in the region of a majority of people, or just under that, of
non-believers. If you apply the same increase as in England, it will be
a majority. If that is the case, surely we have to have major changes
in public policy. We have to look at our broadcasting and our public
broadcasting in particular—the BBC—and at which people we
allow, for example, on “Thought for the Day”. Personally,
I would abolish “Thought for the Day” altogether. I would

Morgan:</Member></B> My Lords, I will make one point and one point
only. Modern Britain has had the enormous benefit of not being torn
apart by doctrinal or political conflict between the churches and
unbelievers. That has been an enormous contribution to our social peace
and very different from, for example, the situation in France, which is
relevant as it is my wife’s country. She is a Huguenot—a
Protestant—and the Huguenot community have suffered from the
savagery of intolerant belief. There has been a long confrontation
between church and state in modern France, including bitter assaults on
the church by freemasons, republicans and socialists. The church itself
has identified with nationalists, militarists and, during the Dreyfus
case, anti-Semites. It is still evident today, in the disgraceful
attacks on Muslim women in France in the name of secularism. This kind
of intolerance is perhaps most notable in 
<?notus-xml column=1478?>Catholic countries but is also visible in Protestant ones—witness
the role of the religious right in the United
States.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072524000187" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072524000187">Why<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T15:12:21"></hs_TimeCode>
have we been luckier? In my opinion, it is for two historical reasons.
The churches have discovered how to retreat, while atheists and
humanists have discovered how to protest properly. The church, as we
know, had a virtual monopoly of civil and social power in the early
19th century in Britain. It was persuaded—or politically
forced—to give way on issue after issue, such as admission to
universities and religious rites. It retreated in its views on science,
coming to accept evolution, and on social issues such as property
rights and industrial relations. Most powerfully, as we discovered in
this House recently, it has profitably retreated in its views on moral
attitudes, most notably on the debate on gay marriage. The noble
Baroness, Lady Stowell of Beeston, was able to appeal to the better
angels of our nature as we considered that
issue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072524000188" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072524000188">I have
the honour of following the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries
of Pentregarth, and one of the most remarkable retreats was in Wales,
where the church accepted its own disestablishment and being seized out
of the part of the province of Canterbury. The view of the Church in
Wales—yr Eglwys yng Nghymru—as a Church of England in
Wales is now completely out of date.</hs_para>

atheists and humanists have become much more effective in their
approach. Beginning, perhaps, from a literary or philosophical
emphasis—Diderot and the encyclopaedists have been
mentioned—they added scientific triumphalism in the 19th
century. Humanists assumed power in public life, for example John
Morley, who famously described Gladstone with a large G and God with a
small one. Atheists were forced to defend themselves—Bradlaugh
did, for example, in order to take his seat in the House of
Commons—and non-religious conscientious objectors were
persecuted in both world wars. However, the more aggressive and
divisive forms of protest were broadly rejected. Dogmatic
anti-religious creeds such as positivism or Auguste Comte’s
religion of humanity were not accepted and made little headway in this
country. The emphasis, if one can so describe it, was on
humanism—the value of the individual, the power of an
individual’s moral quest for truth and the values of human
brotherhood resulting from that—rather than on doctrinaire
atheism.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13072524000190" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072524000190">I am

Holyoake<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T15:15:23"></hs_TimeCode>, who
chose in 1851 to describe himself as a secularist not as an atheist. He
took part in a famous debate with Bradlaugh on the proposition:
“The principles of Secularism do not include Atheism”.
His heroes were humanist men of letters such as Erasmus and Montaigne,
who have been mentioned today and who both of course declared
themselves to be Christians. So it has been that humanists, as we have
heard, have been able to act effectively with religious idealists in
progressive crusades, from the anti-slavery to the anti-apartheid
movements.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072524000191" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072524000191">The
outstanding product of that is the outfit to which 10 of the 17
speakers this afternoon belong—the Labour Party. It was hugely
important, with all respect to my noble friend who just spoke, that the
Labour Party did not lapse into the anti-clericalism of the 
<?notus-xml column=1479?>French or German socialist parties. The views of the Labour Party were
pluralist. They ranged from the undoubted atheism of the Webbs, many of
the Fabians and HG Wells, side-by-side with members of the Independent
Labour Party in South Wales and in the West Riding, which brought in a
Christian ethos. Nothing was more stimulating for the labour movement
in south Wales than the religious revival of 1904. I make that point
because I made it in my first book and nobody paid any attention, so
perhaps 50-odd years on people will pay attention.</hs_para>

rhetoric and values were shaped by Cornish chapels. His values formed a
bridge, I think, within the labour movement. In the social Christianity
of our age, Tawney has been, I believe, our dominant philosophical
inspiration. The Labour Party benefited from this. The whole range of
creeds has worked for social justice. Now I hope they will work for the
doctrine of human rights, which massively appeals both to humanists and
to Christians. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is truly
universal in that

Flather:</Member></B> My Lords, in this debate, which the noble Lord,
Lord Harrison, has initiated, I feel that it is a great privilege to be
able to speak about one’s views. We do not always get that
opportunity. This debate is about the contribution that atheists and
humanists have made to the United Kingdom and society—indeed, to
the world, not just to the United Kingdom. We have never killed anybody
in the name of atheism or humanism. We have never harmed anybody in the
name of atheism or humanism. I think that is a good
start.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072524000194" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072524000194">If you
look at religion and its history and consider how the world would have
been without religion, what things would not have happened, and how
would that have shaped us today? The noble Lord, Lord Maxton, has
hinted and spoken about that, but I would like emphasise it. For a
start, we would not have had 9/11, we would not have had 7/7, and we
would not have a young soldier being beheaded on the streets of London.
Those are just present-day events. We would not have the Crusades. We
might not have had the great build-up of problems between Christians
and Muslims. So many things have come about through religion that would
not have happened. We would not have had the conflict in Northern
Ireland, which has already been mentioned. We would not have had the
Spanish Inquisition. We would not have had witch hunts. There are so
many things about religion historically that are amazingly
awful.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072524000195" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072524000195">What
has surprised me today is how few people are here to defend religion.
People have not defended religion today; even the Bishops have been
very gentle, kind and appreciative of people like me. What has also
surprised me is that this debate has been much more about humanism than
about atheism. We have not had 
<?notus-xml column=1480?>any real atheists speaking about their views. I am not a humanist. I was
elected vice-chairman of the Humanist All-Party Group a few years ago,
and I told the members then that I was not a humanist. They said,
“Don’t worry, we are a broad church”. Make what
you will of it. I am very happy to be with humanists, but I am not one.
I resist belonging to any organised group, and that is probably what
stops me joining the humanists.</hs_para>

religion for its own sake, but I find that some of the things for which
religion has been responsible are just too awful to think about.
Another thing that has not been mentioned today, which I think is
extremely important, is the treatment of women. How has religion
treated women through the centuries, and how is it still treating
women? How many religious people are standing up to fight against that?
What is happening to women? We have honour killings, women being beaten
and mutilation, which has been mentioned already. There is no end of
things. You may say, “It is the Muslims”, but Catholics,
particularly, are also greatly at fault. Every Catholic church in
Africa says that it is a sin to have family planning or abortion.
Children can be born and can die without food, but family planning or
abortion must not be allowed. Where are the poor women to go? The men
do not care. If a man in Africa has 10 children, he is seen as virile.
He does not care whether his children live or die. I asked the new most
reverend Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury to ask the Anglican
churches in Africa to talk about family planning. He said, “I
can’t tell them anything. They will think us a colonial
power”, but he is the head of the Anglican Church and he should
take responsibility to make sure that Anglican churches in Africa at
least speak about family planning and look at issues about
women’s suffering. For that alone I think religion is to be
condemned, because no religion so far has supported women through the
ages. If they had, women would not be in the position they are today. I
make that point very strongly because it upsets me greatly to see what
is happening to women in the
world.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072524000197" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072524000197">The
right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Birmingham talked about Mother
Teresa. Really, Mother Teresa was stocking up for her sainthood. She
campaigned constantly against family planning. She took the dying off
the streets; what about helping the living? Did she help the living?
No, she collected the dying. You have to help the living. You have to
change people’s views if you really want sainthood. I do not
think sainthood is for people who think about what they are going to
get in the next

running on, so I will take just a few moments to tell you about the
atheists I have most admired: Bertrand Russell; James Watson—I
sat next to him at dinner once; Warren Buffett—I have not met

Bertrand Russell’s godfather. These people contributed to our
thinking, to science and to making a better world. As far as
creationism is concerned, the US is still struggling over whether
creationism should be taught in schools; now there is also intelligent
design, which says that something nudged the universe into creating
humans or something like that.</hs_para>

I will reflect on why I became a humanist. I think it was,
subconsciously, when I was at school, although I was not aware then, or
indeed for many years, of the term “humanism”. I studied
religious education at A-level and was thrilled by the language of the
Bible—Old and New Testaments—and moved by stories of
self-sacrifice, pride, humility, friendship, human strength and
frailty. I studied other religions as well and began to question why so
many of their histories included wars, revenge, killings, verbal
attacks, prejudice and bigotry, all in the name of religious faith.
Others have raised this already. Of course, I have since met many
people of religious faith, including in your Lordships’ House,
who consistently condemn violence and preach tolerance and equality and
the need to work together as human beings for a just and fair
society.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072524000203" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072524000203">During
my later days at school, I began to think that I had formulated,
however imperfectly, a personal code—a secular morality, if you
like—which came not from a single god or gods but from curiosity
about the human condition, how we function in a problematic world
without being constantly shaken by hostile events and how we need the
support of other human beings in our struggle to express ourselves and
behave with grace and honour. It is a core of respect or appreciation
for self and others. It is a belief in humanity—the knowledge
that when things go wrong, someone of good will can offer
support.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072524000204" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072524000204">I
also studied English and had the joy of coming across EM Forster.
<I>Passage to India</I> was one of the set books—were we not
lucky? It is not only a novel about the struggle for tolerance; it is
thoughtful, provocative, humorous and full of characters struggling to
find their place in the world—except perhaps the wise and
profound Mrs Moore. I read EM Forster avidly and over and over. It did
not register with me at the time that he was a prominent humanist and
vice-president of the Union of Ethical Societies. I was simply
captivated by the beautiful prose and the themes; for example, class
differences in <I>Howards End</I>, which is prefaced by the phrase
“Only connect”. <I>A Room with a View</I> is also about
connections and <I>Maurice</I> explores class reconciliation in a gay
relationship.</hs_para>

can do no better than that. Apart from Forster’s novels, I also

is an increasingly important subject because religious belief is, as we
have heard, declining so rapidly, and, at the same time, there is an
increasing perception that, especially among the young, the idea of
morally good or bad behaviour—indeed, the concept of morality
itself—is rapidly withering away. It is tempting, therefore, to
conclude that these two phenomena are causally connected. I believe
that this is a dangerous as well as a false
conclusion.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072524000211" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072524000211">Before
explaining why I think that conclusion is dangerous, I should say a bit
about where I come from. I am not a member of the British Humanist
Association. I consider myself to be a Christian by culture and by
tradition. I frequently attend services of the Church of England, and
one of my greatest passions is church music, as sustained in the great
English cathedrals and colleges, as well as the great oratorios and
passions. I do not want the Church of England to be disestablished, and
I regard my loyalty to the sovereign as loyalty to the head of the
church as well as to the head of the state. Having said that, I suppose
I should confess that I am an atheist. I do not believe in the literal
truth of the narratives of the Judaeo-Christian religion, nor do I
believe that it is sensible or realistic to urge people to
“return to faith”, as we are sometimes urged. Nor do I
believe that you can be urged, or comply with the urging, to believe
something that you simply do not believe.</hs_para>

of my non-atheistical friends and often envy them, I believe that they
sometimes pose a danger if they insist that lack of proper religious
belief, by which I mean literal religious belief, is the cause of lack
of moral sense. To put it another way, it is dangerous to society to
suggest that without religion, or in the aftermath of religion as some
people have suggested, there can be no firm moral values and no shared
or common ideals that can be universally worth pursuing. Such despair
of the possibility of a morality which is other than mere whim is
dangerous because we may be forced into a false dichotomy: either a
morality based on dogmatic transcendentalism, which can authoritatively
dictate on what is right and what is wrong, or no morality at
all.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13072524000213" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072524000213">I am not
a great lover of the concept of human rights, and certainly not as a
foundation for morality because I do not think that they can be that,
but at least the Universal Declaration of Human Rights has given us a
way of understanding that there are some evils that no human being
should be subjected to  by another. If we hear of a country
which has “an appalling human rights record”, we know
what such  
<?notus-xml column=1484?>evils are. We also know that morality demands that we do not perpetrate

hold that the many atheists who live and work in this country can
contribute to the moral improvement of society—I insist on that
phrase: the moral improvement of society—not necessarily by
preaching or forming groups but by all the time being good teachers,
whether professionally or as parents and mentors teach. I believe that
moral education is the most important and most urgently necessary
condition for the improvement of society. I am afraid that I do not
altogether share the optimism of the noble Lord, Lord Maxton. Things
are in many cases very depressing at the moment, especially among the
young, but we do not do good by suggesting that they return to faith.
They cannot believe things that they do not believe, but they can
understand that there is a morality which can be shared and ideals
which can be aspired to by everybody. Therefore, I sincerely hope that
the contribution to this moral improvement that we must all hope for is
celebrated and acknowledged by atheists and those who believe in
God.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-25?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_25_PT_1/E1CE8E0CCA11040765396E46ACCA780858286853" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 25 July 2013">Thursday,

Soley:</Member></B> In his very welcome and detailed introduction to
this debate, my noble friend Lord Harrison gave many explanations of
what humanists have achieved over the years and I will not add to those
details. However, I want to support and expand on the comments made by
the noble Baroness, Lady Flather, about religions which claim to be
religions of peace ending up fighting among themselves and killing
large numbers of people. That problem has to be addressed, but I also
want to consider why it happens. One of the reasons is that religion is
similar to political ideology. If you lay down a set of assumptions,
statements and beliefs that have to be accepted in order to become a
member, you inevitably invite conflict and division. I am not a member
of any humanist society, but I speak as an atheist and a natural
humanist. The basic, underlying assumption of humanism, which is its
strength and the reason for its great contribution, is that human
problems are best solved by reason. If humanism made the mistake of
trying to list the many things that would make you a humanist, it would
risk doing exactly what happens with religion and some political
ideologies. It would create structures where division and conflict
become almost
inevitable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072524000217" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072524000217">In
debates like this it is useful to bear in mind  that there is a
difference between God and religion. You can believe in God without
being a member of a religion. God is an idea: religion is a government
structure and a social control structure. Neither of those is bad. I
would absolutely agree with the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord
Harries of Pentregarth, about where religion comes from. To human
beings struggling to understand a world with terrifying natural forces
like thunder, lightning, earthquakes, volcanoes, the idea of God or
gods was a very useful way of achieving social control. You needed
social control because, in order to survive, you needed to co-operate.
Co-operation needs social control, so you build on
it.  
<?notus-xml column=1485?>If you then make the mistake of making all these assumptions things that
you have to accept, nobody should be surprised if divisions rapidly
occur.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13072524000218" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072524000218">One
advantage of humanists is that not only do they not fight and kill each
other in large numbers, they do not have problems about the roles of
women and men, sexual identity, disability or any other similar thing.
Trying to solve human problems by reason is the strength of humanism. I
would disagree with my noble friend Lord Morgan that we have not had
religious conflict. It may not be as bad as other countries but for a
short time during the Civil War women had to cover their hair fully and
were stopped in the streets by soldiers if they did not do so. The
great advance brought by the Civil War to this country and the rest of
the world was that it threw out the idea that the King was the
representative of God on Earth. You no longer had the idea that you
could not challenge your leader. In Iran at the moment, the Ayatollahs
play that exact role. It will fail for similar reasons: ultimately,
there will be a dispute about the correct interpretation. We get around
that by having elections to throw out the person who thinks they have
the right interpretation. If you are using a religious or God-based
structure, you cannot do that. You have to rely on other things. It is
amazing how we have, over the years, adjusted ourselves to this
argument. I am a great fan of the sophisticated, politically astute
sovereign, Queen Elizabeth I, who, struggling to prevent more and worse
religious wars, came up with the wonderful phrase:</hs_para>

problem for those who have an idea of God is not so much a scientific
one. You can always move the boundaries back: the Earth was the centre
of the universe at one time until that was disproved; the Earth was
considered to be only a few thousand years old until that was
disproved; and when we go back beyond the Big Bang, the boundaries will
be moved again if you are looking for a scientific argument. The
problem for people who believe in God is actually a moral one. The
moral issue is that you have to accept that God created life in a form
that has to survive off other forms of life. The malaria mosquito that
stings the child is not doing it in order that the child can have a
better life in future or can somehow rise above it; it is doing it
because it has to survive and reproduce.</hs_para>

Darwin’s big contribution to us all; he showed that it was
actually evolution. A question that has always fascinated me, and this
is why I would have loved to have had an interview with Charles Darwin,
is: why, when he realised the importance of evolution, did he suddenly
go from being a religious person to being a non-religious person, or
certainly a person who did not pursue religion, and go quiet about the
whole issue? It was probably because he recognised that the survival of
the fittest meant that life had been created—if that is what you
believe—in a form in which it had to live off other forms of
life.</hs_para>

problem for anyone who believes in God, with or without a religion: it
means that you no longer have a way of avoiding the problem that maybe
yours is a cruel or, at best, a careless God, or something of that
nature. A far better explanation is that in fact there is no God. The
great strength of humanism and atheism, to my mind, is that they
recognise that we do not need to worry about things like that so long
as we recognise that human problems can be solved by reason. Built into
that approach is the possibility of tolerance. I put this also to the
noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries: tolerance is what takes
you forward.</hs_para>

Craigavon:</Member></B> My Lords, we should all be grateful to the
noble Lord, Lord Harrison, for raising this subject and specifically
for mentioning atheists in the Motion before us. I declare my position:
I have long been an atheist, and for some many years  have been
a slightly fringe member of the All-Party Parliamentary Humanist
Group.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13072524000224" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072524000224">Some
of us might remember when the late Lord Dormand tried to keep that
group alive, but the problem that he had for quite some time, which
obviously no longer obtains, was the difficulty of filling the required
Conservative quota for all-party groups. For many years that defeated
him and we were unable to be a properly registered group, but
nevertheless we could hold meetings. The All-Party Parliamentary
Humanist Group is now in full health, as we have heard, and is well
supported by the British Humanist Association, recently fresh from the
achievement of inserting humanist marriage services into the same-sex
marriage Act, with the invaluable help and persuasive skill of the
noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, on which I congratulate
her.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072524000225" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072524000225">Fewer
colleagues may also remember the late Baroness, Barbara Wootton, who
was in the first group of female Peers in 1958. I remember the phrase,
in recalling her being criticised, wrongly, for putting forward beliefs
that she was told were able to be based only on the capital created by
religion—or, rather, that she was accused of spending the
capital passed down to us by religion. In those days, spending capital
was rather more of a sin than it is today. I am not sure what has since
happened to her formidable reputation, but she was fighting the battles
of her time in the ways of that time. I mention such examples from the
recent past as a reminder that, over time, we have successfully come a
long way—for which I am not trying to take any credit.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13072524000226" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072524000226">The theme of most of
what I want to say may be that it is no bad thing that we have moved
away from previous certainties to what I would call constructive
uncertainties—the rather amorphous humanist movement, on which
it is sometimes difficult to get a firm handle, is testament to that.
In his very good tour d’horizon the noble Lord, Lord Harrison,
used a very nice phrase when he talked about those of humanist outlook.

<?notus-xml column=1487?>I would also like to touch on the role of the church and faith,
sometimes with the help of the work of Richard Dawkins.</hs_para>

uncertainty is that provided to most of us by the extensive lobbying we
recently received—from all sides—on the Marriage (Same
Sex Couples) Bill. The different moral and cultural interpretations of
marriage were evident even before this Bill arrived and, as one who
supported it, the institution of marriage is now even more fragmented,
which may be no bad thing. In fighting for this new right of marriage,
what was not quite so apparent were the downsides for all sexes of its
overall success or failure rate, the divorce rate and the modern extent
of cohabitation—maybe all approaching 50% now or in the next few
years, as in many other
countries.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072524000228" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072524000228">We
can all hope, imagine and wish for happy families, but the reality may
be very different. We are probably all aware of the assertion that
families—sometimes meaning marriage and family life—are
the best context for the most successful upbringing of children.
Without having time now to go into the detailed argument, I think that
is a misguided and a logically misconceived reading of
causation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072524000229" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072524000229">One
area where Richard Dawkins has been particularly prominent is that of
rationality and faith. I find it extraordinary when he is sometimes
accused of proselytising as much as those with whom he
disagrees—that is his methodology is no different from those
whom he opposes and he is using the same methods as those he is
accusing. We have had some sort of ambulatory religious orthodoxy for
many hundreds of years but putting forward and sustaining beliefs is in
a completely different category from questioning and challenging
others’ beliefs. Faith and belief is for many a necessary and
understandable support to their lives, however stable or uncertain. One
issue is how such beliefs might usefully be questioned or challenged.
In a debate such as this, where we have a Minister replying, there is a
limit to the role of Government. It might be that their task is to
provide a level playing field, but at the same time accepting a
particular starting point or set of premises. Criticism of faith
schools, for example, is a justified area of debate, where the
Government can be encouraged to play a useful
part.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072524000230" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072524000230">The
question in the census, with whatever shortcomings, on religion has
provided evidence of an official decline in religion, which according
to Richard Dawkins’ analysis still overstates the role of
Christianity. The number of people who identified themselves as
Christian in England and Wales dropped from 72% in 2001 to 59% in 2011;
and the number of people who ticked “No religion”
increased between those dates from 15% to 25%. The churches used the
2001 figure to claim support for their influence on public policy, but
under Richard Dawkins’ analysis using opinion polls,
three-quarters of those claiming to be Christian did not think that
religion should have any special influence on public
policy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072524000231" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072524000231">I
realise that opinion polls have an indirect connection with what
happens in the real world. An example relevant to this debate and
debates in this House is the commonly accepted figure that more than
80% of the population support some form of assisted dying; but 
<?notus-xml column=1488?>that is currently not reflected in the political will shown in this
building, nor in the unusually unanimous opposition by the Bishops of
this House. On that point, I am not saying that the church should just
follow opinion polls; but one of the genuinely redeeming features of
the presence of the Bishops in this House is their ready ability to
split their votes on both sides of some controversial arguments. I was
pleased, too, that in replying to the mention by the noble Baroness,
Lady Meacher, of the assisted dying debate, the right reverend Prelate
the Bishop of Birmingham said he would work hard to get that right in
the upcoming debates on assisted dying.</hs_para>

noble friend for introducing this debate and for the manner in which he

others who continue to adhere to their religions; that is a matter for
them. My objections occur only when religious hierarchies attempt to
impose their beliefs on those who do not share them. We saw some
evidence of that during our discussions on the Marriage (Same Sex

Humanists supported the Bill, but then most of us have been very
concerned about the opposition to and frequent persecution of gay,
lesbian and trans-sex people. We are delighted that the passage of the
Bill indicates that we have moved on from the days of discrimination,

humanism to believe in equality and goodwill between people, and
therefore to be active in campaigns for human rights. It is gratifying
to reflect on the improvements in women’s rights that have been
made in this country during the past century. Many of the major
religions—although by no means all—have opposed the
campaigns that achieved these advances. Certain religions are still
extraordinarily bad about women's rights. In this country, we have an
equality law. I would oppose any attempts to introduce Sharia law or
practice, which is sometimes suggested. Our law is paramount. It is
intended to protect women. I do not agree that culture or religion

of course, were adherents of their particular religions, but their
religions are not blamed for their misdeeds. Stalin is often cited as
an example of a tyrant who was an atheist. Of course, he was originally
trained as a priest and converted only late in his teens when his
training had been completed. Many believe, as do I, that his earlier
training conditioned his approach to politics, so you had a political
line that could not be crossed because otherwise there would be
damnation or worse. That was how Stalin conducted his

number of historically significant people who were also atheist and set
examples to us all. However, there of course continue to be attacks
upon secularists and atheists from time to time. Typical of these are
some of the criticisms of Richard Dawkins, someone whom I personally
admire. He has written successful books attacking religious beliefs,
but not people. He has also written movingly about the Bible, the King
James version, acknowledging its cultural significance and also
praising the beauty of its language. Nevertheless, he is often attacked
as some kind of atheistic extremist, which I think is very
unfair.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072524000239" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072524000239">As I

a very personal matter, heavily influenced by life experiences. I
started off as a traditional working-class boy going to Sunday school
and singing in the church choir, if you can believe it, although the
main attraction of the latter was the payments for performing at
weddings. Where did it all go wrong? Largely through
education and, particularly, the reading and teaching of history: a
hefty dose of Darwin, Crusades, Inquisitions and burning witches gets
the questioning juices going. By the age of 15 I had total disbelief in
any gods, apart from Denis Compton, or any creed based on the
supernatural, an afterlife or organised religion. It looks to me as
though an increasing number of young people in the United Kingdom are
getting to this position as they move, quite swiftly in many cases, to
reject religious belief. I should add that I have far more confidence
in young people and their values than some have suggested today,
particularly their capacity for mutual support of each other, which
seems to me to be a strong, socially cohesive value.</hs_para>

identifying themselves as non-religious at 25%, up from 15% in 2001.
Perhaps more significantly, people with no religion had a much younger

British Social Attitudes survey has shown an even sharper move away
from religion, with 41% of people surveyed in the census year saying
that they had no religion. The BSAS subsequently looked in more depth
at religiosity. This revealed that in 2012 half the population did not
regard themselves as belonging to a religion, with this rising to
nearly two-thirds of 18 to 24 year-olds. Only 14% of people attend a

discrimination. A whole raft of these issues regularly features. On the
optimistic side, I think that we crossed a Rubicon in this House when
many noble Lords drew on the views of younger generations in framing
their views and casting their votes on gay marriage. Governments now
need to pay less attention to the views of organised religions in the
framing of public policy and treat them like any other pressure group.

science has made us healthier and wealthier. What has been seldom
acknowledged or realised is that since the Enlightenment, which it
helped to bring about, science has played an essential part in making
us more civilised. Science is the enemy of autocracy because it
replaces claims to truth based on authority with those based
on evidence and because it depends on the criticism of established
ideas. Scientific knowledge is the enemy of dogma and ideologies and
makes us more tolerant because it is tentative and provisional and does
not deal in certainties. It is the most effective way of learning about
the physical world and therefore erodes superstition, ignorance and
prejudice, which have been causes of the denial of human rights
throughout history. Science is also the enemy of narrow nationalism and
tribalism and, like the arts, is one of the activities in this world
that is not motivated by
greed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072525000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072525000011">What can compare, for

venture of collaboration by 10,000 scientists and engineers from 113

I have no belief in a god or in an afterlife. Does that make me an
atheist or a humanist? I do not know, but I certainly espouse the
ideals of humanism, so perhaps I am a humanist who likes going to
church and who delights in the Church of England’s compassion,
companionship and culture. I feel comfortable, however, not having any

have heard this afternoon of many extraordinary British citizens who
have made huge contributions to UK society—writers, scientists,
philosophers—and today we celebrate the fact that they were
atheists or humanists and have made  very fine contributions.
Most people, however, when learning the economics of Keynes, reading a
novel by Ken Follett or Kingsley Amis, listening to a glorious piece of
music by Vaughan Williams, or admiring the ceramics of Grayson Perry or
a gown by Alexander McQueen, would not know that they were atheists. I

were or are atheists and humanists, but that is my own
ignorance.</hs_para>

are millions of people today, as throughout history, who are
non-religious and who believe that there is no afterlife and that the
universe is a natural phenomenon. They conduct their good lives
according to a moral code, without the aid of gods or scriptures, but
on the basis of reason and humanity. 
<?notus-xml column=1493?>However, they have no idea that they are humanists. If there were
greater acknowledgement of the vast contribution of humanists to our
country, I wonder whether more people would consider themselves
to  be humanists and would, for example, opt for a humanist
funeral for themselves or their loved ones. More than 600 couples in
England and Wales already choose to celebrate their marriage with a
humanist ceremony, so I am delighted that, thanks to the amendment
tabled by noble Lords and passed in this house, couples of the same and
opposite sex will, in the not-too-distant future, be able to choose a
humanist marriage. I am proud that noble Lords, as has been mentioned,
were able to achieve this in the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act. This
Act opens up marriage to more couples who love and commit to each
other, so it is fitting that it will also open the way for humanists to
marry in a ceremony that reflects their own deeply held beliefs. I
agree with noble Lords that the shift in opinion in our own House is
the result of the influence of younger people who are free of the

or lack of belief that is important, it is their values, the ethos that
governs their life and actions, and the beauty or excellence of their
creation. Christians, Sikhs, Jews, Muslims, and Zoroastrians delight in
the music of Sir Michael Tippett, or are gripped by the
novels of Iain Banks. Atheists and humanists love the poetry of William
Blake and the architectural glories of our cathedrals. My late husband
Stuart was an atheist. He had strong values and a clear moral code,
with which he imbued our children, but he often read the King James
version of the Bible; he loved the beauty of the language, while
tending towards the Marxist view that religion is the opium of the
masses. I do not accuse the church or any other religion of
capitalising on poverty or ignorance, but it is a fact that, all over
the world, many poor people and those who have little or no access to
education cling to religion in the hope of a better
afterlife.</hs_para>

of the questions raised many times today is about the place and
influence of religion in our society: does the fact that there is a
shift away from religious belief, especially among the young, mean that
our society is suffering in some way? There are many reasons why
society is changing, often for the better, and why lives are becoming
more difficult, but I do not think that lack of religion is one of
them. Of course, I recognise the invaluable role that churches and
religions play in bringing people together and providing support,
especially for the vulnerable. However, that coming together must not
result in intolerant
tribalism.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072525000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072525000024">While I do not doubt
the ability of young people to support each other, which has been

was said during a debate on an Oral Question last week, that religious
schools are often found in the most challenging areas and that 
<?notus-xml column=1494?>they provide an excellent education. This is true, but many
non-religious schools are also found in difficult areas and provide an
excellent education. While I salute the work of, for example, Church of
England schools—there are many in my own forest
community —any school with strong leadership can provide
a safe microcosm of a good society in which pupils can learn and grow.

with conflict between those of different faiths and between those of

means that tensions elsewhere in the world have a powerful influence on
our own communities, which as a consequence feel fragile. I worry that
the proliferation of religious schools, including free schools, could
mean that tolerance, understanding and community cohesion could be
diminished. As the right reverend Prelate said, we must work together

values that underpin a school, together with the nurturing of tolerance
and understanding, are of the utmost importance, as is the curriculum.
I was interested to see that the new national curriculum published
earlier this month includes in the primary curriculum for the first

from the current national curriculum, which is to be warmly welcomed,
the British Humanist Association points out that it is also a

we have had debates in this House on freedom of speech and freedom of
religion in relation to the Equality Act and, most recently, the
same-sex marriage Bill. These freedoms are the cornerstone of our
democracy. I was delighted to learn that in June the European Union
council of foreign affairs Ministers adopted new guidelines to help the
EU promote freedom of religion and belief in countries outside the EU.
They protect the non-religious as well as the religious. They also
protect the right to change or abandon one’s belief, and the
right to freedom of expression, including the right to criticise or
mock religion or belief. They commit to protecting individuals and
individuals’ rights to hold beliefs, but not to protecting the
beliefs themselves. Does the Minister agree that this implies that the
European Union will recommend the decriminalisation of blasphemy

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My Lords, first, I congratulate the
noble Lord, Lord Harrison, on securing this most informative and
interesting debate. As has been seen in the contributions of all noble
Lords, it has been one of great reflection, certainly for me. Standing
at the Dispatch Box, I feel that I am in something of a
minority—not for the first time, I might add—as someone
of faith. Various noble Lords mentioned where they were coming from. My
qualification is that I am Muslim by faith and Christian by primary
education. My two closest friends are atheists and I am a Member of a
House that reflects our country, which is made up of people of all
faiths and of none, of humanists and of atheists. Equally, I am a
citizen of a country that allows people to profess, propagate and
practise their faith freely, whatever beliefs they
have—something of which we should all be tremendously proud. The
noble Lord, Lord Soley, talked about Queen Elizabeth I. She set that
structure for allowing us the freedoms and liberties that we enjoy
today, and long may they remain with
us.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072529000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072529000005">This
Government have rightly placed considerable emphasis on working
effectively with religious groups and celebrating faith, and the
contribution that people of faith make to local and national society.
That perhaps means that we have had less opportunity to make clear our
view that religious belief is not a prerequisite for public service.
There are people who choose to follow a non-religious, atheist or
humanist belief path who clearly have as much commitment to the public
good as people of faith, and who are serving society in many different
quarters and ways. The Government fully recognise and welcome their
contribution to the life of our country.</hs_para>

stronger place because of the diversity of our beliefs and people, and
the values that British people hold. Unlike other countries, we have in
Britain no register of acceptable religions and beliefs. This is to be
welcomed. We do not judge people on what they believe, but we respect
them for what they stand for and contribute to our society and
country.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072529000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072529000007">Noble
Lords have furnished many examples of public service by atheists and
humanists, historically and in the present day. I have a couple of my
own. The National Federation of Atheist, Humanist and Secular Student
Societies has a non-profit week, an annual event, during which it
harnesses the enthusiasm and commitment of students to raise money for
charities such as Children in Need, Amnesty International and
Médecins Sans Frontières. Day in, day out, as the noble
Lord, Lord Harrison, mentioned, there is the silent service of humanist
chaplains providing pastoral support to non-religious people in
hospitals, prisons and universities alongside our religious chaplains.
This work is essential to ensure that non-religious people and those of
no faith, and humanists and atheists, can get the support that they
need in times of
difficulty.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072529000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072529000008">There
are personal examples. In the spirit of the coalition, I look towards
the Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg, who has declared that he has no
religious faith, but who has the strongest respect for all faiths. I
could see this when I attended an event with my right honourable friend
and the honourable Member for 
<?notus-xml column=1496?>Tooting, the right honourable Sadiq Khan. We came together at this event
as political parties and communities in the aftermath of the tragic
murder of drummer Rigby in Woolwich, to demonstrate the solidarity of
people across all faiths, cultures, communities and religions, and
those of no faith, and to show that we stand together solidly in the
face of extremism, and to fight it and all acts of
inhumanity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072529000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072529000009">Diversity
of religion and belief is well reflected in your Lordships’
House. We have heard some stirring contributions from atheist and
humanist Peers. I make that distinction clear. I need only to look at
the Bishops’ Benches again to recall the wise counsel of right
reverend Prelates on many occasions. That has been demonstrated by the
contribution today of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of
Birmingham. In recent years, Catholic and Free Church, Church of
England, Muslim, Hindu, Sikh, Jewish, Buddhist and Zoroastrian Peers,
and humanist Peers and those of no faith, have constantly enriched the
contributions of this House. Long may that
continue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072529000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072529000010">This
House is a microcosm of the society that this Government want to see: a
place where individual freedoms are protected and that is open to all
on merit, accepting of difference and where people of different
backgrounds come together to achieve shared goals. The noble Lord, Lord
Harrison, has served with great distinction as the chairman of the
Economic and Financial Affairs Committee. If I may presume to guess his
motives for doing so, it is partly because of his belief, which I am
sure that the great majority of your Lordships share, that a strong
code of ethics should underlie economic and financial dealings,
privately and at the level of the
state.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072529000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072529000011">This
code of ethics owes as much to ancient philosophy, with Aristotle
arguing that those with wealth have a moral duty to maintain virtue in
their business dealings, as it does to Judaeo-Christian thought. Adam
Smith, another person who never invoked God in his work, laid the
foundations for modern business ethics. Humanist thinking, as we have
heard from various contributions—the noble Baroness, Lady
Whitaker, mentioned George Eliot and Isaac Newton—has
contributed greatly to the development of our culture over the
centuries and continues to do so today. The noble Lord, Lord Warner,
raised this issue as well. Given all these examples and precedents,
noble Lords may wonder why the Government have frequently referred in
public statements to the contributions of faith communities to public
life but perhaps have not paid equal tribute to the work of humanists
and atheists more generally.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13072529000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072529000012">Simply put, it is
because those without religious beliefs are serving the community
through a huge range of charities and initiatives but, for the most
part, do not primarily identify themselves as atheists. Put another
way, an individual with a humanistic or non-religious belief may choose
to work in an international aid agency, for example, or for a homeless
shelter but I doubt that many would argue that they are doing so
because they are motivated by their atheism. They are doing so because
they feel it is right and, in their view, plain and simple humanity to
do so. That point was well made by the noble Baroness, Lady
Massey.</hs_para>

faith communities, people are working hard in countless churches and
other places of worship, and in charities and community groups, to
serve their neighbours and improve their local communities. They, too,
are driven by humanity but in part are also inspired to do so by their
religious faith. Yet as atheists or as a follower of religion, humanity
belies our common values. It unites us. The noble and right reverend
Lord, Lord Harries of Pentregarth, talked of a meeting of colleagues
with humanist values and Christian humanists acting collectively.
Perhaps I should extend that to all humanists: humanism lies, I would
argue, in all faiths. I support that attribute. Indeed, the noble
Baroness, Lady Warnock, talked about moral education and the
improvement of society, which is not the work of any one religion or
community. As several noble Lords have said, it is a collective
responsibility<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T16:26:48"></hs_TimeCode>.
This means that there is a distinctive, long-enduring and powerful
well-spring of positive social action in all our
communities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072529000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072529000014">This
is not the place to talk in detail about the different forms of social
action that faith communities are involved in, although it would not
make sense for us as a Government to fail to take account of the fact
that the churches, for example, have an extensive national framework of
buildings, experience and volunteers that puts them at the very heart
of service delivery to the homeless and others in need. We recognised
that when we invested £5 million in the Church Urban
Fund’s Near Neighbours programme, which uses the infrastructure
of the Church of England to build productive working relationships
between people of different faiths and none at a local level in five
key localities in England, thus maximising the impact of faith-based
social action and creating more integrated communities. I should note
that beneficiaries of Near Neighbours projects are from all faith
backgrounds and none.</hs_para>

Christian denominations, Catholic social teaching plays out in a wide
range of projects linked and resourced by the Caritas Social Action
Network. Through the work of the Muslim Charities Forum, my own Muslim
faith, Islam, increasingly focuses on addressing social needs within
Britain as well as abroad. The Hindu community has Sewa Day to focus on
volunteering projects; the Jewish community has Mitzvah Day; and there
are other
projects.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072529000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072529000016">There
are<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T16:28:13"></hs_TimeCode> those who
perhaps feel that there is a hidden motive with religious people to get
involved in social action—perhaps winning converts with the
promise of a free bowl of soup. Unfortunately, this attitude lingers in
some local authorities, where at times there is still reluctance to
commission services from faith groups. The recent <I>Faith in
</I><I>the </I><I>Community</I> report by the All-Party Group of
Christians in Parliament shows that this view is very much a minority
one, thankfully. These days, councils are generally keen to work with
faith groups. However, even where local authorities have recognised
what faith groups have to offer and have commissioned services from
them, they are sometimes expected to be silent about their faith. Let
it be clear that although local authorities are legally at
liberty  to impose such a condition, we do not regard it as
reasonable.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=1498?><hs_para UID="13072529000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072529000017">In the
Government’s view, it clearly is right that, if asked, churches
and other faith groups should be able to be open about their religious
motivation. The vast majority of faith groups delivering services seek
to impose religious beliefs on no one. Indeed, it is reported that many
actively avoid discussion of religion, as they know this can be a
barrier to offering practical help to those in need.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T16:29:29"></hs_TimeCode> goes without
saying that where a charity or a community group is non-religious or
indeed atheist by nature, it should stand exactly the same chance as a
religious group of winning a commission from a local authority to run a
service. If it has the skills and the experience, and can offer value
for money, it should get the job. The noble Lord, Lord Layard, talked
about happiness and the importance of different groups getting the
right people involved. I am marked by one of my people who I have
looked to for motivation. That is Mahatma Gandhi, who in his time said
that:</hs_para>

well as being inspired by religious beliefs to serve the community,
faith groups and religious leaders have distinctive
perspectives—let us say wisdom—that are of value to
public discourse and policy development. That is why my noble friend
Lady Warsi sits at the Cabinet table as the first ever Senior Minister
for Faith and Communities, to ensure that these perspectives are being
heard and that the contributions of faith groups are recognised. But,
crucially, atheists and humanists bring important insights, alongside
those of religious faiths, to issues around personal freedom and
responsibility. My noble friend is also at the Cabinet table to defend
the interests of people with humanist or secularist views who feel that
their perspectives are failing to receive a fair hearing. The
Government continue to meet the British Humanist Association, and I
would be willing to facilitate a meeting with my noble friend if that
would be helpful. Part of the role of officials in the faith team in
her department is to put faith groups in touch with different parts of
Whitehall as necessary, and of course this offer extends to secularist
and humanist groups. For instance, officials have facilitated
discussions over equalities issues, which several noble Lords have
mentioned and in which I know humanists continue to take a strong
interest.</hs_para>

Britain, 25% of the population at the last census described themselves
as having no religious belief, and that is their absolute right.
Indeed, it was a point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, and
the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, in opening the debate. They are equally
able to express their views freely but as the noble Baroness, Lady
Royall, has just pointed out, that is not always the case abroad, where
people with atheist views face very real persecution if they are open
about them. The noble Lord, Lord Harrison, also made this point. Noble
Lords will be aware that my noble friend’s Commonwealth role
includes defending the right to freedom of religion or belief
internationally, and that includes the right not to have a religion. I
note what the noble Baroness said about the blasphemy laws that we see
operating outside the European Union. Unfortunately, while one thinks
that the defending of faith may be a good principle, the way they are
applied  
<?notus-xml column=1499?>is deplorable, and certainly the Government stand ready to challenge
them wherever we see abuses occur. I join with the noble Baroness in
those sentiments.</hs_para>

noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker, raised the issue of freedom of religion.
I can inform her that in December last year we held an international
conference in London on freedom of religion or belief which
specifically considered the rights of those with non-religious beliefs.
Humanism, of course, is a belief system. My noble friend was commended
by the chief executive of the British Humanist Association for
emphasising that freedom of religion and belief also means freedom from
religion. We also regularly speak out against violations of the right
to freedom of religion or belief wherever and whenever these
occur. We do so in the context of freedom for all, including
the right not to have a religion. A violation of the freedom to believe
or not to believe is an attack on us all.</hs_para>

up on a few points that were made in the debate, and I apologise to
noble Lords if, due to the time restriction, I am not able to mention
them all. The noble Lord, Lord Harrison, talked about an equal
distribution of faith and non-faith representatives on the
Bishops’ Benches. I, for one, would say that we have repeatedly
seen the value of the contributions from the Bishops’ Benches. I
also note that the representatives of the minority faiths have
expressed their approval of the continued presence of Bishops in your
Lordships’ House. For now, we can certainly see that we have
across the House representatives of different faiths, albeit in a
personal capacity.</hs_para>

Harrison, also raised the issue of the Cenotaph. I understand that at
present there are no plans to review participation at the Cenotaph
ceremony, but I am willing to take the matter up once again with
departmental Ministers. He mentioned the Zoroastrians, but let me
assure noble Lords that their participation last year was in
recognition of their 150th anniversary, and was just a
one-off.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13072529000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072529000023">The
noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker, raised the issue of the syllabus and
religious education in schools, as did the noble Lord, Lord Layard, and
the noble Baroness, Lady Royall. There is certainly no reason why a

councils on religious education, which help set local religious
education syllabuses. That is important to

no religion whatever. It is not so much the

very seriously. Our record on tackling FGM is quite clear and the Home

reflect on a very personal point, if I may. As I said, Britain is an
incredible country in which we respect people of all faiths and all
beliefs. I end with a quote not from a famous person, but from my best
friend—an atheist—on the day of my wedding, in his
capacity as a best man. He said: “Tariq and I have known each
other for nearly 20 years. During that time, there were occasions he
sought to convert me to his faith of Islam. I, for my part, have, at
times, sought to convert him to mine of beer and rugby. Neither
succeeded, but we remain the closest of friends, based on the mutual

we go into the churches we so admire, we light a candle for Florence. I
last did so when I went into Lichfield Cathedral last year. I did it

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Earl
Howe):</Member></B> My Lords, the regulations that we are now
considering, which were laid before this House on 4 July, exempt some
types of providers of NHS services from the requirement to hold a
licence from Monitor. Providers who will not be required to hold a
licence are as follows: NHS trusts; providers which are not required to
register with the Care Quality Commission; small providers of
NHS-funded healthcare services whose annual turnover from the provision
of NHS services is less than £10 million; providers of primary
medical and dental services; and providers of NHS continuing healthcare
and NHS-funded nursing care.</hs_para>

Care Act 2012 gave Monitor a new role in regulating providers of NHS
services, and the licence is a key tool for Monitor in carrying out its
new functions. The Act strengthens sector regulation by building and
improving on Monitor’s previous role as the regulator of
foundation trusts and makes sector regulation more comprehensive by
extending Monitor’s role to all providers of NHS services. While
the 2012 Act allows licensing to apply to all providers of NHS
services, these regulations provide for exemptions to this requirement
for certain types of provider where the licence would not give
additional protection for patients or would impose an unfair burden on
providers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072529000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072529000033">Regulation
2 defines a licence holder as the legal entity responsible for
delivering NHS services to patients, the body receiving NHS funding and
providing care directly to patients. This approach mirrors that for CQC
registration. Regulation 2 also ensures that, where a provider has
subcontracted elements of a service, the subcontractor is considered a
separate entity and thus in need of a licence.</hs_para>

that NHS trusts will not be required to hold a licence. This is because
directions from the Secretary of State require the NHS Trust
Development Authority to set and enforce requirements on NHS trusts
similar to those set by Monitor's licence. The NHS Trust Development
Authority must seek and consider advice from Monitor in setting these
conditions to ensure that the requirements for NHS trusts will provide
similar protection for patients’ interests compared with those
set by Monitor through the licence.</hs_para>

licensing regime, a commissioner may request that a service be subject
to additional regulation to ensure patients’ continued access to
that service. Any provider of such commissioner-requested services will
not be eligible for an exemption under the regulations even if the
provider otherwise qualifies for an exemption. Where commissioners have
designated a service as a commissioner-requested service, Monitor must
be able to intervene in order to secure continuity of that service. I
should highlight to the House that this particular override would not
apply to NHS trusts because the NHS Trust Development Authority will be
able to undertake similar interventions on an NHS trust which becomes
unsustainable. Regulation 9 provides for
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072529000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072529000037">Regulation

£10 million it is exempt under Regulation 8. The Minister will
know that when we debated the Bill that became the Health and Social

interest. I have never been satisfied that that problem has been
resolved satisfactorily. If, under these arrangements,

those practices are members of the CCG, so there is

Howe:</Member></B> I am grateful to the noble Lord for his questions,
some of which I shall write to him about. He first asked me about the
review of licensing exemptions that the department plans to carry out
in 2016-17. He is, of course, right to say that no Government can
commit their successor, of whatever colour, and it will be open to a
successor Government, if it is of his party, to revise that aspiration.
However, we think it right that after such an interval, the department
should look to see whether the exemptions are continuing to prove
appropriate, and if they are not it should propose amendments. I do not
think that is a very controversial
aim.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072529000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072529000053">On the
working life of the NHS Trust Development Authority, it will not have
escaped the noble Lord’s notice that the original lifespan that
we marked out for the TDA will now be exceeded. We have quite
consciously, and rightly, determined that the process for approving
foundation trusts should be extended, bearing in mind the outcome of
the Francis review and the need for trusts, some of which by their very
nature will prove more difficult to bring to foundation status, to
focus on those aspects of the Francis report which need to be addressed
if they are to be worthy of foundation trust status. Therefore, the
length of life of the NHS TDA will undoubtedly extend into 2015. I
cannot be more specific than that at this stage. It is a special health
authority established by order. We will review that order in the normal
course of things in three years’ time to assess whether there is
a need for the authority. That is mentioned in the Explanatory
Memorandum to the establishment
order.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072529000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072529000054">The
noble Lord asked me why ophthalmic services are exempt. It is because
they are not subject to registration by the CQC. We will of course keep
those exemptions under review, as I have said. If evidence emerges to
suggest that we should extend the licensing or make further exemptions,
we will do so. When I spoke to the ophthalmic sector, it said that it
did not see the need for a licence from Monitor, and we have taken
account of its
views.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072529000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072529000055">The
noble Lord asked me for some examples  of
commissioner-requested services. It is difficult for  me to do
that because they will be services which commissioners deem are in need
of additional regulation to protect patients’ interests. Monitor
has published 
<?notus-xml column=1505?>guidance for commissioners to help them determine the
considerations around commissioner-requested
services. It will very much depend on the needs of the local population

area.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13072529000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072529000056">The
noble Lord asked me why GPs and dentists are exempt. As he knows,
providers of primary medical services and primary dental services under
contract to NHS England will be exempt from the requirement to hold a
licence. As NHS England holds the contract with providers of those
services, it is clearly well placed to place requirements on those
providers that are similar to some of those in the licence. An
agreement between Monitor and NHS England will underpin the
arrangements. Monitor and NHS England are currently working on that.
GPs and dentists sometimes provide other types of services under
contracts with commissioners other than NHS England, such as minor
surgery clinics or diagnostic testing services. They will be subject to
licensing in respect of these services but at the same time be eligible
for the de minimis threshold exemption. In addition, all providers of
designated commissioner-requested services will require a licence, even
if they would otherwise qualify for an exemption. It is therefore
conceivable that a service provided by a GP practice might be
considered a commissioner-requested service, but that is a speculative
assumption on my
part.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072529000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0002.htm#13072529000057">The
noble Lord referred to conflicts of interest when such services are
commissioned from GP practices by clinical commissioning groups. As I
am sure he knows, there are clear rules around conflicts of interest.
While GP practices are, by definition, members of a clinical
commissioning group, the commissioning process must be done as much at
arm’s length from an individual GP practice as possible. If
someone in the clinical commissioning group has a direct personal or
professional interest in the decision being taken, he or she must
follow the rules surrounding that conflict.</hs_para>

how NHS England is going to maintain standards in primary medical
services. I have largely covered that point. NHS England will monitor

it makes are of significant interest. They are minor adjustments,
generally needed as a direct consequence of the Health and Social Care
Act 2012, which I shall now refer to as the 2012 Act. They help to keep
the statute book up-to-date and coherent, but they involve no new
policies. Consistently with this, neither the Joint Committee on
Statutory Instruments nor the Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee
has seen a need to draw special attention to the draft order.</hs_para>

the draft order does, it may be helpful to start with a very brief
reminder of the relevant provisions of the 2012 Act. That Act made a
number of changes to the architecture of the National Health Service in
England. Before the 2012 Act came into force on 1 April this year, the
functions of commissioning and providing health services were conferred
by legislation on the Secretary of State and were delegated by him to
bodies such as primary care trusts. The Act, however, now gives the
function of commissioning health services direct to the NHS
Commissioning Board—also known as NHS England—and to
clinical commissioning groups; while primary care trusts have been
abolished. The Secretary of State continues to be under a duty to
promote a comprehensive health service. He has ministerial
accountability to Parliament for the health service. He is under new
duties to keep under review the effective exercise of functions by the
national-level bodies, such as the NHS Commissioning Board, and to
report annually on the performance of the health service. That is the
framework established by the 2012 Act.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13072529000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0003.htm#13072529000063">I turn now to the
individual amendments made by the draft order. The first amendment is
to the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act
1986. The 1986 Act creates a requirement to assess the needs of people
who are discharged from hospital after at least six months’
inpatient treatment for mental disorder. Section 7 of the Act sets out
the services to which such an assessment must relate. Schedule 5 to the
2012 Act amended Section 7 of the 1986 Act to reflect, for example, the
abolition of primary care trusts and the fact that it is clinical
commissioning groups which now have to carry out the assessments in
England.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13072529000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0003.htm#13072529000064">However, that schedule
did not update the reference to the services to which the assessment
should relate. These are currently described as services that the
Secretary of State is under a duty to provide under the NHS Act 2006.
The order removes that reference, and 
<?notus-xml column=1507?>updates it to take account of the changes in responsibility for
commissioning and providing health services in England that were made
by the 2012 Act. In making that change, we are able also to refer
correctly to the bodies that provide services for the purposes of the
Scottish and Welsh health services, and to the Acts under which they do
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072529000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0003.htm#13072529000065">The second
amendment made by the draft order is to the Community Care (Delayed
Discharges etc.) Act 2003. That Act puts in place arrangements to
ensure the safe and timely discharge of patients from hospital. Under
the 2003 Act, the responsible NHS body is required in certain cases to
issue an assessment or discharge notice, and the relevant local
authority is required to assess the patient and put in place a support
package by the named day. Schedule 5 to the 2012 Act made some
amendments to the 2003 Act, but not those required to ensure that the
arrangements continue to apply to NHS patients in independent
hospitals. The draft order therefore makes the necessary amendments by
adding NHS England and clinical commissioning groups to the definition
of “NHS body” in Section 1 of the Act. This puts those
bodies under a duty to issue the relevant notices in relation to
patients discharged from independent hospitals commissioned by
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072529000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0003.htm#13072529000066">Lastly,
the draft order amends Section 256 of the National Health Service Act
2006. That section deals with the powers of certain NHS bodies to make
payments towards expenditure on community services. Schedule 4 to the
2012 Act replaced the references to primary care trusts in the main
body of Section 256 with references to the NHS Commissioning Board and
to clinical commissioning groups, but unfortunately it did not amend
the reference to primary care trusts in the cross-heading to the
section. The draft order corrects that
oversight.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072529000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0003.htm#13072529000067">In
conclusion, I hope that I have demonstrated that the draft order
contains changes that are consequential on the Act. It makes some minor
but necessary changes to keep the statute book coherent and up to date.
I commend the draft order to the House. I beg to move.</hs_para>

weeks ago, we had an excellent debate initiated by the noble Baroness,
Lady Wheatcroft, on the contribution of the arts to the economy. The
case was made then by a number of noble Lords that the contribution of
the creative industries to jobs, growth and tourism is considerable,
but often understated. Yet we have a reputation globally as world
leaders and innovators in the arts and it will be undoubtedly one of
the drivers for future economic growth and prosperity. This point was
echoed in a recent Arts Council report that showed that there was a
four-fold return on every pound invested in the arts.</hs_para>

am very pleased that this is the case but even if it was not, I believe
that the investment would be worthwhile. That is why I was prompted to
table this Question. I want to make a different case—the arts
for their own sake, for what they provide to our civilisation and the
benefits they impart to our well-being as a nation. This should be a
sufficient reason to celebrate, to defend and to invest in our arts
culture. It is why I share the concern expressed by many arts leaders
that Maria Miller’s recent speech focused so heavily on the
economic benefits that could accrue from our arts activities. For
example, she said that arts organisations should,</hs_para>

other words, they have to keep making a profit. This demonstrates some
flawed thinking. If we invest only in arts that are guaranteed to make
a profit, we damage the very innovation and creativity that has
generated our reputation for excellence in the first place. However,
one of our challenges is that, while it is relatively easy to measure
the economic contribution of the arts, it is a much bigger challenge to
provide evidence of the wider benefits to society. I was struck when
preparing for this speech by how many research projects have recently
been launched to measure difference aspects of the impacts of the arts
on our lives. This is obviously to be welcomed, but it will take
time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T17:15:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo>

considerable sympathy with the advice of my noble friend Lord Howarth
to the recent Culture, Health and Wellbeing International Conference.
He suggested that they should not wait for the holy grail of a
definitive, conclusive report on the benefits of the arts, but should
pool the existing research findings which already demonstrate a
positive impact on health 
<?notus-xml column=1509?>and well-being. It is also helpful that the National Alliance for Arts
Health and Wellbeing has been established, supported by the Arts
Council, to draw together the case for the positive impact of the arts
on health and well-being. It has been working with the Office for
National Statistics, which was famously and quite rightly asked by the
Prime Minister to measure the factors which affect
well-being<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T17:16:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

bit worrying that the funding cuts may result in that well-being
research being scaled down. Nevertheless, since the Windsor conferences
in 1998 and 1999, we have increasing evidence of the positive impact of
the arts on health outcomes. For example, the Art Council reports that
singing has been found to affect the hormones that facilitate emotional
balance. The use of music in cardiovascular units led to reduced
anxiety and to improved blood pressure and heart rate. Patients who
experience visual arts and live music on trauma and orthopaedic wards
stayed in hospital, on average, a day less. A recent large-scale study
in Norway showed that visits to the theatre, concerts, art galleries
and museums result in better health and well-being, and that the more
often people engaged in cultural activities, the greater the health
benefits<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T17:17:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Part survey has reported that taking part in the arts and cultural
activities once a week has a positive effect on an individual’s
well-being. UK museums and art galleries are increasingly involved in
art and cultural activities, providing a welcoming non-clinical setting
to support initiatives for those with mental health, dementia and
learning difficulties, with measurable benefits. I recently visited a
groundbreaking project at the Geffrye Museum, providing a safe and
stimulating environment for adults with learning difficulties. The
Dulwich Picture Gallery’s initiative entitled “Good
Times” provides a range of communal activities for an
increasingly isolated and vulnerable ageing population. I have been
impressed by the outcomes of the Men’s Room charity in
Manchester which provides creative expression for young men previously
involved in crime or homelessness. All this evidence confirms what we
intrinsically know to be true: that creativity, whether active or
receptive, lifts the spirits and increases a sense of
well-being.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072529000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0003.htm#13072529000077">The
same can be said for the contribution of the arts to education. The
Henley report on cultural education showed that young people involved
in the arts at school also performed better in other subjects. The
impact of the cultural activity spilled over into other aspects of

highest-achieving schools—including, of course, the private
schools—tend also to offer a high standard of cultural
education. He also quoted the outcome of a United States longitudinal

why there continues to be frustration at the failure of the Department
of Education to embrace and champion these principles. The original
EBacc proposals completely sidelined arts education. Even in its new
format, teachers report that less time is being allocated to teaching
creative subjects. The new national curriculum, while a considerable
improvement on earlier drafts, does not, for example, have any
meaningful inclusion of dance, drama or film. While we welcome many of
the steps outlined in the belated government response to the Henley
report, it feels like it is too little, too late. Obviously we welcome
initiatives such as the new National Youth Dance Company, the music
hubs and Artsmark, but there is a sense that creative learning is
moving out of mainstream education and into extra-curricular

economic returns, but also the less tangible advantages: that it raises
our quality of life, improves our sense of well-being and contributes
to our future success as a nation. Ultimately, none of these issues
matters as much as a belief in art and creativity for its own sake.
However we choose to express it, art is what makes our nation

Callousness, cruelty and murder follow. That is why, when the arts go
into prison, they make a real difference. Acting companies take the
plays of Shakespeare to prisoners and then stay to discuss with their
audience, the inmates, what are human motives and what are the feelings
of other people. That helps the prisoners grow to see their own lives.

Orwell. These festivals are arenas of ideas. I chaired a debate in

Islam. There was an audience of more than 1,200 people. These places
are indeed the cradle of ideas, debate and exchange. At a time when
human discourse and the popularity of political meetings are perhaps on

realise that this is the full beauty of “craftsman’s art

be able to share it. Of course, some are conscious every year of the
all-encompassing quality of the arts when they see the television

importance, educationally and to the health and well-being of the
nation. She referred to the Dulwich Picture Gallery experiment, where
not only the old, but also the sometimes quite recalcitrant young are
brought to a greater understanding. They are—to quote
Wordsworth, as did the noble Baroness—“seeing into the
life of things” in a very different and new way. I saw this many
years ago when I was involved in the beginning, in this country, of the
Music Therapy Charity. One saw what effect music 
<?notus-xml column=1513?>had on severely handicapped children who otherwise would have had no
outlet. It began with a glorious service in Westminster Abbey when
Yehudi Menuhin played Bach partitas on the chancel steps. The two
remarkable Americans, Nordoff and Robbins, who started this charity,
were there. It has now grown considerably and is known around the

as their forefathers did before them, is to see our fine buildings, to
go to our wonderful galleries, and to listen to the music at the Proms

people should be made more aware of the glories of Italy, the majesty
of France and the wonderful beauties in our own country. Every young
person, as part of his or her education, should go to the National
Gallery and spend an hour in the company of someone who understands and
appreciates the paintings. Every young person, before he or she leaves

Winston:</Member></B> My Lords, by 1944 some 6 million people had died
in Auschwitz in appalling conditions. Sometimes the question is
asked—it might have been asked earlier this afternoon in another
debate—“Where was God in Auschwitz?”. Perhaps the
answer might be, “Where was man?”. However, there could
be another answer. Perhaps it came from a place that fed Auschwitz:
Theresienstadt.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072529000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0003.htm#13072529000102">During
its life, Theresienstadt housed between 120,000 and 150,000
individuals, all but about 22,000 of whom died in Auschwitz. For them,
God was in their music. In that remarkable place, people were starving.
They had no proper water supply and sanitation. They lacked almost
every accompaniment of humanity, but they celebrated their humanity by
singing Verdi’s “Requiem”. It was conducted by
Rafael Schächter, one of the Jewish composers in Theresienstadt.
Towards the end of the life of the camp, the composer Viktor Ullmann
composed an opera called “Der Kaiser von Atlantis”, a
satire on Hitler. It is a short opera that lasts for less than an hour.
In it, pretty well every human emotion is described, including love,
hope, longing and sadness. Interestingly, the one thing that is missing
is anger, even though the chief singer is der Kaiser: Hitler. What we
cannot forget is that Ullmann never saw the production, because when
the Nazis saw it in rehearsal, they banned it, and of course Ullmann
and his librettist ended up in Auschwitz, where they
perished.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072529000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0003.htm#13072529000103">I
shall talk about music only and declare an interest as chairman of the
council of the Royal College of Music. I suggest that music is central
to this debate. In some respects it is one of the most basic of the
arts, because it is the closest to being unrepresentational in a way.
One of the great things about music is that it expresses all humanity.
It expresses longing, sadness, anger and humour, it looks at joy, as my
noble friend has already mentioned, it looks at sadness and at
love and, in the case of Theresienstadt, it looked at hope
as well. It is a basic civilising influence on our
population.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072529000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0003.htm#13072529000104">When
you look at music in scientific terms, you see that it affects
different parts of the brain. For example, memory is enhanced by
listening to music. Recent studies using magnetic resonance imaging
scanning show that different parts of the brain, including the
hippocampus, expand when we listen to or play music, whether we are
musicians or non-musicians. When it comes to dexterity, the motor
cortex at the top of the brain is also enhanced. The auditory cortex is
enhanced as well; most importantly, Broca’s area, which is on
the left side for a right-handed person and central to 
<?notus-xml column=1515?>language, is also very closely linked to music. Perhaps that is one of
the reasons why so many musicians have been amazing
linguists.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072529000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0003.htm#13072529000105">These
things are developed by people who use and play music, particularly
schoolchildren. I want to speak mostly of schoolchildren in this
instance. Although we think that musicians are born and not made, it
turns out that this is not the case. Recent evidence in a beautiful
German study clearly shows that pretty well anybody who is given enough
time and practice can compete with the best opera singers, and that
their brain can expand in the areas that are needed. That has been
demonstrated in
scanning.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072529000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0003.htm#13072529000106">On a
lighter note, a pop video made by One Direction was launched on the web
this week. On the first day of launch, it received 14 million hits,
which was extraordinary. One Direction are delightful young men. They
are responsible. I think that they are altruistic, although I do not
know that for certain, my impression is that they are. At many levels,
they are an interesting role model for young people and you can see
that they are massively followed by them. It is a pity that we do not
have that same following for classical and other music which have so
much depth in terms of our learning experience and give us wealth, not
financial wealth, of course, but wealth in how we perceive the world
and react to it and the wealth that is in our humanity and
relationships.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072529000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0003.htm#13072529000107">For
schoolchildren, music and learning music do not foster just memory and
probably better intellectual capacity, although, in spite of the
rumours, not intelligence, but they certainly foster collaboration and,
as the noble Baroness, Lady Bakewell, has said, empathy, which is
obviously important. These things are really important to children, and
the lack of musical education in schools is great concern in our
society at the
moment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072529000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0003.htm#13072529000108">The
Minister may not have figures to hand at the moment, but perhaps they
can be dug out. Under the previous Government there was the singing
initiative, which I not think is anything like adequate enough. In
music, it would be better if far more schoolchildren had access to
instruments because that increases that collaboration in a new way.
They help understanding of the structure of music and increase
dexterity. It would be of interest to know what the Government are
doing about the number of schools, particularly primary schools, which
have access to musical instruments.</hs_para>

supports the Royal College of Music and other areas in musical
education, will the Minister tell us how the Government view the
outreach programmes that conservatoires are doing to spread music among
young people? The Sparks programme run by the Royal College of Music
takes primary school children, and there is no question that children
who come from very different backgrounds achieve amazing success. They
collaborate and play music so well that it is difficult to believe they
have not been learning music for a great deal longer than they have.
Many conservatoires have a junior department which is closer to more,
if you like, adult children. It would be helpful if the Minister in her
summing up could affirm support for those sorts of activities, which I
believe are really important to the health of the
nation.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-25?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_25_PT_1/3CE1E05F7DCFADCAA27C2E1AD5B51FAC5265D028" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 25 July 2013">Thursday,

Rea:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, thank my noble friend for bringing
this important area before the House. I feel somewhat diffident
speaking with those of such calibre. Previous speakers have shown that
a good story well told can have a very big impact, which probably
should be a rule for my future speeches. As a former medical
practitioner, I will speak today on the effect that the arts, in the
broadest sense, can have on health. Here, I am using the long WHO
definition of health, which considers it to be not only the
“absence of disease” but
also,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13072529000198" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0003.htm#13072529000198">“complete

useful because it recognises that health is not only physical but
includes emotional and social components, factors which have tended
until recently to be neglected in healthcare. Sir David Weatherall,
when the regius professor of medicine at Oxford University more than a
decade ago, explained how scientific medicine, which dominated the last
century, changed the emphasis in healthcare from the whole patient and
whole organs to diseases of molecules and cells. This caused many to
feel that medicine had become reductionist and dehumanising. Although
himself a molecular scientist, Professor Weatherall said
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13072529000199" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0003.htm#13072529000199">“we

then the need for this is becoming more widely accepted but dehumanised
healthcare is still the experience of some patients. The events in Mid
Staffs, although not the rule, unfortunately are not unique. But,
despite increasing pressures, most patients in the National Health
Service receive expert, considerate and friendly
care.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13072529000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0003.htm#13072529000112">Where
do the arts fit into this health story? The three components of

between mental and physical health has now been demonstrated in a
number of studies. Cheerful or normal people live longer and recover
from illness more quickly than depressed people, who place a very heavy
load on the National Health Service. The immune response of
non-depressed people is better. My noble friend Lady Jones cited a

between social deprivation, even relative deprivation in prosperous
societies, and physical and mental health and longevity is well known
and is being increasingly better understood through the world-wide
studies of the social determinants of health being led by Professor
Michael Marmot of University College London. That is as relevant to the
UK today, when our health problems are largely due to long-term,
non-communicable diseases, as it was 100 years ago, before the era of
antibiotics. Living conditions, nutrition and lifestyles are among the
most important of these 
<?notus-xml column=1517?>determinants. Here it should be emphasised that lifestyles are not
simply a matter of individual choice, they are a product of economic
and social pressures. It is only the exceptional individual from a

commercial and social pressures and live an optimally healthy

friend Lord Winston and the noble Lord, Lord Cormack, and works of art
and sculpture as well as the written word, is often enormous. I would
add high-quality media presentations on the radio and television, and
let us not forget film as well. I could recite a long list of all the
arts which are important. To say that the arts entertain us and cheer
us up is only part of the picture. By helping to lift depression, the
arts can improve our mental health and this can, in the ways I have
suggested, lead to better physical health.</hs_para>

have not mentioned one important aspect of our culture: the built
environment. The noble Lord, Lord Cormack, talked about the majesty of
Lincoln Cathedral, and of course there are other inspiring buildings
all over the country. Good and imaginative design of neighbourhoods and
individual buildings, apart from pleasing the eye, can have important
effects on physical health. We have too many boring, or at the worst
ugly, housing developments, while thoughtless redevelopment has plucked
the heart out of many towns and cities. The result has been a loss of
cohesive community support which can have effects on social well-being.
The building of arts and cultural centres in many towns and cities has
been a positive move that partly compensates for the destruction of
city centres, and the evidence is that they have a sizable positive
impact on the morale of their communities.
However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T17:53:45"></hs_TimeCode>, they

all noble Lords know, would also act as a kick-start for the economy
and have a beneficial effect on mental and social well-being.
Well<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T17:53:23"></hs_TimeCode>-designed
housing, apart from being more carbon efficient, can improve mental,
physical and social health through aesthetically pleasing design, good

this kind in many places throughout the

Earl of Clancarty:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, thank the noble
Baroness, Lady Jones, for introducing this debate. As an artist, my
instincts to some extent are to reverse 
<?notus-xml column=1518?>the terms of the debate; in other words, to ask what, for example,
education can do for the arts and creativity. That might strike one at
first as the standard way of looking at things, but for me, generally
speaking, artists make and publicise their work as best they can and it
is for others to draw conclusions about the wider social effects that
work may
have.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072529000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0003.htm#13072529000119">I am
emboldened in further pursuing my instincts on this on three counts.
First, I understand that although the DCMS is responding to this debate
rather than the Department of Health, that department will be listening
in with the other cap that the Minister wears. Secondly, there is the
wider ever-present arts narrative that needs to be addressed. It is
very difficult to persuade successive Governments of the case for art
for its own sake—a term which the noble Baroness, Lady Jones,
used in her speech. That obstacle characterises the overarching
narrative driving most of the debate on the arts at Westminster,
whereby the effects of the arts on education, well-being and health are
still the justification for them, while being a corrective to our
previous debate on the economic effects and to Maria Miller’s
insistence on the arts’ economic value. Thirdly, there is the
rather remarkable speech made by the Scottish Culture Secretary, Fiona
Hyslop, on 5 June at Edinburgh University, in which she
said:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13072529000189" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0003.htm#13072529000189">“It
is our job … to create the conditions which enable artists to
flourish … I don’t need or want the culture or heritage
sector to make a new economic or social case to justify public support
for their work. I know what these sectors can deliver because I see it
in action. I visit hardworking artists and practitioners who are
exploring new ways of working; and who are creating dynamic and
exciting new ways of enjoying and sharing their work and the work of
our
ancestors”.</hs_quote><hs_para UID="13072529000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0003.htm#13072529000120">Artists
and the arts sector would have to wait forever to hear a message like
that from a Government at Westminster. There will be cynics, of course,
who say that the SNP has an agenda in trying to court artists. That may
be, but that does not have to invalidate its cultural policy. The key
thing here is the facilitation of artists, which I believe is a good in
itself, whatever the specific effects may be, because the
artist’s work is the contribution to society. The
Government’s primary job in relation to the arts is—or
should be—to do just that and must of course include encouraging
the potential for creativity from all classes of society. It also means
facilitating not just contemporary artists but those artists of the
past—“the ancestors”, as Fiona Hyslop calls them,
a term which properly draws them closer to us—whose influence
may thereby still be felt through our collections, exhibitions,
buildings and public sculpture. From this, everything else should
proceed. Indeed, in the short term, good art may not give a feeling of
well-being at all but may be disturbing and highly critical of society,
as much of our best post-war drama was. It is a healthy society which
allows artists to have their say, encourages that criticism and, all
importantly, offers spaces within which that can
happen.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072529000121" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0003.htm#13072529000121">The
newest space of course is the internet, but there is also what might be
termed an attitudinal or mental space and, furthermore, physical or
geographical space. That space is now becoming hugely underestimated
and increasingly neglected locally. I am thinking about theatres, art
venues, studios and rehearsal rooms as well as the streets themselves.
In part, this is because of the attraction of the internet, but also
because of the 
<?notus-xml column=1519?>cuts, particularly at the local level, and the largely unthought-through
council sell-offs of buildings and land alongside the now much looser
planning guidelines. Overall, this is an ongoing neglect that is
detrimental not just to artists but to the well-being of local
communities. Publicly owned spaces have the potential to be public
spaces, as well as providing significantly cheaper rents. Privatised
spaces that are open to the public, such as shopping malls, will always
be primarily commercial spaces where the public are only present by
invitation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072529000122" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0003.htm#13072529000122">Can
more help be given to artists and artist groups in relation to
commercial spaces and greater incentives provided for the cultural and
artistic use of vacant shops, for example? The Minister should also be
aware that the removal of planning permission for landlords to turn
studios and workshops into flats is hugely threatening to the arts and
the creative industries. That is not to say that public spaces are not
also becoming increasingly problematic for artists. Perhaps the
Minister can confirm that the DCMS is giving particular attention to
the Bill recently introduced by the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, to
remove restrictions on leafleting, which is having such a bad effect on
the local arts scene in some

seems that Cornwall Council, too, supports its preservation but, at the
same time, has given permission for development without an
environmental assessment, public consultation or planning permission.
This case again illustrates the fact that once one effectively tears up
the planning guidelines and there is no concerted
decision-making—which is not the same as autocratic
decision-making—there is likely to be chaos and rampant
development, and the arts will be the loser in all

this same context of the protection of our culture, I mention also the

Minister will be aware, both the Arts Council and the Museums
Association have been hugely critical of this proposal, 
<?notus-xml column=1520?>and I hope that the DCMS is taking an interest in this as well. The
collection would have been donated to the public in perpetuity and
therefore should remain so. There is a history here. In 2010, Croydon
Council threatened to axe all arts services and sell off 13 local
libraries. Fortunately there has been enough of a public outcry for
this not to happen, although the popular David Lean Cinema, which was
also part of the Clocktower complex, has already been

irony is that a great many of us are often not aware of remarkable
collections or treasures until they are under threat, although that
does not mean that others have not already greatly enjoyed them. I
would like to make a suggestion to the Government, and I hope they will
forgive me if this is something that they have already considered. As a
follow-up to their successful GREAT campaign, perhaps they would
consider a series of posters highlighting our local collections and
treasures to an international audience, with perhaps a number of
locations featured on each poster. One example that springs to mind is
the William Morris Gallery in Walthamstow, which won this year's Museum
of the Year award. Britain has a huge wealth of treasures and
collections, often in out-of-the-way places, that are not part of our
national collections and are not as well known. Providing such posters
would do at least two things: it would re-emphasise the importance of a
local or regional Britain, and it would help, I believe, to protect
those
treasures.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-25?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_25_PT_1/71C332A16147B459F2D4056C46DCA81E074B79AB" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 25 July 2013">Thursday,

Sawyer:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, thank my noble friend Lady Jones
for initiating this debate. Perhaps I may also say how much I am
enjoying debating with people who have great experience and knowledge
of the subject. My noble friend Lady Bakewell began her speech by
talking about the Proms and the “Messiah”. I start mine
by talking about the Durham miners—perhaps at the other end of
the spectrum. I will not be talking about the great-great-grandson of a
Durham miner, the bonny lad who was born this week to be King; to do
that, I would need to talk about the Middleton family. I will be
talking about another mining family, the Elliot family. There cannot be
many people in this country or in this Chamber who have not heard of
Billy Elliot. He was the subject of a film in 2001 and of a West End
show in 2005 which is, almost 10 years later, playing to packed houses
all over the world. It is, of course, the story of a miner’s son
from the north-east of England who became a ballet dancer.</hs_para>

discovery from coal-mining to ballet captured so many hearts around the
world? There are many reasons, one of which lies at the heart of
today’s debate: the transforming power of art—in this
case, dance—and its ability to bring joy and happiness, which
have the power to actually change lives. “Billy Elliott”
is based on an individual but the story cannot progress without the
power of the community—the village, the teacher, the family, the
neighbours, the public space, the public scholarship and the solidarity
of a deprived community all go together to make it a heart-rending
story that shows the power and joy of people engaging in art.</hs_para>

individual transformation and achievement, often against adversity,
but, linked with the power of the support of a wider community, it taps
into one of the most powerful veins of successful public art: whether
theatre, film or dance, it is where communities and people fight
against adversity using the power of art to achieve things.
“Billy Elliot” was part of a voyage of artistic discovery
and renaissance in the north-east of England, from the “Angel of
the North”, to the Sage music and arts centre on the banks of
the Tyne, to Sir Anish Kapoor’s “Temenos” on
Teesside, to hundreds of small organisations that provide intellectual,
emotional and physical spaces, including galleries, libraries and
theatres, where people can go time and again to experience what I
consider to be the invigorating and healing power of art, which is very
powerful
indeed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072529000131" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0003.htm#13072529000131">Of
course, there are many Billy Elliots in our world, thankfully. I will
tell your Lordships about one young man, who grew up in central
Middlesbrough—not the most well-heeled or prosperous part of our
country—in the 1990s. He went to Teesside University, which I
know because I have the joy of being chancellor of that university. He
became a performing arts teacher because as a teenager—as a
young man not really knowing where to go—he became involved in a
youth theatre, a project supported by Middlesbrough Council.</hs_para>

same man graduated from the Royal Academy of Music here in
London—quite a big step, almost as big as Billy’s. Then
he started work as a teacher. He began to work professionally as an
actor, both on stage and in television. He continued to teach music and
drama to college students throughout south-east London. These
teenagers, who are from a deprived part of south-east London, many from
estates and difficult places, now go to the Globe to watch plays. They
go to the National Theatre because of the influence and support of
their teacher and their college. They speak lines of Shakespeare just
for fun. For weeks after each play, they come to the college repeating
lines they heard from the actors and swapping one-liners with each
other as well as writing lines of their own. They stand up confidently
in front of the class and other audiences and perform their new
work.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13072529000133" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0003.htm#13072529000133">The
theatre gave these young people language, confidence, the power of
communication, and an interest in other members of their community,
humour and stature in a way that nothing else could. Particularly
today, with the absence of that kind of thing from the world of work,
where young people do not get it in the way that they used to and the
way that they should, the power of art is far more important than ever.

communities and schools. The gallery is free to all, and contributes to
the social framework of Middlesbrough and the wider Tees valley. MIMA

provision in Middlesbrough, and has welcomed 900,000 visitors since it

abiding treasure for them in their lives. I was glad that the Secretary
of State, Michael Gove, responded positively to the proposal by the
Poetry Archive, of which I was a trustee, that there should be a
competition for schoolchildren across the country to recite poems
aloud. The national finals at the National Portrait Gallery were a

Matthew Arnold was professor of poetry at the University of Oxford, and
also Chief Inspector of Schools—what a good appointment that was

to answer the great question: “How to live?” The study of

of its positive connotations—discrimination. It teaches them to
make moral distinctions, to recognise integrity and quality.</hs_para>

Creativity and Wellbeing Week the array of such practices and services.

important research. In 2009, the Arts and Humanities Research Council

statistically significant beneficial effects on their health and

maths and English of students who engage in the arts improves,
particularly in the case of children from low-income families. I will
give two examples from my own city of Liverpool. The first is in West
Everton, which is one of the poorest, most deprived communities in the
country. There is a project there where every primary school
child—not just some, every single primary school
child—learns a musical instrument. They form an orchestra, which
has performed within the community, with the Royal Liverpool
Philharmonic Orchestra and here at the Royal Festival Hall, and when
they leave their primary school a second orchestra is formed at
secondary school level. That has been hugely significant for those
young
people.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072529000158" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-0003.htm#13072529000158">My
second example came from Liverpool being the European Capital of
Culture in 2008. A programme was set up called Creative Communities.
Ordinary communities could bid for and secure grants for arts projects.
We are talking not about arts organisations but about individuals
within the community, or groups of individuals, securing grants. One
school for 11 to 16 year-olds in one of the most deprived parts of
inner-city Liverpool, with high truancy and absenteeism rates, problems
with drugs and very low attainment, applied for a grant to make a film.
It secured a £20,000 grant, and a film producer worked with
those young people. They made the film, and I remember going to the
opening night; they were all in black tie, with a red carpet and all
the rest of it. That project was life-changing for those young people,
and I mean life-changing. When they had finished working with that film
producer and put on the premiere night of the film, they wanted to
carry on with what they had been doing. The school was for 11 to 16
year-olds, but they wanted to do A-levels, so the drama teacher, who
was called Miss Jones, continued to work with them on Saturday
mornings. Of that group of 12 children, two went on to be teachers.
Truancy and absenteeism at the school decreased and results improved.
Arts really can inspire young people. Projects like Kids in Museums and
Shakespeare in schools are hugely important.</hs_para>

times, even with problems of survival that must have seemed far more
pressing than those that we face today, humans have created art, as we

sure that they created music too; the earliest of drawings indicate
both music and dancing. Of course, every culture shines in different
ways, and our own culture has been and remains distinctive and
outstanding. We have world-class theatres, artists, galleries, heritage
sites and music. As I heard my noble friend Lord Cormack, I was

<?notus-xml column=1528?>those lines. I would not be surprised if it is not long before he starts

noble friend Lord Jenkin, who unfortunately is unable to be with us
today, the noble Baroness, Lady Liddell of Coatdyke, and the noble
Lord, Lord Cameron of Dillington. The amendment, which is fortunately
grouped with the very interesting amendments that the Government have
tabled on the same subject, tries to guarantee the independent
renewable energy generators who have a vital role to play in ensuring
that we have secure, affordable and sustainable energy in the United
Kingdom.</hs_para>

generators feel—they certainly did before the Government tabled
their amendments last week—that the Energy Bill puts at risk
their ability to raise the funds necessary to invest in vital
infrastructure because it does not provide a clear route to market for
them once they have carried out that investment. They feel that the
Bill effectively entrenches independent generators’ dependency
on the big six through their power to provide long-term power purchase
agreements. They therefore feel, and have felt for some time, that the
lack of effective competition for those long-term power purchase
agreements means that the terms available to the independent generators
make their position unviable and make it that much more difficult for
them to raise the funds necessary to carry out the investment that we
all believe is
important.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000004">This
is a problem, in their view—I realise that others may have a
different analysis—of a structural market failure that will not
be solved by Ofgem’s liquidity reforms. Nor will the move to a
new structure of CFDs provide to a market source the sort of
competition that would enable them to obtain PPAs. This problem of
market access by the independent generators was, I understand, first
raised by them with the department two years ago when it was first
announced that the renewables obligation was to be withdrawn and
replaced by the generation support mechanism that we have been
discussing this
week<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T14:03:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000005">The
failure to tackle the problem earlier reflects to some extent—I
do not want to be unkind; I understand the difficulties that the
department has had in trying to model these
problems—inadequacies in the assumptions that were made about
how the market would operate in this situation. There was an assumption
that it would operate rather more effectively and that, therefore,
there was no need to guarantee a route to market for the independent
generators.</hs_para>

course, those of us who have had a chance to study the Baringa report
on which the Government’s amendments for a backstop PPA proposal
are to some extent based, was received by the department in its final
form less than 10 days ago. Therefore, one understands why there is
still a great deal more work to be done before final decisions can be
made as to the way in which a backstop could be set up. On the other
hand, the independent generators feel that there is an urgent need for
the Energy Bill to be amended in such a way that it includes a solution
which incorporates plurality in the market for PPAs from the beginning.
It will not be possible for them to make applications for CFDs without
having some assurance that they will be able to market what they
produce on that
basis<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T14:07:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000007">As
was discussed in Committee in the other place, many in the industry
prefer the solution of a green power auction market to solve the
problem. The Government have claimed that this would be a more
expensive way to achieve the objective. There is, of course, a dispute
about that. The independent generators would argue that they could
achieve a £2 billion saving for consumers by removing a
middleman charge that the current market generates. I am not sure about
that but one of the problems that I have, and why this amendment has
been tabled in the way that it has, is the complexity of developing the
backstop PPA. The 
<?notus-xml column=541?>more I read the Baringa report, the more difficult I feel this is going
to be. That complexity is such that I believe it is important that
there should be a backstop in the form of a green power auction market
if it is not possible to implement the backstop PPA. That is why this
amendment has been put down in the way that it has. If the backstop PPA
is not viably implemented and in place when the first CFDs are in
operation, the independent generators will be under a clear
disadvantage compared with the big six and the foreign state-backed
utilities, contrary to what the Minister in the other place pledged in
Committee, and UK energy
security<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T14:07:03"></hs_TimeCode> will be
at
risk.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000008">According
to what we have read in the department’s helpful briefings, the
regulations will not necessarily be laid until next year. What we need
to hear from the Minister today is an assurance about when they will be
implemented so that the independent generators can be sure that they
will be available at the appropriate
time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T14:07:30"></hs_TimeCode>. With the
detail of the backstop proposals still to be finalised, it seems to us
necessary that the Bill also empowers the Government to implement as a
backstop to the backstop the GPAM, which is the only clearly worked-out
solution, and one which could operate, even though I realise it has
some
disadvantages<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T14:08:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000009">I
have a further amendment in this group, which is the traditional
amendment with which, I am afraid, I have teased the Committee in the

Cameron of Dillington:</Member></B> My Lords, I have put my name to
this amendment. Our energy markets are dominated on both the generation
and supply sides by the big six integrated utilities. Meanwhile, we
have a very complicated situation whereby the Government are trying to
maintain semi-market conditions in a marketplace that is obviously
rigged, and rightly so, in order to decarbonise it and ensure security
of supply. As a result, the contortions and complications in this
marketplace are mind-boggling, as my noble friend Lord Roper said. It
is hard to see how the EMR game will evolve in this respect over the
next
decade.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000011">One
basic principle if we are to have an efficient marketplace is that we
need to balance as far as possible the amount of power generated with
the demand for that power—with a capacity margin, of course.
There is no doubt that the integration of a power supply chain makes
achieving that balance much easier but having all the power generated
by only a few is not in anyone’s interest. We need as many
independent generators as possible and that means they need to be able
to secure investment for their projects. The Government recognise both
these facts in their amendments in this
group.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000012">To
touch on the principles involved here, I understand the argument made
by some that no business should have the right to make a guaranteed
return for its investors, but in the electricity market we are dealing
with a special situation. We have to make the big jump 
<?notus-xml column=542?>from fossil fuels to renewable power. In a competitive, international
financial marketplace, with many variable investment opportunities in
many less risky and possibly less complicated fields, investors and
banks are reluctant to commit to the renewable generation industry
without a reduction in the long-term risk. For the sake of our energy
security and energy decarbonisation, not to mention our overall
economy, we need that reduction in risk and thus that commitment. The
Government’s recognition of this in their amendments is very
pleasing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000013">To
continue to defend the principles behind the Government’s
amendments, it is important to remember that an increased risk
inevitably leads to an increased cost of capital, which in turn leads
to higher costs for consumers. We do not want that increased risk. Bear
in mind that renewable technologies are pretty much all about the cost
of capital because after the initial capital cost the actual source of
the power—wind, sun, tide or waterfall—is usually free,
provided that the management is
satisfactory.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000014">So
far I could have been speaking in favour equally well of the new
government amendments as our own. My only real worry about the
government amendments is that, with all the “may”s rather
than “must”s, and all the possible provisions that might
or might not appear at some undecided time in the future, these
amendments descend on one like an amorphous cloud of uncertainty. One
recognises that somewhere within them are the right intentions but no
one is quite sure how it will all work out. I suspect that we will
return to these amendments on Report to get greater
clarity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000015">Returning
to our amendments and Amendment 55AC in particular—the noble
Lord, Lord Roper, spoke about this—it might be worth touching on
the choice between a backstop power purchase agreement, or PPA, and a
green power auction market, or GPAM. My own view is that of the two
options GPAM is the better one. I would very much prefer it if the
Government could keep Amendment 55AC up their sleeve in case their
backstop PPA does not do the trick for the investors. I cannot see what
harm it would do to have it in reserve. That would make it much easier
in future to revert to the existing, proven system. I stress those last
three words: the NFPA exists and works. It would be crazy not to put
this option in the Bill now just in case investors lose confidence in
the backstop powers. It does not matter how confident the Government
are that their way will work. It is the confidence of the investors
that matters. There is no way of second-guessing the
marketplace.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000016">As
I said, the existing NFPA is already a proven option and works
extremely well selling six-month contracts six months
ahead—because it is only for six months. The balancing risk is
low for the supplier. They will not get caught out buying too much
power at the wrong price that will look silly in five or six
years’ time. That is very helpful to the small supplier and
therefore encourages greater diversity and competition at that end of
the marketplace. That may be why the big six do not like it. Meanwhile,
we already know that GPAM creates enough flexibility and reliability in
the marketplace to boost the confidence of the investor, who is needed
to support the independent generator. All that is already
proven.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=543?><hs_para UID="13072528000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000017">The other element that
persuades me that GPAM is best is that I do not like the idea that the
backstop PPA leaves DECC or Ofgem in overall command of the
marketplace, setting both the strike price and the electricity floor
price. I prefer some semblance of a working market, even though a true
market may be some way off. I guess that this is my main preference for
GPAM. We all hope that in 25 or 30 years’ time, our reliance on

concerned about their tentative nature. I started out by being
concerned about the backstop and how it would operate because the
reality is that at the point at which the backstop kicks in, you are

to someone who is standing on at the edge of a crumbling cliff,
“Don’t worry if you fall off; the RAF has a very good
search and rescue operation”. It is very troubling that there is
no recognition of the stage at which a company or project would be when
the backstop was applied. I am delighted that someone as eminent and
knowledgeable as the noble Lord, Lord Roper, found the Baringa report a

said, when we were discussing Amendment 53BB, no one is blessed with
perfect foresight and energy markets are wonderful at knocking people

energy markets. That makes it all the more essential to have a degree
of flexibility. I can understand why the department has relied so
heavily on the big six because they are the big operators in the field,

entrepreneurialism on the part of the independent generators.</hs_para>

their minds back, it was interesting to hear what the noble Lord, Lord
Deighton, said at the Dispatch Box during Question Time on Tuesday

renewable energy, particularly offshore renewable energy, would be in
helping our investment in infrastructure to move ahead. Yet these
independent generators are the very people who are coming along and
saying, “Hold on a minute; we don’t have the certainty to
invest”. I get the impression that some people, when they are
looking at the scale of these investments, think that we are talking
about something that will cost £200,000 or even £2
million. There is a project in Edinburgh that

Deben:</Member></B> My Lords, we may have noticed that there is a good
deal of support on both sides for what the Government are trying to do.
I hope that my noble friend the Minister has noticed the tone in which
these discussions have been carried through. We would like to be
convinced, and we are unconvinced only because these measures are quite
difficult to
understand<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T14:22:06"></hs_TimeCode>. The

thing in the Climate Change Act that the climate change committee is
supposed to do is to ensure that the public understands what it is
doing. I do not think that that is a bad thing to have at the back of
one’s mind. I just hope that I do not have to stand on a
platform at this moment and explain in simple terms what is in here. I
suspect that my noble friend the Minister would agree that that is not
the most comfortable place in government just at this moment. It is not
because there are things that are necessarily wrong with it, but there
are extremely complicated things in it, and we want to make sure that
it is as good as it can be. That is my first
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T14:23:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000029">On
the amendments, I remind noble Lords that this is no small matter.
Electricity from renewables increased last year by 19%, which is pretty
remarkable; it is 11.3% of the total. We are not talking about some
tiny little thing, which is what the climate change dismissers are
always saying. This is no longer a gleam in the eye of Greenpeace; it
is a central part of what we are seeking to do. Therefore, we have to
recognise that enabling the elbow room for the renewables sector is
very important. The Government have recognised that and, on all sides,
people have said that the government amendments do extremely
well<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T14:24:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000030">I
want to put three simple propositions to my noble friend. First, it is
instinctively difficult for free marketeers such as me to be entirely
keen on a system where the Government are fixing almost every element
of the process. I recognise that it may be necessary—and,
indeed, if it is necessary, I shall be the first to defend it. But I
think that she understands why one starts by being a little concerned
about
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T14:24:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000031">Secondly,
we need a convincing explanation of why some kind of auction is not
part of the set up. It has been shown around the world that the one way
in which you get lower prices is through a descending auction. There is
no doubt about that. The advantage of that is that it does have that
effect. From what happened in Brazil it is clear—it is not that
it has not been tried and found wanting; it has been tried and it
works—that you can bring prices down if you operate in that
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T14:25:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000032">It
gives huge confidence to the public because, instead of the Government
having to explain in the context of a document such as this why they
have delivered this, that or the other, they are able to say to the
market, “Look, the price has been fixed at the 
<?notus-xml column=546?>lowest figure we can see working”. There is a real issue of
communication here and a need to explain why—apart from the
unconvincing pushing aside in the other place when Ministers said it
would be very expensive and complicated. I was a Minister for 16 years
and I knew that any civil servant who said we could not do something
because it was expensive and complicated had not worked it out. That
mechanism is always used; it is the technique. I look with care at
those behind my noble friend. An issue may be complicated but you might
be able to make it simple, but the idea that it is expensive I have
never seen proved in any independent area.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T14:26:53"></hs_TimeCode> would like to
be 100% on the side of the Government on this but the whole concept of
a competitive system based upon some kind of auction is so valuable
that we should not lose
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T14:27:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000033">Thirdly,
the worst kind of debates in the other place, and even more so in your
Lordships’ House, are about what it means rather than about what
should be done. My worry in this area is that if we get to the Floor of
the House and spend our time trying to work out what it means, we will
probably get it entirely wrong. It would be valuable if the Government
could clear that bit
out.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T14:27:44"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000034">The
noble Baroness, Lady Liddell, and I have not always agreed on matters
over the years but at least on this we can be at one. We want to arrive
in October with a clear view of what is being proposed and what its
ramifications are so that if we do not agree with it at least we are
talking about the same thing. I fear that if we argued about it now we
would be arguing about something that was different in the mind of
every Member of the Committee. After all, we have chosen to try to
understand these things rather more than the generality. I hope my
noble friend will treat the amendment with that kind of approach,
rather than saying, “It does not quite work in this way or that
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T14:28:40"></hs_TimeCode>”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000035"><B><Member ContinuationText="Viscount Hanworth" PimsId="832" UID="13072528000266" xid="2155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000266">Viscount

55AE calls on the secretary of State to make regulations that will
ensure that the independent electricity generators that employ
renewable technologies will find a route to market for their produce.
We are aware that the Government are relying on those enterprises to
provide a large proportion of the investment in renewable electricity
generation: the figure is anything between 35% and 50% of the new
investment. There is also a widely perceived danger that, in the
absence of further provisions in the Bill, the independent generators
will be squeezed out of the market. The reality is that the big six
electricity firms, who supply more than 90% of the
electricity that is sold to consumers and businesses, have been
expanding their generating portfolios 
<?notus-xml column=547?>to include an increasing proportion of renewable energy. In the process,
they have been dispensing with the services of the independent
generators<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T14:30:12"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T14:30:19"></hs_TimeCode>.
The renewables obligation, which for a while was effective in obliging
the big six to purchase the output of the independent generators, is
becoming ever less effective in sustaining them. The suspension of the
renewables obligation in 2017 would surely spell the doom of the
independents unless some effective measures are enacted to prevent
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T14:30:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13072528000252" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000252">2.30

time, the Government have ignored the plight of the independent
generators. Quite simply, they have failed to perceive the dangers that
the Bill poses for them. Now it seems that, at last, they have begun to
understand their circumstances. In the Commons on 4 June, the Minister,
Greg Baker, was keen to assure Members that the Government now have the
matter under active consideration. He undertook to respond more fully
to the proposal for a green power auction market, GPAM, in the course
of the Bill’s passage through Parliament. However, he also
asserted that independent generators face only a short-term problem. He
gave a bland assurance that the contracts for difference, which are the
essential provision of the Bill, will undoubtedly improve their
circumstances and that they will offer them “the best long-term
solution”.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T14:31:40"></hs_TimeCode> am bound to
say, as JM Keynes once did, that in the long run, we shall all be dead.
Clearly, the independent generators may not survive into the long term.

have been some developments in the past few weeks. As recently as last
Thursday, the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, tabled amendments to the Bill
designed to improve access to the market for the independent renewables
generators. The new so-called backstop powers granted by her amendment
would allow DECC or some other agency to command electricity suppliers
to buy power from the independent generators, if those generators are
unable to establish a viable purchasing power agreement with one of the
major
suppliers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T14:32:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000039">The
proposals for a backstop power purchasing agreement are contained in a
document prepared for DECC by a consultancy called Redpoint Baringa.
The document has existed in draft form since the end of February, or,
it may be, for longer, but it appears to have been largely neglected by
DECC until recently. The document appears to suggest that, in the main,
the independent generators will find an easy route to market and that
they will have little difficulty in raising capital. It is assumed
that, in consequence, recourse to the backstop provisions will be an
infrequent occurrence. The provisions are designed to make this a none
too profitable recourse for an independent generator. The report states
that,</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13072528000217" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000217">“this
option will be designed to be unattractive for equity under normal
market conditions and should therefore only be triggered by the project

backstop

seems to me that the report’s proposals embody the same
optimistic assumption regarding the proper 
<?notus-xml column=548?>functioning of a competitive market that was the fallacy under which the
draft Bill was labouring and which continues to be a feature of the
fond imaginings of the Government. Therefore, the proposals do not

the amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, accord very
considerable additional powers to the Secretary of State, they do not
spell out any of the details of the backstop provisions. The Renewable
Energy Association has declared that although they might
reassure lenders that they will not lose their money if they generator
cannot find a buyer for the power, the provisions will not provide much
encouragement to invest. Investors will need to see some secure
long-term purchasing power contracts; they will need more than a mere
assurance that someone will step in if all else fails. My subsidiary
Amendment 55AFA is designed to ensure that any power purchase

Renewable Energy Generators Group, which represents a majority of
independent generators, favours the alternative option of a fully
fledged green power auction market modelled on the existing provisions
of the Non-Fossil Purchasing Agency, the NFPA. Under such provisions, a
generator’s output would be auctioned in six-month blocks on a
rolling basis for the duration of its contract for difference. The
auction prices would create a market reference price relative to which
the payment under the contract for difference would be determined. I
should say that the Bill proposes that payments in favour of the
generators are to be made whenever the reference price is below a datum
known as the strike price, and that charges are to be imposed upon them
whenever the reference price exceeds the strike

amendments in the names of the noble Lord, Lord Roper, and others cover
both the option of backstop powers on the one hand and the option of a
green power auction market on the other. It clearly signals that
something must be done and that it must be done urgently. However, it

already observed, that the backstop powers will be invoked only when
all else has failed. At such a stage, the market failures will have
been sufficient to deter the investors on whom the Government are
relying. On the other hand, the green power auction market presupposes
the presence of a sufficient number of willing purchasers. In their

Teverson:</Member></B> My Lords, if there has one been theme since the
Bill started its long route over the past couple of years to where it
is now, it is that it is not decarbonisation that has been the subject
of the big debate—although it is a bigger debate now, I
admit—but access to the market and competition by a vibrant
independent generating sector. I would not be as pessimistic as the
noble Viscount when he says that this sector would be squeezed out
altogether. However, we want to see not just a surviving independent
sector—and I believe it would survive under the conditions that
we have at the moment—but a vibrant and expanding sector where
we see future competition growing. I do not think we have got there
yet. Whether it was the Select Committee in the House of Commons that
went through the draft Bill or our own committee under the noble Lord,
Lord Oxburgh, the whole area of independent generator competition was a
theme that was common to us both and a very strong
one<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T14:39:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that the Government do not understand that this is an issue. I think
that they do and that they have done for some time. They have done a
lot of work on this, and I am sure that the Minister will go through
it. The Government are aware that this is an issue and have been
working on it very hard. What concerns me is that, as far as this Bill
and the amendments are concerned, we still seem to be in a position of
“may” rather than “must”. Although we talk
about this in all sorts of other areas and sometimes use it as a
political ploy—sometimes trying to strengthen something that is
legitimate as a “may”—in this area it prolongs the
uncertainty of the
market.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000049">When
the Bill started its long process back in 1910—I mean in
2010-11; it might seem like the last century but it clearly was

three and a half years until that April 2017 deadline. By the time this
Bill becomes an Act, as it surely will in whatever state, that will be
down to three years. As the noble Baroness, Lady Liddell, said, these
major investment projects take time, whether it is in planning
permission, judicial review or all the other areas. By then we will be
well into the post-2017 period. That is why it is important that the
Bill firms up on that and why I am slightly concerned that it is still
a “may” situation in these

that the point has come where, as a Government—I point out to

Conservative—we need to come off the fence. We need to say,
“Yes, this is not just a problem but one we understand needs to

unfortunate thing in this long process is the feeling that the auction

going forward—something to which my noble friend Lord Hanworth
alluded. This is not a small part of the market but a considerable part
of it, and my noble friend Lady Liddell pointed to the reasons for

Worthington:</Member></B> I thank the noble Lord for his timely
intervention. I could not agree more. It is a shame that those
statistics were not trumpeted more. We would all feel very proud that
that happened at a time when the rest of the economy was not doing so
well. It was not just that there was good growth in that sector but it
positively affected our balance of trade. There are very few sectors in
which we can say we have a positive balance of trade with China, but in
this sector we can. As the noble Lord alluded to, the global average
rate of growth in this sector was only 4%, while we were at 4.8%. Tiny
nation though we are, our growth in this sector is outstripping much
larger nations. We are up in the top six countries in this sector. I am
sorry that I am waxing lyrical slightly here but it is important. We
are a nation of innovation and entrepreneurial spirit. We were the
country that brought the Industrial Revolution to the world; let us not
forget that. Let us hope that we will remain at the forefront of this
industrial revolution. I know that that sounds like a grand
introduction but it is pertinent to this part of the Bill. We really
need to make sure that this sector is protected and that no unintended
consequences are meted out to it as a result of the

It is probably fair to say that it was already emerging. The renewables
obligation has been a good policy that has driven a lot of investment,
but we were already hearing that independent generators were finding it
difficult to secure power purchase agreements. At the heart of this
issue is the problem, alluded to many times throughout our
deliberations in Committee, of the vertical integration of the big six.
There is no liquid, open competition in generation. We have an
oligopolistic system of six vertically integrated companies that
dominate. It will come as no surprise that on this side of the House we
believe that the time has come to address that. We would have preferred
to see genuine market reforms that required the selling of power into a
competitive pool, which would be good for competition, liquidity, the
independent generators and the consumer. We know that the Government
are not yet there but we hope they will join us

Bill helps to make the case even stronger for splitting apart that
vertical integration because we are moving into a system of contracts
for difference. We are moving away from the arguments in 
<?notus-xml column=552?>favour of vertical integration, which are that you need it to secure
finance and build new capacity, but when you have a CFD the argument
is, by and large, weakened. There is also a big intervention in the
capacity mechanism. The time is therefore coming, if not now then very
soon, for the issue to be properly addressed.</hs_para>

These proposals, though welcome, come quite late in the day. As has
been mentioned, we have known about this problem for two years and yet
here we are addressing the issue on the eighth day in Committee and on
the final stretch. I think it was the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, who said
that it feels as though we are making things up as we go along. I would
not say that it was as bad as that but it does feel as though these
measures have been considered quite hastily. Making this a negative
resolution risks the ire of the Delegated Powers Committee, which has
not yet had a chance to consider it, and we strongly urge acceptance of

have explained why there is an issue and, in the spirit of
collaboration and seeking to make the Bill as strong as possible, I
should perhaps now explain what I think the solutions are. First, we
know that the industry wants to find a resolution to this issue. It is
very keen to work with the Government and would like to have proper
consultation with the department. It has been mentioned to us that the
organised consultation process was slightly opaque. I know that five of
the renewables trade associations, as a group, have written to the
department requesting more clarity in the consultation process around
the detail of these provisions. They are worried about communications
not being consistent and they are worried about the timelines. They
need reassurances from the department and a clearer process of
involvement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T14:51:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000062">Further
to the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Liddell, this should also
include investors, who are absolutely at the heart of the issue. Clause
44 is about facilitating investment and not about liquidity, which is
dealt with in Clause 43. It is very important that the consultation
process fully involves the investors who will be necessary to get these
projects under
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T14:52:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000063">I
have not spoken about the GPAM alternative. I am not sufficiently
across the details to know whether the GPAM is a better option than the
backstop power but the wording of the government amendment limits the
options. At the moment, Clause 44 gives a broad power to do what is
necessary. The government amendments would remove that flexibility and
narrow it down to the PPA. The PPA may be the right answer but I am not
certain that that narrowing down is a good idea. I have been critical
of the breadth of some of the powers but in this case, given that it is
still in development and that consultation is necessary, I urge the
Government to keep open the option of making a 
<?notus-xml column=553?>different type of intervention if necessary. That would tweak the
government amendment. It is important that we do not put all our eggs

attention to the fact that there are a range of different institutions
that one can talk to. For some of us, one of the easiest things to do

who until two weeks ago was the chairman of a community energy company
that has just fallen off the cliff because of the attitude of a major
generator. She, of all people, can tell us the view of the independent

that. As I was saying, there is clearly an issue and a need for
intervention. There are existing alternatives for the independent
generators. Perhaps one thing that we need to explore is how we can
strengthen those independent suppliers. Ecotricity was a very good
example. It was set up to build wind farms but found that the way that
it could build its business best was to have a supply arm creating its
own form of vertical integration. It is a way of creating more
liquidity and plurality in the market to help those independent
suppliers to buy from the independent generators. That seems logical,
so perhaps we can explore how those can be better

are also aggregators in the market. One problem that independent
generators face is that individually they do not have the capacity to
employ traders. The big six all routinely employ traders for all sorts
of reasons, and that gives them a massive market advantage from being
able to enter the various markets themselves. Aggregation and the
provision of grouped trading services is necessary to help to support
suppliers. That is another area that we could look at in more detail to
see whether something needs to be done to make it more

be listening and asking what is happening in the market following the

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Energy and
Climate Change (Baroness Verma):</Member></B> My Lords, the issue of
competition and, in particular, the route to market for independent
renewable generators has been referred to throughout the Bill’s
passage in this House and in the other place, and the debate has been
equally eloquent and balanced today. There is good reason for that. I
agree with noble Lords: independent renewable generators have a
significant pipeline of projects across the UK and bring essential
competition, innovation and diversity to the energy market.</hs_para>

recognise that in recent years it has become harder for independent
renewable generators to secure power purchase agreements on bankable
terms. We judge that several of the factors currently constraining the
market will be resolved by the introduction of CFDs, but some issues
may continue to limit competition for long-term PPAs after CFDs have
been
introduced.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000074">My
officials have worked very closely with industry to prepare the market
for the CFDs. We have already established industry working groups to
develop PPA structures that will be fit for purpose for the new market
arrangements and a code of practice for those participating in the PPA
market. Those will help new entrants and smaller generators to navigate
the process of negotiating and securing PPAs. However, the Government
have decided that it is necessary to provide further confidence for
developers and investors by tabling amendments to the existing powers
in the Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000075">I
am very pleased to hear a welcome from noble Lords from across the
Committee for the amendments. They will enable the establishment of a
power purchase agreement scheme which could provide generators with
access to an off-taker of last resort. This mechanism would be similar
to that outlined in my noble friend’s Amendment 55AB. In the
light of the Government’s amendments, I hope to reassure my
noble friend and other noble Lords that these issues are being
addressed.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13072528000254" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000254">3

55AB is designed to address the issue of access to market by giving all
CFD holders the right to a backstop power purchase agreement with an 
<?notus-xml column=555?>electricity supplier on terms specified in regulations. The Government
fully agree with the intention behind this amendment. However, the
amendment differs from the government amendments
in a number of key areas. First, it would place the Secretary of State
under a duty to introduce the mechanism. We do not think that this is
appropriate, since a full understanding of potential unintended
consequences is needed before taking any decision to introduce any such
mechanism, and the need for this may change over time. Secondly, the
amendment explicitly states that every generator eligible for a CFD
contract should also be eligible for a backstop PPA. This would include
large nuclear, renewable and CCS generators, for whom this may not be
appropriate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000077">Finally,

desirability of ensuring that every … generator who is a party

at reasonable cost and over a reasonable
period”.</hs_quotefo><hs_para UID="13072528000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000078">This
is something that the Government should not do, as there are many
factors other than a backstop PPA mechanism that have a more
significant effect on whether generators have access to debt at
reasonable rates and

55AC would oblige the Secretary of State to establish a green power
auction market in the case that the backstop off-taker scheme proves
ineffective. While we appreciate the GPAM proposals as a valuable
contribution to the debate, we have considered very carefully the
analysis of the impacts and decided that this would not, perhaps, be
the best way forward. GPAM would effectively turn the CFD into a fixed
feed-in tariff, which would isolate generators from normal market
incentives. Noble Lords may recall that the CFD was chosen over a fixed
feed-in tariff to retain market incentives. In other developed
countries, such as Germany, with high levels of renewable generation,
fixed feed-in tariffs have led to excessive costs to consumers, and
such countries are increasingly moving to other mechanisms that retain
market incentives. Furthermore, GPAM would be a fundamental distortion
of the purpose of CFDs and is not guaranteed to be bankable. Indeed,
lenders have indicated that GPAM would itself require an off-taker of
last resort mechanism to protect against the possibility of a
generator’s power not selling in the auction, or the auction not
taking
place.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000080">As my

welcome the intention behind the Amendment 55AE proposed by
the noble Viscount, Lord Hanworth. It requires the Secretary of State
to ensure that independent electricity generators, employing renewable
technologies, have a route to market. I have already set out the range
of work under way to support independent generators and hope that this,
in addition to the Government’s own amendments, satisfies the
noble Viscount’s concerns and that he will not press his

55AFB amend the Government’s amendments. I hope that this is a
sign that the noble Viscount sees merit in our proposals. Amendment
55AFA would ensure that electricity generators are eligible for PPAs
under the scheme for the duration of their CFDs. While I am sympathetic
towards its intention, we have to be careful not to constrain our
options at such an early stage. For example, it may be that access to
PPAs under the scheme is not appropriate during the first few years of
a generator’s CFD, when the risks and level of uncertainty is
lower. We plan on consulting on the design of the off-taker of last
resort later in the year. I reassure the noble Viscount that the
duration of support will be considered as part of this process.
Amendment 55AFB would enable the terms of the PPAs under the scheme to
be made by reference to current market prices. This would undermine the
effectiveness of the scheme which depends on generators knowing the
backstop price at the onset of the
CFD.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000083">I am

to government Amendments 55AF, 55AG, 55AH, 55AJ and 55AM, which I hope
noble Lords will welcome. These amendments clarify and supplement the
existing powers in this chapter by enabling the establishment of a
power purchase agreement scheme. Under such a scheme, licensed
electricity suppliers would be required to offer to enter into PPAs
with eligible generators on specified terms and through a specified
process. The amendments would also enable the costs or benefits of the
scheme to be apportioned among suppliers, and functions to be conferred
on the Secretary of State or
Ofgem.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000085">These
powers would enable the Secretary of State to create an off-taker of
last resort mechanism. This would guarantee generators access to
backstop PPAs on specified terms, thereby giving them confidence over
the minimum price they will receive for their power. To ensure that the
mechanism is truly a last resort, the terms offered must be
significantly lower than those expected in a well-functioning
market.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000086">The
socialisation of the costs or benefits of the scheme across suppliers
would ensure that any effect on the PPA market is minimised. To ensure
that the mechanism operates fairly and efficiently, Ofgem would be
responsible for administering the scheme, including overseeing
allocation of generators to suppliers. These protections will ensure
that the mechanism does not interfere with the normal PPA market and
would be called upon only in the event of a clear market
failure.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000087">We
consider that such a mechanism, by contrast to the GPAM, offers a
simpler solution that will provide better value for money. It does not
require significant intervention in the market, as the GPAM would, and
it will reduce costs to consumers because it retains 
<?notus-xml column=557?>normal market incentives on generators. This mechanism should make
lenders more comfortable financing projects that use a greater variety
of routes to market, including a more diverse range of PPA
counterparties and shorter-term PPAs. This will lead to greater
competition in the PPA market, potentially reducing the costs that
independent generators face in accessing the market and reducing costs
to
consumers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000088">Initial

will she explain again why she rejected Amendment 55AFB in the name of
the noble Viscount, Lord Hanworth, which would have inserted in
government Amendment 55AF a reference to current market prices? I find
my entry in the Register of Interests extremely misleading because it
should imply competence to deal with this Bill, whereas I find it
extremely hard to penetrate. However, I would have thought that over
time the PPA must bear some relation to market prices. It cannot be set
for all time, surely. The Minister seemed to be saying that it was
important to give the certainty of a fixed price. That would mean a
variable degree of subsidy, depending on what was happening to the
actual price in the

have some difficulty with Amendment 55AB, introduced so impressively by
the noble Lord, Lord Roper. I find it difficult to get away completely
from the idea of efficiency being a criterion as well as independence.
All the emphasis on the ability to borrow in the markets or from the
banks and thus to have the certainty of a demonstrably viable price
seems to take us far away from the market and questions of efficiency,
although I am all for encouraging independent generators. However, the
Minister’s rejection of Amendment 55AFB really puzzles me.
Surely there must be some relationship with current prices in the

clearly essential if we are to have continued growth. We will probably
continue to disagree about “duty” or
“power”, but we have already considered that in other

whereas it may be necessary for it to be here now, there may be a time

two of the other points raised by the Minister as to whether GPAM would
require a backstop, there are obviously different views. The

arises because the current subsidies to wood-burning power plants make

friends Lord Jenkin and Lord Roper have put this amendment forward.
Although I do not support its content, it is an important subject to
have raised 
<?notus-xml column=561?>briefly in this Committee. One difficulty that we have to face is that
the way that renewable materials are considered alters very quickly.
There was a time when people talked about biomass as though it was the
solution to everything. They hardly ever spoke about biomass without
saying how wonderful it was. Then we saw the pendulum swing to the
other end and no sort of biomass was acceptable to anyone. There was
always some good reason why it was not acceptable. In rather a long
life, I have usually found that neither of those two positions is a
good place for the pendulum, although somewhere in the middle
is.</hs_para>

there is a central issue which goes beyond biomass. It is illustrated
by a circumstance in my own county of Suffolk, where the local council
has just turned down a request to build a waste-to-energy installation
using straw. The argument against it was not an environmental one. It
was a genuine argument about whether it and other straw-burning
waste-to-energy installations would have such an appetite for straw
locally that the price for straw would increase because of the subsidy
structure. The other uses of straw in the area, which were very
significant and led to opposition to the installation from pig farmers
and others, meant that the planning committee had to say that it did
not see that this was the right answer. I am not at all sure that that
was the planning reason that it gave, because planning is a rather
complex matter, but that was certainly what the argument was
about<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T15:26:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Committee, the Standing Committee and our future discussions in your
Lordships’ House can lead the charge for having sensible
discussions about environmental matters and not arguments
between those who believe in things and those who do not.
Very often, the decision and the choice come somewhere between the two,
and this issue illustrates that very well. It is perfectly possible to
be an enthusiastic environmentalist determined to combat
climate change but to say that a particular straw-burning
installation in a particular place is not the answer. The same applies
to biomass. However, that does not mean that you are taking a nimby
attitude. I am not talking about people objecting to something because
it is near to them; I am talking about having more serious discussions
about individual issues than is often allowed simply because the two
sides clash and the space in between is not available for intelligent

important that two things are taken into account. First, how does the
subsidy—that is what it is—affect other industries; and
are there circumstances in which we should look at that carefully?
Secondly, how do we make sure that the subsidy is in support of biomass
which is properly sourced? I do not want this particular solution
although there is a bit that appeals to me: we should make sure that
people do not use biomass that has a bigger carbon footprint than what
it is replacing.</hs_para>

that all this stuff came from certified forests but I think that there
is now some pretty good international measurement that enables one to
decide whether “certified” means
“certified” or whether it means, “This is a label

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Lords, Lord Jenkin and Lord
Roper, have raised an interesting point. I was going to support the
amendment, at least in principle, but for rather wider reasons than
those that the noble Lord, Lord Roper, advanced or, indeed, some of the
points that the noble Lord, Lord Deben, made. The arguments are
sometimes between one group of environmentalists and another and they
are sometimes between one vested interest and another. We have been
through the same cycle or swing on liquid biofuels. I am not sure where
the pendulum will end up on that—there has been a significant
intervention, which I was partly involved with in my previous capacity
in
government.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000123">This
is a difficult issue. The amendment asks the Secretary of State, first,
to look at it carefully and, secondly, to ensure that the users of
biomass as a feedstock have obligations to consider the nature of the
supply chain and how far it saves carbon. Even in the best of
circumstances, biomass in the broadest sense—it covers a
multitude of very different forms of feedstock, from food and farm
waste to bespoke forestries that are grown for this purpose on the
other side of the world—is, even conceptually, a rather long
form of sustainability. You chop down one tree and another one grows,
so that in 50 years’ time you have replaced the first one. That
is not necessarily the same as some forms of feedstock where the carbon
content is low or nil immediately. With biomass, there is a carbon
emission. It is therefore important that, in this whole approach, we
look at what form of biomass we are using, where it has been sourced
from and what it displaces—I had not thought of the softwood
argument or the straw argument, although I seem vaguely to remember a
similar case not so long
ago.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000124" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000124">As for
displacement on a global scale, I was also thinking about growing
bespoke crops in ground that would otherwise be for food, whether in
the third world or whether sugar beet, for example, in the UK. It is a
big question. At the moment, there is no requirement either on the
Government or the regulators and counterparties to look at that aspect.
There is also no obligation on the generator proposing a biomass
project to look at these issues. The amendment at least gets us into
that important discussion.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=563?><hs_para UID="13072528000125" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000125">On some of the figures
that the Government have produced—I am not quite sure in which
context—we have looked at the early, phase 1 proposals for green
energy, of which there is in total 18 gigawatts. Some 5.3 gigawatts
comes from six projects for biomass conversions—from fossil
fuels to biomass in part or in whole—and another 0.6 gigawatts
comes from biomass CHP projects. Therefore, a third of what is
currently being proposed upfront regarding all the technologies is
biomass. It is much larger than onshore wind in this context, so this
will be an important issue. Money is being invested in it and
expectations are being raised as to how it will perform. Therefore,
what appears to be a simple and modest amendment in the names of the
noble Lords, Lord Jenkin and Lord Roper, opens up a wide field. We will
not resolve this issue today and we may not even resolve it in the
course of the Bill. However, the department, those who enforce the
regulations and those who propose biomass projects will have to explain
in rather more detail how they are sourcing this, what the effects of
sourcing it will be and what the effect on carbon emissions will be. If
something like this amendment were accepted by the Government, we would
at least get into that discussion. I do not suppose that the Minister
will accept the amendment, but it would be helpful if she would at
least indicate that the department needs to take another look at
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000126" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000126"><B><Member ContinuationText="The Earl of Caithness" PimsId="2425" UID="13072528000287" xid="1123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000287">The
Earl of Caithness:</Member></B> The more we look into this subject, the
more complicated it gets. We should take seriously the points raised by
the noble Lord, Lord Whitty. He mentioned converting land that is
suitable for food crops to other uses. We know that in Brazil maize and
corn are being used as fuel for cars. I wrote to Drax when I noted that
it was converting three of its stations to biofuel production.
Sub-Committee D was looking at energy at the time . The staff at Drax
were very bullish and said, “This is a wonderful thing. It is
all being grown overseas. It is all reputable and is being monitored
very carefully. It will all come over in ships and everybody is going
to be very happy”. Another point which has not been mentioned is
that the amendment refers to “woody biomass” and if you
take land out of agricultural production and convert it to timber
production, that is a long-term and expensive operation. My noble
friend Lord Deben mentioned straw, which is an annual crop but, as
regards the sort of material that we are talking about, you are talking
of a crop that could well be harvested in 40 to 60
years’ time. Intervening in such a market leads to
complications. I am very glad that I am not the Minister who has to
deal with this issue as it would cause me all sorts of nightmares,
which just shows how very difficult this whole area
is.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000127"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Maddock" PimsId="1636" UID="13072528000288" xid="1335" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000288">Baroness

such as the wood processing and wood panel sectors. Indeed, it is a
stated aim of the Government’s bioenergy strategy that support
for bioenergy, including support for power generation from woody
biomass, should consider the consequences of policy interventions on
the wider energy system and economy, including non-energy industries.
It is the Government’s view that where this and the other aims
listed in the bioenergy strategy are met, bioenergy can make a
significant contribution to meeting our renewable energy, energy
security and emissions reduction needs at low cost. Bioenergy also has
the benefit of being dispatchable, so can operate when

will procure and use over the next five years. We require this

come from imports from countries such as the United States—to
which my noble friend Lord Deben referred—which have larger
forestry industries and whose companies are able to give power
companies the long-term fuel contracts they need. Given the analysis

not like a plant’s proposed fuel strategy. Establishing the

Second Reading and in Committee about my concern that we are
potentially entering into a great politicisation of energy policy with
this Bill. We are, for good reason, proposing to move towards a much
more administratively complex and centrally controlled system for
allocating funds to low-carbon projects. There are reasons for that and
we support the broad principle., However, the Government have been
quite clear that this is a temporary transitional arrangement and
supporting documents have referred to the fact that this will
ultimately transition to a competitive system where, through technology
and blind auctions, CFDs will be allocated in an administrative way
with far less central
control<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T15:48:46"></hs_TimeCode>. Given
that that is where we are trying to get to, I am concerned that we
should not unnecessarily constrain this transitional period by a system

deletion of subsection (4) would remove the power to make targets for
the means by which electricity is to be generated—that means the
type of electricity generation—and remove the risk of the scale
of generating capacity being unduly split up.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> definition
of “eligible generators” will be set by order. I think
that 0that is correct. I do not see why you would want to have specific

this is potentially the most worrying aspect—the Secretary of
State may wish to make targets by geographical location. I am not
saying that 
<?notus-xml column=567?>this is what would happen, but it is obvious that that holds the
potential for a huge degree of politicisation of energy. If a
Government are strong or weak in a particular region and wish to direct
generating capacity into that area, for whatever reason,
this would enable that to happen. We do not want to go back to the bad
old days, whereby, to win a seat, you might want to boost a few jobs
and put a power station there. That seems to be retrogressive. You
could also lose your seat by doing that, it is true to say. It works
both ways. However, I should be interested to hear the rationale from
the Minister as to why geographic targets would be necessary. I am also
nervous about undue micromanagement in terms of targets, sub-targets
and sub-targets of sub-targets. We have had some experience of that
already, with both the RHI and the FIT schemes having very targeted
small allocations of pots of money to be spent on different types and
scales of technology. Everyone with whom I speak in the industry is
heartily sick of that, partly because it is almost inevitable that
those targets will be wrong. The market finds the solutions according
to its internal logic, and it is very difficult for civil servants to
guess at
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000146" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000146">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T15:51:35"></hs_TimeCode>
am very nervous about the sub-division of the levy control framework
into small, tight pockets of money where, if it is anything like the
RHI and the FIT schemes, digressions will be introduced. If a certain
type or scale of technology delivers, those digressions will hit and
the market can be pulled away quite rapidly. We are seeing that with
the solar feed-in tariffs at the moment. There is a great fear that, if
the mid-size solar projects took off, they would immediately hit a
digression and the market would disappear. Therefore, there is a very
good reason to be nervous about micromanagement in this
context<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T15:51:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000147" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000147">Nor
do I think that this measure can work in practice. The levy control
framework is a seemingly fixed amount of money, but the
levels of spend that will come through the CFD is not fixed, so you
cannot estimate how much money will go to different projects until you
know the difference between the reference price and the strike price,
and that will come only with
time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T15:52:23"></hs_TimeCode>. I am
nervous about the levy control framework anyway, but I am
even more nervous of one that is divided and sub-divided down into ever
smaller pockets, because that will create a great deal of uncertainty
in the market and has the potential to disadvantage rather than reward
winners. Let us be honest—we want the market to
uncover the most successful projects—the ones with the best
chance of delivery. If, every time a sector or sub-division
shows that it is being successful, it has its funding taken away or
cut, that is not really a way to build an industry. That is
why we have tabled the amendment. I admit that it is a probing
amendment but this is a serious issue in relation to how CFDs
will operate. I look forward to hearing the

infrastructure supporting the delivery of a particular technology. The
Government may wish to set geographic targets for a number of reasons.
For example, we are considering whether renewables trading may be used
to help to achieve our renewable and decarbonisation objectives, and
setting geographical targets may support
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000152" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000152">It is

clarity and transparency, providing market participants and investors

about the need for the targets. Will they be legally enshrined in
secondary legislation? If so, that seems slightly too restrictive.
Perhaps people in the industry at the moment are reassured, but in a
year or two, when parts of the levy control framework have already been
used up and certain subsectors are feeling that their targets are too
low, that sentiment could quickly change. I am just thinking of the
bids that we have already had for the investment contracts. We already
have a number of biomass conversions and a large number of offshore and
onshore wind projects. What happens if more projects come later down

up?</hs_para>

that it is only a power that is being taken and that the Government may
not necessarily use it, but I urge against too much micromanagement and
too much setting of targets in secondary legislation. We may come to
regret that; it may well push up the cost to consumers. The noble
Baroness has spoken eloquently in favour of keeping costs low. The
market will seek out the least-cost solution. I would be wary of too
much intervention or of trying, as the noble Baroness mentioned, to
support a particular supply chain or a particular technology. The more
this comes naturally from the market, the more sustainable it will be.

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, we have jumped to the transitional
arrangements for the move from ROCs to CFD. This is an incredibly
complex clause about how that will happen. I have refrained from trying
to alter the main parts of the clause because a lot of work has
obviously been put into it. Effectively, those who have ROCs will at
some point have them exchanged for fixed-price contracts, which may run
until 2027. At that point, they will have to be sold back to the
purchasing authority, which, in principle I suppose, is Ofgem, but
could be the counterparty or the Secretary of State. Alternatively,
they could be sold in the market and then sold back to the system. ROCs
or their like-for-like replacements will be around for some time, but
only those that apply to existing projects.</hs_para>

discussing the dynamics of much of the renewables industry and how we
have achieved growth rates and advancements; we were all complimentary
about the dynamism of the sector. It is also true in many cases that
the dynamism of the planning system, and of getting the supply chain
and sometimes investors in place is not quite as nimble as that of the
entrepreneurial skill being shown in the renewables sector itself. In
the pipeline, therefore, are lots of projects whose economics and
financing started by being based on the expectation for ROCs and whose
investors have invested on the expectation of a ROCs system applying to
them.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13072528000159" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000159">At some
point, the Government have indicated that no new ROCs-based projects
will operate beyond 2017. That, however, does not appear to be
reflected in the legislation, as far as I can see—certainly not
in the rather lengthy Clause 46. However, some projects whose
calculations and return on investment will have been based on ROCs
provisions will come on stream between now and 2017.</hs_para>

to put into legislation the fact that there will be three years of
overlap, with a ROCs system running in parallel with the new CFD
system—or probably the investment contracts system and then the
CFD system. I know that there is a horror in DECC about running
different subsidy systems in parallel. I have never quite understood
why the department has such an absolute objection to that, as some
schemes are more appropriate under, say, feed-in tariffs than they are
under ROCs and some will be more appropriate under the new
regime.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13072528000161" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000161">The
amendment simply attempts to say that there will have to be a period
when projects that have been in the pipeline for some time on the basis
of ROCs are still allowed to start on ROCs and to get into the system.
That is all the amendment suggests and I think that it reflects what
the Government have, in one sense, already said—that when the
Bill comes into effect some time next year, there will be a three-year
overlap period. However, we would like to see that in 
<?notus-xml column=573?>legislation. Some of these projects are now causing anxiety and
hesitation because people do not know what will happen, and some
investors are getting nervous and projects are being stalled as a
result. Therefore, we would like to see that written in and we would
like confirmation that that is indeed the Government’s
intention. I beg to

require the transition period, when new renewable generators will have
a choice of scheme between the renewables obligation and the CFD, to
last for a minimum of three years. Our long-standing intention is that
the RO will be closed to new generation from 31 March 2017 and that the
new support mechanism, CFDs, will be introduced next year. This will
deliver the new mechanism well in advance of the closure date of the RO
and provide a suitable transition period when investors can choose
between either mechanism.</hs_para>

providing this transition period and the choice between support schemes
is to promote investor confidence and certainty, and to ensure that
there is a smooth shift from the renewables obligation to contracts for
difference. The amendment would require the RO to be kept open beyond
the intended closure date of 31 March 2017. The design of the RO is
based on the setting of an annual obligation, which determines RO
expenditure for each financial year. This means that closing the RO at
a random or uncertain point during a financial year is inadvisable. A
minimum transition period, such as the noble Lord proposes, would in
practice be likely to mean keeping the RO open to new entrants until 31
March
2018.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000165" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000165">Such an
extension would increase costs to consumers. More generators would be
able to make use of the less efficient support that the RO provides for
an additional year, rather than seek support under CFDs. This would
undermine the overall transition to EMR and could have an impact on the
UK’s ability to meet our 2020 renewables target. Because the RO
is a less efficient mechanism than CFDs, we would be able to afford
less new renewable capacity in total, which I know is not the outcome
that the noble Lord
intends.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000166" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000166">In
addition, investors accredited after 31 March 2017 would get less than
20 years’ support, as the RO final end date is 31 March 2037.
Keeping the RO open after 31 March 2017 would mean that we would need
to hold a further review of RO support levels for the period beyond
that date. That would also have an impact on investor certainty, as it
would take time before they knew what the RO support levels were after
31 March
2017.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000167" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000167">However,
I appreciate that the closure of the RO to new generation has been of
concern to some investors. The Government have listened to those
concerns and, as part of the RO transition consultation launched on 17
July, we confirmed that we will offer grace periods for those
generators aiming to accredit under the RO before the closure date.
Generators eligible for grace periods will be able to get RO support
even if they do 
<?notus-xml column=574?>not commission before 31 March 2017. We are consulting on the length of
grace periods and on the eligibility criteria. The principles proposed
in the consultation are that the eligibility criteria must be
straightforward to prove and assess, and must be consistent with the
intention to transition to CFDs. That will ensure that grace periods
are available as needed to ensure investor confidence but do not
involve an outright extension of the RO. To help investors we announced
CFD strike prices ahead of schedule and published the draft delivery
plan for consultation last
week.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000168" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000168">We
remain committed to implementing EMR next year and providing a suitable
transition period—currently over two and a half years. There has
been six years’ advance sight of the timing of the RO closure to
new generation. We are consulting on grace periods to address any

minimum term for the transition period within the Bill might have
adverse effects that greatly damage investor confidence. I have

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness for that
reply. It gives me some comfort but there are a number of uncertainties
on both sides here in the sense that those behind some of these schemes
thought that they would be commissioned at an earlier date than they
will be, so their calculations are based on that earlier date. The
Minister is clearly right to say that we had six years’ sight of
ROCs ending but we have not had six years’ sight of what will
replace them. Therefore, decisions were made on the ROCs system or
something very like it operating until that point. I would not like to
see a delay because of a planning appeal, or some other reason why the
commissioning date slips, which might have a detrimental effect on some
very good schemes in the pipeline that we would wish to
encourage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000170" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000170">I
am heartened by the noble Baroness’s reference to grace periods.
I will look at the consultation document more carefully. Although I
knew it was issued last week or the week before, I was not clear that
it would affect this so directly. That would give some comfort. I
hesitate to mention it, but there is a possibility on the other side,
namely that the introduction of CFDs, or the clarity of what the choice
might be between ROCs and CFDs, might be delayed. An issue I have not
mentioned since Second Reading must still slightly worry the
Government: we have not cleared any of this through state aid. Were
there to be a delay on that, a lot of the dates would have to slip
whatever was written in legislation. While I was mainly concerned about
delays in projects based on ROCs, there is the possibility of delay on
the government side, which none of us want to see. That would also have
consequences for the way we deal with those projects in the

matter follows on from the discussion we have just had involving the
noble Lord, Lord Whitty, who raised important issues to do with the
transition from the renewables obligation to contracts for difference.
It is not an understatement to say that there is huge concern in
certain sections of the renewables industry about this issue. Those
sections of the renewables industry are important as they will be
relied on to deliver the very major increase in renewables
generation that the Government are hoping to see by 2020, given the
£110 billion of new investment and the huge increase in
renewables capacity. For example, the latest renewables statistics talk
about offshore renewables generation rising from 3 gigawatts today to
18 gigawatts in 2020. That is 15 gigawatts more in a difficult offshore
environment. Taking early final investment decisions will be crucial to
the construction and commissioning of that generation. The onshore
figure of 6 gigawatts today, which is double that of offshore, rises to
13 gigawatts by 2020, which, again, is a very major
increase<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T16:16:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000175" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000175">One
of the purposes of tabling these amendments is to help the Government
to deliver their policy in this area given that they are clear that
they want to deliver this increase in generation and want to provide
certainty. Indeed, they have made helpful and supportive statements on
these issues. Timing is very important here as regards secondary
legislation. It was encouraging to hear the Minister talk about the
consultation document that has just been published. However, that
consultation will take time and then further time will be taken in
making decisions. It is intended that these decisions will be
implemented not through primary legislation but through secondary
legislation. Because of that, and the uncertainty over the state aid
issue, it will take some significant and powerful signals from the
Government to ensure that the final investment decisions which are so
crucial to achieving these targets are kept on track. That is the
background to the matter. We must ensure that this transition from the
renewables obligation to contracts for difference is as smooth as
possible. I think many of us here would rather that it had all happened
two, three or even more years ago so that it did not happen at exactly
the same time as this huge growth in offshore renewables. However, we
must make the best of the situation and do everything in our power to
achieve these
targets<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T16:18:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000176" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000176">For
projects accredited under the outgoing renewables obligation, there is
uncertainty as to what will happen after 2027, when Ofgem will stop
issuing ROCs. The 
<?notus-xml column=576?>Government have said that projects will see a “grandfathered
transition” to a fixed price regime through to 2037, when all
ROCs will finish. However, it is uncertain from the Bill whether all
projects will be eligible for the new fixed price instrument, and
whether the value will be equivalent to standard ROC payments. This
leaves uncertainty regarding the value of existing RO projects and
threatens the investment decisions being made presently. It is critical
to the investors to whom I have referred, who are making decisions now
or soon, that the policy intention to provide grandfathering is
reflected in the Bill rather than in secondary legislation. It would be
interesting to hear the Minister’s views on this point, but it
may be as long as two years before there is clarity and certainty if
the secondary legislation route is
adopted.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072528000177" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000177">My
amendments to Clause 46 therefore aim to create the certainty required
in regard to the entitlement and the value of certificates. My first

of State is guided by the principle of equivalence between the regimes,

<?notus-xml column=577?>served us relatively well as we make the move into an unknown

this context, it is imperative that we do not breach the trust of the
industry and the investors who put their money into projects by
misinterpreting the term “grandfathering”, which is a
clearly understood phrase. It means that if you invest in good faith,
there will not be regulatory interventions to change the fundamental
tenets of that investment. Unfortunately, the provisions in this
section stretch the definition of grandfathering to breaking
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T16:23:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Amendment 55AL. As has been eloquently expressed, the words in the
subsection will certainly strike terror into the hearts of investors.
They are far too broad and enable changes to the fundamental facts on
which an investment was based. It will damage investor confidence not
only in relation to that one narrow aspect but more globally. We are
asking many investors, entrepreneurial companies and the existing
market players to work with this new system. I think that it can work,
but if we start<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T16:25:00"></hs_TimeCode>
on the basis of regulatory uncertainty and not recognising and
respecting grandfathering, we will start off on a very poor foot
indeed. I think that I am right to say, although it may not have been
directly in this context, that I have heard arguments played back by
Ministers that have said that we cannot introduce emissions performance
standards on to existing coal plant, because that would damage investor
confidence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T16:24:49"></hs_TimeCode>. It
would mean that people saw us as an unreliable place to invest. This
aspect is actually far riskier than that, and I hope that the Minister
can give us words of encouragement in relation to these two amendments,

46 already mirrors much of the primary legislation for the RO to ensure
that we are able to replicate the effect of the RO, so far as is
appropriate. The differences from the RO are a result of the different
ways in which the schemes operate; for example, the fact that the price
of certificates will be fixed means that this will no longer be a
market-based scheme. Amendment 55AL removes the provisions for both
regular and ad hoc reviews of support levels under the fixed-price
certificate scheme. The Government do not 
<?notus-xml column=578?>expect to make regular support-level changes under the fixed-price
certificate scheme. However, I hope that noble Lords would accept that
the Government must be able to respond to significant unexpected
changes, such as major cost reductions or increases within a particular

the discretion to change must be about new schemes or future
projects—for example, changes to the feed-in tariff related to
new schemes; changes to the renewables obligation going from
one ROC to 0.9 ROC were about new projects that would be
commissioned after a particular date. Just to be clear, we are talking
here about projects that will have been

clarification that I would like to receive in terms of why this
discretion is necessary. If I do not get that changed, I will continue
to make the analogy with Spain, which was where the panic was

renewables but, by the way, this project that you invested in last
year, where you committed funding and had bank commitments in place, is
now going to be subject to a change in government support”, that
is very bad news. If that were a possibility in terms of the
grandfathering rights, they would not be grandfathering rights at all.

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, this is probably the most
straightforward amendment that I have ever produced; however, it has
vast repercussions for the whole Bill. For those noble Lords who have
not read it, it seeks to replace “a” with
“the”, in reference to the counterparty, certainly in the
section that deals with
CFDs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T16:33:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

to this at various points in our proceedings; we have not really smoked
out from the Government how they see the counterparty operating and
what sort of counterparty they have in mind. They have said
that there will be a single counterparty private organisation backed by
the Government. That is not what is stated in the legislation. The
amendment would be a bit late in the sense that there is still
provision in Clauses 8 and 9 for the Secretary of State
contemporaneously to designate more than one counterparty.
I understand the Government’s position in relation to
CFDs—there is a separate provision that we will consider on
Monday in relation to investment contracts—to be that at any
given time only one counterparty should be designated by the Secretary
of State.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13072528000195" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000195">It
is hoped that that counterparty would last some considerable time and
that even redesignation, or taking designation away, would be rare, but
you need those reserve powers. However, you do not need the reserve
powers to have more than one counterparty running at the same time.
Indeed, I never quite understood why anybody thought that that would be
sensible. The structure is difficult enough already. There is a
regulator, a counterparty and a systems operator, and then there is the
Secretary of State and all the regulations that are directly down to
the department. To crowd it out with several counterparties engaged in
different contractual 
<?notus-xml column=580?>relationships, probably with the same company, always seemed to me
fairly daft. Therefore, I hope that before we finish with the Bill the
Government themselves will delete those provisions that allow more than
one counterparty to be
designated<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-25T16:35:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

constant reference to counterparties all through this clause and the
reference is always to “a counterparty”, that keeps open
the possibility of there being more than one. If we said “the
counterparty”, I would be much happier, although it would
require quite a lot of reprinting of the Bill. I started to try to
change it in several different places but I gave up at three
o’clock in the morning, so I have tried it out in two places

point behind this. Clarity and simplicity is needed here. It occurred
to me earlier that there could be a very specific reason for this
wording, in that there would need to be a separate counterparty in
Northern Ireland. There will be a separate counterparty for investment
contracts but, as I said, that is dealt with in the next section.
However, if there were a general expectation that the possibility of
having more than one counterparty in this field at any given time was
what the Government wanted to keep open, I would be very alarmed, and I
do not think that I would be alone in

these amendments and I hope that I shall be able to allay his concerns.
I am aware that the ability to have more than one counterparty
previously caused concern in the other place. The ability to have more
than one counterparty is only to facilitate a transfer from one
counterparty to another in the unlikely event that this is necessary.
We sought to provide reassurance on this with amendments at Report in

today.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13072528000200" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130725-gc0001.htm#13072528000200">There
can be only one counterparty to a CFD contract. A generator will always
know who is on the other end of its contract. Under this Bill, there
cannot be a return to the original multiparty model that raised
significant concerns among the industry and in the Energy and Climate
Change Select Committee in pre-legislative scrutiny. The CFD
counterparty was introduced specifically to address those

unlikely event that the CFD counterparty fails or withdraws its
consent, we must ensure a smooth transition from one counterparty to
another to make sure that generators can continue to get paid under
their contracts and that the contracts can continue to be allocated. To
meet any concerns that the policy intention here is unclear, the Bill
was amended in the other place so that the ability to designate more
than one counterparty can be used only where it is necessary, broadly
speaking, for the purposes of ensuring that payments continue to flow
or that contracts continue to be allocated. These limited circumstances
are set out in Clause 7(5).</hs_para>

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for that
explanation. I had sidelined Clause 7—I think I referred to
Clause 8 just now, but it is Clause 7. That does not seem sufficiently
to cover the case of a counterparty body having failed but still having
obligations and commitments which need to continue. There are many
situations in administration where a designation ceases and is given to
somebody else. It is a fairly narrow requirement to say that the
counterparty, or whatever body is involved, shall continue to meet all
its obligations. There will be a contractual obligation 
<?notus-xml column=582?>for it to do so anyway. I ask the Government to look again at whether
Clause 7(5) is indeed tight enough to avoid the implication that there
might be more than one

help tackle the deficit left by the last Administration, in the recent
Spending Round, the Coalition Government set out a saving of 2.3 per
cent for 2015-16 in overall local government spending, including
funding from central government, business rates and council tax income.
This change is balanced with a progressive package of measures which
create a real opportunity to transform local services and help deliver
better outcomes for less. The package includes:</hs_para>
<hs_WAIndent>• A £3.8 billion pool of
funding for integrated health and social care. This will help to ensure
that service levels in the care and support system can be protected and
to enable you to invest in prevention and early
intervention;</hs_WAIndent><hs_WAIndent>• A
new fund of £330 million for transforming services. This will
comprise a £200 million extension of the Troubled Families
programme to support another 400,000 families, £100 million to
enable efficiencies in service delivery, and a £30 million
revenue fund plus a £45 million capital fund to drive
transformational change in the Fire and Rescue Service;</hs_WAIndent>
<hs_WAIndent>• A joint programme with the
Department for Education on reviewing pressures in children’s
services;</hs_WAIndent><hs_WAIndent>•
Flexibility to use capital receipts from asset sales to fund one-off
revenue costs of reforming services;
and</hs_WAIndent><hs_WAIndent>• Support for
two further council tax freezes in 2014-15 and 2015-16, to complement
the existing three year freeze which has help cut council tax in real
terms by almost 10 per

scheme for local authorities in England, which gives councils, for the

growth whilst ensuring that they have adequate resources to provide

proportion of locally collected business rates to help fund the
services they provide, we have created a direct link between business
rates collected and local authority income, reducing local authorities'

redistribute surplus food. We do however recognise the good work of
organisations that redistribute surplus food to provide access to
nutritional meals for those who may otherwise struggle. In addition,
most major retailers already have partnerships with redistribution
charities. In 2012, Defra held a meeting with retailers and food
distribution charities to explore the current barriers to
redistribution. The Waste and Resources Action Programme is working
with Fareshare and FoodCycle to deliver a trial to increase food

£1.6 billion each year. This estimate was of the

have the details of the costs to local authorities over the last five

along with estimated costs for the Legal Aid Agency (LAA) up to
2010-11. The costs for HMCTS are gross and do not take into account
fees received by them. The costs for the LAA are net of
