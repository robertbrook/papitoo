food banks by major retailers is driven down by the Courtauld
agreement, whereby retailers have very few food surpluses, the
signposting by job centres to food banks will not be a way of providing
food to those in emergency need? Will he ensure that his department
monitors the referral and re-referral of signposting, so that by the

food banks are absolutely not part of our welfare system, in which we
have other means of supporting people. There is local provision, and
following the devolution of part of the Social Fund to local
authorities, local authorities are now responsible for setting up local
welfare provision. To the extent that they are interested in using
third-sector groups, including food banks, that is entirely up to

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, April this year saw the
demise of the discretionary Social Fund and the passing of
responsibilities to local authorities. We know that funding for local
authorities was not ring-fenced and we learnt last week of a further
10% cut in their budgets. Does the Minister not accept that this, taken
together with harsher benefit sanctions regimes and a longer wait for
benefits, will mean that the use of food banks will only increase?
Despite what he said, is it not a fact that under this Government food
banks are looking to be a permanent part of the welfare provision of
this
country<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T14:39:37"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

whether the use of food banks is supply led or demand

provision of food-bank support has grown from provision to 70,000

O'Cathain:</Member></B> My Lords, does my noble friend agree that there
is a lot of mythology about food banks? This movement was started by
the Christian churches—people reaching out to people who are not
necessarily long-term unemployed but who have found themselves in a
position through no fault of their own. There are abused women who have
been given local flats by housing associations but who still do not
have money until their benefits come through, and this is where groups
of people, operating through the churches —it started in
Salisbury—can do so much good. One of the benefits of
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T14:41:01"></hs_TimeCode> for people
like me is to make sure that we do something for our fellow men. Can my

connections. The Trussell Trust has said that one reason why people
have come to it is benefit delays. I checked through the figures and in
the period of that increase the number of delays that we had had
reduced. It went up by four percentage points over the past three
years, and our delays now stand at 90%. It is difficult to know which

and the evidence is already coming in. Is it not true that, in many
cases, the discretionary housing payments available for people with
special needs, especially disabled people who need an extra bedroom,
are being provided by local authorities on a short-term, temporary
basis, and therefore that these people will still be trapped with rents
that they cannot afford in the longer term? Is it not also the case
that many councils and housing associations are already reporting that,
in order to relocate and rehouse people who wish to move to smaller
accommodation, the demand, compared with the supply, is such that it
will take several years, and these people, too, will be trapped with
higher rents than they can
afford?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0001.htm#13070283000038"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T14:54:32"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Freud" PimsId="5439" UID="13070283000395" xid="2007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0001.htm#13070283000395">Lord

people to move when there would be a high cost of adapting a new

Government will make £490-odd million of savings from the
bedroom tax on the assumption that most tenants will stay put and take
the hit. That is where the saving is coming from. However, all the
evidence from housing associations, including my own, and local
authorities shows that something like 30% of tenants will move, largely
into the private rented sector, where rents, and therefore housing
benefit, will be higher. Does the Minister accept that to send 660,000
families into misery for the sake of something like £50 million
of net savings in the public sector is not only cruel but profoundly

annual savings is about £500 million a year. As to the
circumstances in which people move into the private sector, clearly it
is more expensive generally in the private sector than in
the social sector. However, one has to look at the whole of the
transaction. Such a move will free up a large apartment or home in the
social sector, which will then be made available for a large family on
the waiting list. There are 1.8 million families on the waiting list, a

look very carefully at particular homes to make sure that they are in

must make the point that the turnover of people in the private sector
is enormous by comparison to the very low turnover in social housing.

go into Egypt after the revolution. The Foreign Secretary has visited,
as has the Minister with responsibility. We are incredibly engaged in
the process, as is our ambassador. I think that the noble Lord will
also agree that it is important that we are not seen to be deeply
involved in telling the Egyptian people how they need to resolve this

in turn. On security, four years ago three-quarters of the most serious
terrorist plots against the UK had links to Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Today it is less than half. British and international forces have
stopped Afghanistan acting as a safe haven for al-Qaeda, and Afghan
forces are now taking the lead on security right across the country. At
the weekend I went to Camp Bastion, Lashkar Gah and the forward
operating base at Durai. The British forces I met are absolutely clear
about the capability, confidence and leadership of the Afghan forces,
which are already delivering 90% of their own training. All of the

different bases. We are now in 13 and by the end of the year it will be
four or five bases. By the end of next year, when Afghan forces take on
full security responsibility, there will be no British troops in any
kind of combat role at all. Beyond 2014, small numbers of British
troops will remain to help the Afghans deliver their national army

Pakistan. We discussed our trade, economic and cultural ties. We also
agreed to work together in countering extremism and radicalisation,
investing in education, tackling poverty and dealing with all the
issues that can fuel terrorism. Building on the trilateral process that
I have been leading between the UK, Afghanistan and Pakistan, I
welcomed the Prime Minister’s commitment to working with
Afghanistan in defeating terrorism across the
region.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0001.htm#13070283000068">Let me
turn to last week’s European Council. This was rightly focused
on sorting out Europe's economy by doing what we are doing in Britain:
getting a grip of spending and supporting private enterprise to create
jobs and growth. On spending, the Council finalised with the European
Parliament the seven-year budget deal that we successfully negotiated
in February. It agreed new flexibilities between different years and
between different budget headings but, crucially, the deal delivers for
the first time a real-terms cut on the credit card limit for EU
spending for the next seven years. There was no change to the agreed
deal, which set spending at €908.4 billion across the next seven
years. That compares with €943 billion in the past seven
years.</hs_para>

process, there was a further attempt to unpick the British rebate. In
February, after repeated attempts to water down the rebate, we reached
a clear deal that it would remain unchanged. That was reflected in the
Council conclusions that I reported back to this House. So the
discussion that took place was not necessary and it is frustrating and
frankly unacceptable that we had to go through it all over again. The
proposal was to remove our rebate on agricultural spending in new
member states, and it would have cost the British taxpayer more than
£1.5 billion. It has now been categorically rejected. We will
continue to get the rebate in the years ahead on the same basis that
we do now. It is fair. It is right and, unlike, the previous
Government, this Government will not agree to weaken it or give any
part of it
away.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0001.htm#13070283000070">At the

supporting the private sector to create jobs and tackling the burdens
that hold back our businesses from competing in the global race. We
agreed that the European Investment Bank should increase its lending by
40%, with more finance for small and medium-sized businesses. We agreed
to do more to help young people who are not working to acquire
the skills that the private sector needs through proper educational
training, very much along the lines of Britain’s £1
billion youth contract, and we 
<?notus-xml column=1083?>agreed to scrap unnecessary EU regulation that ties up our businesses in
red tape when they should be growing and creating new jobs. To give
additional detail and urgency to the Commission’s work, we will

the need to give them hope and work. I should point out that the
catalyst for this initiative was not the centre-right Governments of
the European Union but the left, led by President Hollande. There are
26 million young people looking for work in the European Union, and 6
million unemployed young

this summit did not mark the recognition, long overdue, that the
current economic approach in the European Union is leaving millions of
young people without employment or prospects and fearing for their
future. Of course we should look at EU regulation as the Government
propose, but does the Leader of the House really believe that this is
the solution to youth unemployment, including in Britain? The European
economy is struggling and the British economy has not grown as the
Government have been promising it would since they came to office.
There are nearly 1 million young people still looking for work here in
Britain. Long-term youth unemployment is up by 158% since the
Government took office and the Government’s youth contract is
failing. It is clear that this Government can hardly argue effectively
for action in Europe on youth unemployment when they are so
transparently failing on the issue here at

made at the start of her response. On her questions about Afghanistan
and the continuing commitment of the UK beyond 2014, no decisions have
been taken beyond helping to deliver the officer training academy,
which was referred to in the Statement, and the accompanying force
protection. The existing funding commitments have already been set out.

agreed with what the noble Baroness said about the importance of
support for a proper political process. In terms of that process and
keeping the political talks on track, it was clearly the case that the
initial opening of the Doha office was done in a way that caused a
setback to those talks. Nevertheless, it is important that we should
try to continue with that process and make progress as fast as we
possibly can. We are very keen to see early meetings between the
Taliban and the US, and between the Taliban and the Afghans, on terms
that all sides can accept. I hope that will move forward. We know from
our own experience that peace processes are often long, complex and
very 
<?notus-xml column=1086?>bumpy, and this will obviously be no exception, but we have been working

progress since the Chequers regional peace summit communiqué,

February, co-operation on border relations and on military issues has

has also been some positive co-operation to resolve issues to do with
refugees, so there have been some tangible
steps.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0001.htm#13070283000089">Back at
Chequers, both the Presidents committed themselves to doing what they
could to work towards peace in Afghanistan over the next six months.
The news that the Taliban has released a statement distancing itself

it is a step—in that long, difficult road to peace. The
Afghanistan-Pakistan relationship is difficult, which is why we are
working with both sides to try to improve it, and I agree with the

they told him that he did not have a cat’s chance of pulling it
off. I think that they rather hoped that he would not pull it off, but
I am delighted that they now support that and the measures that he has
taken to try to introduce a bit more financial control into the EU

unpicking the rebate, it is the case that that was a straightforward
ambush of the Prime Minister. He had no interest whatever in the rebate

as youth unemployment is concerned, I obviously agree with the noble

and 60,000 last year, but we are not complacent about that. One hundred
thousand young people have started a work placement under the youth
contract and we know that youth unemployment fell faster last year in
the UK than it did in the USA, Germany, Canada, France and Italy. There
is a lot more to do, but there has been some progress and I agree with
the noble Baroness’s point about the importance of looking at EU
regulations. I would not argue that it will make all the difference,

want to see increases. The idea of playing it as a game 
<?notus-xml column=1088?>on a snakes and ladders board, where you have only
ladders and no snakes, is what is leading to the present budgetary
imbalances. I ask the Minister not to give a commitment other than that

budgeting, I am sure the noble Lord will accept that to have secured a
real-terms reduction in the budget for the first time ever represents a
significant achievement by my right honourable friend the Prime
Minister. As I am sure the noble Lord knows, the process of agreeing
budgets—with the flexibility between years, the different lines
and the political compromises that are inevitably essential—is a
nightmarishly complicated process. The noble Lord did not ask me to
give an undertaking, and I do not think that I or anyone else would be
able to reform this labyrinthine process, but I certainly undertake to
make sure that his comments, which I know are meant to be helpful in
making sure that there is rigour in budgeting, are taken back so that
people can consider them

there have been increased incursions by Spanish naval vessels in
British waters at Gibraltar. More recently, Spanish vessels fired on a
British sailor in those waters. It is reported by the media that the
Prime Minister raised this matter with the Spanish Prime
Minister—of course, Spain is an EU partner. Was the matter
raised with the Spanish Prime Minister, and if so what was his
response?</hs_para>

confident are Her Majesty’s Government that women in Afghanistan
will enjoy full political rights and that they will be able to take a
full part in civil society in that country? The Statement says that
130,000 children are now in school, including 30,000 girls. That
implies that 70% of school-aged girls are not in school. Will the
Minister tell us in percentage terms the figures for girls in school
and whether girls are now being allowed to go to university? This was
the case a few years ago, but the situation seems to have
deteriorated.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0001.htm#13070283000102"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Hill of Oareford" PimsId="5741" UID="13070283000427" xid="2026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0001.htm#13070283000427">Lord

to know that I do not have those percentages in my head, but I will see
what I can find out about them and I will write to her about whatever I
uncover. There has been progress in the way that she said in drawing
attention to those figures. She is right to draw attention to the
guarantees and commitments about the future and the right of women to
vote and participate in elections. All I am able to say is that I know
that we are giving as much encouragement and support as we 
<?notus-xml column=1089?>can to make sure that that process goes forward before the elections.
For those who, like her, want to make sure that that situation persists
in the future, the most powerful lever is the £4 billion of aid
that outside countries give to Afghanistan, but we would all be foolish
if we were to pretend that there was a simple thing that we could do to
guarantee it. Like her, the Government are very concerned, and I know
that the Foreign Office and DfID are doing everything they can to argue
in the way that I know the noble Baroness would expect them to
argue.</hs_para>

noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, is the voice of experience, I will

the point about reducing regulations, this was agreed, I think, in the
Council back in March. Some small progress has been made by the
Commission. However, the Prime Minister was very clear that the process
was not as fast or as extensive as he would like, which is why he made
another charge at the Council last week. I think it is worth setting up
our own task force—I probably share some of the noble
Lord’s scepticism about all sorts of task forces
everywhere—to try to come up with some ideas of our own to show
the way, looking specifically at the effect of regulations, how they
might be reduced and how that might lead to more jobs,

numbers post-2014, because they are not at all clear? The MoD must have
done this work already. How many personnel are we talking about for the
defence academy? What is this protection force that we are talking
about? It sounds a very open-ended thing to me. What sort of numbers
are we talking about and where would they be? On what date will we give
up Camp Bastion? Will we be abandoning it or handing it over to the
Afghan authorities or to the Americans? Will we provide any air assets
post the end of 2014? It is really rather important for us to get our

will be happy to circulate them. I know that the numbers envisaged are
small. The numbers on the continuing support that would be made

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Lord
Nash):</Member></B> My Lords, it is my great privilege to open the
Second Reading debate of the Children and Families Bill. When I came
into this job, I swore that I would do what I had successfully done
over the previous 30 years: keep control of my diary. I gave
that idea up at lunchtime on my first day. A visit that I had asked to
make some time ago appeared serendipitously in my diary
yesterday—I say serendipitously because it had been fixed a long
time before we knew that the Second Reading of the Bill would be today.
This visit was to the Avenue School, a special school in Reading run by
Dame Sue Bourne, and was a very moving experience. They do wonderful
work at this school with children with severe SEN, many of whom are
severely disabled. It was a privilege to see the wonderful ways in
which they are improving the lives of those
children—substantially, to judge by the smiles on many of their
faces. As I left, Sue gave me the dragonfly pin that I am wearing,
which is in memory of all the children who have been at the school and
who have died, so I said that I would wear it today. The memory of that
visit will stay with me throughout this
debate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:51:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0001.htm#13070283000123">The
Government are determined to make sure that we put the needs of
children at the heart of everything we do so that, regardless of
background, every child has the chance to fulfil their potential and
succeed. Too often we hear stories of services failing children and
families who need their help the most, trying to get them to fit in
with the system rather than the other way around. It is crucial that we
get the legislative framework right, so that services transform the way
in which they work for children and families, focused keenly on their
needs. That is what the Bill seeks to do.</hs_para>

the most thorough scrutiny and

other place, the debate has been constructive and comprehensive. Every
part of the Bill has been scrutinised thoroughly by a standing
committee and has been passed with the blessing of the whole House.
This is in part due to extensive pre-legislative scrutiny of the
majority of the Bill. This process, as I am sure noble Lords would
agree, clearly improved the legislation. I offer my gratitude to
Members in this House for their scrutiny of Parts 1 and 5 of the Bill
as part of their work on the Joint Committee on Human Rights and the
House of Lords Select Committee on Adoption Legislation. I also thank
members of the JCHR for their more recent report across the Bill, which
I am sure will inform scrutiny in your Lordships’
House.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000125" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0001.htm#13070283000125">Perhaps<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:52:58"></hs_TimeCode>
the most significant improvement that the Bill has seen to date is the
amendment brought forward by the Government to introduce a duty on
health bodies to provide what is set out in an education, 
<?notus-xml column=1093?>health and care plan. This amendment to Part 3 of the Bill was widely
welcomed and will make a real difference to the lives of children and
young people with special educational needs and their families. It is
my ambition that the scrutiny in this House builds on that progress in
an open and constructive way.</hs_para>

turn to the provisions of the Bill in more detail. Delays in the
current adoption system mean that it currently takes on average 21
months to place a child, and a child’s chances of adoption
reduce by almost 20% for every year of delay. This is clearly
indefensible and needs to change. The Government’s adoption
reforms will sweep away barriers that have stood in the way of finding
children stable, loving homes earlier. The Bill contributes to this by
requiring local authorities to consider a fostering for adoption
placement as soon as they are considering adoption for a child; by
removing the explicit requirement to have regard to a child’s
religious persuasion, racial origin and cultural and linguistic
background when matching a child and prospective adopters; and by
enabling the Secretary of State to require some or all local
authorities to outsource their adopter recruitment and assessment
function<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:54:24"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:53:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0001.htm#13070283000127">The
Bill would also better support approved adopters by piloting greater
access to the adoption register, by improving the information on offer

give adopters more choice and control over the help that they
receive.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13070283000128" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0001.htm#13070283000128">In
addition, the Bill puts the role of the virtual school head for
looked-after children on a statutory footing. This is just one
important step that we are taking to ensure that every local authority
redoubles its efforts to drive up the educational attainment of
children in their care.</hs_para>

unnecessary delays in the family courts, something that the family
justice review recognised as part of its work to consider radical
reform of the current systems for family law. A child waits
over 42 weeks on average for their care or supervision case to
be resolved. This is not acceptable and we agree with the
review’s recommendations that more needs to be done to address
delays and ensure that a stable placement for a child is found as
quickly as possible. To that end, the Bill includes measures to
introduce a maximum 26-week time limit for completing care and
supervision proceedings, to ensure that expert evidence is used in
children’s cases only when necessary and to remove bureaucracy
and focus a court’s consideration of a care plan primarily on
those issues that are essential to its
decisions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000130" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0001.htm#13070283000130">Part
2 also includes proposals to ensure that the needs of children remain
firmly at the centre of the private family law system. The Bill,
through the parental involvement clause, will make it absolutely clear
that both parents should be involved in their child’s life after
separation, where it is safe for the child. I wish to be clear that
this change does not affect the existing principle that the welfare of
the child must be the court’s paramount consideration in all
cases. In addition, we hope that mediation, information and assessment
meetings will encourage more parents to agree arrangements for their
children outside court. The 
<?notus-xml column=1094?>introduction of the child arrangements order will help ensure that
arrangements are focused on the child’s needs.</hs_para>

educational needs in Part 3 are ambitious and present us with a
once-in-a-generation opportunity to transform the lives of children and
young people with SEN. The reforms put children, young people and their
parents at the heart of the system, strive for higher aspirations for
children and young people, and have a stronger focus on improving their
prospects in life. The new system will provide, for the first time, one
system from birth to age 25 by promoting earlier identification of
needs and extending comparable rights and protections to all young
people over 16; require local authorities and local health bodies to
work together to plan and commission services for children and young
people with SEN, bringing a real commitment to working together across
agencies; and introduce a local offer so that parents can find, in one
place, clear and accessible information about the local support that is
available to
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000132" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0001.htm#13070283000132">At the
end of the new, more streamlined and co-ordinated assessment process
for those with the most complex needs, the Bill introduces education,

living, with joined-up support from education, health and social
care.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000133" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0001.htm#13070283000133">The
Government are committed to reforming childcare and supporting working
families by boosting quality, increasing the affordability of provision
and removing obstacles for providers where this does not impact on
quality and safety. Part 4 plays a part in achieving this. It
introduces childminder agencies, allows childcare providers to request
a paid-for re-inspection by Ofsted and seeks to remove current
bureaucratic requirements on local authorities and governing bodies. On
Report in the Commons, the Government also brought forward a new clause
to introduce tax-free childcare paving legislation, as was included in
Her Majesty’s gracious Speech.</hs_para>

Office of the Children’s Commissioner. It will clarify the power
and remit of the Children’s Commissioner, empowering the
commissioner to stand up for the rights and interests of all children,
particularly those who are vulnerable. For example, it will give the
commissioner a statutory remit to promote and protect children’s
rights, and will introduce changes to make the commissioner more
clearly independent from
government.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000135" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0001.htm#13070283000135">Parts
6, 7 and 8, which are led by the Department for Business, Innovation
and Skills, introduce greater choice for employees, ensuring that
employment law meets the needs and wishes of modern families. The Bill
will give working parents more choice and flexibility in how they share
leave and pay in the early months of their child’s life. This is
a radical new system of leave that will support fathers in getting more
involved in their child’s life and enable working
parents to take leave together and better manage their caring
responsibilities and work commitments. The last section of the Bill
supports family life by providing a right for all employees to request
flexible working.</hs_para>

draw noble Lords’ attention to some commitments made by my
honourable friend the Minister for Children and Families on Report in
the Commons. Most notably, with regard to adoption, we wish to clarify
that local authorities must consider placing the child with a relative

Also, to provide further reassurance on this measure, we will introduce
new safeguards through regulations to make sure that a local authority

have a Bill on aspects of children’s well-being from a Secretary
of State who so far has shown little interest in children’s
lives outside the classroom. Indeed, he has presided over the
decimation of many children’s services, all much needed by
vulnerable children. I am sure, too, that Members on this side, at
least, will be commenting on the disastrous impact on vulnerable
children and young people of the Government’s wider policies on
welfare, employment and cuts, with falling incomes and higher prices
stretching family budgets to the limit. These will cause real hardship

that, apart from two very welcome government

Minister has outlined the key measures and I will begin with those we
can broadly support. The provisions in Parts 6, 7 and 8 for shared
parental leave, time off work for antenatal appointments and flexible
working all build on the progressive record of the previous Labour
Government and we welcome these next steps. However, we would like to
widen access to leave for parents—especially, as the Minister
himself said, for fathers—because these measures may turn out to
be highly restrictive, with only 2% of eligible fathers expected to be
able take up the new changes. Coupled with recent data from the TUC
which show that less than 1% of fathers have taken up the additional
paternity leave that was established in 2011, we clearly need something

role of the Children’s Commissioner, also established by the
Labour Government, and we welcome these proposals, too. However, the
existing functions of the Children’s Rights Director, which are
to be incorporated into the commissioner’s remit, include the
power to take up individual complaints from children, and we want to

problem in principle with the proposals in Part 4 for new childminder
agencies, they will need careful examination. There are two obvious
concerns here. First, childminders in agencies will no longer be
inspected directly at all by Ofsted. Instead, the agency will be
inspected on its quality assurance processes. We know what happened in
Haringey when Ofsted undertook these arm’s-length desktop
inspections —it gave Haringey a satisfactory rating shortly

the Childcare Minister said in a meeting last week that the agencies
would be responsible for the training and development of their
childminders but that there would be no new money. She envisaged that
the cost would be passed to parents, but we know that the high cost of
childcare is currently very difficult for parents to meet. Also, while
the vexed issue of childcare ratios is not in the Bill, we will want
to ensure that in future no Government can attempt to change
these important ratios without recourse to Parliament. We also believe
that local authorities have an essential economic, as well as social,
role in assessing the sufficiency of childcare in their areas, and we
do not want to see this repealed as the Government
propose.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000147" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0001.htm#13070283000147">We
welcome measures in Part 2 of the Bill to improve and streamline family
justice. However, while we very strongly support the continued

dilute  this paramountcy principle. We will want to probe the

come now to the parts of the Bill about which we have more substantial
concerns. Part 1 builds on the reforms introduced by the Labour
Government to improve the adoption system. It is unacceptable that on
average it still takes almost two years for a child in the care system
to be placed for adoption. We agree that that has to change and we
welcome attempts to reduce unnecessary delay in adoptions. However, the
best interests of the child must come above all other considerations.
We are concerned that the Minister in the other place envisages that a
child can be placed in a new fostering for adoption placement as soon
as he or she enters care. That seems possibly counter to careful
assessment and good-quality
decision-making.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000150" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0001.htm#13070283000150">We
also feel that the Government are not right to imply that adoption is
the only, or possibly always the best, solution for every child. Many
children are not adopted and there is little in the Bill to improve
outcomes for them. Fostering gets very little mention, and there is
disappointingly little on improving the lot of children in the care
system, although we welcome putting virtual school heads on a statutory
basis. The majority of children return home, often with no continuing
support, and we would like to raise that during the passage of the
Bill.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13070283000151" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0001.htm#13070283000151">We
would also like to see more emphasis on the importance of contact
between adopted children and their birth families. I very much welcome

to consider the possibility of kinship care as the first option in
every case and give priority to contact between sisters and brothers.

come to the reform of the special educational needs system in Part 3
with the establishment of integrated health and care assessments and
plans and the publication of a local offer of services in every area.
The aspirations of the Green Paper to improve the system across the
board for all disabled children were widely commended. However, we fear
that the Bill as drafted cannot hope to meet those aspirations. This is
also the conclusion of the Special Education Consortium, the Every
Disabled Child Matters alliance and, indeed, all the children’s
organisations with which we have had contact.</hs_para>

will outline why we share this conclusion. First, the measures in the
Bill do not apply to all disabled children. Those who do not have a
special educational need or who are detained in youth custody will be
excluded. I would be very interested to discuss with 
<?notus-xml column=1098?>the Minister his reference to some new ideas for how those in youth
custody might be embraced by these or similar provisions. However, how
can the exclusion of children with disabilities can be justified?
Children with a major physical disability—for example, a visual
impairment or a complex health problem such as cancer or
diabetes—have just as much need for services integrated across
education, health and social care as children with special educational
needs. The barriers to their educational progress can be just as
serious.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0001.htm#13070283000155">Secondly,
while the education, health and care plans assessment will be a step
forward, albeit for a minority of children, and we welcome the
Government’s change of heart in making health as well as
education enforceable in the plans, there clearly needs to be a
parallel duty on the third element in those plans, the local authority
social care services, so we will want to raise that
again.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000156" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0001.htm#13070283000156">The
rights of children and parents to request an assessment is a positive
change, as is the continuation of plans through further education and
apprenticeships. However, parents need a single route of appeal on all
three elements of the plan. As the plan is drafted, parents may have to
go down three separate appeal routes simultaneously, and clearly that
is not acceptable. The draft code of practice makes clear that this new
system, welcome as it may be, will apply to only a tiny minority even
of the population of children with special educational needs, compared
with the 13% of SEN children statemented currently. Other SEN children
—some 1.4 million—together with all those disabled and
seriously ill children who do not have special educational needs will
have to depend on the local offer to get support. For these children
and their families, there will be no practitioner to forge the
integration of health, education and care, despite the fact that many
will need this. Parents will have to do it themselves, and yet this is
one of the major problems with the current system that the Green Paper
promised to address. The local offer gives no guarantee of services,
only a list of what might be available and which is not enforceable.
The Government do not want to specify what should be in a local offer,
so parents face the same postcode lottery as they do
now<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:13:02"></hs_TimeCode>. Those are
the headline issues. There are others, particularly the abolition of
school action and school action plus, without any clarity as to what
will replace them. This is a major change because it will erode many
current entitlements for the majority of children who will not be
eligible for an education, health and care

families and, above all, our children. For the first time in a
generation the Government are tackling some of the major barriers that
children and families face. We on these Benches are fully committed to
giving disadvantaged children the best possible start in life. Reforms
to special educational needs provision will help families to secure
access to the support they deserve, new virtual heads will support the
educational achievements of looked-after children and the proposals for
shared parental leave and flexible working are a real step forward. The

learning difficulty assessments, but, regretfully, they do not
currently apply to young people in custody. We know that a third of
young offenders have a SEN statement, compared to only 3% of the
general population. Young offenders are among the most vulnerable
members of our society and need all the support that we can offer them.
Given that children in custody are particularly disadvantaged in this
respect, it is illogical that they are being left out. I suggest that
we extend the new plans to young offenders, otherwise we will miss a
unique

learnt on Report in another place that, although the Government are
committed to supporting young offenders in this way, the stumbling
block to providing such support is conflict with the Apprenticeships,

opportunity to make provision for young offenders with SEN. I hope that

child’s health condition does not stop at the school gates.
Parents need to know that schools are places of learning that can cater
for the needs of all young people; places where children with health
conditions are both understood and cared for. Whether a child is
diabetic, epileptic or severely allergic to something, schools must be
able to support their needs. Take the example of a child with, say, a
nut allergy. Unless appropriate care is taken, the child is at risk of
a life-threatening anaphylactic reaction. Simple approaches can be
taken by the school—ensuring that staff are EpiPen trained;
ensuring that EpiPens are easily accessible and signposted; and
displaying photographs of children with food allergies in the school
kitchen and staffroom. Of course many or most schools do such things as
standard, but many do
not<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:18:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000166" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0001.htm#13070283000166">I
have offered one example but the same may be said of children with
diabetes, epilepsy, asthma, migraine, chronic fatigue and congenital
heart defects. Indeed, in my own city of Liverpool, a young primary lad
died of a sudden cardiac arrest. That school and family established the
Oliver King Foundation and, with the support of the local media, are
now putting facilities in every school in the
city<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:19:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000167" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0001.htm#13070283000167">A
child’s condition should have no impact on their ability to
study. Though different from SEN, if medical needs are not managed
properly they will surely impede a child’s education in much the
same way. Too many schools fail to follow guidance in this area.
Moreover, existing legislation is poorly designed for such purposes.
Considering that there are no specific requirements to provide
the necessary support for all children with health conditions, an
amendment that places a clear duty on all schools seems to me to be
eminently sensible. Indeed, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State
recently indicated that practices in schools need improving. In
Committee he said that guidance on managing medicines will be published
this year, thus clarifying schools’ responsibilities. Does the
Minister think that this is
sufficient<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:20:08"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

of young carers. Despite the good intentions in the Care Bill, there is
now a yawning gap that leaves young carers in an unjust position. Young
carers are children and young people who provide ongoing and regular
care to family members while they themselves are in education. The 2001
census identified 175,000 young carers in the UK, 13,000 of whom care
for more than 50 hours per week. The 2011 census identified a similar
number, up to 178,000. However, there was an 83% increase in the number
of young carers aged five to seven. These young carers often undertake
inappropriate and burdensome responsibilities, and all too often they
do not receive the support that they need. This of course results in
poor educational outcomes. The Bill offers significant scope to improve
the long-term life chances of young carers by enabling a whole-family
approach, but I suggest that the rights and responsibilities need to be
made clearer for young carers and practitioners alike. I know that
Ministers are sympathetic to young carers’ needs, and I
therefore look to amendments coming forward to provide this much needed
support<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:21:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000169" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0001.htm#13070283000169">As
I referred to earlier, this Bill is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to
provide children and their families with real support for special
educational needs. Education, 
<?notus-xml column=1101?>health and care plans are at the centre of that support system. For the
first time, SEN will be coupled with health and social care provision
in a single global agreement. I am pleased that the Government have
taken note in this area, and specifically that they have guaranteed
that health requirements will become part of the plan. However, should
I fear the same fate that has befallen our so-called “national
curriculum”? The plans must do what they say on the label. They
must entitle the holder to expect all the provisions that they detail:
education, health and care. Will the Minister confirm this, so that we
may give parents and young people greater confidence in the
system?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000170" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0001.htm#13070283000170">In<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
order to make the system truly joined-up, surely we should go that
extra mile and realise the equal importance of there being one easily
identifiable route of redress for families, should things go wrong. A
single, accessible and understandable point of appeal is necessary. We
must not create a system that forces families to navigate a vast and
complex complaints system across three agencies. I look forward to
hearing what the Minister intends to do in this
regard.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0001.htm#13070283000171">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:22:40"></hs_TimeCode>
was delighted to receive a Written Answer from my noble friend the
Minister, detailing how essential it is that teachers’ training
prepares them to teach children with a broad range of special
educational needs. I suggest that all teachers must be equipped with
the skills to identify and support children with special educational
needs, which should include specific learning difficulties such as
dyslexia. It really is not good enough that we have a teaching
profession that is not universally trained to understand the issues.
There should be teachers in each school or each group of schools who
are qualified to test for and identify dyslexia. Although I praise the
work of SENCOs in schools, there is an urgent need for all initial
teacher training programmes to include a mandatory module on dyslexia
and other hidden disabilities. I hope that the Minister will reflect
upon this point, and I know that my noble

be “passported” with them. Although I welcome the
extension of legal protections for young people with SEN up to the age
of 25, as currently drafted, higher education institutions are excluded
from the new framework. As I have been assured that the
Government’s intention is to create a single system which
supports the highest aspirations, surely this goes against the spirit
of the Bill? It has the potential to cause delay, and will no doubt
create unnecessary bureaucracy. I hope that the Minister will carefully
consider that the plan should follow a young person, whichever setting

followed with great interest the childcare ping-pong—or, as the
Mayor of London would no doubt call it, the
“whiff-whaff”—regarding reforms to childcare
ratios. I now presume that it is game, set and match to the Lord
President of the Council in this regard. Equally important is the need
to give careful reconsideration to the introduction of a childminder
agency system. The introduction of such an arrangement would mean that
experienced childminders could be lost. Indeed, 71% of childminders
have “outstanding” grades. They have built their own
businesses and are 
<?notus-xml column=1102?>now on a level footing with daycare centres. Currently, childminders are
inspected every three years by Ofsted, but only every four years if
they achieve “outstanding” status. However, as we have
heard, under these proposals the agencies as organisations will be
inspected while only a cross-section of their registered childminders
will be inspected. There is a danger that childminders with less
satisfactory standards will be afforded a higher status by virtue of
their membership of a highly rated agency. When a parent chooses a
registered childminder, they should be confident that the grade of the
childminder reflects their talents. Can the Minister confirm that all
childminders will be inspected by Ofsted, and not merely a
cross-section of those who work for a particular
agency?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000174" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0001.htm#13070283000174">As I
said at the outset, the Bill is progressive in its aims and potentially
life-changing for children and families in this country. By the way,
when I was talking about the Oliver King Foundation, the word I could
not bring to mind was “defibrillators”, so I was
referring to defibrillators in every school. I hope that the Minister
will reassure the House that the Government intend to revisit our areas
of concern and, in so doing, ensure that the very promising provisions

reality is that choice of education provision remains something of a

‘choose’ a special school placement do so because they
believe, or have been told by professionals, that mainstream provision
is not possible for their child. In other words, that mainstream
provision is currently structured in a way that it cannot respond to

key in making choice in education, since they have the power to place
children and young people with SEN on the roll of special schools. The
reduction of funding available to local authorities and the increasing
number of special schools being funded by the Department for Education
through the academies and free schools programme will lead to greater
numbers of disabled children and young people with SEN being placed in
special schools. A disabled child on the roll of a mainstream school is
likely to require the local authority to pay for additional SEN support
directly from the local authority’s education budget. However,
the cost to the local authority of a DfE-funded special academy school
placement is nil, as spending comes directly from the department. The
choice will therefore be driven by the need to balance the books,
rather than by duties under the Equality Act. If the Government want
real choice, there is a need to remove the local authority’s
power to name a special school against the expressed wish of a family.
This change needs to be reflected during the new education, health and
care assessment and planning process, which will replace existing
statementing.</hs_para>

Families Bill covers only the placing of children and young people with
SEN in a mainstream school or college building. It does not cover what
children and young people with SEN will learn while attending. Since
the Academies Act, increasing numbers of children and young people have
lost their entitlement to a national curriculum as academies are no
longer required to offer it. The result is that children are denied
access to a broad and balanced curriculum and are increasingly being
placed on special courses. Effectively, instead of increasing choice,
there is already a restriction of choice cascading down from
post-16.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13070283000180" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0001.htm#13070283000180">The
Learning and Skills Council report in 2008 found that disabled people
with learning disabilities were four times more likely to be enrolled
on a segregated course rather than a mainstream accredited course,
whether at college or sixth form. Since the report was published,
little has changed. The Down’s Syndrome Association has
expressed concerns that children with 
<?notus-xml column=1104?>Down’s syndrome have been placed into discrete courses for
students with learning disabilities and difficulties, without the
opportunity even to consider mainstream accredited courses. If the

include a choice of courses.</hs_para>

providing more choice, the personal budgets that will be made available
for young people with SEN and their parents is welcomed. For the first
time, children and young people with SEN will be able to use a direct
payment instead of depending on the SEN provision to be arranged by the
school, college or local authority. This will have an impact
particularly on further education, as it should mean that young people
will be able to purchase the support that they need while attending a
course of their choice. However, for students in schools or post-16
there is still a snag, because they will need consent from the
institution before they can make use of the personal budget, as
required under the Special Educational Needs (Direct Payments) (Pilot
Scheme) Order 2011. The unfortunate reality is that in today’s
financial climate it is very unlikely that colleges and schools will
provide consent for a personal budget request made by young people or
their parents, as this will mean a reduction in their own budget. If
the Government want to promote choice, then the parents and young
person requesting a personal budget should be given one, as is the case
currently with social care personal budgets. Only when young people
have a personal budget will their choice increase—a real choice
over which mainstream courses they want to
attend.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000182" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0001.htm#13070283000182">For
the Government to promote a genuine choice of educational
opportunities, they need to remove and not increase the barriers that
prevent children and young people from participating in mainstream
education. If the Minister believes in choice of education provision,
he should first consider the local authority’s power to
frustrate children, young people and parents from exercising their
choice of mainstream education provision. Secondly, the Minister should
reconsider the options for schools and colleges to refuse families and
young people with SEN the option of seeking a personal budget in lieu
of support provided by the

important changes for looked-after and adopted children. I add the
support from this Bench too for the broad ambition of the Bill to
extend a greater level of choice, participation and long-term support

want to touch briefly on three particular areas: care leavers, young
carers and children with special educational needs. First, I am
concerned that we may have missed an important opportunity during the
passage of the Bill to make a much-needed change for care leavers.
These are young people who are in need of special attention and ongoing
support as they transition into adulthood.
One<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:35:10"></hs_TimeCode> particular
category of care leavers who are seriously disadvantaged is those who
are subject to immigration control. Many of those young
people are here on their own with no parent or legal carer looking out
for them and have come here from places such as Afghanistan, Somalia,
Iran, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Eritrea to seek sanctuary.
They have often lost their loved ones. They have experienced
unimaginable violence and abuse. Some may have been recruited as child
soldiers or have been exploited in multiple ways.
However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:35:32"></hs_TimeCode>, when
they come to the United Kingdom for safety, too often they are denied
the protection they need due to the decision-making process within
government departments. They can be left in a limbo where they are not
recognised as refugees, but cannot return home because it is too
dangerous for them to do so. As they turn 18, they get caught by
immigration restrictions which put them at risk of being made homeless
and going
hungry<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:35:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000187" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0001.htm#13070283000187">A
report by the Children’s Society entitled <I>I
Don’</I><I>t Feel Human</I> was published in 2012 and
highlighted this issue by showing how young people who had come to this
country on their own as unaccompanied children were ending up destitute
and homeless. This was because they were being cut off from the local
authority support as they turned 18 due to their uncertain immigration
status<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:36:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000188" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0001.htm#13070283000188">Many
of those young people are destitute and resort to self-harming and
attempt suicide out of sheer desperation about their situation. We need
to do what we can to ensure that those vulnerable young people continue
to get the support they need as long as they are here. Would the
Minister be open to exploring making an amendment to Schedule 3 to the
Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 to ensure that it does not
apply to lone children and care
leavers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:36:47"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000189" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0001.htm#13070283000189">I
want to say a brief word about young carers. The recent census from
2011 stated that there were approximately 166,000 young carers in the
United Kingdom, but there is reason to believe that that is just the
tip of the iceberg, as many young carers remain hidden from the view of
the professionals. I know from my experience how many of them live
lives that are profoundly restricted, demanding and exhausting, bearing
responsibilities well beyond what is reasonable for their years. When
the Children's Society looked into the long-term outcomes for young
carers in its recent report, <I>Hidden from View</I>, it found no
strong evidence that young carers are more likely than their peers to
come into contact with support agencies, despite government recognition
that that needs to happen. That research also found that young carers
are 1.5 times more likely than their peers to have a special
educational need or a disability. Young carers are more likely than the
national average to be not in education, employment or training between
the ages of 16 and 19.</hs_para>

what the Children’s Minister in the other place said when he
made a clear commitment to consider how legislation might be changed so
that rights and responsibilities are clearer to young carers and
practitioners alike in this important area. I also welcome his
commitment to a “whole family” approach to the assessment
of care needs. It is therefore important and encouraging that the
Children’s Minister and the Minister for Care Services have come
together to ensure that both the adults’ legislation in the form
of the Care Bill and the children's legislation which we are discussing
today can work together to allow for whole-family
approaches<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:38:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000191" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0001.htm#13070283000191">Can
the Minister update us on when we might see any proposed changes to
legislation to support that approach? I would also welcome any update

I would like to say a word about children with special educational
needs. I welcome much that is here, but share the disappointment of the
consortium of national specialist colleges that many of the amendments
tabled in Committee in the other place proved to be unsuccessful. In
particular, can the Minister provide greater clarity on the composition
and functioning of the Section 41 list of providers that young people
will be able to request for inclusion on their education, health and
care plan? Can the Minister ensure that there is positive affirmation
in the Bill that young people will be entitled to an education, health
and care plan up to the age of 25 and ensure that local authorities
will not end these plans too
early?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000193" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0001.htm#13070283000193">On

report of the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, whom I am delighted to see
in her seat today, paved the way for wide-ranging changes in the way
that the state education system deals with children with special needs
and disabilities. It is more than 30 years since the Education
Act 1981 put in place many of the tenets of the current legislation and
the system of statements of special needs. It is some six years since
the publication of the second report of my Commission on Special Needs
in Education, which I was asked to chair by the then leader of the
Opposition, who is now the Prime Minister.</hs_para>

commission, we noted that the extraordinary advances in medicine since
the Warnock Report and the 1981 Act mean that many more children, often
with the most serious, multiple disabilities, now not only survive
birth but can find much contentment in much longer lives with the
proper attention, therapy, medication and—very
importantly—education. During 
<?notus-xml column=1107?>the commission we also heard from a large number of
dedicated professionals and devoted parents, whose work on behalf of
children with special needs is both heartening and humbling. Virtually
every submission noted, and almost every witness from whom we took
evidence believed, that radical revision of the provision for special
education needs was long overdue. It is for this reason that I welcome
the aim to create through this Bill a new legislative framework that
better reflects the different circumstances that the decades since 1981
have brought.</hs_para>

it is clear that pathfinder authorities have had to devote considerable
time and resources to developing these new processes and that while
there have been some encouraging findings from them, the pathfinders
themselves encompass only a small minority of authorities—fewer
than a quarter of those in England. As a result, even where pathfinders
are able to make progress in putting in place elements of the proposed
system, there is still a huge task ahead for these lessons to be
communicated, understood and implemented across the vast majority of
local authorities and, just as importantly, for these lessons to inform
the regulations and guidance that will follow this Bill. I do not need

to its implementation and I share the concerns of my noble friend Lady
Hughes and those of the noble Lord, Lord Lingfield. We are experiencing
severe cuts to services for families. Child poverty, by whatever
measure we use, is increasing and is likely to increase further.
Voluntary sector organisations point out risks to the Bill in relation
to the potential fragmentation of local services, which may add to the
onus placed on them, for example in relation to adoption and how the
voice of the child and advocacy for children will be regarded. It will
be important to assess these risks associated with delivery of the

in prison, or otherwise incapable. I have heard anecdotes from kinship
carers when I was 
<?notus-xml column=1109?>in a previous role concerned with drug addiction. Many carers who spoke
to me were devoted and committed grandparents; some of them had given
up work to care and in some cases their health and family life had
suffered due to their becoming a carer in a crisis. Research has shown
that children who live with kinship carers have better educational,
social and emotional outcomes than those who go into other forms of

to work with the Government on resolving this and I look forward to
hearing of any progress. Other issues of kinship care include
adjustment leave for grandparents and family carers, paid leave as
equivalent of adoption leave, and parental leave for grandparents to
support a family in emergency. We shall no doubt wish to return to such
concerns at a later

being seen to be awkward, or criticising government actions. I include
myself in that. For example, it surely cannot be right in a public

sports body because she criticised proposed policy in a welfare Bill.
This is ludicrous. It is even more ludicrous when in one such set of
appointments no women or people from ethnic minority backgrounds were
appointed to an advisory board. This is not just about individuals. It

have us think that it is. PSHE is about helping young people to develop
respect for self and others, communication skills and the
self-confidence to learn. It includes developing a positive school
ethos, and social policies such as anti-bullying, healthy eating, and
positive relationships inside and outside school. The noble Lord, Lord

Hamwee:</Member></B> My Lords, in what my noble friend Lord Storey
called a “progressive and promising Bill”, I will largely
confine myself—today, at any rate—to Part 1. I should
declare an interest because I was a board member of and legal adviser
to Parents for Children, an adoption agency, many years ago and am a
patron—one of several who are speaking today—of PAC,
which deals with pre and post-adoption
support.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000216" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0001.htm#13070283000216">Under
the invigorating chairmanship of the noble and learned Baroness, Lady
Butler-Sloss, I was a member of the Select Committee that played a sort
of legislative leapfrog with the Government as they launched proposals
into the public domain, so we undertook both pre and post-legislative
scrutiny. What most impressed me during our work was the importance of
early permanence and the increasing understanding of that and of the
importance of identity: the need to know one’s identity and the
need for parents to know and understand a child’s identity. It
became clear to the Select Committee that many current concerns are
more around practice than legislation. The logic of that should perhaps
be fewer amendments, which will be a relief to the Minister. We shall
see.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000217" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0001.htm#13070283000217">We heard
that reforms already made to tackle delay in adoption need time to bed
in, although they seem to be making a real difference. That went hand
in hand with a warning that disruption caused by wholesale changes to
the role of local authorities could significantly destabilise their
implementation. I am far from convinced that removing local authorities
from the adoption approval process is appropriate. Governments like to
talk about a light touch; what is in the Bill is potentially very
heavy-handed. Like others, I believe that joint working by local
authorities with one another and voluntary agencies should be the
focus, as well as dealing with what might seem marginal but are
obviously quite significant difficulties, such as employment law,
single Ofsted inspections and a number of other details.</hs_para>

Association of Directors of Children’s Services, which talks

suitable adopters and the benefit to be gained from local authorities
going even further in their collaborative efforts on this. I believe
that goes, in part, to pre-adoption support, which I

very uneasy that the provision in Clause 3, which gives the Secretary
of State a power of direction with regard to local authorities without

back to the beginning of the Bill and to something that several noble

clear I am about what “considering” means. It is not a
technical term. The Government’s own guidance says that the

pretty much unbounded admiration for people who foster or adopt; it is
almost beyond my imagining. I also have a lot of admiration for the
social workers involved and for the children who cope and contribute to
their own success. It was salutary to hear the point from children
during our work on the Select Committee, some of whom said,
“They don’t listen to me, because I’m a

Children and Families Bill at the weekly meeting of the Cross-Bench
Peers. I was particularly interested in Part 3 and the provisions
affecting children and young people with special educational needs and
disabilities. I asked how the local authorities who were trialling the
provisions for this group—pathfinders, as they are
known—were progressing, but no one seemed to have a clear idea
of the present position, unlike the noble Lord, Lord Lingfield, who
obviously has studied the situation. I, too, have looked into this

only partially developed a project plan while two pathfinders had only
partially agreed a clear set of objectives and partially sorted out a
project board and governance structure. Similarly, six had not fully
established commitment to share education, seven to share social care
and 14 to share health resources. The report highlights plenty of good
practice and plenty of good will, but it also highlights slow responses

the pathfinder group of local authorities was given additional
resources and support, and volunteered to make changes. However, this
current legislation is not going to provide additional resources for
the remaining 297 local authorities. It is being introduced at a time
when the authorities are restructuring their health and education
provision to meet entirely different government priorities. It is being
introduced by local authority staff, many of whom are having their
services outsourced and having to establish new consultancy and
contractual agreements across a whole raft of provision, and all of
whom are having to deal with profound levels of financial cutback. What
will their priority be? Will it be in delivering this new service, in
meeting the demands of this legislation? It is extremely likely that,
in many cases, local authorities will not consider this a priority and,
as such, numerous children and young people, their families and the
professionals with whom they work will pay a very high price.</hs_para>

It is good and bad in parts. One very good thing is that it provides us

cross-party consensus on many new issues. There are a number of parts
of the Bill that I welcome and believe will improve on our current

the Children’s Commissioner for England with the remit to
promote and protect children’s rights. Any strengthening in this

the commissioner will have sufficient funds to carry out his or her
duties and that as few constraints as are reasonably possible are
placed on his or her activities and priorities. I hope that a key part

grandson had to text his mother to say that he did not feel well enough
to travel home by bus, his usual way of travel. When my daughter
arrived at the school by car, she found him alone in the playground,
gasping for breath. She tried to drive to the doctor’s surgery

their school lives. Many others have other serious and life-threatening
conditions. Children who have different needs and require complex,
individualised health interventions also need additional social care
and educational support. The families of these children
routinely deal with more than 30 professionals, from education, social
care, health and other services. Communication between agencies is
generally inadequate, adding further stress to families and children.
While this is stressful for families of children with disabilities and
long-term conditions, for families whose children’s lives are

local authority to produce information on education, health and care
services “it expects” to be available locally, known as
the “local offer”. This has the potential to speed up
access to services and to increase confidence in the system. The added
provision to assist children transitioning from childhood to adulthood
is to be welcomed. However, Clause 30, which deals with this, is not
strong enough to ensure that the benefits of the new local offer will
be realised, as other noble Lords have commented. First, a local
authority will have to set out only the provision 
<?notus-xml column=1117?>“it expects” to be available in the
local offer. That wording is not strong enough to provide redress for
parents or young people if those services are not available. Secondly,
there is too much scope for variation between local areas in services
that will be specified. Clause 30 would be strengthened by a legal duty
to provide what is set out in the local offer, which would enable
parents and young people to challenge local authorities. I hope the
Minister is sympathetic to that, as the feeling is quite strong that
such a duty should be in the Bill.</hs_para>

around the transition from children’s to adult services, is
being lost. Young people between the ages of 18 and 25 who may move in

many women, I wrestled for many years to balance the responsibilities
of a demanding job and the needs of, in my case, four young children. I
owed a duty to my employer to give as much time as the job demanded,
and I both owed a duty and cherished a wish to be with my family,
enjoying their company, as much as I possibly could. I used to say that
I lived with a permanent sense of guilt: if I was with the
family,  
<?notus-xml column=1118?>I felt guilty about the job, and if I was in the job, I felt guilty
about my family. In those days, there was no flexibility in work at
all. The hours were fixed, and the expectations of my bosses were for
many more hours than the contract strictly required. The very idea that
one might plead, for example, an important speech day at one’s
child’s school as a reason to leave work a little early was just
unthinkable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000254" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070283000254">Over
the years, many employers have become more enlightened, and slow,
welcome progress has been made for many lucky workers. Now, there is a
wonderful provision in the Bill that gives everyone—men and
women—the right to flexible working hours. Work at home on
occasions when there is something important to get done quietly without
losing time in travel or interruptions from colleagues? Yes. Start late
to be there for the children as they go off to school? Yes. Or start
early and leave early to be there when they get home?
Yes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000255" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070283000255">How many
women have worked through their lunch break to complete a task so as to
leave in time to pick up children from school? An American friend of
mine who is a very senior banker told me that her bank had recently
conducted a study into the work patterns of its employees. She told me,
“We found that the first 10 or so people out of the door
at close of business were all mothers of young families, and we were
very concerned about that. But then we found that those women actually
put in more hours in a week than most of their older or male colleagues
because they worked straight through their lunch hour”. Now,
there will be no need for such stress. While of course these are
welcome provisions for both men and women, we know from many studies
that in a majority of families women still bear the principal
responsibility for childcare, so this is indeed a policy for women to
welcome, and I welcome flexible
working.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000256" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070283000256">The
second area which is good news for women, although it is one where,
again, both men and women benefit, is the provision for shared
maternity leave. In the past, and for many still today, coming home
from hospital with a newborn means at best only a few days with a
partner’s help to cope with sleep deprivation and physical
weariness. After those few days, the young mother is on her own, often
reaching exhaustion at the unremitting responsibility of meeting the
demands of a
baby.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000257" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070283000257">How
wonderful for the new mother now, thanks to the provisions in

possibilities in sharing the 12-month entitlement: time together at the
start, and the remaining time perhaps split so that each parent can
spend time at home with the baby while the other works. What a welcome

do not share the negative doubts of the noble Baroness, Lady Hughes. I
am sure that many fathers will welcome this provision. Many men regret
the lost opportunities to spend time with a much loved small child.
This Bill gives fathers the opportunity of a proper shared role in
bringing up a small child. In so doing, it may even provide one more
valuable shift in 
<?notus-xml column=1119?>the balance of the roles of men and women in

third area where I believe this Bill will be welcomed by many women who
care about the emotional and social welfare of children is the
presumption of equal access for both parents after separation and
divorce. All too often in recent years, the assumption has been not
only that the welfare of the child implies that they live with their
mother but that the wishes of the mother are paramount in determining
what access is granted to the father. Denying a child adequate contact
and time with both their parents is not in that child's best interest.
The sense of self-worth and confidence in any child comes primarily
from one's parents, and continued contact with two parents can
strengthen a child's confidence, even after the trauma of divorce. I
was interested to read in the <I>Sunday Times</I> the words of Penelope
Leach, a guru of childcare in the 1980s and 1990, who
said—rather surprisingly, coming from her—that even bad
fathers should, with proper supervision and safeguards, be allowed time
with their children, because that contact is so important for the
child<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T17:30:46"></hs_TimeCode>. Although
some angry divorced mothers may—understandably, perhaps, in some
cases—resent this provision, it is contrary to all we know about
the interests of a child to allow any mother to use her children as a
weapon in her anger against their father. I am confident that the
overwhelming majority of mothers, who see how much their children both
love and need their fathers, will welcome this measure. I am proud that
the coalition Government whom I support have brought forward what I
believe is an excellent Bill for women and for
families.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13070283000349" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070283000349"><I><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T17:31:14"></hs_TimeCode></I>5.31

things in it. We make a lot of speeches about two things: raising
educational standards and closing the gap. It is closing the gap that
we have always found very difficult, and at the bottom of that gap are
very many of the groups of children and young people whom we are trying
to assist in the Bill. They are children who need to be looked after,
children who have a disability, children who have a special educational
need and children who have had difficulty in early family life. If we
can get that right, we as  a nation will do a great deal to
achieve our larger educational aims of raising standards across the

<?notus-xml column=1120?>not see it that way because, when you look at what
is in the new education, health and care plans, they essentially are
trying to do the same thing as statementing did but in a different way.
That is happening because statementing did not work as well as we would
have liked it to work. The players are still the same—the health
authority, the schools, the education services, the care authorities
and the parents. There is no new player in this mix. The plan comes at
it in a different way to try to make it work.</hs_para>

annoys me most about this is that it is about some very fundamental
things in education: identifying a child’s strengths and
weaknesses; setting objectives as to how they might improve and how
their needs might be met; reviewing progress; and working with the
family to do the best we can for the child. That is done every day in
every school for children who do not have special educational needs. It
is the nature of good teaching and the nature of a good school. What we
fail to do, right across the parties and right across society, is to
try to make that system work for children who have extra needs. For
them, the co-ordination does not work, and they need it far more than
many children without SEN. I see this as another step along the road in
the journey to try to get better at delivering this. Nevertheless, we
are far better than we used to be 20 or 30 years ago, so it is not
always a bad story. If we do that, we can then perhaps get on to
debating the things that we debate for children who do not have SEN,
such as pedagogy, curriculum, and all those things that will raise

we are to get this right, we have to understand why integrated working
has never happened before. Let us be clear: it has been open to the
authorities and the powers that be to deliver what is in this Bill
before this Bill arrived. If health, social care and education
legislators had wanted to deliver a seamless service for children with
special educational needs, they would have done it; and it is a shame
that they have not done it. We are trying, all together as politicians,
to find a legal structure to make it happen. I think what we can best
hope for is a change of culture so that people actually say that it is

think that, in the past, three things have gone wrong—or,
rather, have been less than perfect. If this Bill helps those, it is a
success; if not, it is not. One is the relationship between the
different services as to whether they work. Too often in the past,
education has had to beg the other services to take note. That is
because the priorities have not been aligned and the budgets have not
been aligned. Quite honestly, health and care professionals go to work
without often thinking that SEN children are at the top of their
priority list. A group of education officers go to work knowing that
they are at the top of their priority list, and they have had a hell of
a difficulty trying to get others to pay
attention<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T17:36:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000266" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070283000266">The
second area that has not been right is responsibility and
accountability. If you are not accountable for what you are meant to
do, the chances are that you will not do it. The third thing has been
resources. Quite honestly, we have raised expectations for children
with special needs and their families that we would 
<?notus-xml column=1121?>give them a tailor-made plan and deliver it, and it
has not always happened. So, as we go through the Bill, my test for its
success will be as follows. Does it make the relationships work more
effectively? Does it put responsibility and accountability in the right
place? Will the resources be there to make sure that we
deliver<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T17:36:53"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000267" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070283000267">There
is a lot to welcome, particularly taking the plan to age 25 and the
efforts to make the voice of the child stronger within this whole
process. However, I will concentrate on some things that I want to look
at as we go through the Bill that I think deserve further
consideration. I either do not quite understand them or am against
them—I have not quite made up my mind. Some have already been
mentioned, such as the groups of children left out of the Bill,
children with SEN, children with a disability but without a special
educational need, and minimum standards for care plans—I will
not say too much about that because it has been
mentioned<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T17:37:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000268" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070283000268">I
will pick out two points that have not yet been mentioned. One is the
qualification for SENCOs. I welcome that very much. I find it strange,
given that we have just dropped the mandatory qualification for
headship, that we are now putting in law a mandatory qualification for
SENCOs. Nevertheless, I welcome it. It looks, to me, as though teachers
teaching children with special educational needs will still be able to
have no qualified teacher status at all. I do not understand, if we are
making it a requirement for SENCOs to have two qualifications, why
those who are teaching the very same children they are organising would
be allowed to do so without QTS. Perhaps the Minister could comment on
this<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T17:38:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000269" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070283000269">My
second point is about pre-school learning. This is the second time that
this Government have dropped the requirement for a group of education
providers to be inspected by Ofsted. I am a great admirer of Ofsted; I
think it plays a good part. The first time this was done was with
schools which had got outstanding Ofsted inspections. I did not agree
with it but I could see the rationale behind it. I cannot see the
rationale for some childminders not to be subject to Ofsted when we
cannot guarantee their
quality<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T17:38:43"></hs_TimeCode>.

Sharp of Guildford:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, welcome the broad
thrust of this Bill. It is a wide-ranging Bill with much in it to
welcome. As always, the devil is in the detail. As the Minister made
clear, it is a Bill that, unusually, comes to us having had
considerable scrutiny in the other place, partly as a result of the
work done in this House by the Select Committee on Adoption
Legislation, and the adoption clauses have taken much that it
recommended. Parts 6, 7 and 8, on paternal leave with flexibility and
so forth, mentioned by my noble friend Lady Perry, owe a great deal to
my honourable friend Jo Swinson in the other
place.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000271" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070283000271">As is
the case with many noble Lords, my interest in the Bill centres on Part
3 and special educational needs. This is because I have been for some
time a governor of a primary school in Guildford with 
<?notus-xml column=1122?>responsibility for special educational needs. As
such, I shared the frustration of my honourable friend Sarah Teather
when she was the Minister responsible for special educational needs at
the Department for Education and published the Green Paper, <I>Support
and </I><I>A</I><I>spiration</I>, which preceded this Bill. She said
that the aim is to stop the agonising battle that parents face in going
from pillar to post to get the support they
need<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T17:40:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000272" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070283000272">Now
we have these education, health and care plans which are to replace
statements and aim to provide the joined-up thinking and action that
have so often been absent in the present policies. These plans are now,
where appropriate, to apply to all children from pre-school through to
25, an extension which I welcome particularly because we all know that
early intervention, if possible, can be the most effective action. Many
of us have seen cases of young people leaving school or college at 16
or 18 who have sorely needed extra support and help and have not had
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T17:41:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

however, about the group of children who are currently classed as
having special educational needs but do not merit a
statement—those who are under school action or school action
plus, as it is called. They are in the majority because of
the 1.4 million children in this country classified as having special
educational needs, 85% are under school action or school action plus
and will not get statements. Can the Minister clarify the situation? My
understanding is that, as now, the school will be responsible for
providing services for these people and, in particular, it will be for
the SENCOs mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, to make sure
that these young people receive the services they
need<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000274" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070283000274">Many
primary schools, such as my own, concentrate now on individual learning
plans and some very good, school-based plans are put into action.
However, this puts a great deal of emphasis on the training of the
SENCOs and teachers in schools to be much more knowledgeable about
special educational needs, a point mentioned by my noble friend Lord
Storey. We need to be aware that these young people will still have
needs that need to be addressed by the school and that the school will
not necessarily receive the support from the local authority that it
has had in the past. I understand that schools will be able to use the
local offer outlined in Clause 30 but that local authorities do not
have any longer a responsibility for providing specialist services to
the schools which have backed up the SENCOs. I wonder whether this will
cause some gaps in services that we ought to be aware of and
consider<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000275" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070283000275">Like
others, I welcome the idea of joined-up thinking and the bringing
together of health, social care and educational needs. In the past, in
my experience, there have been many letdowns on the health side. We
have not had the speech therapy or educational psychology support that
we have wanted from the National Health Service. I am delighted that it
now has a duty. I echo those who have suggested that there ought also
to be a duty to provide on the social care front and I would like to

am worried about the local offer under which the local authority has to

However, there is no requirement on local agencies to provide these

<?notus-xml column=1123?>I share the doubts expressed by many of those who have been briefing us
as to whether, given the financial pressures on local authorities and
the general running down of their education departments, local
authorities will be in a position to offer a comprehensive
spread of services. The Select Committee in the other place
called for minimum standards to be put in place for this local offer
and I wonder whether the Minister can tell us whether the department is
minded to heed this
recommendation<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000277" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070283000277">I
am particularly concerned about the position of further education,
where there seems to be a number of barriers in the way of creating the
seamless transition to which we all aspire. One such barrier is
finance. The new funding system which came into play this year is
proving exceptionally difficult and complicated to deal with. Many
colleges are finding it extremely time consuming. They often have to
negotiate funding on an almost student-by-student basis. This is very
awkward, especially when they are dealing with a number of local
authorities. Can the Minister give any assurance that these funding
issues will be resolved before the new education, health and care plans
come into operation next
year<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000278" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070283000278">There
is also a question as to why the words “must have regard to the
young person’s age” are used several times in the Bill in
clauses relating to financial decisions about support for those over
18. The danger with such words is that they provide, as some have put
it, a get-out clause for local authorities in denying a young person
the particular support services that they need—for example,
special support on transport or something of that
kind<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000279" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070283000279">I
wish to say a brief word about specialist colleges—the group of
colleges, residential and non-residential, which provides specialist
services for people with specific disabilities, such as the deaf and
the blind. They are often centres of excellence in dealing with
disabilities which require high levels of support. They are pleased to
see Clause 41, which places responsibility on the Secretary of State to
draw up a list of accredited independent and specialist providers that
young people and their parents can choose to access. Can the Minister
provide any details about when this list will be drawn up; what
criteria will be used in selecting who is on it; and whether there will
be any appeal procedures for those institutions that do not appear on
the list but feel that they

I am not clear why higher education has been excluded from these
proposals. If the education, health and care plans are to apply to all
those studying in further education up to the age of 25, why do they
not apply to students in higher education? There would be many benefits
if these plans continued through university, including avoiding the
need for further reassessment and assuring everyone that co-ordinated
support continues for young people even when they move away from home.
It is entirely logical for universities to be included within the same
framework.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13070283000351" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070283000351"><I><hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode></I>5.47

<?notus-xml column=1124?>progress of childcare issues for the future. I have been in the House
for 13 years and have lived through a series of different Bills. Each
Bill has brought progress and movement forward, just as this Bill will.
However, it leaves huge gaps which, I hope, will be looked at in the

Bill has a very good heart that has three major heartbeats. Placing
decision-making for children at the centre of policy is something that
the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Children has asked Ministers to
do for a long time. We shall continue to press Ministers to do
that<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>. Listening
to children is also central. However, it is only for some children
because there are circumstances outlined in the Bill under which young
children, if they are particularly disabled, are excluded from being
heard in relation to some of the wishes they may have about services. I
know from working with children that you can hear quite clearly what
they have to say from a very young
age<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.
The most important heartbeat is about working together. It was very
heartening to see the logos of three different departments at the top
of a letter from Ministers. I only hope that that indication of working
together will continue throughout what we are trying to do here,
because there is so much to be
done.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000283" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070283000283">I<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
begin by asking the Minister about the strategic thinking for the whole
context of children’s planning. I have a dreadful cold, so if I
suddenly stop it is because my voice has gone. I am very concerned
about the issues facing those who are in the front line, working with
troubled families. By troubled families I do not mean the technicality
that people seem to mean, but all families with troubles. This work
requires real maturity, knowledge and skill. It requires an
understanding of child development and family dynamics, and how they
interact with culture as a whole and with a child’s environment.
For social workers, independent reviewing officers, under-fives workers
and many others, including teachers who are engaged in this work, there
is a very high personal cost. There is sometimes a very high cost
indeed in terms of the possibility of career
difficulties.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070283000284" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070283000284">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T17:59:13"></hs_TimeCode>
all know that local authorities are coping well in tough times. They
have exciting new methods of delivery, but it is clear for all to see
that with the next round of cuts, authorities will be on the verge of
not coping. I wonder what the Government will do to ensure that
children’s services are protected. It takes only one mistake to
end a child’s life or a worker’s career. As someone who
has lived through three childcare inquiries—which I am sure is
not a confession I should make too easily—I know the impact this
can have on an individual. I heard about high case loads when I sat on
the Select Committee on Adoption Legislation, which was chaired
by<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T17:51:35"></hs_TimeCode> the noble and

in funding between education and social care, which occurred a couple

expensive, with a significant loss in placements. Even if the

am not going to spend a lot of time on Part 1 of the Bill, although I
shall take part of it in detail. As I mentioned, I sat on the Select

about this. The political emphasis on adoption has led to a missed
opportunity to provide services across the care system, as adoption
will not be suitable for a variety of children. Guardianship and
long-term fostering have been shown to provide equally successful
outcomes. As we said in our

has run out, so in conclusion I want to say a word about parental
involvement. The Government have specifically said that ensuring the
involvement of both parents in the upbringing of their children does
not mean 50:50 splits. The reference to shared parenting in the Bill
has been removed, for which I personally am grateful. When considering
certain private law 
<?notus-xml column=1126?>applications the court is required to presume that the child’s
welfare will be furthered by the involvement of both parents in

Touhig:</Member></B> My Lords, with some improvements, which I am sure
will be proposed in Committee in your Lordships’ House, the Bill
has the potential to be a landmark piece of legislation. I begin by
welcoming the Government’s stated intention of improving the
special educational needs system for children, young people and
parents. I declare my interest as a vice-president of the National
Autistic Society. I know from its work that the current system is
letting down too many children, with devastating results. Just one in
four young people with autism accesses any form of education or
training after school. Only 15% of adults with autism are in full-time
employment, and 26% of graduates with autism are unemployed. That is
the highest rate for any disability
group.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070293000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070293000002">Given<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T17:59:13"></hs_TimeCode>
these figures, it is no surprise that the Bill is eagerly anticipated.
The sentiments in the 2011 <I>Support and Aspiration</I> Green Paper
were encouraging. I pay tribute to the then Children’s Minister
Sarah Teather, who promised that parents would no longer have to fight
for the services their children need. Her successor Edward Timpson has
said that the Government
would,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13070293000234" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070293000234">“be

the Bill was introduced.</hs_parafo>

confirm one of the commitments made in the other place. May we have a
guarantee that independent special schools and specialist colleges can
be named by parents on education, health and care plans? The indicative
draft regulations are somewhat lacking in detail on this point. Perhaps
the Minister could indicate when we will see the final draft of the
regulations. I have seen for myself that independent schools, such as
those run by the National Autistic Society and Ambitious about Autism,
often cater for children with some of the most complex needs. They
offer innovative new approaches to providing specialist support, while
maintaining links with mainstream schools and helping children stay
anchored to their local communities. That is very
important.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070293000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070293000005">The
new system as set out in the Bill promises to be person-centred and to
take a holistic, joined-up approach to children and young people by
taking into account their education, health and care needs. This is an
excellent aspiration, but can the noble Lord confirm that the Bill will
make this a reality? I want briefly to raise some key areas of concern
which I believe must be addressed if the Bill is to deliver on its
promises<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T17:59:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the Bill must protect and enhance existing rights for parents and young
people. Crucially, under the current system, parents rely on their
right to appeal statements at tribunal. Under the new system, only
provision that is deemed to be “wholly or mainly” for the
purpose of education can be appealed in this way. This effectively
represents raising the bar and could restrict the ability of parents to
uphold their rights and support the needs of their children. I believe
that the words “wholly or mainly” should be removed from
Clause
21<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T18:00:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that many in this House will agree that one of the most positive things
in the Bill is that education, health and care plans can be maintained
up to the age of 25, as opposed to the age of 19 in the current system.
Transition, as we know, can be very challenging for disabled young
people, and it is important that legislation should reflect the fact
that young disabled people may benefit from longer periods in further
education. However, like the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp of Guildford, I
am concerned that reference is made in Clauses 36, 37, 44 and 45 to the
fact that a local authority “must have regard” to a young
person’s age. I fear that, in these difficult economic times,
this will lead local councils to refuse education to young people over
the age of 19. Here, I seek an assurance from the Minister that he will
act to further refine these provisions to ensure that this is not the
case<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T18:01:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

matter, that of the promise of a joined-up system. I would like some
clarification as to why the Special Educational Needs and Disability
Tribunal cannot provide a single point of appeal for any issues
concerning education, health and care plans. When a child with autism
is receiving services such as speech and language therapy to help with
communication or cognitive behavioural treatment to help with anxiety,
how do we define whether those are educational or health needs? It is
extremely difficult. It may be essential for a child to attend a
school, but doing so is also likely to improve the child’s
general health and well-being. Similarly, social care support such as
intensive help at home for those with very complex needs or
short breaks for their families are much needed and help in all kinds
of ways. Parents and children certainly spend too long waiting and
battling the system before they get the help they need. The local
ombudsman and the myriad complaints procedures in the health service do
not deliver real redress, so extending the role of the tribunal to
cover health and social care in education, health and care plans would
simplify the system. It would deliver real accountability for parents
and help make sure that children with special educational needs receive
all the services they need to realise their potential and to thrive in
later life. It would also help the Government to realise their ambition
of a joined-up
system<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T18:03:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

sure that the system works for all children and young people with
special educational needs, not just those with education, health and
care plans. For many children with autism, specialist support is
provided within a mainstream setting and without any statutory rights.
At a time of squeezed local council budgets, we must make sure that
there is real accountability for families as well. Councils must be
under an obligation to ensure that there is sufficient 
<?notus-xml column=1128?>provision to meet the needs of all residents with special educational
needs. The local offer must not simply be an information tool, it must
have real teeth. Failure to do this will result in parents increasingly
seeking education, health and care plans as the only means of enforcing
their right to the support that their child
needs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T18:03:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

which is being considered in Committee, contains a number of helpful
provisions around care plans and how they can be transported when a
person moves into a new council area. I am pleased that the Government
have recognised this and have tabled an amendment on
portability in the other place. However, this amendment simply creates
regulation-making powers. Can the Minister inform us of when we might
see these regulations and reassure us as to whether, as is the case
with the Care Bill, they will make explicit reference to the continuity
of provision that children and young people can expect when they

about delivering the Government’s promise. This new regime must
make the system easier and more accessible for all families, not just
those I would call the “sharp elbow brigade”, who are
educated, articulate and have the means to work the system. If it is to
be effective, we have to ensure that all disabled children and young

have been waiting for this Bill for a long time. It is one of those
things that has been coming along for a while. When I looked at its
framework, I thought about what is required to make the education
system work. I should say that I am going to talk only about Part 3.
You start to look for what is not there, and one of the things that is
not there is a specific comment about teacher training for dealing with
special educational needs. We have to square up to the fact that many
teachers get very little support in their initial training on special
educational needs. Indeed, I am told that in some cases it is two
hours<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T18:06:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

conditions that those teachers are dealing with by considering the
“dyses” first—dyslexia, dyspraxia,
dyscalculia—along with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
I pointed these out to a friend of mine who is not dyslexic but who
said, “It would take me two hours to learn how to spell them all
accurately”. Two hours of teaching is not enough. If you do not
know what you are dealing with, how in hell are you supposed to give
the correct support? I do not know; you are supposed to be a good

Touhig, has talked about the “sharp elbow brigade”. We
dealt with this before when a previous Government were thinking about

might not have perfect knowledge and it might not be rigorously tested,
but they have knowledge while initially the teacher will have none.
They will acquire it via the bumps and bangs of being knocked around

properly, we are not going to make the progress we

must declare my interests, which arise from the world of dyslexia,
which is reckoned to affect around 10% of the population. That would
make dyslexics the biggest disability group, but the condition feeds
into other groups such as those related to the development of speech
and language, which can be contributing factors. Having sharp-elbowed
parents is a factor in the personal cocktail. If you have mild dyslexia
and you come from a middle-class background with wealthy parents who
can afford interventions, you ain’t got that many problems in
this world. If you come from a council estate with offending in
the family and no one expects you ever to pass an exam, quite often you
end up in the prison system. This has recently been recognised by the
Government. I had the honour with Chris Grayling of launching the
Cascade Foundation, which is considering the prevalence of dyslexia in
prison.</hs_para>

prisons first, because you will find a good study sample. It is
reckoned that some 70% of the prison population cannot read properly,
while many studies have shown that 50% of prisoners are within the
dyslexia spectrum. Asperger’s syndrome is over-represented among
prisoners as well. I ask this of my noble friends on the Front Bench:

that the people who teach are trained, we must look at those who are
supposed to be supporting them, because no matter what you do you have

everybody can be an expert—it will just not happen. What about
SENCOs? This has been mentioned before. Will they have superior
training and back-up to be able to support that person? If this is done

power, that people needed to pass a compulsory English language test.
During the course of the Bill I was assured, “Do not worry, we
are not going to make life more difficult”. However, the wording

it out, sort it out”. Then as the meetings went on, I was told,
“It is terribly difficult, you cannot do this”. Then I

3 of the Bill. When the DfE published its <I>Support and Aspiration</I>

would be a genuine transformation in the support available to disabled
children and children with special educational needs. The Green Paper
held the promise of a single, accessible system of joined-up support,
delivered through an education, health and care plan. We were promised
that parents’ endless battles with bureaucracy would be
consigned to the history books and instead a system characterised by
simplicity and transparency would be ushered

the SEN and disability sector broadly welcomed the ambitions of the
Green Paper, with its proposals to create a more coherent, joined-up
approach to meeting the needs of children and young people with special

obviously moves in the right direction in a number of
ways—notably with the introduction of education, health and care
plans—the sector does not feel that the Bill delivers on the
original objectives of the Green Paper or that, as drafted, it fulfils
the Government’s ambition to create a better co-ordinated and
less adversarial system. The sector feels that the Bill is too focused
on education-related services and does not provide an adequate

will not be eligible for the new plans; nor in some areas does it
protect the existing rights of children, young people and their

currently drafted, there is a risk that the Bill will make things
worse. I have to tell the Minister that there is a real sense of
frustration and disappointment out there at the Government’s

about half the time that I was banking on for my speech, so I will skip
over the things I wanted to welcome. Like the noble Lord, Lord Storey,
I was deluged over the weekend by briefs calling for literally dozens
of amendments to the Bill. I shall mention five areas by way of putting
down markers for where I shall wish to see amendments in Committee. It
is beginning to get repetitive by this point, so I will touch on them
only briefly, but it reveals a consensus that is developing across the
House about the changes that need to be made. Before I do that as

First, the Bill undermines current entitlements. I will give just three
examples. As the noble Lord, Lord Touhig, said, Clause 21(5) raises the
bar for accessing therapies that are vital for some children if they
are to be able to access education. Secondly, Clause 34(9) means that
special academies will be able to admit children or young people
without having their SEN statutorily assessed or an EHC plan put in
place. This creates a risk that children and young people will be
inappropriately placed in special schools and undermines the principle
that mainstream settings must be inclusive for all children and young
people.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070293000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070293000031">Thirdly,
local authorities will no longer have to comply with all the current

the second change, like the noble Baroness, Lady Hughes, I am concerned
that despite calls from the Education Select Committee, the Bill fails
to bring disabled children and young people who would currently be
covered by special education legislation within its scope. Research has
estimated that in the region of 25% of disabled children may not have
SEN, but it is just as vital that they have access to support for their
health and social care needs. A good example of where the Bill is
deficient in this respect is the way in which Clause 30 provides that
the local offer has to include only information on services for
children and young people with SEN, not services that disabled children
and young people might need to
use<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T18:20:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070293000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070293000033">Thirdly,
still following in the footsteps of the noble Baroness, Lady Hughes,
although the noble Lord, Lord Rix, was prophetic in his anticipation of
what I was going to say, the EHC plan is not yet a single plan across
all three areas. Under the Bill, it remains essentially an education
plan. It is not the radical reform that the Government promised and
that parents were expecting. To achieve that, it needs to be amended in
two ways. First, it needs to establish a duty on local authorities not
just to deliver the educational provision set out in the EHC plan but
to assess the social care needs of a child or young person and deliver
the support identified as necessary. Secondly, it needs to provide a
single route of appeal for parents, children and young people to
challenge decisions about the content of EHC
plans<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T18:21:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070293000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070293000034">Fourthly,
provisions relating to the local offer are too weak. Clause 30 requires
local authorities to produce information on the education, health and
care services that it expects to be available locally. That is known as
the local offer. As such, it is purely descriptive of the services that
the local authority currently has on offer. Local authorities need to
be under more of an obligation to identify the needs that exist in
their area and ensure that they have the services in place to meet
those needs. The Bill needs to be strengthened to ensure that children
and young people and their families can hold local agencies to account
for the delivery of those
services<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T18:22:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

there is the collapsing of the present two tiers of school support,
school action and school action plus, into a single category of
additional SEN support. The Government are yet to produce any evidence
that that will be any improvement in educational outcomes on the
present system based on early intervention and a graduated approach.
Indeed, there is a risk that it will lead to a degradation of the
present system of support. As the noble Baroness, Lady Hughes, said,
that concerns the majority of children with SEN—84%—who
receive additional support from the school’s own budget, so we

receiving. How can authorities be expected to plan with any degree of
confidence in those circumstances? We must remember that the

as I was encouraged to hear the Minister say in introducing the Bill, I
think we are moving forward to see how this Bill and the Care Bill can
be 
<?notus-xml column=1134?>joined up. Young carers are children and young

carers often do not receive the support that they need. A failure to
identify and support young carers and their families can also lead to
crisis and avoidable child protection issues. The recent report
published by the Children’s Society, entitled <I>Hidden from
View</I>, revealed the following things: one in 12 young
carers is caring for more than 15 hours per week; about one in 20 miss
school because of their caring responsibilities; and young carers have
significantly lower educational attainment at GCSE level—the

pay tribute to all the young carers out there who do so much to support

role of the Children’s Rights Director will now fall under the
remit of the Children’s Commissioner. In taking on this role,
the Children’s Commissioner will be able to provide advice and
assistance to specific groups of vulnerable children. That is something
that the Children’s Rights Director currently does. The groups
specified include children in care, care leavers, children in boarding
schools and children receiving social care services. I believe that
this is an opportunity to ensure that other vulnerable children who are
living away from home or their families—such as, as have been

receive that advice and

understand that the Government would like simply to incorporate the

need support. Enshrining in legislation the ability to provide support
for children living in custody, separated children who are seeking
asylum or children who have been trafficked would be an
important power for the commissioner. More importantly, it could ensure
that a wider group of vulnerable children can receive advice and

Drake:</Member></B> My Lords, I wish to focus my comments on friends
and kinship care. As my noble friend Baroness Massey noted, up to
300,000 children are growing up in friendship and kinship care. For
most of these children, family members step in to avoid children having
to be taken into care, while in other instances children are placed
with wider family members following care proceedings. Kinship care is
by far the most common way of providing permanence and stability for
children who can no longer live with their parents.</hs_para>

some other noble Lords, that there is a danger that the Bill overlooks
the vital role that kinship carers play. While recognising the laudable
desire to reduce delays in placing children for adoption, the current
drafting of the Bill risks making it harder in future for the wider
family to step in, particularly as it removes the duty on local
authorities to give preference to keeping children with their families.
It is important that the right balance is struck between accelerating
the process of approving adoptive placements and ensuring that
alternative permanent placements for children with grandparents and
other relatives are not overlooked.</hs_para>

place, the Minister, Edward Timpson, showed sympathy for these concerns
and said that he was thinking of amending the Bill to make it clear
that local authorities must first consider placements with family or
friends before they consider fostering for adoption placements.
However, we do not yet have visibility of such an amendment. I hope
that we see it soon. I know that there are many who will wish to stay
with that issue and see that amendment coming forward.</hs_para>

carers can be caught between two different public policy
priorities—getting and keeping people in work, especially women
and older workers, and local authorities protecting the interests of
vulnerable and traumatised children by requiring carers to give up work
to look after them. This tension was raised during the passage of the
Welfare Reform Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Freud, gave the matter his
detailed consideration and subsequently provided for the Universal
Credit Regulations to exempt kinship carers from work conditionality,
looking for work for the first 12 months after taking on the
care of the child. An issue flagged up at the time was the increased
likelihood of friends and kinship carers losing their jobs because the
taking on of such children often occurs at short notice when they have
no employment leave entitlements.</hs_para>

opportunity to extend parental leave entitlements to kinship carers to
give them parity with adoptive parents. Kinship care is the most common
permanency option for children who cannot live with their birth
parents, yet there is a stark imbalance in employment leave
entitlements for kinship carers compared with entitlements for adoptive
parents. The same arguments apply to the extension of parental leave to
kinship carers as were advanced for the introduction of adoption leave:
the need for time for children to settle and bond with carers and the
advantage of enabling carers to remain in the labour market. There
should be access to an entitlement to both paid leave and a period of
unpaid leave, the latter to deal with the initial uncertainties when
the children first arrive and long-term arrangements may not yet be
settled.</hs_para>

research shows that almost half of kinship carers who were previously
in work leave their jobs when children move in. A Family Rights Group
survey revealed that nearly 40% of family and friend carers have left
their job, lost their job or taken early retirement when they have
taken on the care of children. It is often more difficult for both
young and older kinship carers subsequently to get back into the labour
market. There are many reasons for this, including the high needs of
the children, but a lack of legal entitlement to any time off
undoubtedly
contributes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070293000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070293000056">Extending

leave provisions to deal with family emergencies are available to

Swinson, said that this entitlement was available for grandparents 
<?notus-xml column=1137?>relied upon for childcare. The regulations are unclear, though, and
there is evidence to show that most employers and grandparents
believe that they are not entitled to take such leave in these
circumstances. The Bill should remove this ambiguity and enable a
grandparent to take a reasonable amount of time off to provide help to
deal with an unexpected event. Currently one in four working families
depend on grandparents to provide childcare. With increased longevity,
and with people remaining longer in employment, it will become
increasingly important that grandparents are able to combine work and
caring responsibilities in order to maintain not only their own but
mothers’ employment.</hs_para>

also consider the possibility for unused periods of parental leave to
be transferred to a grandparent if neither parent is able to use it.
The principle of transferability of leave from mothers to fathers has
been agreed. Would it be such a radical step to extend it to
grandparents? I know that one of the drivers for transferable parental
leave between mother and father was to break the stereotype that
childcare is a female responsibility. Weighed against that, though, it
is important to recognise who is providing the care, and in
many instances it is the grandparents.</hs_para>

Richardson of Calow:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall confine my remarks
to Part 3. I have a personal interest in this. Out of my nine
grandsons, three have special needs—one is severely dyslexic,
and two are autistic, both in the same family. My daughter is currently
involved in a tribunal with her local authority to try to secure a
place that would meet my grandsons’ profound needs. I welcome
this Bill. I think that it has the potential to provide for my
grandchildren and many others and may be very beneficial in their
progress towards independent and productive adulthood.</hs_para>

in the Bill that I believe are very good. I greatly welcome the
holistic approach to education, health and social care needs,
recognising that they are interdependent. I hope that this

language and occupational therapy, but instead to recognise that they
are essential—not add-ons to the care that is
provided.</hs_para>

the reference to children’s well-being and I am very taken by
the reference to the contribution that children and young people make

have one or two particular concerns. There is little in the Bill that
relates to the provision beyond age 18 other than that it will be
supported if the education, health and care plan is still in place. The
aspiration is fine but there is little about how provision of special
education after 18 will prepare disabled young people for responsible

challenges that they face.</hs_para>

are a number of issues around the discontinuance of a plan. There seems
to be an expectation that it will be looked at carefully rather than
that it will be continued if at all possible. A number of clauses, as
other noble Lords have mentioned, say that a local authority,</hs_para>

needs to be looked at again. Proper recognition needs to be given to
the fact that young people with special needs may take longer than
others to learn life skills. Some will need to have prolonged absences
from school or to try different environments in which to learn as they
make their transition into adulthood. I want an assurance that
chronological age will not be given too much weight in making decisions
about maintaining the education, health and care plan and that no one
will be discouraged from continuing in education or have that
questioned severely on the grounds only of cost. The thrust should be
towards encouragement rather than discouragement. I noted, as others
have, that young people with autism benefit greatly from further
education but that only one in four access it.</hs_parafo>

understand what that means. Does it mean that if the educational
outcomes have been achieved, there is no further need for any care?
Does it mean that if they have not been achieved, no further care will
be given? Is it positive or negative? That part of the Bill perhaps
needs to be questioned. I would also question, when we come to it, why
Clause 47 says that the local authority “may make
provision” to transfer a plan “to another …

continue to support someone whose needs are best met in another

Professor Aynsley-Green, and all those who work in that office.
Extremely valuable has been the contribution which the commissioner has
made to the public discourse on issues affecting children since the

introduced by the Bill could provide greater stability for children by

unnecessary disruption to the child at a later stage.</hs_para>

trafficking. Your Lordships will be well aware of the research
commissioned by the Home Office into the practical care arrangements

amendment—Amendment 57A—to the Protection of Freedoms
Bill. This amendment was supported by the noble and learned Baroness,
Lady Butler-Sloss, the noble Baroness, Lady Royall, and the noble Lord,
Lord Carlile. The amendment was to provide legal advocates or guardians

amendment we examined the three current provisions in the Children Act
1989 which the Government believed had the effect of guardianship under
the directive, namely Section 26 advocates, independent visitors and
independent reviewing officers. We concluded, however, that none of
them had the required effect. Section 26 advocates act only on the
child’s behalf in relation to local authority case reviews and
are not appointed from the moment that a child is identified as
a victim of trafficking. They become involved only if the child chooses
to take advantage of the service. Independent visitors provide a
befriending or visiting role and do not have the right to advocate on
the child’s behalf. Independent reviewing officers have a
specific function in relation to reviews of the child’s care and
are not required to have regular contact with the child between
reviews.</hs_para>

Council. The report is due to be published next week and will, I am
sure, give a valuable insight into the experience of trafficked
children in this country and the care that they receive. It will be

trafficked children vindicates the notion that the current legal

advance of the publication of this report, we know that there are many
challenges faced by trafficked children which our current laws and care
provision are inadequate to meet. In fact, nothing has changed since
that debate in February 2012, except that the case for the provision of
guardians has grown stronger. The Anti-Trafficking Monitoring Group of
expert NGOs published a report in June which highlighted how children
who are being used as domestic slaves are not being identified as
trafficked because social workers are not investigating thoroughly the

who go missing from local authority care. The very system that should
be providing safety and reassurance is unable to protect confused and
exploited children from the threats of their traffickers. The figures
may have improved slightly since 2010, when over the preceding five
years 301 of the 942 trafficked children who were rescued went missing

prosecuted for criminal offences that they have been forced to commit

accommodation that could prevent children absconding from local

to 8 of the Bill, which we broadly welcome. These changes will help
improve gender equality at work and at home, and give some families
greater choice about how they share their childcare responsibilities.
This would be greatly enhanced if, as my noble friend Lady Drake has
argued, more support can be given to grandparents. However, I also
wonder whether the Bill misses an opportunity to improve independent
rights of access to leave and support for fathers, and to initiate a
culture change in favour of truly flexible leave and
pay.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070293000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070293000079">From what
has already been said in this debate and particularly by my noble
friend Lady Hughes, I am sure that there will be support across your
Lordships’ House for a Bill that foregrounded children’s
rights and benefits and, starting from that position, promoted the
opportunities for fathers to care for their children, and especially to
share their childcare responsibilities with mothers in the crucial
early years. After all, the issue of fathers sharing care is first and
foremost about what is good for children and the whole family too. It
gives children more time with their fathers, which is a very good thing
for both, enables women to keep a foothold in the world of work, which
is better for their future work prospects than taking time out, and it
is good for the couple
relationship.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070293000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070293000080">The

Mothers may continue to take maternity leave and pay as they do now,

flexibility. This will also help challenge many employers’

Consultation on Modern Workplaces says that there is strong evidence of

<?notus-xml column=1142?>for fathers in their own right remains at two
weeks’ leave at the flat rate, assuming that they qualify for
paternity leave at all. Will this not result in some fathers continuing
to be unable to take any paid leave at the time of their child’s

birth?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070293000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070293000083">International
evidence shows that fathers’ take-up of leave is influenced by
whether it is earmarked for them and whether it is adequately paid. The

more fathers to take leave, but this has not been included in the Bill.

properly recovered and flexible parental leave has fully embedded. When

pay between them in blocks  of a minimum of a week at a time.
The consultation proposed that parents might take the new form of leave

This was warmly welcomed by family organisations and some employers.
Part-time leave and part-time pay can have significant benefits for
families, particularly those on low incomes who would like to extend
the time that they can spend at home, but who cannot afford to have no
income. Allowing part-time leave, topped up by wages, might allow
low-income parents to transition gradually back to work. Many good
employers already allow employees to come back to work after maternity
leave on a gradual basis, which helps with handover periods from locum
cover. Children may also benefit if they can be settled into new
childcare arrangements on a gradual basis. Can the Minister explain why

statutory pay rates are well below the national minimum wage and will
only be uprated in line with other benefits by 1% until 2016. Does the

Working Families recent survey of 1,000 parents of disabled children
found that 27% of respondents were not in paid work, and more than 80%
of those had given up work to care for their disabled child. Once out
of work it is very hard to get back in. More than half the parents
surveyed had been out of work for at least six years. Their talents and
skills are lost to their employers. Their families are left poorer and

Benjamin:</Member></B> My Lords, we all agree that the Children and
Families Bill is an important and welcome piece of legislation. As I
always say, childhood lasts a lifetime, so I congratulate the
Government on looking after the needs and well-being of children to
give them a solid foundation and a stable future. However, even good
Bills can be improved, and there are a number of extra commitments that
the Government could make that would extend the Bill’s reach
even more.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070293000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070293000090">I
have been working closely with the NSPCC and Barnardo’s and
declare an interest as a vice-president of the latter. They are both
convinced that the Government should use this Bill as an opportunity to
provide even more support for young people, including children
suffering from sickle-cell disorder, young carers and those leaving the
care system, who are among the most vulnerable in our
society.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13070293000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070293000091">The
NSPCC and Barnardo’s have also raised some key points which have
caused them grave concerns on adoption and family justice. They do not
support the removal of due consideration of a child’s religious
persuasion, racial origin and cultural background when placing children
for adoption. Adoption between races adds another dimension to the
adoption experience which cannot be ignored. Existing evidence points
towards ethnic background being a significant factor because if a child
experiences racism, they may feel isolated and unable to share it with
anyone. A child being visibly different from family members may also
result in them having a sense of not belonging or feeling unable to
identify with their family. I believe we would be in dangerous
territory should we remove consideration of this factor altogether from
legislation because do we really understand the impact of these changes
and the message they send out? I believe it must be considered by a
court or an adoption agency 
<?notus-xml column=1144?>when they are coming to a decision relating to the
adoption of a child. Parents need to be able to understand the identity
of the child they are adopting, so this should be included in the
child’s welfare checklist along with religion, culture and
language, as recommended by the House of Lords Select Committee on
adoption. We need to encourage more people from culturally diverse
backgrounds to adopt.</hs_para>

perfectly reasonable. It allows the Secretary of State to take action
against local authorities which are failing in their duties to recruit
adopters by removing these powers from them, but this must be done in a
fair way. After all, there is an adoption crisis in the country.
Children’s charities and the Local Government Association have
concerns about the fact that the Bill allows the Secretary of State to
remove responsibility for adopter recruitment from all local
authorities. This could lead to a catastrophe in the adoption system
because there is no guarantee that external providers would be able or
willing to take on these services immediately, and any delays across
the system would severely damage the chances of some of the
country’s most vulnerable children being adopted. It will not
solve the problem but will make matters
worse.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070293000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070293000093">Moving
on to family justice, there are huge concerns that the 26-week time
limit could make evidence-based interventions that take longer than the
specified time limit more difficult, so we must ensure that there is
sufficient time for the appropriate assessments to take place.
Programmes such as the NSPCC’s infant and family team inform
professionals, help court decisions on whether maltreated children can
be reunited with their birth family or should be placed for adoption
with their foster family as well as assist parents in addressing
problems, but all this requires 12 to 15 months before a
final recommendation is made. Although the Bill provides for 8-week
extensions, continually adding them causes uncertainly for all, so we
must ensure that this policy does not bring any unintended consequences
that impact negatively upon the best outcome for
children.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070293000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070293000094">Finally
I ask the Government to give serious consideration to the addition of a
new clause to cover the children’s performance licensing

including the BBC, Channel 4 and ITV, which were present at the

dates back to the 1960s when there were only three television channels,
needs to be reformed and that there is great urgency to modernise the
child performance regime. There is huge uncertainty on the rules for
child performers on popular shows such as “Britain’s Got

current system places greater emphasis on bureaucracy and form-filling

to be enhanced and updated in order fully to protect children in
today’s media environment, including online production, and to
put adequate protections in place to ensure their health and well-being
at all times. Local education authorities retain a significant amount
of discretion on whether to license a child performance, leading
to a postcode lottery across the UK. This needs to be
addressed. There needs to be consistency. Oddly, there are greater
restrictions around children participating in film and television
production than in theatre. Although there are Ofcom guidelines for
broadcasters, legislation for everyone involved in the employment of
children in all fields of entertainment is being proposed to avoid
widespread
confusion.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070293000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070293000097">Child
physiologists have called for legislation ensuring children are
protected from all aspects of a rapidly changing media world, which
many children and young people want to be part of as they find it
enthralling and alluring. The National Network for Children in
Employment and Entertainment—the NNCEE—the majority of
members of which are local authority officers, has stated that it would
like to see a simple, future-proofed framework that offers equal
opportunity to all children while ensuring they are properly
safeguarded and, most importantly, have trained and qualified
chaperones. Sarah Thane’s report and the Government’s
consultation last year were warmly welcomed by the broadcasting and
production industry, and those in the media industry are extremely
disappointed that the Government have decided not to take forward these
proposals for reform, having mainly taken the local authorities’
opinion into consideration on this issue. It is imperative that this
decision is reversed, so I hope that the Government heed the warnings
from this wide range of organisations—the BBC,
Channel 4, ITV, Pact and NNCEE—as well as schools and
child physiologists and give this proposal full consideration to show
they truly value children’s welfare and long-term well-being and
therefore add a new clause to this important Bill. Let us not end up

option of last resort, so children may have experienced 20 or 30

we need to allow young people passing the age of 18 to remain with

to enable all those young people in foster care in this country to

This is a very modest proposal. While there has historically been a
shortage of foster carers, recruitment is currently going well and many
of those who might provide such supported lodging will in any event be
retiring from fostering. The cost to roll this out would be about
£2.7 million initially and local authorities would soon recoup
that expenditure from savings in social care interventions. Society
would benefit in the longer term with fewer children entering care,
from their parents who are wanting care themselves, and with fewer care
leavers in custody, on benefit or needing support from the health
service. A couple of weeks ago we heard from a young man at the

profound and multiple learning difficulties, aged between 19 and 25,
who are supported in the non-maintained and independent special schools
sector, need to keep learning past the age of 19, especially as they
learn much more slowly than their mainstream

lives and, as the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, has just said, it is
difficult for children in foster placements to leave at the age of 18.

spend in such a service will mark the transition from childhood to
adulthood and be a type of, I suppose, social apprenticeship—a

West Yorkshire. Young people with complex needs are fortunate to have
the services of the Hollybank Trust in an area called Mirfield. In the
past five years, all its school students have made the transition into
adult services with the support of the trust. This has enabled them to
focus on crucial areas of development such as communication and
independent living
skills.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070293000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070293000120">However,
young people attending schools in other areas have not always been so
fortunate. The Chailey Heritage Foundation in East Sussex has just
launched an innovative new life skills service for young people aged 19
and over. Young people can use their personal social care budgets to
pick and choose the elements of service that they wish to
access, such as life skills development and well-being and leisure
opportunities. The reasons for this service being developed are
interesting. It has been developed in response to the difficulties
faced by young people with complex physical and learning difficulties
on leaving school. The reports that I have looked at from adult social
services in the area reveal cases where school leavers moving to adult
care homes had had their communication aids removed from them and
stored in the office, and had had their motorised wheelchairs turned
off as they were causing wear and tear to furniture and walls. These
were young people at great risk of losing the skills developed across
their schooling and which would have enabled them to lead more
independent and happier adult
lives.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070293000121" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070293000121">I was

Minister could clarify that those young adults with complex needs will
continue to receive the support that they require in order to help them
make the transition to adulthood. Clause 45 outlines the conditions for

conclusion, children with complex needs have an entitlement to

adults. Moreover, considerable time, effort and investment has been put
into their education as children and, in order to ensure that the
social and financial investment that has been made during these school
years is protected, the Government must guarantee that young people

legislative debut, and say how much those of us who hope to make a
contribution to this important Bill appreciate that, in line with his
predecessor, the noble Lord, Lord Hill of Oareford, whose performance
was so widely admired on all sides of the House, he has already made
himself so readily available to us. I also say how much I admire the
way that the Minister for Children and Families, Mr Edward Timpson,
took the Bill through the other place, and appreciate that he also
makes himself readily available. In supporting the general thrust of
the Bill, I am glad that Part 3 in particular received such intense
scrutiny in the other place.</hs_para>

and one advantage, plus my experience as Chief Inspector of Prisons.
First, I chair the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Speech and Language
Difficulties, which earlier this year published a report on the link
between social disadvantage and speech, language and communication
needs. Secondly, I chair the Criminal Justice and Acquired Brain Injury
Interest Group, the founder of which, Professor Huw Williams of Exeter
University, has published much valuable research on the number of
sufferers who are in the hands of the criminal justice system. My
advantage is that I have the pleasure and privilege of sharing an
office with my noble friend Lord Rix, who fights so tenaciously for the
best interests of those with learning disabilities. Exploiting his vast
experience, we often discuss the absence of difference in the process
of assessing and treating those with learning disabilities and
difficulties. That leads me to the first of my three pleas
to the Minister, namely that the birth to 25 pathways mentioned
in the Bill should not be confined to those with SEN but should be
developed as a universal tool to be used with and for every child in
the country, to ensure that no possible impediment to learning is
missed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070293000126" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070293000126">I say
that because I believe very strongly that SEN is too narrow a
qualification for the continuous programme of assessment and treatment
that makes up both the Healthy Child programme, one part of which is
speech and language, and the proposed pathways. There is growing
evidence that language competence is critical scaffolding for a
readiness to learn, and that well developed communication and
word skills are fundamental to a good start in the early years at
school. In researching for our report, we learnt of some excellent work
being done now in different parts of the country to enable every child
to engage with appropriate stages of education, an intention that
appears to be clearly at the heart of Part 3. I therefore welcome the
flexibility inherent in pathways that consist of assessment followed by
local offers of individual education, health and care plans, because
that is a framework that can accommodate those with speech, language
and communication needs as well as SEN, should they be added, as I hope
that they will, as a result of amendments to be tabled in

special educational or special learning and communications needs or, in

wrote to the Minister for Prisons, presuming that he would be seeking
to have the clause removed from the Bill. I received a courteous but
thoroughly unconvincing explanation from the Minister for Children,

education and support in custody on to local authorities, inserted by
the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009, by
ensuring that local authorities are not put in the impossible position

may not be appropriate to their circumstances. I would have thought

Eccles:</Member></B> My Lords, we have a lot of legislation and I am
sure that much that is in the Bill is welcome, but I worry about
disengagement—that is to say, the number of people who vote in
general elections and other elections. When I look at a Bill, I look
for reasons to continue to be worried. The first reason would be if
something unexpected came in a Bill, which you would not expect the
Government of the day to put forward. The second worry is when a Bill
includes aspirations that may be unfulfilled for very 
<?notus-xml column=1153?>good and practical reasons. This disengagement is partly welcome to the
public, I regret to say; they are quite interested in becoming
disengaged from the political process, which they see as rather
inward-looking.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070293000133" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070293000133">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T19:35:32"></hs_TimeCode>
have one of each of these worries about this Bill. First, on the
unexpected element, new Section 3A, in Clause 3, headed
“Recruitment, assessment and approval of prospective
adopters”—and here I am alongside my noble friend Lady
Hamwee—is an authoritarian provision. It gives the Secretary of
State power to take certain functions away from local authorities by
directions, if the Secretary of State so determines. However, there is
no parliamentary procedure for directions, so it is highly draconian.
The public knows that local authorities vary widely and will have
different opinions about adoption—this is in Part 1 of the
Bill—and will come to different conclusions about the best way
in which to handle their approach to adoption. I would have thought
that it was part of the democratic process that they should be allowed
to have different approaches. That, however, is surely in conflict with
this Government’s approach to, for example, localism. It is an
unexpected clause; I do not welcome it, and it is another reason for
disengagement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T19:36:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070293000134" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070293000134">Part
5 is my second example. In 2004, in nine sections and one schedule,
with a budget that peaked at £3 million, the Children’s
Commissioner was created, partly as a response to the United Nations
Convention on the Rights of the Child, a child being defined as anybody
up to the age of 18. The convention took 10 years to create,
from 1979 to 1989, and we ratified it in 1991. It is a convention with
very high aspirations; the list of rights is long and, of course,
familiar when we think about detriments, abuse and
discrimination—all very familiar things. But signatory states

that children “reach their potential”. That is a very
demanding and large assignment. To date, the Children’s
Commissioner has not attempted to tackle the major political issue of
that—the joined-up government issue—and could not have
done, having never had the budget. So it has been low-key and has
looked at rather small but nevertheless significant detriments. A good
example would be the exclusions from school affecting about 6,000
children a year. That seems to have been an excellent thing for the

However, I share the disability sector’s concerns, echoed by
many noble Lords, that the Bill still requires major improvement if it
is to deliver better outcomes for children and young people with
special educational needs or disabilities. Worryingly, in some areas
the Bill does not protect existing rights and risks making matters
worse. I will not repeat the points made by many other noble Lords. I

children with special educational needs as if they were a single entity

the case, as is demonstrated by children with sensory impairments.
Sensory impairment is a low-incidence need. Most mainstream
professionals are unlikely to have regular contact with such children
with which to build up expertise on how to meet their needs. Instead,
this expertise is likely to be centred in relatively small, specialist
support services and

Further action is badly needed to ensure that these services are able

the funding of these vital services. The National Deaf
Children’s Society has established that in this year alone 29%

year, just 37% of deaf children achieved five good GCSEs, compared to
61% of children with no identified special educational need. That is a
massive attainment gap. It is painfully unnecessary when you consider
that deafness is not a learning disability and that deaf children
should be doing as well as other children. Deaf children and other
children with sensory impairments need more support, not less. When
this was raised during the passage of the Bill in the other place, the
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Children and Families
indicated that his department will not intervene and that it is for
local communities to challenge any such cuts. This is shamefully
complacent. The department has made a commitment that funding for these
services will be protected and yet seems unperturbed that 29% of local
authorities are not doing so in relation to deaf
children.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070293000142" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070293000142">What
assurances can the Minister give on the success of the Bill, knowing
that there is a clear risk that in many areas funding cuts will fatally
undermine its ambitions and result in children getting less support? I
ask him, where are the specialist teachers to advise on a
child’s education, health and care plan going to come from
unless there is action to protect these services? Who will provide
early intervention services? What will families buy with their personal
budgets? Without adequate funding to provide these services and staff,
it is extremely difficult to see how SEN reform can be made a success.
Parents of children with sensory impairments deserve better than this
complacency when it comes to their futures. They need the department to
take action, not pass the buck to local authorities and
communities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070293000143" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070293000143">That
brings us to accountability. Many of these measures place the burden of
holding local authorities to account almost entirely on the shoulders
of parents. Not all parents will be able to, or necessarily want to,
take this role. The vast majority were not knowledgeable about the
world of special educational needs and disability, and are desperately
feeling their way, trying to discover what will best help their child.
They are busy being parents to all their children, and the parents of
children with special educational needs have plenty to do
already.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070293000144" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070293000144">I am
surprised to learn how little information is available to parents or
professionals on the quality of SEN support services in their
area and how little the Bill does to address this. There is no
specific requirement to publish information about local authority SEN
support services, despite the vital importance of these services to
children with sensory impairments. It does not appear that local
authorities would have to publish information by type of need, and they
might therefore simply publish generic information about SEN. Nor does
it appear that the Government will require the local offer to follow a
set format—most importantly with clear expectations for minimum
provision—which will make it harder for parents to compare
provision in different areas. I understand that the department has been
considering representations that Ofsted should inspect specialist SEN
support services. I hope that the Minister will be able to update

Tyler of Enfield:</Member></B> My Lords, I would like  to add
my strong support for the Bill. This piece of legislation represents a
real opportunity to improve the lives of millions of children and
families in this country. I declare an interest as president of the

is much to welcome in the Bill and I should like briefly to draw
attention to several of its key provisions before moving on to the main
points on which I wish to focus. First, in terms of promoting
family-friendly employment policies that reflect the needs of modern
families, I warmly welcome Part 6, which introduces a system of shared
parental leave, which will enable families to decide for themselves,
given their own circumstances, how best to care for their child for the
first year, thereby encouraging both parents to be involved in this
critical phase in their child’s
life.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070293000148" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070293000148">Part 7
helpfully complements Part 6 by allowing prospective parents to take
paid time off work to attend antenatal appointments. Extending the
right to request flexible working to all employees is also part of a
much-needed modernisation of working patterns that should lead to
greater harmony in the workplace with everyone feeling they are being
treated fairly in terms of their work/life
balance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070293000149" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070293000149">This
leads me to the importance of childcare and, in particular, measures to
make it easier to offer wraparound care. I will return to this as the
Bill proceeds, especially the need for childcare hubs to be able to
offer a one-stop-shop facility for parents to access the additional
hours needed for wraparound care through a network of linked and
quality-assured childminders, However, I am concerned that the proposed
removal of the duty on local authorities to publish a formal
assessment of the sufficiency of childcare in their areas may
result in some local authorities no longer actively working
with providers to ensure there are sufficient quality childcare places
available locally.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13070293000150" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070293000150">I turn now to four
specific areas of the Bill: the family justice reforms, young carers,
the local offer and independent advocacy for children in care. First, I
give my strong backing to this Bill’s efforts to improve the
family justice system and help deliver better outcomes for children and
families who go to court after family separation or where children may
be taken into care. By tackling delays and introducing a statutory time
limit of 26 weeks for care and supervision proceedings and focusing
timetabling decisions for care proceedings on the child’s
welfare, the child’s interests and well-being are rightly placed
at the centre of proceedings and 
<?notus-xml column=1157?>decisions, rather than being left in limbo. Every day matters for a
vulnerable child and every day in limbo can feel like a
lifetime.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13070293000151" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070293000151">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T19:59:16"></hs_TimeCode>
is worth recalling that the proposed 26-week statutory limit initially
attracted a degree of incredulity because the last time an average case
took 26 weeks to complete was in 1995. However, over the past year, the
average time a case takes to go through court has reduced by some 15
weeks, making this already one of the most radical reforms to care
proceedings in a generation, and that was before the legislation
commenced. I am also aware that 26 weeks is a maximum. Many new cases
this year are being completed in 20 weeks or less. A culture of delay
is being replaced by one of urgency. However, there will always be a
small number of particularly complicated cases where this is not
possible or, indeed, in the best interests of the child. Judges,
through effective case management, must feel able and must be able to
approve extensions where necessary.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13070293000152" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070293000152">In the run-up to this
legislation, there was much heated debate as to what was then being
called the presumption of shared parenting and what that would lead to.
Following the consultation, it became clear that no one thought that
strict 50:50 shared parenting—as some were choosing to interpret
the presumption—was sensible, workable or desirable. I am very
pleased as well that the language has now changed. The most important
thing is that the child and their needs are put first. As other noble
Lords have said today, the paramountcy principle is indeed paramount.
This is clearly the intention in the child arrangement orders, which
should assist in focusing parents on effective co-parenting and making
parenting time arrangements in the interests of the child. The initial
focus on parents’ rights in this area has moved, quite rightly,
to one of joint parental involvement with a focus on the child’s
rights and the parents’
responsibilities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070293000153" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070293000153">Secondly,
at the Second Reading of the Care Bill, I drew attention to the
treatment of young carers, which many noble Lords have spoken about
today. We have already heard the statistics about the number of
children and young people affected, so I will not repeat them. There
can be little doubt about the heroic work performed by such children
and young people and the importance of the contribution they make to
their families. However, the existing legislation simply does not give
young carers the protection and support they deserve. All too often,
the demands of caring responsibilities at home interfere with a child
or young person’s education, as well as shortening their
childhood and all the experiences that should
entail.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070293000154" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070293000154">Like
many noble Lords today, I was very encouraged by the recent comments
made by the Children’s Minister, Edward Timpson, when he said
that the time had now come to address this issue. I would therefore
welcome an explanation from the Minister of exactly how this commitment
is being taken forward and how and when it will be incorporated into
the Bill. Young carers sit at the intersection of the Care Bill and
this Bill and it is critical that these two pieces of legislation are
properly joined up. I strongly believe that, with both Bills before the
House, this is an unprecedented opportunity to clear away the current
inconsistent and 
<?notus-xml column=1158?>complex law surrounding young carers and to ensure that they are given
the same rights and protection that the landmark Care Bill is
introducing for adult
carers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070293000155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070293000155">Thirdly,
I will talk very briefly about Part 3 of the Bill. As time is moving
on, I will simply add my voice to that of other noble Lords who have
mentioned their concerns about the local offer. It has many good points
in making known the services available but I share the concerns about
the lack of a duty on local authorities to make some vital services
universally available or to deliver the services that families with
disabled children need. This aspect of the Bill will need close
scrutiny.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13070293000156" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070293000156">Finally, I want to
mention briefly the importance of independent advocacy for children in
the care system, which was highlighted by my noble friend Lady Hamwee.
The Government should be congratulated on introducing legislation
improving services and support for children who are looked after and
adopted, and for placing young people at the centre of decision-making.
However, the Bill can be further strengthened by ensuring that children
and young people are given access to independent advocacy at key
stages, such as care planning reviews and child protection conferences,
to help them express their views, wishes and feelings. Is there scope
in Part 1 of the Bill to amend the existing legislation to include a
presumption that access to such independent advocacy will be
provided?</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-02?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_02_PT_1/76ED6ED9362C9260AC4BFFCB286E61FD35C2736E" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 2 July 2013">Tuesday,

Warnock:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall confine myself to Part 3 of the
Bill and certainly shall not cover everything. I welcome the
Government’s attempt to substitute something better for the
discredited system of statements, which has long produced more problems
than solutions and has been the cause of great antagonism between
parents and local authorities. There will still be appeals against
decisions in this area, but the aim is that there should be fewer and
that parents should be involved in the assessments at an earlier
stage<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T19:57:11"></hs_TimeCode> and more
realistically. It is also very welcome that the assessments will be
independent and that the recommendations can continue up to the age of
25, not only because this will cover the transition from school to
college and beyond but because the age of 19 is for many children with
special needs a time of quick improvement, so they need help at that
stage<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T19:57:49"></hs_TimeCode>. I share
the astonishment of the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, that the
continuation to age 25 does not cover students at university. I can

of support that will be offered to people at college.</hs_para>

intended to enforce the collaboration between different providers of
services, which the original report in 1978, the committee of inquiry,
so conspicuously failed to bring about, although it thought about it a
great deal. However, there are still certain areas of confusion which I
shall be very pleased if the Minister could help to sort out. There is
a good deal of vagueness in the Bill and uncertainty about how things
are going to work in practice, such as personal budgets.</hs_para>

be an opportunity to clear up an underlying confusion that has been
around for a number of years—in fact, ever since an
attempt  
<?notus-xml column=1159?>was made to bring the Education Acts into line with the
Disability Discrimination Act. I refer to the difficulty that we have
in distinguishing between a disability and a special educational need.
Of course, the two often overlap but, as my noble friend Lord Low
pointed out, not all disabled people have special educational needs. As
the noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins, pointed out, most helpfully I
thought, the use of the term SEN is liable to be very misleading
because people use it as though all people designated as having an SEN
have the same sort of need. I was extremely moved by her appeal to
separate off those who have a sensory deprivation of one kind or
another and who very often, if their needs are addressed, do not have
any other special educational needs. This seemed to me the kind of
confusion that the Bill might help to clear

to deep scepticism about whether it will be possible for local
authorities to fulfil their duties in the face of more financial cuts.
In particular, I should like to ask the Minister how local authorities
are supposed to fund the training of SENCOs, the cost of which is
approximately £3,000 for each trainee. At present, that is paid
for centrally, but from April 2014 the cost is to fall on local
authorities. Without properly trained SENCOs in each school, the whole
new system will collapse. Under the proposed new arrangements, SENCOs
will have to make decisions about the needs of children with an SEN but
with no education, health and care plan—probably almost 90% of
the group of children with SEN—without the help of the school
action and school action plus framework. I have not found anything that
helps me to understand the rationale for abolishing this distinction,

suspect that a large group of children—probably 18% of children
in any given school, and more in some schools—are going to find
themselves at the mercy of very variable and inadequate levels of
educational support. I am referring to pupils who have SEN but do not
have plans. The supply will be dictated, as usual, by financial
considerations rather than considerations of need. I do not complain
about that because that is the world that we live in, but the SENCO
will have to be both a powerful advocate and very well educated in all
different disabilities if he or she is to be able to make that kind of

very much like to be confident—I am not—that the new

ill trained and often totally inadequate generalist classroom
assistants. Such assistants may do more harm than good to the pupils

are looking after should appear more or less to keep up with the rest
of the class. They tend to do the work for the child, rather than take
time to make sure that the child properly understands what is going on.
In the case of dyslexia, I believe that they often do more harm than
good. As the noble Lord, Lord Addington, well knows, teaching a
dyslexic child involves skill. Such children can be taught and they can
be marvellously helped and supported, but an untrained classroom

regard this Bill as an opportunity rather than anything else, and
unless it is suitably amended I think we will have wasted a chance. I
refer particularly to Clause 57, which is concerned with special
educational provision other than in schools. This has particular,
although not exclusive, application to children who have been excluded
from mainstream schools. We know that children with special educational
needs are many times more likely to be excluded than children without.
Pupil referral units—they are mainly pupil referral units but
there are other kinds of provision as well—are mostly inhabited
by children with special educational needs. There are some very good
PRUs. I know quite a lot about one in particular in Tower Hamlets,
which does extremely good work. It puts students through GCSEs and
A-levels. The work that it does is good, but in particular the teachers
are most remarkable people.</hs_para>

to assess school-assessed work at GCSE or A-level because they are only
teachers in PRUs. PRUs are not recognised as places where trainee
teachers can train because they are only PRUs and not proper schools.
This seems to be grossly unfair on those teachers, but there is also a
lack of use of what could be a marvellous resource. After all, they are
teaching the most difficult children whom other schools have failed to
teach, and they are a last resort for extremely vulnerable children. If
this last resort is not supported and used, and if the skills on
display there are not disseminated through other schools, the children
in these units will be undervalued and the resource that they are using

I entirely agree with my noble friend Lord Ramsbotham when he says that
Clause 70 should be taken out of the Bill. PRUs are places from which
children in secure accommodation could most benefit, not only through
the skill of the teachers but through the use that the best of these
places make of interactive distance learning, which is the most useful
kind of teaching that these disaffected children can have. If these
children are disaffected at school, they are likely to become yet more
disaffected from society as a whole and they will end up in

point that has been made well by the noble  Lord, Lord

cannot possibly expect the Department for Education and our schools to

parliamentary group has pointed out so well, it is important that all
departments work together—the Department for Education, the
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, the Department for
Communities and Local Government, the Department for Work and Pensions,
the Department of Health, the National Health Service and Public Health
England, the Ministry of Justice and the Home Office, and the UK Border

happy to respond to any inquiry from his officials about what names I

adjust in the face of opposition, in the formal political sense, but to
amend legislation if necessary in the light of the crucial importance

suggest to the Minister—and the all-party parliamentary group

Young of Old Scone:</Member></B> My Lords, I was interested to hear how
moved the Minister was by his visit yesterday. I now invite him on
another visit, this time to a family who have just experienced a major
struggle to get adequate support in school for their son who has type 1
diabetes. I declare an interest as the chief executive of Diabetes UK.
However, I am speaking not only on behalf of children and families with
diabetes but on behalf of the one million children in this country who
have long-term health conditions, such as asthma, heart disease,
migraine and epilepsy, who require and often do not get extra support
at
school<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T20:17:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070293000178" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070293000178">Several
noble Lords have already highlighted the absence of provision in the
Bill for this important group. The Health Conditions in Schools
Alliance, an alliance of 36 national charities across a wide range of
health conditions, has collected evidence from children and parents. We
hear about children being excluded from school activities and made to
feel isolated and different at a time when they need to feel that they
are fitting in. Their academic attainment suffers and, in 
<?notus-xml column=1163?>some cases, their very health or survival is put at risk with crises in
their condition being unsupported. In many cases, parents have to give
up work or work reduced hours, with serious financial implications for
their families and, indeed, for the
economy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T20:18:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070293000179" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070293000179">Let
me give examples. There are 29,000 children in this country with type 1
diabetes. In 70% of cases where a child is unable to inject insulin on
their own behalf or where an insulin pump needs simple checks, parents
are required to go into schools to provide this simple care. Some 59%
of schools do not have a policy of advising staff on how to give
medication. There are 63,000 children and young people with epilepsy
but less than 40% of schools have an epilepsy policy. Indeed, recently
the Children’s Commissioner has criticised ad hoc exclusion of
children from schools as the result of long-term medical conditions.
Often when schools think that they cannot cope, they simply send the
child
home<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T20:19:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070293000180" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070293000180">I
should not be critical of all schools because many schools provide
excellent support to these children but, distressingly, others do not.
It is intriguing that very often that involves neighbouring schools in
the same local educational area. So it is not an issue of money, staff
or skills—it is a failure of commitment. It is often left to the
interest or motivation of a head or a particular teacher. This kind of
postcode lottery is

the debate on the Bill in the other place, the Government spokesman
agreed that in some schools support for children with health conditions
is below the level we should be seeing and that every effort needs to
be made to improve practice on the ground. However, wishing things to
be better will not make them happen. We now have a long and deep
experience that shows that for those schools which do not voluntarily
do the right thing by these children, a statutory requirement is now
needed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T20:20:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070293000182" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0002.htm#13070293000182">I
am sure the Minister will have been briefed that the Children Act 1989,
the Education Act 2002 and the Equality Act 2010 provide sufficient
legislative framework. I simply say that they have not so far. Too many
schools have failed to follow the existing guidance given on supporting
children with health conditions. I could introduce the Minister, were
he in visit mode, to some of the families who have had to fight
to get rights through using this legislation. However, for every family
that has the tenacity, intelligence and resource to fight that case,

would like the Minister to meet some of these families but, more
importantly, I invite him also to adopt the amendments tabled on this
issue in the other place and lay a statutory duty on schools to have a
plan for the support for such children. It is not too much to ask for a
million vulnerable children. It will help the Government to meet their

I may briefly raise the issue of another omission from the Bill. It may
look a bit off the wall, but here goes. The Minister will be acutely
aware that the Government failed to include in the Queen’s

<?notus-xml column=1164?>cigarettes and tobacco products, despite the considerable weight of
evidence. We are still waiting. Standard packs are designed to protect
children and young people from taking up smoking. This Bill is an

read in the context of children and families, particularly those on low
incomes, carrying the main burden of austerity and economic and social
policies. This is clearly demonstrated by the Office of the
Children’s Commissioner’s child rights impact assessment

Joint Committee on Human Rights, I shall focus on three of the issues
raised in our report on the Bill. First, on the reforms to the Office
of the Children’s Commissioner, the committee has welcomed them
as significant human rights enhancing measures. However, despite the
changes made in response to our pre-legislative scrutiny, some concerns
remain. The committee recommended that the commissioner’s
primary function of promoting and protecting the rights of children
should be explicitly defined with reference to the rights set out in
the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, rather than the
commissioner simply having to have regard to these rights. This
stronger formulation would be in line with the recommendation of the

degree of independence is pivotal in determining their success or

the Bill enhances the commissioner’s independence, there are
very real concerns that it will not have sufficient resources to fulfil
its enhanced duties in a way that ensures its compliance with the Paris
principles, which govern international human rights bodies. In a
digital age it is crucial that an organisation’s independence is
signalled by its website. At present that is not the case, despite
protracted negotiations. The JCHR has urged the Government to resolve
this issue swiftly, and I would welcome the Minister’s assurance
that it will do

are also other important ways in which the office of the
Children’s Commissioner must be strengthened. These were raised
by the Alliance for Reform of the Children’s Commissioner, and
no doubt we will explore them in Committee. For example, there is a
case for extending the definition of vulnerable children for whom the
commissioner is required to

asylum, children who have been trafficked and children in

to Part 1 of the Bill, the Joint Committee recommended that Clause 1 be
amended to make more explicit the Government’s intention that a
fostering for adoption placement does not take priority over a

making the welcome assurance in his speech. I hope he can reassure us

The danger is that without any such reference, due regard might not be
paid to these factors, which would  be incompatible with
Article 20(3) of the UNCRC. The committee therefore recommended
that these considerations be added to the checklist to which local

As it is, the impact assessment anticipates a take-up rate by fathers

achieve a culture change or a real shift in the division of caring
responsibilities between fathers and mothers, which I believe to be
essential if we are to achieve true gender equality. The evidence cited
in the impact assessment suggests that this would have a positive
long-term effect on children and young people.

Joint Committee welcomes the provisions as representing progress
towards the implementation of the obligation set out in Article 18(1)
of the UNCRC to take steps to ensure recognition of the principle of
the “common responsibility to parenting”, but it also
expresses disappointment that the Bill does not make the more ambitious
provision for shared parental leave that was foreshadowed in the modern
workplaces consultation. I know that the Government have said that they
will keep this matter under review and that there are powers in the
legislation to extend paternity leave and for it to be taken in
non-consecutive periods. Can the Minister clarify whether this means
that it could be taken at any point during the period covered by shared
parental leave<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T20:29:41"></hs_TimeCode>?

Another<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T20:29:51"></hs_TimeCode> step
backwards is the absence of any provision for part-time leave, even
though this was proposed in the original consultation. As the charity

Howe of Idlicote:</Member></B> My Lords, as the noble Baroness, Lady
Benjamin, said, I think we are all agreed that this is a very important
Bill, interacting as it does with so many pieces of legislation that
have only recently been through your Lordships’ scrutiny.
Thankfully, we have the summer vacation to study the many reports that
are the result of the pre-legislative scrutiny that has already been
undertaken, so when we reach Committee in October, we shall be better
equipped<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T20:31:21"></hs_TimeCode>. There
are many areas of the Bill that one is interested in. It is my belief
that strengthening the role of the Children’s Commissioner for
England is crucial, as indeed is the voice of the child on every single
issue, but I shall leave those two matters to one side.</hs_para>

other noble Lords, I will concentrate my remarks on the area of special
needs. I warmly congratulate the Government on making these reforms the
key priority in order to improve the lives of children and families in
the UK. It is estimated that one in eight families in England has a
child with special educational needs, which equates to 1.7 million
children. Given these significant numbers and, one must stress, a
likely growth in them as the years go on, it is of the utmost
importance that we get these reforms right. We have heard about the
problems faced by those with special needs in the health area. It is
clear that the current legislation—the Equality Act, education
legislation and so on—is not sufficient. There must be a duty on
schools to take the necessary action. I am sure that we will come back
to this point.</hs_para>

issue is something that Members in the other place argued for
vigorously: the need to reduce the battles that families face in
getting the support that they need. Indeed, I am pleased that the 
<?notus-xml column=1167?>Government have stated that the explicit aim of the Bill is to end the
unacceptable situation where “thousands of families” are
forced to go from “pillar to post” and
face,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13070293000256" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0003.htm#13070293000256">“agonising

campaign of the disability charity Scope, whose report was published
last year, found that too many families with disabled children and
special educational needs were being pushed to crisis point. Almost
two-thirds of families said that they were not able to access the
services that they and their child needed in their local area. If they
have the energy and tenacity to do so, parents are being forced to
fight for every last bit of support, be it in schooling, childcare,
therapy or leisure services. The impact that this lack of support has
on families’ quality of life should not be underestimated; 80%
of those families said that that caused them stress and anxiety, and
half said that they struggled to hold down full-time jobs as a result
of a lack of support in their local
area.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070293000204" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0003.htm#13070293000204">The key
way in which the Government aim to resolve that is through the
introduction of the local offer—the services on which the vast
majority of children with SEN, the 87% who do not have a statement,
will be reliant. The local offer will require local authorities to
publish information on the support available for families with disabled
children and children with SEN in their local area, thereby injecting
some much-needed transparency into the SEN system. Improving access to
information is of course a vital tool in enabling families to find the
support and help that they need. I am delighted that the Government are
committed to introducing that. However, although the
Government’s intention with regard to the local offer is
welcome, I fear that in practice it will not bring about the
transformation in support for families that has been
promised<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T20:35:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070293000205" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0003.htm#13070293000205">The
right access to information is vital, but not a panacea. In order to
ensure that services are truly responsive to needs on the ground, there
must be strong accountability. I seem to recognise that word
“accountability” from my noble friend, who I think is
sitting behind me, because he requires it on everything to do with
children in custody, but it is also relevant in plenty of other
areas.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070293000206" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0003.htm#13070293000206">Currently,
parents too often feel that nobody is listening to them and that the
only way they can get the right support for their child is to go
through the formal process of getting a statement, or even going to a
tribunal. That is an extremely arduous and complex process and is only
for those who have the knowledge and know-how to do so. Moreover, can
that really be the most efficient use of time and resources for local
authorities that are suffering large cuts to their budgets? As the

There is another problem, though, pointed out by Keystone Consulting.
Around 100,000 children cannot access mainstream education due to
sickness, disability, exclusion or being moved around as looked-after
children, or because they are in custody. By no means do all the
excluded not want to learn; a BIS research paper in January found that
more than nine out of 10 NEET young people were motivated to learn but
felt that there were
barriers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T20:38:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070293000209" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0003.htm#13070293000209">As
Keystone Consulting points out, education provision can be supplied by
individual organisations that have created innovative ways to help
those who are currently excluded. However, the snag is that the money
assigned per student while inside the mainstream system does not follow
a young person once they are no longer on the school roll, meaning that
it is financially difficult for students to pay for the alternative
education that would help them. Online and blended education mixes
visual with auditory, verbal and kinaesthetic modes of teaching and
ensures that children can focus on learning without being bogged down
by external influences that they might struggle to deal
with.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070293000210" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0003.htm#13070293000210">My time
is more than up so I will not go on further. I simply stress that
having small pockets of good practice is not good enough. We must be
able to transform support for all disabled children. There must be a
legal duty to ensure that local authorities and health agencies
consider disability at every stage, be it planning, designing,
commissioning, funding, delivering or evaluating local
services.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13070293000211" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0003.htm#13070293000211">I
emphasise the importance of these reforms in meeting the needs of all
children with SEN, not just those with the most complex needs. We must
seize this opportunity and ensure that the Bill truly transforms
support for all SEN children. This is a message that is coming from
many other people too. A strong, relevant local offer is an excellent
way to do this. Parents all over the country are watching this debate
and we must not let them down.</hs_para>

Northbourne:</Member></B> My Lords, this is a good Bill. It addresses
important failings in our current child support system. However, it
will be very expensive to implement. With the present state of the
nation’s finances, there must be a question mark over how local
authorities will be able to afford to implement it.</hs_para>

that the Bill attempts to address relate mainly to the problems of
those children whose parents are unable or unwilling to give them, or
to procure for them, the love, care, support and education that they
need if they are to develop into happy and useful adults and to be able
to be good parents and good citizens in their turn. It is important
that these problems be solved not only for the future of our society
but in the context of the human rights of every child and of social
mobility within our society. Too many of this nation’s parents
today have not been adequately prepared for their role as parents.
Might it not be a more effective—and, perhaps, less
expensive—way of achieving the Government’s objectives to
concentrate more on prevention? Should we not be thinking about what
steps we could take to reduce in the future the number of families that
will fail to give their children the start in life that they
need?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070293000214" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0003.htm#13070293000214">This
leads on to two practical questions. First, should we not define more
clearly what responsibilities towards their child we as a society
expect a parent  to accept and shoulder? Secondly, should we
not  be doing more in school to motivate and
empower and prepare our young people, the nation’s
future parents, for the responsibilities of adult life and
parenthood?</hs_para>

and fathers want to give their children the start in life that they
need, but there are many obstacles in the way. More than 3 million
children in this country are growing up in lone-parent households. Some
30% of women and 17% of men have been victims of domestic violence at
least once since the age of 16. Some 22% of children live with a parent
who drinks hazardously. These statistics, and many others that are
available, give some indication of the problems that prospective
parents face in our society today: unemployment, family breakdown,
unstable and chaotic families, domestic violence, drug and alcohol
abuse, mental illness, fathers in prison and many more. We will never
entirely wipe out these problems, which devastate the lives of some of
our children, but their number and severity could surely be reduced. I
believe and hope that such a process might be set in train by the
Bill.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13070293000216" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0003.htm#13070293000216">There
are things that we could and should be doing. I will mention just two.
First, we could use the Bill to clarify in simple language the
respective responsibilities of parents and the state in the complex
task of raising the nation’s children. The complexity of the law
today means that too many parents, and especially too many young men,
are choosing to ignore their parental responsibilities. Section 2 of
the Children Act 1989 refers to “parental responsibility”
but does not define it. I should like to see this Bill define a
parent’s responsibilities to their child unambiguously and in
simple language so that every prospective parent, even teenage fathers,
could understand that they have responsibilities towards any child they
bring into the world. I would also like them, if possible, to have some
understanding of what those responsibilities are. Today, the law on
this subject depends on case law. This is fine for lawyers but is not
helpful for teachers and others when trying to explain to young people
why they should take seriously their responsibilities to their 
<?notus-xml column=1170?>future child. Scottish law has an excellent short
definition of parental responsibility, on which I intend to base an
amendment.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13070293000217" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0003.htm#13070293000217">My
second suggestion for action relates to the fact that recent research
shows that there are two windows of opportunity in a child’s
life when it is possible to influence their social and personal
development. The first is in the first three years of a child’s
life. This window of opportunity has already been recognised by this
Government and has led to their early years programme, so ably led by
Graham Allen. The second window of opportunity is during key stage 3,
between the ages of 11 and 14. At this age, most young people are eager
to find out more about the opportunities, challenges and
responsibilities that they will meet in adult life. This is a time when
good schools have the opportunity to help, teach and guide pupils on
these issues, perhaps through the PSHE programme.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13070293000218" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0003.htm#13070293000218">However, the sad thing
is that, as Ofsted reports show, few secondary schools today are giving
any priority whatever to PSHE. Most do not regard personal and social
education as an important subject and in the majority of cases the
subject is being taught, if it is taught at all, by teachers with no
specialist training or experience in it. I call on the Government to
encourage all secondary schools to employ at least one teacher with
specialist training in this important subject and to take steps to
ensure that enough specialist teacher training is available to make
this possible. Today, not one single teacher training university in
this country offers such a
course.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-02?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_02_PT_1/D0C92168ADCB07BC85A3E2C06E47C9922AB3CED3" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 2 July 2013">Tuesday,

Eaton:</Member></B> My Lords, I declare my interests as a
vice-president of the Local Government Association and as an elected
member of Bradford Metropolitan District Council. I speak today as the
Bill has significant implications for local government. As someone who
has worked in local government for many years, I welcome the
Government’s commitment to improving the lives of children and
young people. It goes without saying that protecting children and
helping to provide for their future is one of the most important things
that councils do, and councils take those responsibilities very
seriously. The measures in the Bill will have a significant impact on
councils’ children’s services, because local authorities
will have a central role in implementing
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307032000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0003.htm#1307032000002">I know we
all want to make sure that the Bill helps secure the best possible
outcomes for our children and young people. While I welcome many of the

the proposed changes to the adoption system and, as with many others,
special educational needs
reform.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307032000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0003.htm#1307032000003">I
served on the House of Lords Select Committee on adoption legislation
and had the pleasure of working on this with many noble friends who are
here today. I would like to be clear, as the committee was, that
adoption is not the only form of permanence available for children. For
some, permanence through special guardianships or long-term foster care
might be more appropriate. The central consideration must always be
what is in the best interests of the individual child.</hs_para>

clauses are to be commended. For example, councils already make use of
fostering for adoption. This increases stability for children. However,
it remains essential to progress measures to reduce the significant
delay in the courts and uncertainty for the child and those who are not
being fostered for adoption. The committee welcomed this clause, and I
am pleased that the Government have extended its scope, as we argued
that they should, and that there is now a duty to consider a fostering
for adoption placement for all children for whom adoption is being
considered.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307032000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0003.htm#1307032000005">The
committee did not agree with the Government’s proposals to
remove the requirement to consider ethnicity when matching children
with families. We were not convinced, and I am still not convinced,
that this process causes significant delay. I believe that it should be
not the only consideration but one factor along with others. That said,
there needs to be a change to the adoption system, and we welcome many
of the reforms that have been introduced. The acute shortage of
adopters remains a significant challenge, but the provisions included
in Clause 3, which will allow the Secretary of State to remove
all councils from the recruitment and assessment of adopters,
is not the solution. In fact it risks making things worse for
children and
adopters.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307032000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0003.htm#1307032000006">Voluntary
adoption agencies provide only 20% of adopter recruitment. Removing the
other 80% runs serious risks of creating more harm than good. Councils
will also remain responsible for placing children for adoption and
matching them with families. Clause 3 could fragment the system as a
result. Adoptive families say that they like the consistency of support
from a social worker throughout the process. There are also wider
disincentives in the system, which deter councils from recruiting more
adopters than they need in their local area. I know that the Local
Government Association is already working with the sector on plans to
overcome these systemic barriers and to improve performance where
necessary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307032000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0003.htm#1307032000007">I am
also concerned that this clause does not include criteria for use.
There has been room for improvement, but local government has been
taking action and we are seeing the impact of this. Recent research
from the Association of Directors of Children’s Services has
found that the number of children placed for adoption in England has
nearly doubled over the past year. We need time for other adoption
reforms, such as the adoption gateway and changes to the assessment
process, to bed in. I am concerned that the sweeping provision in
Clause 3 would undermine this positive
progress.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307032000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0003.htm#1307032000008">Clause
9 introduces a duty for local authorities to appoint at least one
person to promote the educational achievement of looked-after children,
the so-called virtual school head. It is important to point out that
every local authority in England already has arrangements in place to

the importance of helping children to overcome the trauma experienced
before they came into the care system and the need to support them in
achieving good educational
outcomes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307032000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0003.htm#1307032000009">On

noble 
<?notus-xml column=1172?>Lords have spoken eloquently on this subject. The reforms are ambitious.
They aim to ensure that in future children, young people and their
parents are at the heart of the system. We therefore need to make sure
that the Bill helps to deliver the best outcomes for children and young
people with special educational needs. That is why it is important to
get the detail right. I am concerned that the Bill will not deliver
effective accountability and redress for young people with SEN and
their parents. Although one of the key aims of the new system is to
bring together education, health and social care, as the noble Lord,
Lord Touhig, mentioned, there will be different ways of challenging the
education, health and social care aspects of provision through
different tribunals, procedures and processes, which risks leaving
parents and young people with a confusing system that is
time-consuming, difficult to navigate and emotionally
draining.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307032000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0003.htm#1307032000010">As we
have already heard, Clauses 31 and 32 place a duty on local authorities

I want to make sure that the Bill’s provisions allow local areas
the freedom to include the full range of services that help children
and young people. The local offer should be developed with local
families so that services are designed for them and are not prescribed
by Whitehall. The Bill will give councils a range of new duties, and we
do not need an extra layer of requirements or we will turn a good idea

reflect on the fact that far too many public services are designed to
cope with the symptoms of problems rather than to tackle their causes.
This is true particularly for family services. In designing our
community budgets in Greater Manchester, we began to quote the case of
a family in Salford, who within 12 months had consumed over
£250,000 of public spending from various public
services—police, local housing and others—but who at the
end of the year were no different from the way they were at the
beginning of the year. We had spent that public money and achieved
nothing, so we need to think about

the point made by the noble Lord that we are dealing with families with
complex, often intergenerational, issues. They do not have role models
to help them to know how to perform better. Change cannot come—I
wish it could—from command. We cannot send a team of social
workers into one of our more difficult estates and tell people to
improve their lives. They really do not understand and are not able to
do that. We need a holistic, sustained and trusted

came across such an approach offered through the Life programme, which

It had been working in Swindon when I heard that it was looking to
expand the programme to see whether its success was transportable to

Wigan for less than two years, but we are already seeing how the lives

saved us from the likelihood of having to take four children into very

made for one bedroom may be welcome, but I am not sure that it is

transferred her child into mainstream education. It was life-changing

Brinton:</Member></B> My Lords, I support the Bill and particularly the
core phrase of “support and aspirations” which Sarah
Teather MP used to launch the Green Paper when she was the Minister,
and which I think runs right through the heart of the Bill. I
absolutely accept the previous two speakers’ point about local
government’s concerns about funding this, but we have to start
somewhere. There is no doubt that “support and
aspirations” for children and young people with special
educational needs and disabilities are due for reform. The much
stronger links in the Green Paper 
<?notus-xml column=1175?>between education, health and social care are
critical if we are to move to a truly child-centred approach for those
with
SEND.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307032000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0003.htm#1307032000025">Something
has, however, slipped between the Green Paper and the publication of
the Bill, although there has, correspondingly, been some remedy of this
during the Bill’s passage through another place. The links
between health and education are somewhat weaker. In particular, I am
concerned about the 25% of children and young people with disabilities
or physical illnesses who fall outside the scope of the Bill because
they are deemed not to have SEN. However, their education is often
harder to access because of their
disability<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T21:07:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

student at Impington Village College, where I was a governor for 10
years, who had cystic fibrosis. At the heart of the school is a strong
medical and support unit called the Pavilion, which has full
physiotherapy, occupational therapy, a nurse on hand and other medical
support. Having this in the middle of a mainstream school meant that
she was able to access a normal education. She was a very bright young
lady. Yet, as the noble Baronesses, Lady Warnock and Lady Howe, have
pointed out, schools which do not have this system at their heart would
have been reluctant to take her with the thought of her having to do
physiotherapy twice during the school day in order to make it possible
for her to study. I really think that the Bill will move things forward
for many children with severe medical problems like this.</hs_para>

need social care as part of their education, health and care plan, the
Bill only outlines the administrative need. It is not enforceable, as
other noble Lords have said. Social care is critical to youngsters with
serious disabilities. Without it, they too cannot necessarily access
their education fully. This week is junior rheumatoid arthritis week.
There are children as young as seven or eight who wear splints and use
wheelchairs, although it is not a disease you normally associate with
the young. They still need that support if they are going to have
education in their local school, which has much to commend it. I hope
that the Minister will be able to address this quite specific point
about a duty of enforceability during the passage of the
Bill.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1307032000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0003.htm#1307032000028">I am
also concerned that the SEND tribunals can hear appeals only on the
education element. Surely an education, health and care plan is one
unit. Surely the principle behind the Bill is to reduce the silo
thinking and behaviour. I absolutely cannot understand why a SEND
tribunal should not be able to draw in the health and care plan
elements<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T21:09:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307032000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0003.htm#1307032000029">If
we are serious about the age of 25 as being the key date for those with
SEN, it is vital that EHC plans can continue into university and
beyond. I just do not understand why employers are
included—which is wonderful—but not universities. While
we are talking about universities, I was astonished to read today a
survey from the Snowdon Trust that SEN support is significantly reduced
for graduate students. So you can have a certain amount of support for
three years of your undergraduate course and, merely because you are
bright enough to continue on to be a postgraduate, your support is
significantly reduced—often to 10% of what it was before. If we
believe that this provision is to cover young people up to 25, this
must be addressed.</hs_para>

Lords will not be surprised to here me say that there is one group of
children whose needs are excluded from SEN and that it is an area that
really does need to be addressed. These are children who are so
severely bullied that they fear for their safety—and worse, some
take their own lives. Their downward spiral is often characterised by
their refusing to go school; the number is estimated at 16,000 a year.
I am afraid to say that some schools do not help these children in
finding them alternative provision until the bullying is stopped and
their confidence built up. Providers such as Red Balloon Learner
Centres get 95% of their students back into mainstream education. It is
time that these children were able to access temporary special needs
support, and I will bring amendments to the Committee stage of the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T21:11:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307032000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0003.htm#1307032000031">However,
more than that is needed. At present, the regulations and codes of
practice for schools dealing with bullies are in a number of places,
and I believe that they should be brought together in one clear
government statement, in legislation, support documents and codes of
practice, so that all schools and colleges are in no doubt about the
Government’s strong statements against bullying and how this
needs to be dealt with. We also need to have training for teachers,
social workers and, frankly, children to start to change the culture.
Anti-Bullying Pro, a charity that has worked with Jodie Marsh and Alex
Holmes, has done amazing work in over 600 schools to develop
anti-bullying ambassadors, but there are thousands more schools still
to go. Shy Keenan, whose son Ayden tragically took his own life in
March this year, is fighting for Ayden’s Law in a strong
campaign at the <I>Sun</I> newspaper to provide protection, training
and support to ensure that not one more child has to

want to focus for the last part of my speech on shared parental
responsibility. One problem that many young women face is an employer
trying to decide whether or not they might be likely to have a child,
and whether that will cause problems for the organisation, even though
they know perfectly well that to declare this would be discriminatory.
But there is another problem, too. We have focused too much on the
mother as being the only parent who can provide parental support in a
child’s early years. It is time that parents were able to share
between themselves parental leave in those early vital months; by doing
this, the problems that I have outlined above of invisible
discrimination against women should reduce. An employer will no longer
be able to assume that a woman will take her entire parental leave. The
same is also true of statutory shared parental pay. I am mindful of the
comments, too, of the noble Baroness, Lady Drake, on the role for
grandparents for this as well. I would welcome that, although it may be
a step too far for this Bill—but I think that we at least ought

other elements of Parts 6, 7 and 8 are also essential to provide the
right support for employees, with, of course, due notice for employers.
Flexible working, as outlined eloquently by the noble Baroness, Lady
Perry of Southwark, is absolutely long overdue. The measures in this
Bill are mature and ones that responsible employers will welcome;
investing in their 
<?notus-xml column=1177?>staff will encourage them to stay, and make them
more productive. These are very much Liberal Democrat reforms,
championed by Nick Clegg, and Jo Swinson, the Business Minister, but
resoundingly endorsed by the party. It will produce a more motivated
and productive workforce, and employers will be able to recruit and
retain staff from a wider pool of talent. It will also have the benefit
of increasing the diversity of the workforce—no bad

year I hosted a round table organised by the NSPCC with representatives
from major adoption and fostering agencies, leading academics with a
body of research from the UK and overseas, and adults who had been
fostered, adopted, in care and/or were adopters themselves. None could
see the merit in getting rid of the need to at least consider race,
ethnicity or whatever you want to call it when placing a child for
adoption. By the same token, no one suggested that it would be right to
say that it was better for a child to languish in care rather than be
adopted by parents with a different cultural or ethnic experience. The
evidence points to a number of reasons why it takes longer for black,
Asian and minority ethnic children to be adopted, a principal reason
being that some ethnic groups come into care at an older age than
others and are therefore not the desirable babies that many
potentially adoptive couples seek.</hs_para>

Benjamin, argued this point most emphatically. I am sure that she and
professionals like me in the field fail to see why the Government
refuse even to include ethnicity and race in the welfare checklist,
given that these characteristics fit comfortably alongside the other
elements of a child’s welfare. Can the Minister give a
substantial, evidence-based reason as to why this option has been
rejected? Does his department have a view on the extent to which it
would be helpful to encourage more people from a variety of ethnic and
cultural backgrounds to become adoptive parents and foster carers? I
have not heard much on that issue.</hs_para>

also, as many noble Lords have pointed out from a range of
perspectives. Giving the Secretary of State sweeping powers to
direct local authorities effectively to outsource
adoption services without consultation presents real problems.
Of course any local authorities that are failing in their
duties with regard to adoption must be held to account, but it is that
accountability that would be diminished were these services to given
over in their entirety to the voluntary or private sectors. In the case
of the latter, if this is the Government’s ultimate
aim—and I hope that the Minister will strenuously deny
it—how would this benefit adoption services? I find it hard to
imagine how a private sector company would expect to make a profit in
this most sensitive of situations, and voluntary organisations have not
indicated that they have the will or the capacity to take over from
local authorities.</hs_para>

aware, adoption is not the end point but the start of a challenging
adventure that has ups and downs. Experienced skilled support for all
the parties involved is an essential component of the process and can
make all the difference to the quality of the outcome. Adopters should
be entitled to a comprehensive package of support, provided by the
local authority as part of its statutory obligation. Too often,
adoptive parents do not know where to go or who to speak to for the
professional advice and support that will help them over the difficult
patches; often the

year seek out their records, and some of their experiences are quite
distressing. I also want to address the issue of access to the records
and notes from one’s time in care. Unlike an adopted
person, a care leaver has no right of access to information
about their past, their siblings or even their parents; they might
simply have a restricted amount of information handed to them, as the

want to address is what the right age is to expect a care leaver to

care leavers can access support, whether that is through foster carers,
if both parties are in agreement, or through other forms of support. At

to be commended in the Bill, there is still an awful lot of work to do

more equal to children who grow up in more conventional family
arrangements. There is a huge range of questions that we have to ask,
one of which is to ask why this keeps happening. This disparity in
outcomes is not a new phenomenon; it is not exclusive to the late 20th
or early 21st centuries. Instead, it has dogged us for decades and we
do not seem to make any real inroads. How do we deliver really high
quality care for those who need to come into the system? How can we get
more black, Asian and minority ethnic foster parents and mentors? How
can we stop young vulnerable girls in care in particular being groomed
and violently abused while apparently being looked after by the state?

independent living. I agree with my noble friend Lord Lingfield and the
noble Baroness, Lady Richardson, that continued learning of this nature
is education for these young people and, because they learn slowly, it
needs to continue beyond the age of 18. I was interested in what my
noble friend said when introducing the Bill, but Clause 36(10) can be
interpreted to mean that a young person over the age of 18 no longer
needs an education, health and care plan. Section 6 of the draft code
of practice also implies this, and mentions that in some
circumstances such a plan would not be appropriate. No, my Lords. I
agree with the noble Lord,
Lord<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T21:40:06"></hs_TimeCode> Patel:
these young people still need a plan, including education to
help them learn what it means to be an adult. For example, they could
take part in adult activities with the support of staff, gaining skills
in how to work alongside staff and parents to plan innovative
placements for their future. This future could involve them
within their own
communities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307032000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0003.htm#1307032000071">The<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>

Knight of Weymouth:</Member></B> My Lords, one of the joys of speaking
towards the end of a long debate such as this is that most of the
points that you wanted to make have been made more eloquently than you
are capable of. That is certainly the case in respect of
Part 3 of the Bill. As others have done, I welcome the
aspirations behind the Bill, and I share some of the concerns that the
Bill as drafted does not fully meet those aspirations. In particular, I
share the concerns about the 1.4 million children with special
educational needs who do not have statements. As school action and
school action plus disappear, I am concerned about how those children
will be properly provided
for.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307032000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0003.htm#1307032000074">I<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>

Lady<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T21:42:31"></hs_TimeCode> Warnock,
and others, that higher education is strangely excluded. I share the
concerns of the noble Lords, Lord Storey and Lord Ramsbotham, among
others, about the exclusion of children in
custody<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T21:42:43"></hs_TimeCode>. I
agreed with many of the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp,
about further education colleges. In particular, I am perplexed that
million of pounds have been spent on 20 pathfinders, to enable them to
test out aspects of the funding behind these reforms in local
authorities. Little evidence has been provided to date, and they have
now been extended until September 2014 in order for sufficient evidence
to be gathered and evaluated, and yet obviously that will not be in
time to support the passage of this Bill or the development of the code
of
practice.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307032000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0003.htm#1307032000075">That<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
enforces the concern that the Government’s admirable motivation

these things without the evidence that we need. I certainly share the
concerns expressed by the noble Baroness,
Lady<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T21:43:44"></hs_TimeCode>
Grey-Thompson, about choice and inclusion. We need to ensure that the
parents of all children with special educational needs have a real
choice, and that we do not return to the days of some children
essentially being parked in provision that is not challenging and not
really education, just the minding of those
children.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307032000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0003.htm#1307032000076">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T21:44:15"></hs_TimeCode>
would like to ask the Minister a couple of questions about one area of
Part 3, which is the dry subject of data. I understand from those who I
have spoken to that we do not actually know on a local authority by
local authority basis how many children will be provided for in these
plans. I would be interested to know if that 
<?notus-xml column=1185?>is the case and whether there is any evidence that could be published
over the Summer Recess to show that. In trying to work this out, I
looked for an impact assessment for those clauses of the Bill that
would have been drafted by the Department for Education, but I could
not find one, despite the Cabinet Office guidance that impact
assessments are generally required for all UK Government interventions
of a regulatory nature that affect the private sector, civil society
organisations or public services. This Bill certainly does that, so it
seems odd that there is no impact assessment to help us make those
judgments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T21:45:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

of my comments to Part 6 of the Bill. I shall tell noble Lords a little
of the story of a woman called Lucy Herd and her son Jack. In September
2008, Lucy gave birth to Jack, the third of her children. It was a
particularly emotional time for her since she had lost five children
through miscarriage and regarded Jack as a miracle child. After three
days in hospital because Jack had jaundice, he came home and was a
remarkably happy, cheerful and loving baby. In August 2010, Lucy was
preoccupied in the kitchen, but then noticed that Jack was lying face
down in the garden pond. Despite her efforts to resuscitate him,
and those of neighbours and eventually the paramedics,
unfortunately Jack died. Lucy’s partner, her husband, was
working on the other side of the world at the time and needed a good 24
hours to be able to come back to comfort Lucy and receive comfort for
his grief at their loss. Obviously, Lucy was also dependent on members
of her immediate family, her mother and her
siblings<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T21:47:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

although she was able to take time off to deal with her bereavement,
her husband had to return to the other side of the world after only
five days because that was the limit of the time off that he was
allowed. Her mother, a teacher, was allowed seven days of time off to
cope with the bereavement and to provide support, while her siblings
were allowed only 24 hours. Lucy discovered that there is no statutory
entitlement to bereavement leave when your child dies.</hs_para>

6<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T21:48:12"></hs_TimeCode>. I have
referred Lucy to the CBI and the TUC to discuss this with interested
parties and the current indications from the CBI is that it has some
sympathy with doing something about this. Perhaps a period of two
weeks’ time off and using the rest of the time as parental leave
as one would if the child was alive might be an appropriate way
forward. Lucy has put a

Government, from which I will read a short passage so that noble Lords
know their position:</hs_para>

no specific right to ‘bereavement leave’, all employees
do have a day-one right to ‘time off for dependants’
which allows them to take a reasonable amount of time off work to deal
with unexpected or sudden emergencies, including when a close family
member dies. Time off will cover arranging and attending the funeral.
Employees who exercise this right are protected against dismissal or
victimisation. The right does not include an entitlement to pay. The
decision as to whether the employee will be paid is left to the

Minister, or one of his colleagues in BIS, be willing, before we go

his parents. However, when there has been domestic violence, it is for
the court to decide whether contact with both parents is indeed safe
and in the best interests of the child, but it is also for the court to
ensure the pre-eminence of the best interests of the child

people’s involvement in decision-making related to their special

setting out the general principles, which  was introduced
following pre-legislative scrutiny, but the Government’s good
intentions are not reflected consistently throughout the Bill’s
SEN provisions. In particular, Clauses 32, 36, 38 and 44 appear to
exclude younger children from participation in decision-making by
providing for the involvement only of parents and of young people over
the age of 16. I will be coming back to that matter as the Bill

my honourable friend Adrian Sanders introduced in another place at

welcome improvements to the powers and duties of the Office of the
Children’s Commissioner for England. I have waited many years
for this, indeed since the legislation that created the commissioner
was first enacted in 2004. I am not surprised that people have been
disappointed—as mentioned by the noble Viscount, Lord
Eccles—because the powers, duties and resources given to the
commissioner by the Labour Government were poor and inadequate. This
Government have changed all that. The proposals in Part 6 adhere
closely to the excellent recommendations in the Dunford review. At last
our commissioner can take her place among the children’s
ombudsmen of Europe. Hooray! However, I am concerned by what I heard
from the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, about her worries for the
independence of future commissioners and I will watch this space

Much of what I will say will have been covered already. However, as a
former family judge, I feel that on a children’s Bill I should,
even at this late stage, set out the points about which I have some
concern. I do it therefore without
apology.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307033000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0003.htm#1307033000002">I am

Human Trafficking and a trustee of the Human Trafficking Foundation. I
am also a governor of Coram and have other interests in the register

I was chairman, supported the Government’s steps to improve the

others.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1307033000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0003.htm#1307033000004">On
Clause 1, I am concerned about the provision concerning foster parents
leading to adoption, for this reason: it is absolutely crucial that the
Department for Education gives guidance on the importance of
pre-placement work done by social workers, so that social workers are
not seen as placing children with foster parents without having taken
care to see whether the parents are capable of taking the children
back. I was delighted to hear that families will be consulted first,
but social workers must not jump the gun. Social workers need to be
aware that they must not breach the human rights of birth parents and
children, as has been said, under Article 8 of the convention by not
doing sufficient preliminary work before placing children with those
fostering with a view to adoption. Early intervention with birth
families may make it unnecessary to remove children. I was disturbed to
learn that money was being taken from early intervention to support
adoption. It seems to me that money is needed for both.</hs_para>

many other noble Lords have said they are, about Clause 2. In our
adoption committee, we were very concerned about the evidence that we
received on the question of ethnicity on the basis that if it is out
altogether, social workers may go the other way. We had evidence to
that effect, with social workers saying, “Ignore
ethnicity—it is no longer there. It has been taken out”.
I entirely agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Young of Hornsey, so in
our report we recommended putting that factor along with others in
Section 1(4)(d) of the Adoption and Children Act 2002. I hope that the
Minister will listen on this point, which has been canvassed across the
House already. I also put down the marker that post-adoption support is
essential. The Government are going some way with the passport but have
not yet gone far enough.</hs_para>

we raised the issue of children from abroad who are in the process of
being adopted by English adopters and are living with them but who
have, until the adoption process is completed, no actual legal status
with that family. I do not think that this has been dealt with yet.
Those prospective adopters need some legal status to deal with the
children whom they intend to adopt. There was a possibility for a
residence order, but in a later part of the Bill that is being got rid
of. I am not sure that the introduction of arrangements in their place
would give the prospective 
<?notus-xml column=1190?>adopters parental responsibility. The foreign birth family may or may
not by then have parental responsibility under our law if the adoption
process has taken effect in the overseas country. No one else in this
country will have parental responsibility, so it is crucial that the
prospective adopters who have children living with them have it in
order to deal with schools, health and other such issues. I also put in
a plea for the Department for Education to get on to the Home Office to
hurry up immigration procedures for children in the process of
adoption.</hs_para>

concern on this Bill, along with others who have already spoken on it,
is Clause 11. I hope that the House will forgive me if I dwell on this
for a moment as a former judge who tried this sort of case. In the
majority of cases where parents separate, they come to a sensible
arrangement for the children and the involvement of both parents. In
some cases, mediation helps that process but there is a hard core of
parents who fight out their failed relationship in the arena of the
court over child issues. The relationship has soured and become
corrosive. One or both parents become unreasonable and it is difficult
to get it through to them that the child’s welfare is the
overriding concern of the court and more important than the right that
some parents feel they have in the arrangements for the children.
Mother and fathers can be utterly unreasonable and vindictive towards
the other parent. I have seen it again and again in the cases that I
have tried. I take the view that in this highly charged state, parents
are the last people who should be making decisions about their
children’s relationship with the other parent. Some mothers, for
instance, cannot believe that their children love the other parent. How
could they, when she hates
him?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307033000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0003.htm#1307033000008">There is
the overriding presumption in the  Children Act 1989 that the
welfare of children is the paramount consideration. Clause (11)(1) sets
up a second presumption, inserted by Clause (11)(2), which is girded
around with a degree of protection, if not in the interests of the
child. A judge or family magistrate starts none the less with a clash
of two potentially opposing presumptions: paramountcy of the
child’s welfare and presumption that involvement of the parent
will further the child’s welfare. Judges and magistrates may
disentangle this, and come to a balanced decision, but this is an area
of private family law where both parents will now, in the absence of
legal aid, be unrepresented and appearing before the judge or
magistrates without lawyers. They will be trying to sort out how to
arrange the future of the children in this atmosphere of failure of the
relationship and a high degree of tension, and no one other than the
court to help
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307033000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0003.htm#1307033000009">Clause 11
is a laudable attempt to involve parents, principally fathers, who
might not otherwise be involved with their children. We have to be
seriously concerned about a substantial group of children whose fathers
have no further, or virtually no further, contact with them after
separation from the mother. But the wording of Clause (11)(2), aided by
press publicity, which has not always been helpful to the understanding
of the intention of Clause 11, has raised unrealistic expectations that
in future the parent, usually the father, will be entitled to play a
substantial part in the future life of 
<?notus-xml column=1191?>the child, regardless of issues about the child’s best interests.
Judges and family magistrates will not of course make orders that do
not put the child’s welfare first. In this hard core of cases
there will then be a serious gap between expectation and the reality of
the court
decision.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307033000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0003.htm#1307033000010">Family
academics, particularly from Oxford, Coram, the NSPCC and other groups
with real knowledge of what goes on at the coal face, are expressing
their major concern about the insertion of a second presumption in
child legislation; I share it entirely. I suggest that the word
“presume” should be deleted and the words “pay
particular regard to” inserted. This would highlight the
importance of the involvement of both parents without the legal problem
of competing presumptions and, I hope, lower the degree of false
expectations by parents of the degree of involvement that can be
achieved. It might also be a good idea to have a definition of the word
“involvement” to identify direct or indirect involvement
and not to be taken to mean any specific quantity of a child’s

an issue about getting rid of the words “residence” and

words that carry baggage, as did “custody” and

failed relationship through child proceedings will not be fooled.
However, there are issues relating to international relations, for
example the Hague convention on child abduction and possibly the
Brussels II Regulation, and the need for a parent from whose care a
child has been abducted to be able to prove a right of custody in order
to invoke the support of the child abduction convention. There are also
other people who are not parents who may need a form of residence order
and the usefulness of parental responsibility for a child in their
care. The word “arrangements” may need to be modified and
more carefully
defined.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307033000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0003.htm#1307033000012">The

an area that is not in the Bill—the protection of children
trafficked into this country. These children almost certainly do not
have a parent in this country, or if their parent is here, he or she
will have trafficked the child. The local authority of the area in
which child or young person is identified as trafficked has a duty to
accommodate such a young person under Section 20 of the Children Act
1989. Accommodation does not include sharing parental responsibility
with the birth parents. Parental responsibility is given to a local
authority only after the grant of an interim care order. I do
not suggest that every local authority notified that a
trafficked child needs accommodation should seek an interim care order
because that would be time-consuming and expensive. I suggest instead
that when a child or young person is identified by the national
referral mechanism as trafficked, the local authority required to
accommodate the child under Section 20 should also automatically be
granted 
<?notus-xml column=1192?>parental responsibility for that child while the child is
accommodated by it. It would cost nothing, but it would mean that
someone would take genuine responsibility for that child in this
country. The noble Lord, Lord McColl, pointed out how many trafficked
children go missing. Local authorities need to realise that
accommodated children need much more care than they currently believe
they
need.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307033000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-0003.htm#1307033000014">There are

we believe that the Bill veers away from these principles. That message
has echoed around the Chamber today. I also agree with my noble friends

cut the unnecessary delays. We have already seen that by concerted and

to our original theme, we are concerned that the new policy emphasis on
the speed of adoption will not always be in the best interests of the
child, nor is it a realistic option for many children, particularly
older ones, which is why we feel that other forms of permanency
including kinship care and long-term fostering should have equal weight
and be the first consideration where options are being weighed up. I

also see a danger that early fostering for adoption can create
unrealistic expectations among potential adopters and children, with
greater stress and pain should the placement not last. This is why it
is important that children should not be placed for adoption unless a
formal decision about their future has been made. It is also important
that their continued connection and relationship with their siblings
post-adoption is planned at the outset of proceedings. Importantly, we
also share the concerns of the Lords Select Committee on Adoption
Legislation, particularly about the removal of the need to consider
ethnicity in adoption. These concerns have been echoed by a number of
noble Lords today. The answer surely has to be that it should be

why we will be tabling amendments to protect the current ratios;
although the Government have rolled back on that proposal, we do not
trust them not to come back with similarly ill thought-through
proposals that could damage the interests of young people. We will also
want to allow further consultation before childminder agencies can be

constructive and heartfelt, and I thank all noble Lords who have
contributed, particularly the noble Baroness, Lady Jones, for her

is detailed and wide-ranging, and this evening’s debate has
clearly shown that the principle that the need to improve
children’s services and that the needs of all children,
especially the most vulnerable, is central to all we do, is something
on which we all

noble Lords have kindly acknowledged, this is my first piece of
legislation as a Minister. I will do my best to respond to the key
points made tonight but, in view of the number of speeches, I undertake
to write to all noble Lords who have spoken this evening to ensure that
I address all the points made in full. I again recognise the work of
the Adoption Legislation Committee, particularly its chairman, the

noble Baronesses, Lady Hughes, Lady Howarth and Lady Gibson, and my
noble friends Lady Hamwee, Lady Benjamin and Lord Eccles have all
raised important 
<?notus-xml column=1197?>points. Everyone involved in the debate today agrees that all children
deserve stable, loving homes to thrive. Adoption is the right option
for some children; for others, returning home to live with their
parents, wider family or friends in long-term foster or residential
care will be the right option for them. The Government have a
significant programme of reform under way in all these areas, which
aims to ensure that children are able to benefit as early as possible
from a permanent home that meets their needs, whichever option is right
for them. I am grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, for
highlighting the good progress that we are making in this
area<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T22:29:25"></hs_TimeCode>. Where
adoption is the right option, however, we are uncompromising in our
efforts to reduce damaging

Noble Lords have expressed heartfelt views about the best way of doing
this, and I am sure that we will return to the issues of ethnicity and
adopter recruitment, as well as many other issues, as the Bill
progresses. I am pleased that noble Lords have welcomed the
Government’s commitment to clarifying the position with regard
to kinship care and fostering for adoption, and I look forward to
sharing our progress on that in

justice and particularly to the question of parental involvement, as
addressed by Clause 11 and in this debate by the noble Baronesses, Lady
Hughes and Lady Howarth, and my noble friends Lady Perry, Lady Tyler,
Lady Hamwee and Lady Benjamin. As has been recognised in the debate,
this issue is a balance that it is essential to get right. The
Government are clear that the provision in Clause 11 does not change
the principle that the welfare of the child must be the court’s
paramount consideration. We believe that it is important to make clear,
especially to parents, how court decisions are made. Wherever possible,
parents should work together to resolve disputes about their
children’s care. This clause will encourage them to do so by
making clear that unless there is a good reason, children should have a
relationship with both their parents. Of course, however, it will not
achieve this by itself. That is why we are putting in place a wider
package of measures to help parents, including better information,
advice and support outside the court system. DfE and MoJ officials will
be working closely with the NSPCC and others to achieve
this<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T22:31:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

forgive me if I do not pause to list them all. The noble Baronesses,
Lady Morris and Lady Howarth, and the noble Lord, Lord Judd, emphasised
how achieving the ambitions of Part 3 will depend on a change in
culture and approach and in ways of working on the ground. That is a
crucial point to recognise. The Bill provides a framework for these
changes to happen. We will build on the work of the local pathfinders

across the House is behind the principle of the SEN provisions.

reform and bring much-needed improvement to the support for children

first set out in the Green Paper and has been followed through to the
Bill. However, the reforms are enabling. Local areas can apply the
principles behind them to a wider group of children, including to those

the roles and responsibilities in relation to childcare
across the genders. I agree with my noble friend Lady Perry
about the importance of these measures for fathers. This is about
achieving real cultural change, which undoubtedly will take time.
Families need and demand the changes in the Bill that will enable this
cultural change to happen. As the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, rightly
said, the <I>Modern Workplaces</I> consultation included consideration
of a “daddy quota”—leave and pay reserved
exclusively for fathers—although economic restraints mean that
it is the wrong time to take this forward. I believe that the
additional flexibility that shared parental leave will give families
will provide far more choice and opportunities for fathers to take on

briefly set out the effect of these government amendments and their
benefits. Their primary effect is to extend the provisions in Part 1 to
the whole of the UK. If and when the power is exercised, there will be
a legal requirement on the Secretary of State to ensure that the carbon
intensity of electricity generation in the UK as a whole is no greater
than the upper end of the decarbonisation target range. This duty is
intended to be met through the existing powers of the Secretary of
State or through negotiation with Northern Ireland
Ministers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070277000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070277000006">The
provisions in Part 1 include a number of ways to ensure that there will
be proper and full consideration of the impacts of any decarbonisation
target range on the single electricity market, which is the wholesale
electricity market operating in Northern Ireland and the Republic of
Ireland. For example, Clause 2(2)(f) and (g), with our amendments,
require the Secretary of State when setting or amending a target range
to consider the impact of any target range on the Northern Ireland
energy market and take into account the difference in circumstances
between Northern Ireland and the rest of Great Britain.</hs_para>

Empey:</Member></B> My Lords, I welcome these amendments but want to
ask the Minister about a couple of matters. I had responsibility for
this area for three years. Long-standing availability contracts signed
many years ago constrain the flexibility of the Northern Ireland energy
sector. That is one of the issues. We have set ourselves very
challenging targets for renewable sources but still need, and will
continue to need, large amounts of availability from more traditional
generating sources.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:34:51"></hs_TimeCode> have also
been encouraging the development of interconnection with the Irish
Republic. Not only will that be a positive thing from the point of view
of reliability and reinforcement of supply, it will mean that the Irish
Republic will have a proportionately larger renewable sector than we
are likely to have in the foreseeable
future<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:35:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070277000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070277000012">There
is one technical point on which I would like the Minister to advise the
Committee, or perhaps write to us about at some stage, which has arisen
in other areas where we have national issues but powers are devolved.
Assuming that there will be a legislative consent Motion—which I
sincerely hope there will be—there is the issue of the Sewel
convention and the Government’s response to that. In
recent correspondence with the NIO on other issues, there seems to be a
tremendous adherence to it. That effectively means that this Parliament
does not wish to overrule or supersede a devolved Administration. It
would apply equally to Scotland. We need to bear in mind how that
particular issue will be dealt with if we sign up to international
obligations, which we may very well do, as we have provisions in the
Northern Ireland Act 1988 which mean that Northern Ireland must comply
with the international obligations of the United Kingdom. However, if
it is not covered by an  
<?notus-xml column=349?>international obligation, the Secretary of State here may set targets
which he or she believes are appropriate for the UK as a
whole.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070277000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070277000013">Given<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:39:35"></hs_TimeCode>
that electricity supplies are provided through the private sector, and
that there are availability contracts, I want to be assured that the
Government will not allow themselves to be hampered by a very narrow
implementation of the Sewel convention. We have to have flexibility.
This is a hugely important area for our activities. Given that the
electricity market in both Scotland and Northern Ireland is
comparatively small, one can easily see why people ignore it. However,
everybody has to do their bit and we all have to make a contribution.
Perhaps the Minister could offer those assurances in her winding up or
could write to us at a later stage. I believe that these amendments are
positive and I fully support
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:37:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070277000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070277000014"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Whitty" PimsId="4591" UID="13070277000110" xid="1139" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070277000110">Lord
Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, from these Benches, I, too, support the
amendments and much of what the noble Lord, Lord Empey, has said.
However, I have some serious queries. I have an amendment in this
group—I will not press it because I think it is superseded by
the Minister’s amendments—as it seemed to me that the
requirement to consult Northern Ireland Ministers was not sufficiently
reflected throughout the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:38:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070277000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070277000015">I
had better declare a past interest, in that last year I wrote a report
on the Northern Ireland energy sector for the Consumer Council over
there. It was a very good report and I recommend it to
everyone—unfortunately the successor to the noble Lord, Lord
Empey, did not entirely agree with it, but there we go. In the course
of that, I saw that there were some very different features in the
energy situation in Northern Ireland compared to over here. I therefore
wonder whether the position is quite as simple as this amendment
indicates. It is right that the decarbonisation target should apply to
the UK—if the Northern Ireland Ministers and Executive are happy
with it, Northern Ireland’s contribution to that can clearly be
worked out. At present, as the noble Lord, Lord Empey, said, there is a
very ambitious target for renewables in Northern Ireland—40% by
2020, which is far in advance of what we are likely to achieve in GB.
On the other hand, there is still oil-fired generating capacity in
Northern Ireland, at least partially, so it is a different situation.
It is also a very different situation at the consumer end, which is
presumably why the consumer regulations in here do not apply to
Northern Ireland. Therefore, in relation to Part 1, I am fully in
favour of adopting this
amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:39:29"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:39:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070277000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070277000016">However,
I am not entirely clear how the extent provisions in Clause 140, to
which the Minister has referred, as regards particularly Part 2, and
Part 3, will cover Northern Ireland. Because there is a different
structure of electricity supply, it is difficult to see a clear
read-across for the contracts for difference, or for that matter the
investment contract provisions, with the situation in Northern Ireland.
As the noble Lord, Lord Empey, and the Minister have said, there is a
wholesale, all-Ireland electricity market for a start, which
complicates issues. In relation to the capacity mechanism, it is also
true that availability contracts are still outstanding and have been
running for years in Northern Ireland and the Republic. In my judgment,

<?notus-xml column=350?>consumers in Northern Ireland have probably paid too much for that
capacity over the years and are continuing to do
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:40:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13070277000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070277000017">It is
difficult to see how the contracts for difference mechanism will apply
there if we have an all-Ireland market and capacity which is
differentially based in terms of existing capacity and ability to roll
on existing capacity. Obviously, future new capacity would be available
on an all-Ireland basis. Therefore, I find it difficult to
understand quite how the mechanisms for contracts for difference would
operate in Northern Ireland. I should be grateful if the
Minister could get her officials, with the agreement of her Northern
Ireland counterparts, to set out how she sees that working. For
example, we are now talking about one counterparty but we have a
different regulatory system in Ireland. I cannot really see how one
counterparty can operate in the Northern Ireland
context<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:41:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070277000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070277000018">There
are issues in relation to interconnection and contracts for difference
can be for capacity which is not in GB. You could have wind farms in
the Irish midlands or French nuclear power stations involved in the
contracts for difference. But I do not think that that is what is meant
in terms of using Part 2 to cover the Northern Ireland electricity
market. I am not against trying to apply the same principles and I am
very much in favour of the precise amendment which relates to the
decarbonisation target. However, I feel that the totality of the
position in Northern Ireland is much more complicated than simply
writing in the Bill that Part 2 extends to Northern
Ireland<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:42:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070277000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070277000019">No
doubt these things are still under discussion between London and
Belfast. I suspect that quite a lot of details have to be sorted out

the opportunity to register it, I register it now and will not repeat
it as we go through the rest of the Bill. Perhaps the Minister and her
officials could set this out clearly so that by the time we come to

we have had a case recently where the National Crime Agency has been

Ministers have said to me in correspondence that, because of the Sewel

contradiction in amending the territorial extent of a piece of

whether it went to the Republic or Northern Ireland, then to be shipped

6, 9 and 14. I begin by declaring my interests as listed in the
register, but with a small renewable energy company and a small energy
efficiency company. It would also be appropriate to start by thanking
the Minister and her team for the way in which they have made
themselves available to brief any Member of the Committee who has
approached them on the complexities of the Bill. It certainly is a
complex Bill and, indeed, that is part of the problem. The complexity
of the Bill arises from the multiplicity of its objectives, which are
to achieve decarbonisation, to achieve energy security and to do both
of those at the lowest possible
cost<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:48:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070277000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070277000032">Some
of us had the opportunity yesterday, courtesy of the noble Viscount,
Lord Ridley<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:48:52"></hs_TimeCode>, to
attend a briefing given by an investment manager on his view of the
costs and complexity of the Bill. Although I think that not everyone
agreed with everything that the briefer said, the talk was extremely
informative in the sense that it emphasised the enormous capital that
will have to be raised if the aspirations of the Government, as seen
through the climate change committee, are to be achieved over the next
40 or so years. It also emphasised the relative unattractiveness of the
UK utilities market compared with those in competitor countries and
therefore the difficulty in persuading investors to put money into
these
proposals.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070277000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070277000033">Of
course, one of the problems is that the proposed way forward cannot be
regarded as the cheapest way forward. In fact, it is relatively
expensive by comparison with ways forward that do not decarbonise and
which pay much less attention to security of supply. Given that
investments in generation are long-term investments, for 30, 40 or even
50 years, investors have to be absolutely clear that the Government are
of firm
intent.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070277000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070277000034">It was
around 50 years ago that the late Lord Franks, in describing
the inability of Oxford University to reform itself internally,
introduced the expression “infirmity of purpose”, which
occurred frequently throughout his reports. Fundamentally, the concerns
of the investment community are that there may be a degree of infirmity
of purpose between this Government and their successor Governments.
Given the overall difficulty of investing in UK utilities, for the
reasons that I have just outlined, the least we can do is to do
everything possible to indicate that not only the present Government
but, as far as possible, across parties, that subsequent Governments
will support this approach.</hs_para>

the reason for putting forward this group of amendments. Because of the
drafting of the Bill, they may appear a little complicated, but there
are really only a couple of words that are important: the substitution
of “must” for “may” in terms of the
obligations of Ministers to declare a target range; and the insertion
of the dates 2030 and 2014.</hs_para>

inserting 2030 is that, although in one sense it is arbitrary, it is an
extremely important date in the Government’s decarbonisation
plans: if the 2050 target is to be achieved, there has to be really
very substantial decarbonisation of electricity generation by 2030
because the second phase of achieving the 2050 target is pervasive
electrification of the rest of the energy economy. Unless you have
decarbonised your electricity generation before that, the second phase
makes no sense. This is part of the reason for 2030 but it is also a
matter of emphasising the Government’s firmity of
purpose.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070277000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070277000037">The
reason for inserting 2014 relates, at least in part, to a second
objective, which comes from Brussels and has to do with the proportion
of renewables that we need to have in our generation by 2020. To
digress for a moment, last week I spent several days reverting to my
roots at an energy professionals’ conference in Edinburgh.
Although shale gas was a very important topic of conversation
there—probably the most important—a secondary topic of
conversation was the failure of Governments to understand how long
things take, to understand the timescales of change. One constructor
said to me, “It’s fine. We can build a power station in
three years, or put up wind turbines very quickly, provided we have all
the components ready”. He said that the Government seemed not to
understand the importance of the supply chain. An important development
that may appear quick to implement may be delayed for several years if
key components such as bearings are not available in the necessary
timescale. The message was that if the 2020 target is to be achieved,
it is extremely important that that should be made clear now, as soon
as possible, so that those who will be involved in achieving it can
start placing orders and can take their place in the queue for
components to get the thing going. Two years’ delay would be
extremely
important<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:55:59"></hs_TimeCode>. My
second point is that if one leaves this to the last few years of the
decade, there simply will not be enough civil engineering capacity to
build the requisite generating capacity, whatever its character, in
time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:56:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070277000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070277000038">Clearly
there are broader questions of industrial competitiveness, which
certainly have bothered me a lot. However, I will not touch on them now
because amendments that we will debate later will provide a better
opportunity to discuss them. So in conclusion, the only important point
is that we cannot take investment in our energy sector for granted. It
will be
difficult<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:59:32"></hs_TimeCode>, and
we have to do everything we can to strengthen investor confidence. The
amendments in this group do nothing other than strengthen that
confidence, and there is no significant downside, given that the
information that will be necessary for the Government to meet these
commitments will be available to them by December this year. I beg to

Hanworth:</Member></B> My Lords, I strongly support the amendments
tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh. Amendments 2 and 6 are of prime
importance. The Bill prevents the Secretary of State setting a carbon
intensity target for the electricity industry before 2016, which is
when the UK’s fifth carbon budget is due to be set. It states
that the Secretary of State may set a 
<?notus-xml column=354?>target but does not compel him to do so. If he were to set a target, the
earliest date from which the target range would be effective would be
2030. The amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, would
compel the Secretary of State to set a target by 1 April
2014<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T15:58:23"></hs_TimeCode>. Here, we
are revisiting territory that has already been fought over on Report in
the House of Commons. An amendment with the same intentions and similar
wording to the one we are considering was proposed by a cross-party
alliance consisting of a Conservative ex-Minister, Tim Yeo, and the
Labour MP Barry Gardiner. The outcome, after a long debate, was that
the amendment was disagreed by 290 votes to 267. However, for the
coalition it was a whipped vote, and it is clear that numerous Liberal
Democrats, and quite a few Conservatives, defied the whip by voting in
favour of the amendment. We may surmise, therefore, that a majority was
in favour of the amendment, but that the expression of their opinions
was limited by the imposition of the whip. One might wonder why the
leaders of the Liberal Democrats agreed to the imposition of the whip.
We must assume that it was a matter of political expediency, and that a
quid pro quo was on offer.</hs_para>

There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:00:54"></hs_TimeCode> are strong
reasons why this country and other industrialised countries should seek
to staunch emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. The
fear of global warming led the independent Committee on Climate Change
to recommend the target of an 80% reduction in greenhouse gases by
2050. The carbon budgets of the Climate Change Act 2008 intended to
help achieve this objective. Scientific opinion now tends to regard the
anxieties that gave rise to the Act as seriously understated. For those
who would open their eyes to the facts, the floods, firestorms,
hurricanes and heat waves that are presently afflicting the world are
early harbingers of far worse to come.</hs_para>

climate change sceptics who participated in the Commons debates
expressed the opinion that by adhering to its decarbonisation targets
Britain would be at a disadvantage relative to its industrial
competitors, who would not be bearing such a burden. This contention
embodies two fallacies. First, it is untrue that other countries are
ignoring the hazards and that they are failing to impose constraints on
their emissions of greenhouse gases. It remains true nevertheless that
such action as has been taken is quite inadequate to avert the danger.
The second fallacy is that there is a disadvantage in being ahead of
the pack in adopting alternative means of energy generation of limited
emissions. The reverse is probably true and there should be a
considerable advantage in developing energy supplies that are
independent of fossil fuels.</hs_para>

of the hazards of fossil fuels that have a finite supply, is a tendency

has been happening to the price of gas, with the effect that

electricity utilities have been relying more heavily than hitherto on
coal-fired power stations. This hazard could be avoided by using a
combination of wind power and nuclear power for generating electricity.
The intermittence of the first source and the inflexibility of the
second source could be overcome by using the capacity available in
slack times to produce hydrogen fuel that could be used to power
generators to meet peak demand.</hs_para>

fracturing the ground. It is not certain that we could get at the gas,
and if it were to be exploited to a significant extent, we would be in
danger of breaking our commitment to staunch emissions of carbon
dioxide. In addition, 40 years is a limited duration in this context,
and we should be looking towards far more distant horizons. So for all

Jenkin of Roding:</Member></B> My Lords, I have listened to the two
speeches on this with great interest. It is with some anxiety that I
confess to differing from the view of the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh. The
intention is, as both speakers have said, to oblige the Government to
declare the decarbonisation target for 2030 next year. In quarrelling
with the proposals in this amendment, I make it clear that I entirely
accept the scientific evidence on dealing with the long-term emissions
of greenhouse gases. The evidence is overwhelming, it is accepted by
the vast majority of scientists and one has to realise that it is part
of the background of what we are
considering<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:05:18"></hs_TimeCode>. I
wish that some of those who were putting it forward were a little more
honest about the areas of uncertainty that still exist; nevertheless
the evidence of the growing concentration of greenhouse gases in the
atmosphere is
compelling<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:05:36"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:09:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070277000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070277000047">I
believe that the origin of the proposal embodied in this amendment is a
letter last February from the chairman of the climate change committee,
the noble Lord, Lord Deben, to the Secretary of State, Ed
Davey. It is a complicated letter which I do not propose to read. I
would say only that the noble Lord, Lord Deben, 
<?notus-xml column=356?>was at one time my Parliamentary Private Secretary, and I am proud to
see him rise to such dizzy heights. However, he made the same case as
the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh: that to fix the level would give greater
certainty to investors. I think that many of my colleagues know that I
do my best to keep in touch with a large numbers of the players in the
energy field—I call it cultivating my sources. It often gives
one a more accurate view of the likely implications of carrying through
this policy, because many of these players are among those who will
actually have to do it. Only one group has approached me on this
matter: the representative body, RenewableUK. All I can say is: I
understand why, but they would, wouldn’t they? None of the
others has made any reference to this issue, and I think the argument
about giving greater certainty to investors is being
overplayed.</hs_para>

is clear that all parties, with some notable exceptions in this Grand
Committee, have accepted the case for long-term decarbonisation in
order to avoid the hazards of climate change. However, it should be
possible to hold to that, and to convince the players of that, without
necessarily going to this rather damaging intermediate step. The noble
Lord, Lord Oxburgh, referred to the three objectives—and I was
present at the lecture which he attended last night—of security,
carbon reduction and affordability. In the brief I received from the
Energy Networks Association, it was called the “energy
trilemma”, a phrase I like. It is the Government’s job to
try to balance those three objectives, because it is becoming clear
that they cannot all be achieved, whatever the Secretary of State may
have said in his press release last
week<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:08:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070277000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070277000049">For
my part, the question of security of supply has to take top place. At
the moment, the burden of all these things is falling primarily on
consumers. As we were told last night, the purpose of much of the
policy in this Bill, and of the Government’s policy generally,
is to shift the risk from producers to consumers, and one is seeing the
result in electricity bills. The Government’s Fuel Poverty
Advisory Group, with which I have been in touch, estimates that the
social and environmental costs per customer will rise from about
£90 per annum to £220 per annum by 2020. If one takes
that into account with other energy costs facing households, I submit
that this is quite early on becoming quite unsustainable. The burden
falling on customers really cannot be tolerated. I notice that the
noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, in an article in <I>House
Magazine</I><I>,</I><I> </I>made much the same point and was surprised
that elements of the coalition seemed prepared to go along with it. I
understand the point that he is
making<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:10:29"></hs_TimeCode>. However,
not only domestic customers, businesses are increasingly complaining
about being hit by rising costs of energy for industrial and commercial

whether the Government have got the balance wrong. Is balancing out
these three objectives sustainable? As I have said, my top priority is
energy security, which is often expressed in the phrase,
“keeping the lights on”. But it is far more than that. We
now live in a civilisation that has become almost wholly dependent on
electricity for almost everything that goes on. The consequences of any
significant interruption of supply create enormous hazards for every
part of the community, which, to my 
<?notus-xml column=357?>mind, has to be avoided. We really must have a secure and dependable
electricity supply. In passing, one has to note that last week’s

is not the occasion to explore the reasons for that or how it has come
to pass but simply to note the fact. I was the Minister for Energy in
1974 when the country faced widespread disconnections, not for want of
capacity but because of industrial action. Whatever the reason, I have
to tell my colleagues that it caused acute embarrassment to the
authorities, of which I suppose I was one, and resulted in the loss of
the general election that immediately
followed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:12:48"></hs_TimeCode>. We

the rising burdens for consumers are, as I believe, becoming
increasingly unsustainable, and if we fail to give adequate priority to
ensuring security, something will give. To my mind, in the present
circumstances and, I emphasise, in the short term—not as part of
a long-term policy—what must give is the current, very rapid and
expensive priority accorded to fighting climate change. If we insist on
setting ourselves ever-higher carbon reduction targets to be fixed by
law for many years ahead, are we not simply locking ourselves into the
present unsustainable balance?</hs_para>

change. But we face the choice now either to require, as the amendment
proposes, the Government to fix the decarbonisation target for
17 years ahead or, as the Bill stands, to allow Ministers to
set the target three years from now after the climate change committee
has given advice on the fifth carbon target and in the light of the
circumstances at the time. The Government must be allowed the
flexibility to do that.

based on what seem to me to be all sorts of optimistic assumptions
about the pace at which we will be able to develop energy-producing
industries. We should also take into account the cost to consumers. It
is not enough to say, as some do, that energy bills will be lower than
they otherwise would be without the Government’s policy. The

very clearly the logic of the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin.
He seemed at times to be saying that he was in favour of the
decarbonisation target and at other moments that the target placed
intolerable burdens on the economy. Of course a balance has to be
struck, but he did not produce any arguments at all to suggest that, if
a decision is simply postponed, we will be better able to get the
balance
right.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070277000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070277000060">I was
particularly surprised that the noble Lord said that of course it is
important to give investors certainty but that that argument had been
overused. However, he did not deny the validity of the argument. He
then said that there was a contradiction between the need to provide
investor certainty, the need to provide security of supply and the need
to protect consumers’ interests. There is no contradiction at
all. It is very much the opposite way around. If one reduces the
uncertainty to investors, one reduces the cost of capital and one will
see more investment projects approved. One will therefore have greater
capacity and greater security of
supply.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070277000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070277000061">Equally,
if we have greater capacity because there is less uncertainty and
because the cost of capital is lower, we will have lower prices.
Therefore, consumer interests will be better preserved. Far from there
being a contradiction between these considerations, it is extremely
important for consumer interests and security of supply that we provide
the maximum degree of investor
certainty.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070277000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070277000062">Here,
I am mystified by what game the Government are playing. The purpose of
the Bill, as presented in public up to now, is to provide a framework
for investors, and the maximum degree of investor certainty. If they
want to do that—it is of course a very sensible purpose to have
in mind—why did they introduce into the Bill elements of
gratuitous uncertainty that are 
<?notus-xml column=359?>being addressed by the amendments before us? Why say in one subsection
that the Secretary of State must ensure that any decarbonisation target
is respected, and in the very next subsection place doubt on whether or
not there even will be a decarbonisation target, saying
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13070277000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070277000099">“the

with regard to the dates, why say that a decarbonisation target may not
be set for 2030, leaving open the possibility that there would not be a
decarbonisation target even as late as that? Under this Bill, a
decarbonisation target cannot be set before 2030 but it does not have
to be set by 2030. Again, that is a deficiency that is remedied by the
amendments before us. What is the purpose of this Bill if it is not to
maximise, within the range of all reasonable practicality, clarity and
certainty for investors? If the Government are intending to do that,
why in the name of heaven have they gratuitously introduced these

issue of whether the decarbonisation target should be set for 2014 or
2016 is not quite so important. If that amendment is pressed, I shall
probably vote for it, but there could be arguments for waiting until
2016, partly to get the benefit of the advice of the Committee on
Climate Change but more especially because there may be a chance of
getting EU agreement on a decarbonisation target by that point. It
would not be sensible to legislate for a precise figure before we knew
whether or not there was a real prospect of getting such agreement,

it is very important that there is now a decarbonisation section of

important shift. It sends out a very powerful message to the industry
and those who are concerned about climate change that the United
Kingdom is not only concerned about this issue but wants to be leading
the argument in favour of decarbonisation and
decarbonisation targets. It was a very considerable success for the new

the idea that the Labour Party would ever play any of these devilish

not give flexibility to the Secretary of State? I suspect that it is

in the media about how difficult the negotiation has been. In fact, the

this area, therefore, it is clear to me that some sort of compromise

Davies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T16:27:18"></hs_TimeCode>,
correctly pointed out that that is not the most concerning aspect, but
there is also the fact that the whole of the first part of Bill, which
is on decarbonisation, effectively becomes optional. That is the
greatest concern that I have as a Liberal Democrat. Looking at the
negotiations and wondering about how these compromises were reached, I
am left hanging on to the belief that this important decarbonisation

reasons, to do with the European Union and the report from the

is what industry is looking for. I was very influenced by the comments
of the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, at Second Reading. He was quite right in
what he said about industry in the United Kingdom. I think that
ScottishPower, SSE and a number of companies that are based here would
be relatively relaxed about the date being fixed in 2016. However,
overseas investors such as Gamesa, Siemens, Mitsubishi and Samsung
which are making commitments to this country, are looking all the time
at how this is playing out in the media. They are getting briefings and
reports back and are looking at what the renewable sector, the
Government and parliamentarians are saying. This issue now has a very
high profile. I go out of my way to explain that the decarbonisation
target is not some totemic issue that is absolutely central to the
Energy Bill. It was bought in at the initiative of the Secretary of
State to try to strengthen the Bill. It can be a very important part of
the Bill but I do not think that it should be used as some sort of
battering ram to undermine its foundations which relate to the
contracts for difference, the balancing payments and so on. The
important message that we have to get out to the industry not only in
the UK but throughout the world is that we are serious about moving
forward the renewables sector, we want to move to this new system as

do not think that anybody felt that the ROC system was perfect.
However, it worked and delivered a lot of expansion of the renewables
sector in this country. The system changed over time. For example,
multiple ROCs were introduced and were very important in encouraging
the offshore sector, not only offshore wind but offshore tidal and
wave, the development of which is strongly supported by a lot of people
in this country. However, the imperfections of the ROC regime were
clear to many. Arguably, it put too much subsidy too easily into the
hands of companies that did not necessarily need the full ROC support,
so it was at times wasteful of taxpayers’ money or of
consumers’ money. I think a lot of people agree that the new
system which has been put in place with the contracts for difference is

strong reservations about the Bill but on this issue I side with the
Government. The agenda to which we are working had its genesis 10 to 15
years ago when continued growth in the world seemed secure, real
incomes were rising, global temperatures were tracking quite closely
the rise of CO<Sub>2</Sub>, which is not the case today, when there was
optimism about an international agreement, public money to fund the
expansion of renewables was plentiful and peak oil was pretty much a
received wisdom. None of that is true today. Indeed, the world is still
in a state of flux. Therefore, a moratorium on specifying new
commitments seems a sensible
response.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070277000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070277000077">The

as quickly as possible, and get plant of one sort or another up and
working before we have serious interruptions, given that we are closing
other plants at a great rate for all sorts of reasons, not least to do
with EU directives. The noble Lord said clearly that if we put this
additional target definitely in place by 2014, rather than perhaps in
place later, we will overcome infirmity of purpose. I can only offer my
experience. It may sound cynical, but I have been in and out of

some of the ministries in which I served—I hope that this does

financiers know perfectly well that if they put too much faith in
targets, they will be wrong-footed. What they should watch of course is
technology. I advise both the Committee and the Government to do as
much as they can to put their faith in technology and to back every
kind of technological advance, because technology rather than targets
will deliver the objectives that most of us want, including
decarbonisation, affordability, security of supply and so

trend, which is to rush at decarbonisation much too fast. It is all
question of pace and politics. While I am as anxious as the next man to
see a greener, cleaner world, and while I accept the horrors of global
warming, whether or not their cause is scientifically established, the
rush and overambition of the Committee on Climate Change, of the
recommendations and of the zealots will upset our targets and ensure
that we do not get the decarbonisation that we need. It is going to
distort decisions and undermine the green cause. It will lead us to
absurd situations towards which we are rapidly heading now, where we
are actually burning more coal and not less, the opposite of what we
want, and where we are getting, as my noble friend Lord Jenkin has
rightly said, eye-watering price increases and minimum prices fixed for
years ahead to encourage renewables. So much for lower
prices—there are not going to be lower prices. Households are
now paying average prices twice as high as they were paying five years
ago, and some forecasts—perhaps too gloomy—are saying
they will be paying two or three times as much as that by the

at my bill, and I do not know whether the noble Baroness has looked at
hers recently, and find that 20% stuck on the bill as a result of green

rising, but spot prices, and indeed some contracts around the world,
have been falling. The noble Baroness knows well that in the United
States, for very special reasons which may become global reasons, the
price of gas is about a quarter of what is here. So I do not agree with

Howell of Guildford:</Member></B> Obviously the bulk of a market price
is the price at which gas is purchased: either contract or spot.
However, if the noble Baroness is asking me to agree with the
proposition that gas prices are now, or will be be, the driving force
in raising prices, and that we should ignore the additional pace at
which extra costs are placed on the consumer, I am afraid I cannot. The
consumer is paying more. Energy prices in this country—I do not
want to wander off the amendment too far—are very high, almost
as high as in Germany. This is not good for our industry, and the pace
at which people can be asked—it is a question of pace, not
principle—to bear additional costs, particularly poor families,
has to be handled with great care and calibration by policy
makers.</hs_para>

over-ambition and more speedy decisions which distort incentives.
Furthermore, technology is changing all the time, and all kinds of
developments can take place which wrongfoot those who have established
targets for years ahead. I know about that because in the 1970s and
1980s I was the Energy Secretary, and we launched a huge programme
looking 50 years ahead for replacing our nuclear fleet, which, if we
had done it, would have saved a lot of problems today. Although we
announced that we were going to have nine new pressurised water
reactors by 1990, we only actually built one. Today, those reactors
would have been built and would be working excellently, producing
low-carbon electricity. Alas, that did not happen.</hs_para>

if the aim of this amendment is to bring greater firmity of purpose,
and to reduce infirmity of purpose, it is not going to succeed. The aim
of the Bill is to get more investment and to get the investors putting
their money into new machinery, whether it is renewable, nuclear or gas
turbines. That investment is not coming forward. It is not happening,
and if people say it is about to happen, I have to ask—and this
is where I am 
<?notus-xml column=365?>going to sound disloyal to the Government—why are Ministers
rushing around talking about de-mothballing existing plant to fill
likely gaps in our power supply in the next few years? Why is the
National Grid talking about interruptible contracts? These are very
frightening things. These are not going to increase certainty; they are
vastly decreasing certainty. The oil companies and energy companies
that come to me are not at all impressed by this Bill. They do not
believe that it will create the investment certainty they need and they
wonder when the politicians are going to show more finesse and care,
and when the proponents of green energy, of which I am certainly one,
are going to show more sense of pace in pushing forward these
issues.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13070277000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070277000089">If we

CO<Sub>2</Sub> than other countries that avoid all these sorts of
targets, such as the United States, which has a brilliant performance
on CO<Sub>2</Sub>. We are going to see less security, less
affordability and more damage to our country, its competitiveness and,

O'Neill of Clackmannan:</Member></B> My Lords, in his meandering tour
d’horizon, the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, said that the only
approach he had had in support of this amendment was from the
renewables lobby. I have certain misgivings about renewables, as I
stated at Second Reading, but there is a degree of oversimplicity in
the approach that a number of people have taken towards this amendment.
The blanket opposition to almost all kinds of targets that we have just
heard from the noble Lord, Lord Howell, is symptomatic of this
condition.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070297000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070297000002">This
amendment does not suggest that the target will require nuclear power
stations to be built tomorrow. Some of us would like them to be built
today—yesterday, in fact—but that is not a possibility.
But there are a number of small and medium-sized projects, about which
there is probably greater investor uncertainty because of their size
and disparate character, which would take encouragement and reassurance
from amendments of this kind. Rather than the somewhat cautious
approach of the noble Lord, Lord Stephen, I think that the
dates suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, are more
realistic.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070297000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070297000003">We
are grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Stephen, for his insight into how
coalitions work. Certainly, as far as decarbonisation is concerned, it
seems that the bus has set off on the way to Damascus. What some of us
want is for it to arrive there. One of the sure signs that it would be
at least within the environs of that city would be if we were to get
acceptance of this amendment and an early possible date. There are
dangers in targets at times but on this occasion this is a
nudge—not a massive shove—in the right direction. It
would be a 
<?notus-xml column=366?>very significant amendment if it were carried on Report—I know
that none of these amendments is going to be pushed to a vote at this

summary, we are not considering all forms of generation and all
projects as being triggered by an amendment of this kind. We are saying
that a number of small-scale investments would be given a significant
push if there were to be appropriate targets within a reasonable
timescale. These amendments meet both those objectives. We could remove
a degree of uncertainty. I do not think that we are going to get
security of supply from these targets today, or a massive degree of
decarbonisation, but we will get some. If we get a bit more security of
supply, perhaps we will get a degree of
affordability.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070297000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070297000005">A
lot of pious nonsense is spoken about affordability and security of
supply. For the fuel poor, there is no security of supply because they
cannot afford to pay for it. They self-disconnect and do not use
it—they have to make very difficult choices. We need far more
radical measures than this modest amendment to try to secure objectives
of that character. However, for the purposes of the moment, this is an
appropriate and sensible amendment to start the passage of the Bill in
this House. If we were to get a broad spread of consensus at this
stage, we could hopefully look to going into the Chamber and securing
the kind of majority that a modest amendment of this character merits

deserves.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070297000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070297000006"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Deben" PimsId="5754" UID="13070297000156" xid="2031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070297000156">Lord
Deben:</Member></B> My Lords, it gives me some concern to disagree with
both my former Secretary of State—for whom I was a loyal and, I
hope, reasonably efficient PPS—and my former Permanent
Secretary, both of whom have spoken against this amendment. I always
find these discussions difficult, because people move to extremes, and
I hope that your Lordships will not mind me suggesting that there have
been some examples of that today. The reason why the climate change
committee advised that there should be such an interim target is that,
by law, we are charged with ensuring that we meet the statutory target
of reducing our emissions by 80% from 1990 by 2050. That is a statutory
provision.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070297000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070297000007">At
the moment, we face a situation in which business has certainty up to
2020 and has it again in 2050. I declare an interest as a chairman of
the climate change committee and, although I do not have business
interests in the areas that we are talking about, I have had them in
the past. The reality is that business needs to feel that there is a
continuing mood, so that if it invests now it will be secure at least
from government vacillation. No business can be assured of everything
else—all kinds of things can happen in these
circumstances—but the one thing that makes this very difficult
is the natural fact of government intervention. My noble friend talked
about the interventionist nature of the Bill. The real problem with the
subject that we are dealing with is that it is necessary to have some
intervention. The argument is in large part about how
much.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070297000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070297000008">As to
whether industry needs this, we had the powerful suggestion from my
noble friend Lord Jenkin that industry did not want it except for the
renewables. I have a list here of 50 major companies, including 
<?notus-xml column=367?>Scottish and Southern, EDF, Alstom, Doosan, Mitsubishi, Siemens—I
could go on—all of which have specifically asked for this
because they are concerned not only about their own investment but
about the supply chain. We are pressing this not because of climate
change but in order to get the benefit of what the UK is doing because
of climate change. If you do not do this, all the money that we are
going to spend—£7.5 billion—between now
and 2020 in order to begin the decarbonisation of our electricity
supply is imperilled, in the sense that the businesses that should grow
and produce will not come here if they feel that there is no certainty
beyond that. My noble friend Lord Jenkin said that it was all very
difficult and we ought to put it off. My problem with that is that
climate change does not wait until we find it convenient to meet the
problems. Every year we put it off, the cost is greater and the problem
is bigger. We have to take that into account when making these
decisions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070297000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070297000009">We
also have to recognise a serious new factor, which is the reverse of
what used to be true. It used to be thought that Britain was in the
vanguard. We had this wonderful Bill and we were doing all this, and
other people were not. Anyone who looks at the GLOBE International
report, produced with the London School of Economics—and I
declare an interest as the president of GLOBE—will see that over
the last year some 30 countries are now embarking on serious investment
in this area. So we are now competing with other countries that are
also seeking this investment.</hs_para>

British Government is that, however much they talk about these issues,
around these tables today are others who keep on saying, “Well,
it is not going to be like that”. Every newspaper throughout the

trouble with that is that people will go to countries to invest where
that is not the case and where Governments have given long-term
assurances. We need therefore to take this fact seriously for the
British economy and for the green jobs that we have sought to create.
This is why I think that the Government have been mistaken in doing
this and why I have some sympathy with this proposal, although of

we have the question of the cost to the consumer. When the newspapers
see a rapidly rising cost of energy, they do two things. First, they

the moment from our green measures is £60 a year. It will rise
to £100 a year in 2020. If we do what is suggested and set a
carbon-intensity target, the bills for the average consumer—as
far as we can do this 
<?notus-xml column=368?>work; we have to rely on the best evidence that we have—will
between 2020 and 2030 have risen by £20 more than they would
have done. After that, of course, because electricity will have been
decarbonised, private energy costs will fall significantly.</hs_para>

in some sort of proportion, rather than blaming all the rises on the
fact that we have what is actually a limited cost. That cost is, in my
view, a cost of insurance. I am sorry to repeat it—I have said
it before because I think it is important—but there is not a
Member of your Lordships’ House who does not insure his home
against fire. Yet there is a 99.8% chance of that house not burning
down. That insurance costs £140 a year. That is more than twice
what we are charging as a nation for people to protect themselves in
the future.</hs_para>

we are talking about is sensible and it insures us against three
things: it insures us against dangerous climate change; it helps to
ensure our energy sovereignty; and it insures us against rising gas
prices. Some people believe that gas prices will not rise. The
international energy body certainly thinks that they will rise. I
certainly would not like to bet my future, or my children’s
future, on the idea that gas prices are going to fall. That does not
seem sensible to me. Replacing our present dependency with a portfolio
of mechanisms by which we produce our energy is an essential insurance
against that, because energy is so crucial, as my noble friend Lord
Jenkin has

Secretary of State for Energy said that he had had a great plan for
nuclear power, and what a great thing it would have been if it had gone

to face realities, needs and long-term decisions. He is now asking us,
on the basis of that experience, to repeat the mistake. He is asking us

The danger of targets such as the one proposed now is that they distort
investment decisions. It is not that they prevent all kinds of
investment but that they distort investment decisions through their
urgency and through their aim at a particular target, in ways that lead
to counterproductive results. The results now before us are a growing
hostility among the public to the higher prices that they have to 
<?notus-xml column=369?>pay, a feeling that there is redistribution from the poor to the rich,
which is not at all welcome, and difficulties about deciding what
strike price to give for our replacement fleet of nuclear power

experience in the 1970s and 1980s was that the investment decisions
were all askew. They were not clear at all. The long-term

of alternative views and distortions. The same distortions will result
from this target. That is all I am

This is a non-prescriptive concept, of which I approve. It does not say
that we have to use this, that or the other. It is a portfolio
approach. I still think that the parallel is very clear. If we had been
able to stick to our proposition, we would be in a better place today

come back to my first point. The reason we believe that there should be
an interim carbon-intensity target is that it is necessary if we are to
reach our statutory requirement in 2050. It is necessary for the United
Kingdom plc because it gives certainty to people about the parameters
within which they will work. If we do not do it, all the noise around
what the Government are doing, and the determination to put off to
beyond the next election the carbon-intensity target that is now
admitted by the Bill, will do a great deal of harm. It will mean that
the supply chain that could come to this country will not come and that
the jobs and prosperity that should come from our far-sighted decisions
will not be gained and earned. We will do very much better to take the
advice that will lead to a serious system in Britain that will make us

of the huge upfront capital costs of renewable energy schemes, where,

their plant will not produce up to the cliff-edge that is 2020 and then
have to sit while the UK Government adopt one of the options in last

people might ask—as the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, did—who
could doubt the UK’s commitment to a decarbonisation agenda? It
is a rational certainty. After all, our Climate Change Act gives us the
tightest emissions reduction target on the planet for 2050. After all,
the Government’s own sponsored impact assessment shows that a 50
gram target could have the benefit, among other things, of reducing
consumer bills between 2016 and 2030, depending on international gas
prices. After all, the Government have virtually admitted that the
whole point of this part of the Bill is to bring in a target in 2016,
so all we are doing here is arguing about a two-year pause—what
possible difference could that make?</hs_para>

rational certainty, yet 2016 brings us beyond the next election and who
knows who will be in charge then? As has already been said, this Bill
does not quite commit the Government to setting a target in 2016, only
some time possibly after 2016. Therefore, Amendment 7, in the name of

the light of all this rational certainty, what is preventing the

still be around well into the 2040s, pumping out 300 grams
of CO<Sub>2</Sub> for every kilowatt hour produced? Or is it the
possibility of more dramatic changes in the energy market? No one can
deny that in the United States shale gas was a revolution in terms of
the price of power there, and the rest of the world is looking to see
whether it can join the club, as it were, including the United Kingdom.

noble Lords who attended a very interesting talk last night by Peter
Atherton, an investment analyst, have made reference to it. I have
heard similar talks 
<?notus-xml column=371?>before. When I sat on Sub-Committee D, we looked at the European power
sector. We were informed, in much the same language, that it was going
to be very hard to produce the power and the investment. Indeed, there
has been such a lack of political leadership on the continent, which I
think is fairly important, that the continental power companies’
shareholdings have sunk almost out of sight and very little investment
is happening in that sector. It has not happened yet in this country
but the question of political leadership is important

essence of Peter Atherton’s message was that a 50 gram target by
2030 would cost far too much and be impossible to deliver in the
current UK and EU financial markets. That is quite apart from the
extreme difficulty of building the physical structures needed to
deliver a 50 gram target on time. Clearly, the Government and the
climate change committee should listen to him and others on the
practical difficulties and expense for consumers of delivering a
50-gram-per-kilowatt-hour target by 2030. He convinced me that perhaps
a 50-gram target by 2030 was a step too far but he did not convince me
that we do not need a target at all. It could be that 75 grams or 100
grams would be enough to convince the investors that their investment
in the supply chain would be
safe<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T17:12:17"></hs_TimeCode>. The point
is that if we believe in climate change and the need to act sooner
rather than later—it appears that all political parties in this

Government say that they are waiting for the fifth carbon budget before
they commit, but I do not find that a very convincing excuse. Such a
budget applies to the wider economy and is not set to specific. I
realise that the power sector is responsible for some 27% of the
nation’s carbon emissions. Therefore, it could not expect to
escape totally untouched by such a carbon budget but there is unlikely
to be the total clarity within these general targets to provide the
certainty for investors in the power sector.</hs_para>

conclusion, it would appear that over the past 200 years our society
has developed a form of lock-in to fossil fuels and fossil-fuel power.
We have got better and better at extracting these fuels, and better and
better at using them. They have become cheap, convenient and reliable.
But now we realise that we have to make a step change, which will not
be easy—indeed, it is proving to be very difficult—as a
nation or even as a species, to getting better and better at deploying
and harnessing non-fossil technologies. I believe that over time we can
learn to make renewable technologies also cheap, convenient and
reliable. But for that to happen, and for us to create this whole new
economy and these new jobs, we need commitment from our Government.
These amendments give our Government the opportunity to take that
lead.</hs_para> <hs_time UID="13070297000150" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070297000150">5.15

to my noble friend Lord Jenkin, who for once was on the same side of
the fence as me, because I do not think that the amendment is
appropriate, but perhaps for slightly different reasons than have been
mentioned. I wholly support the target in the Climate Change Act. We
already have a basket of technologies which, if put in place, would
enable us to hit that target. Perhaps the necessary initiative and
determination on the part of some of the participants in the debate are
not there but the technologies already exist. What I do not know, of
course, is what the unknown unknowns are, to borrow a phrase from a
rather notable
American<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T17:19:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070297000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070297000035">I
want to talk about a known unknown which has changed the nature of the
game since the Climate Change Act was passed, and that, of course, is
shale gas. I am well aware that shale gas emits carbon dioxide if you
use it to generate electricity, but one of the things that has been
going on in the background in this country for a very long time is
consideration of the use of carbon capture and storage with the
intention, if possible, of trying to keep the coal business in being.
However, the fact of the matter is that the emissions from a coal-fired
power station are so appalling that the cost of CCS is extremely high,
the energy penalty is also extremely high and it is not going to work.
The cost of cleaning up the emissions from a gas-fired turbine,
however, is much less because the emissions themselves are cleaner, the
cost of emissions per unit of electricity is already that much cheaper
and you can get those emissions down virtually to zero. Therefore, if
we had those supplies—that is the big question to which we do
not know the answer—we would have what I choose to call a very
useful potential interim technology. I put it no higher than that.
Setting short-term targets now could lead us into a situation whereby
we are forced to invest in high-cost technologies in order to meet
these short-term targets. I do not think that is
wise<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T17:17:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070297000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070297000036">We
are not dealing just with investor confidence here. It strikes me that
the energy suppliers are playing a very good game of poker with us at
the moment, which I think we should resist. We also have to deal with
customer confidence. The difficulty we have with the whole question of
shale gas is that we do not know yet whether or not we have it, can
extract it and use it. To force a decision on the assumption that it is
not there, because that is where we started the debate, would be
totally wrong. We should not rule out possibilities. Another reason why
I am against short-term targets is that we also have to face the
possibility that there may be other game-changers out there that we do
not know about. We shall have to be able to take them into account as
we go along, so my personal prejudice is for keeping things as
uncontrolled as possible for as long as possible, bearing in mind the
absolute necessity of meeting the target in the Climate Change Act,
which, as I say, is capable of being met if we have the political
determination to do it.</hs_para>

Ridley:</Member></B> My Lords, in the United States, shale gas has
displaced coal. I should, by the way, declare my interest in coal even
though, once again, I am speaking against it and in favour of its
greatest competitor, gas. There has been a massive displacement of coal
by shale gas, which brings me on to the next point. The effect of
displacing coal with shale gas in the United States has been to cause
the fastest drop in CO<Sub>2</Sub><Sub> </Sub>emissions of any western
country. They are down to the levels they were at 30 years ago and down
to the per capita levels they were at 50 years ago. These are
extraordinary achievements and suggest that we have, in shale gas, a
technology for short-term reduction in carbon dioxide
emissions—not all the way down to 50 grams or
anything like that but a good chunk of the way—that could be
achieved and combined with affordability. The counterfactual to
building a huge amount of offshore wind capacity and other industries
is to allow the development of gas in this country. We know that the
numbers would be much lower in terms of the cost to the
consumer—it would be much more 
<?notus-xml column=374?>feasible and much more affordable. To throw away the flexibility of

came out last week for the amount of shale gas under the UK is far
higher than was assumed when his report was written? I went to talk to
Cuadrilla at one point last year. I said that the 200 trillion cubic
feet that they were talking about under Lancashire was being ridiculed
as a very high number and asked whether they stood by it. They said,
“Privately, we think it is much higher. It is about 300 trillion
cubic feet but we dare not say so because people will not take that
seriously”. Then an independent consultant, Nick Grealy, said
700 trillion cubic feet and everybody laughed at it. Now, the British
Geological Survey has said there is 1,300 trillion cubic feet. This is
the largest find of shale gas ever on the planet.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T17:24:29"></hs_TimeCode> shale rock

There was a flock of wild turkeys running across the road on the way to

come out of a small area when you are drilling for shale gas. The
answer is that about 25 acres of well pad in Pennsylvania can produce

I may turn briefly to climate change. This is not the time to re-fight
the climate change debate, but others have brought it up.
Given that shale gas offers the possibility of a slower rate of
decarbonisation—not to as low a level of target as we are
talking about—we need to retain the flexibility of that and to
take into account where the climate change science has shifted to. It
is simply not the case that the science has become more alarming in the
past few years. There has been a series of studies of climate
sensitivity in recent years by Otto et al., Aldrin et al., Ring and
Searchinger and 
<?notus-xml column=375?>many others. The biggest of those, the Otto et al. study, which had 14
leading authors, two of whom are co-ordinating lead authors of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, concluded that transient
climate sensitivity—that is, the number that we are likely to
reach in about 50 years—is about half of what we thought it was.
It is about 1.3 degrees centigrade, of which we have had nearly half
already. It is not true to say that we are seeing damaging effects on
weather from climate change. Weather is not climate change. The
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change SREX report in late 2011 came
to the very firm conclusion that you could not see a signal of climate
change in current climate events, neither in droughts, floods, storms
nor any of those kinds of things. Professor Roger Pielke at the
University of Colorado has come to exactly the same conclusion. There
is no evidence yet that we are seeing
damage<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T17:26:46"></hs_TimeCode>.
Meanwhile, we are seeing clear damage from climate change policies. The
denial of cheap electricity to people in poor countries and the effect
of biofuels on food prices are having a demonstrable effect on both
hunger and well-being in other parts of the world. We have to take
these things into
account<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T17:27:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070297000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070297000048">I
hasten to add that I accept the science of climate change. By that, I
mean I accept that carbon dioxide has its full greenhouse effect. At
Second Reading, the noble Lord, Lord Prescott, said that I was denying
this, but I accept that it has the full effect. However, the full
effect is only 1.2 degrees centigrade warming for a doubling of the
quantity of carbon dioxide—it is there in section 8.6.2.3 of the
latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The
danger arises from the potential feedback effects from water vapour in
the atmosphere. We can measure whether those are happening and it is
clear they are happening more slowly than expected—that is what
those papers I cited are all

Browning:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall speak briefly because I
realise that it has been a long debate. I want to make just a couple of
points. First, the Government are taking the most important step in
putting in place the legislative framework to allow a binding target
range to be set at the right time. I understand—perhaps my noble
friend the Minister will confirm this—that there is nothing in
the Bill to say that if circumstances change in the next two or three
years the Government could not go ahead and make that announcement. I
believe that that flexibility is in the legislation. When the decision
is made—whether it is 2016 or before—the fact that the
legislative framework is in place will mean that it can be implemented
with more speed than if we had to come back to take this matter through
Parliament. That in itself is an
advantage<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T17:29:08"></hs_TimeCode>. I

I want to press the fact that all Governments have required flexibility
in this area of policy, as was mentioned so ably by my noble friend
Lord Jenkin of 
<?notus-xml column=376?>Roding. I just share with the Committee a conversation that I had when I
was a member of the Public Accounts Committee in 2005 with the then DTI
Permanent Secretary who then had responsibility for energy policy, Sir
Robin Young. During an evidence session, I pressed him
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T17:29:46"></hs_TimeCode>on whether he
would guarantee integrity of supply in the light of the
Government’s failure to make an announcement on whether they
would renew our nuclear plants, in particular as we were well aware at
the time that the Magnox reactors were coming to the end of their life.
In response to my question, he confirmed that a minimum lead time would
be 15 years, so in 2005 we were getting quite anxious about where the
policy was going. I asked him to guarantee integrity of supply. In his
reply, he
stated:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13070297000135" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070297000135">“The

there is a need for change. However, I say to the Minister that she is
right to keep that flexibility, and that the most serious thing that
could happen to undermine the confidence both of domestic consumers
and, in particular, of commerce and industry, would be if there were
any question of a failure in the security of supply. Nobody in this

that the noble Viscount, Lord Ridley, said was incorrect, he had the
opportunity to say so. He is quite unable to do so. What the noble
Viscount said is right. Another fantasy, since I am provoked by my
noble friend, was his statement that it is not the case that we are
going out ahead of the pack and that everybody else is going green,
going renewable, in the same way. This is patently untrue. The major
European countries that have gone in this direction, Germany and Spain,
are both winding back as fast as they can on their subsidies and
support for renewables. They realise that it is a blind alley, which is
why, as the noble Lord, Lord Cameron, pointed out, the share prices of
the renewables companies have collapsed. That is what is

Lawson of Blaby:</Member></B> That is an interesting question, which I
will answer. The Chinese felt that the Europeans were so foolish that
there was a big potential export trade sending solar panels to Europe.
Their solar panel industry is in dire straits, so they have cut their
prices to the bone, which is why there is this dispute. The noble
Baroness may be interested to know more: China has a five-year plan. In
that plan, how much of their electricity does she think would be
generated by the solar industry by 2020? The answer is 0.5%. That is
what China is doing. However, China thought that credulous Europeans
would buy these panels and that there was a great export trade to be
had. The winding-down, which I was referring to a moment ago, of the
renewables industry in Europe has meant that their market is not nearly
as big as they thought. So the Chinese are in a very difficult state on
this front and that is the origin of the trade disputes. I am glad that
the noble Baroness asked me that, because the answer is

I go on to the amendment tabled by Lord Oxburgh, there is one thing
that I hope we can change if we are going to debate this important
issue in an honest and sensible way. We should get away from the idea
of saying, “I am all in favour of clean energy”. Two
noble Lords have said this already. There is nothing cleaner than
carbon dioxide. It is a colourless, odourless gas whose main effect is
to make the world 
<?notus-xml column=378?>habitable, because without it there could be no plant growth and without
plant growth there could be no animal or human life. Scientists are

carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has a warming effect. How big a
warming effect, as the noble Viscount said, is disputed among
scientists, and the consensus is moving to a much lower effect than was
previously thought. However, the sun has a much greater warming effect

it is a consequence of coalition government that you have two separate
energy policies. However, the other energy policy and the one in the
Bill are in complete conflict. The purpose of this Bill is, through
long-term contracts for difference of 15 years or even more, to lock
this country into high-cost renewable energy and nuclear energy. That
will leave very little space for shale gas, although, as my noble
friend Lord Ridley pointed out, it is now clear that we have enormous
reserves in this country. Having indigenous reserves is particularly
important and, because of liquefaction, the cost of transporting gas
across the ocean adds considerably to the cost of the gas.</hs_parafo>

ways. We either go for shale gas, which is cheap, or we lock ourselves
into high-cost energy. That is what worries me. The only way in which
you can make sense of these two conflicting energy policies is if you
think that the purpose of developing our resources of indigenous shale
gas—we cannot use it here because of this Bill—is for it
to be exported to our competitors so that they can have the 
<?notus-xml column=379?>benefit of the cheap energy that we are forgoing. That is the only way
in which you can reconcile the two policies. Of course, it is complete
rubbish, complete nonsense. It is the economics and the politics of the

I come to the amendment about the target in the name of the noble Lord,
Lord Oxburgh, on which I think that he is a little naive. As my noble
friend Lord Howell said, just putting in this target does not give any
guarantee to energy companies in the slightest, because things can
change. No Parliament can bind its successor. As I said earlier, the
Germans and the Spanish are changing all their subsidies and support
for renewable energy. No businessman believes that this target means
anything. It is true that the contracts for difference, which are
legally binding, will bind us and lock us in. That concerns me, but
this target is neither here nor

Lord Cameron of Dillington and Lord Whitty, I had the privilege of
serving on the House of Lords sub-committee that reported on energy
last year. In the report, <I>No Country is an Energy Island</I>, we
looked at the energy market within the EU. It is not just Britain that
faces a problem; it is the whole of the EU, where a vast amount of
money has to be spent. We came to the conclusion that,</hs_para>

necessary investment. However, what was absolutely clear in the
evidence that we took was that every prognostication about the energy
market made 10 years ago or even five years ago was already
totally out of date and out of the window. It seemed clear to me that
the one thing that was likely to happen was that our report was also
going to be out of date pretty quickly.</hs_parafo>

shale gas. So much more information about shale gas has come into the
public domain than we had when we produced our report. As the noble
Viscount, Lord Ridley, said, the potential supply is wildly in excess
of any of the figures that we were given. It seemed to me at the time,
and it is reinforced now, that our Government need to have the

got on renewables and on targets for renewables was very mixed. Mr
Atherton told us that setting the target in 2006—the UK signed
up to it—locked us into immature, technically uncertain 
<?notus-xml column=380?>and expensive technologies. That is a concern that we ought to bear in
mind. If there are new technologies that are going to produce
decarbonisation, perhaps at a slower rate than some of the purists
would like, that is something we should not ignore. It is something
that this country stands to benefit from. If we have the unique
geological structures under our ground that are perhaps more
exploitable than we thought at the time we wrote our report—and
I guess that our report would be very different now; I wonder whether
the noble Lords, Lord Whitty and Lord Cameron, agree with me on
that—I do not think that we ought to obstruct our Government

turn to what the noble Lord, Lord Stephen, said about investment and
jobs. There has been a huge investment, but I have not seen any of the
jobs come to Caithness for all those wind farms that I look out on.
Some £10.7 billion has been spent in this country on wind farms,
but as little as £2.1 billion actually came to the benefit of
the UK. What I do not understand is why agreeing a target now rather
than in two years’ time is going to change that situation. I do
not have any evidence that firms are going to come to the UK
specifically because we have a decarbonisation date fixed in 2014
rather than in 2016. Indeed, it was on that point that the noble Lord,
Lord Cameron of Dillington, was absolutely right. It is a question of
two years. If in that time we are hopefully going to agree the fifth
climate change package in the EU, is it worth pre-empting
that—at potentially a huge cost—or is it worth waiting
for that to be agreed and then setting a figure after that, which the
Bill provides
for?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070297000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070297000074">My firm
belief is that we should wait and we should use the potential that has
been given to us by geology to explore whether shale gas can come to
our aid. If we can produce cheaper energy, it is going to lead to one
of the greatest revolutions of growth in this country, which will be of
huge benefit not just to us but to the whole of Europe. For those
reasons, tempting as it is to tick my green credentials and support the
noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, I think that we would be heading down the
wrong track.</hs_para>

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Earl has presented a view of
the report that he and I were both party to, as indeed was the noble
Lord, Lord Cameron—and I think that I saw the noble Lord, Lord
Maclennan, come in just now. Does he not agree that the major
conclusion of that report was that, whatever the technology, what
industry requires in order to invest the sums of money that are needed
in European energy is greater regulatory and policy certainty? Part of
that must surely be to establish the trajectory of the decarbonisation
pattern that Europe and the UK are embarked
on.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070297000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070297000076">There is
now more evidence that we have more of shale gas than perhaps we
thought a few months ago. Whether it is extractable at commercial
prices and over what timescale is as yet unclear. But the point about
shale gas is twofold. First, shale gas can help to contribute towards
faster decarbonisation if it displaces coal and oil, but not if it
delays the adoption of nuclear or renewable technologies. Again, it
depends on the framework in which we are operating. The
second thing that the report suggested and emphasised strongly, 
<?notus-xml column=381?>as I am sure the noble Earl will agree, was that shale gas plus carbon
capture and storage could be a major contributor to decarbonisation. If
we do not get carbon capture and storage into the 2020s, we have no
chance of reaching that target, but shale gas is not necessarily the
enemy of that target and could indeed be supported by
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070297000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070297000077"><B><Member ContinuationText="The Earl of Caithness" PimsId="2425" UID="13070297000178" xid="1123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070297000178">The
Earl of Caithness:</Member></B> My Lords, with regard to the first
question that the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, posed to me, yes, of course,
I agree with him. I read out the sentence from paragraph 40 of our
report. It was one of our conclusions that certainty was a
pre-requisite for the investors. My question to my noble friend and the
Committee was: is a delay of two years going to make that amount of
difference when we have an EU target for 2028-32 to agree within a
short timeframe ahead of
us?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070297000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070297000078">With
regard to carbon capture and storage, I did not want to go down that
track. I totally agree with the noble Lord but, again, we have limited
evidence about it to date. I wish that there was much more that we
could report to the Committee about the tests for carbon capture and
storage. There are still some people who say that, despite what is
going on at the moment, it will never become a commercial issue. With
regard to nuclear, of course, having lived next door to
Dounreay—as has my noble friend Lord Maclennan of
Rogart—I regret the closure of that research centre. Dounreay
had the potential to have got us out of the hole we appear to be about

representations from a large number of organisations requesting that
they be put into the Bill. Here they are, and here we are debating them

why do we need such a target and why should we support the amendments
in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh? It is simply the fact that
investors want this and the country needs it. The noble Lord, Lord
Jenkin of Roding, said that only one trade organisation had made
representations to him, but he and I were both present at a joint
meeting of the Nuclear Industry Association, the Carbon Capture &amp;
Storage Association and the Renewable Energy Association, and all three
were united in calling for greater certainty and for a decarbonisation
target to be set as part of the Bill. That is just three trade 
<?notus-xml column=382?>associations. An additional 23 trade associations support it. Another 83
commercial companies support it. In total, more than 200 organisations
support this provision being in the Bill. It is absolutely certain that
we need it; investors have said that they need it. Simon Howard, chief

of the thrust of her argument, but I would ask her to say,
“Well, of course, those people would say that”. There is
at the end of the day a whole bargain going on here where suppliers
will try to get the best deal they can, so they are bound to say things
like that. The difficulty of the Government’s position is in
being able to assess, as we have seen in the negotiations for the

but I think that we have to be really careful in our negotiations about
how much we have already given within this framework, given the very
large businesses that have very good negotiators. I know that the noble
Baroness is one of the least naive people, but I think that we on this
side have to be slightly careful about being naive in these price
arguments. The noble Lord, Lord Deben, made the strong point at Second

we will come on to discuss under Part 2 of the Bill. This is Part 1,
which simply states the purposes of the Bill. There are many things
that the noble Lord said with which I agree. If we had focused more on
setting a framework of legislation, with clear outcomes and the right
policies to create the link between those outcomes and the
responsibilities placed on government and the commercial people who
have to deliver on them, we would be in a much better place than we
are. I said at Second Reading that I believe in markets. I believe
that, as legislators, we should set a clear framework and allow the
markets to live with the least-cost solutions. We are not in that
position right now—that is not the Bill that we have in front of
us—but this part of the Bill could be an important element in
doing just that. The amendments would create that framework of
certainty and guarantee a trajectory of travel. That is what is lacking

said—I do not want to repeat it—the Bill does not set a
decarbonisation target; in fact, it prevents a decarbonisation target
from being set and seeks to tie the hands of future Governments. That
is very regrettable. Moreover, it is simply enabling. It simply says
that the Secretary of State “may”, if he or she chooses,
set a decarbonisation target. Of course, that is going to create
uncertainty. Why the discretion? Ministers in the Commons were keen to
point out that they were in disagreement not about the principle but
merely about the process and the timing. If that is true, why is there
a need for discretion? Why the “may”? It seems to me
totally illogical; it creates needless uncertainty. A number of noble
Lords have used different phrases—“government
vacillation”, “infirmity of purpose” and
“gratuitous increase in uncertainty”. The discretion
seems completely illogical and gratuitous and I hope that, at the very
least, this process will bring some clarity to that issue.</hs_para>

we would go much further and, as other noble Lords who have spoken in
favour of the amendments have said, require the target to be set now.
There is no reason to delay it by two years. It unnecessarily
politicises the issue and kicks it out beyond the next election when we
have people lining up now to invest in the supply chain.</hs_para>

distinct difference between those people who may operate and own the

the value of those CFDs to the UK. They are the people to whom we
should be listening. The noble Lord, Lord Deben, was very clear that
there are people now facing imminent decisions about whether to locate
their factories, their manufacturing plant and their supply chain
businesses in the UK or elsewhere. If we fail on that, we will lose
jobs. We will still have the targets that were set in the carbon
budgets and we will still have the renewables obligations out to 2020,
but we will not be benefiting from the jobs and investment. It seems
completely illogical that we should allow that to occur. Those are the

could go on to make party-political points about why the uncertainty
has arisen, but I will resist the temptation. It is fairly obvious
that, as the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, said, there are two government
strategies on energy and that there is a lack of consistency in the
messages coming out, which makes these provisions all the more
important. I urge the Government to recognise that they have the
potential to do away with that whole element of uncertainty and to help

responsibility in this Bill. The Government have given themselves
enormous powers but they have not said what they are taking those
powers for. Clearly, what they want those powers for is to deliver
low-carbon energy, yet they are dragging their feet, resisting the
creation of a fair and flexible requirement to deliver a certain level
of carbon intensity within a certain time period. Speaking on behalf of
consumers and civil society, I say that, if we are to allow the
Government this degree of latitude, the very least that we can ask in
return is some clarity of purpose. We need some obvious sign that this
is not a Bill cooked up to allow us to have one nuclear project built
for a state-owned French company, but that it is about a much broader
picture—securing investment and low-carbon infrastructure across
the board in the UK.</hs_parafo>

because currently there are no requirements on the Secretary of State
to do anything. If he or she seeks not to sign any contracts, or
decides that it is simply all too much, there is nothing to require
them to do so. In fact there is nothing in the Bill, or in current
policy, that gives any transparency to what will happen in the 2020s.
We have, as many have mentioned, binding EU targets for renewables
until 2020, but after that there is no guidance. We know also that the
Secretary of State is active in Europe against European targets for
2030, so it is no wonder that renewables industry supply chain

has been said about the link between the carbon budgets and the setting
of decarbonisation targets. That is a fallacious argument. The carbon
budgets do a very different job from policies that seek to reduce
carbon emissions directly in the UK. I should declare an
interest, because I was a member of the Civil Service team that drafted
the Climate Change Bill, so I know what the carbon budgets require of
government. They require us to stay within a very flexible budget that
includes traded emissions. This is an important distinction: the power
sector is governed by an emissions cap set by the European Emissions
Trading Scheme. The carbon budget cannot alter that, so the level of
effort required in the power sector is equivalent to the allocation of
allowances under that scheme. That is how the carbon budgets work. That
means that abatement can occur anywhere. It can occur in other parts of
the world. There is a requirement on the Committee on Climate Change to
advise on how much flexibility there is, but it is certain that the
carbon budgets include that tradable flexibility.</hs_para>

of actual policies to deliver real reductions in the UK is a wholly
different issue. These are not policies to deliver on carbon emissions
but policies to deliver investment in the UK. The noble Lord, Lord
Deben, put it exactly right: these are policies about gaining benefit
for UK plc. To illustrate this point further—please bear with
me, as this may seem very technical—in introducing the carbon
floor price the Government have already accepted that carbon budgets
and policies to decarbonise are not one and the same. Many Members have
spoken today about their fears about consumers and competitiveness and
about not wishing to go too fast. I ask them to look carefully at the
Treasury’s carbon floor price policy. It is certainly the worst
example of exacerbating all 
<?notus-xml column=385?>those issues, and to what end? It does nothing other than reward
existing incumbents of low-carbon energy generation—those power
stations that were built years ago, mostly with taxpayers’ money
in the nuclear case or through the RO for renewables. They are now
receiving an additional windfall that they were not expecting as a
result of the CFP. This is the policy that noble Lords should be aiming
their fire at, not at the very sensible decarbonisation target in the
Bill.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13070297000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070297000093">I said
that there has been a decoupling of carbon budgets from carbon
intensity. Another example of that is the fourth carbon budget, where
the Government have managed to create uncertainty out of what should
have been certain by asking for it to be reviewed. The reason why it
has to be reviewed is precisely the point that I have made: those
carbon budgets are dictated by Europe through the ETS and the policies
that we are talking about today concern UK investment and UK actual
emissions, which are different things. We cannot pray in aid the carbon
budgets in arguing against setting this target. It simply does not
wash.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13070297000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070297000094">I am
conscious that we have already had a lengthy debate. A number of other
important issues have been raised. Of course it is in our interest to
protect consumers—we believe that especially on this side of the
Committee. We have a fabulous record of ensuring that the fuel-poor are
protected. My noble friend Lord Whitty is a pre-eminent example of how
we have pushed that agenda. We strongly believe that adopting a
portfolio of energy sources will protect consumers in the long run. The
CCC’s advice has shown that in the 2020s moving towards a varied
portfolio of low-carbon supply will save consumers in the region of
£25 billion to £45 billion. That is not a small sum and
it demonstrates that at the moment nobody can predict the future. The
simplest, safest and most sensible approach is therefore not to put all
our eggs in one basket but to pursue a varied set of technologies to
deliver on our security of supply, affordability and low-carbon
objectives.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070297000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070297000095">I
wanted to talk a little about security of supply, but my noble friend
Lord Davies put it better than I can. Of course, if you reduce
uncertainty for investors, you reduce capital costs and you increase
the level of investment in capacity, so you gain on costs, security and
carbon. That is absolutely clear. I am delighted that he made that
point so
well.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070297000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070297000096">People
may be wondering whether, if we set these targets, they could be met.
They can absolutely be met. They can be met with almost no investment
in new capacity. That is simply because at the moment there is a huge
amount of headroom in our electricity capacity. The carbon intensity of
our power is very high. It was higher last year than it has been for
many years—it reached 530 grams per kilowatt hour in 2012. That
is for understandable reasons to do with the coal price and the gas
price. Gas has been driving up emissions because it has been so
expensive relative to coal. If we were simply to switch the merit order
of the plant that we currently have, we could take 200 grams from that
value, so we could take it down from more than 500 kilograms
to close to 300 kilograms without building anything new or spending a
lot of money on anything expensive. That is what is technically
possible today, as the Committee on Climate Change has repeatedly 
<?notus-xml column=386?>illustrated. An amendment that we will come to shortly is about staged
carbon reduction targets and is built on the premise that it is
incredibly easy for us to do this. Anyone who says that we are locking
ourselves into expensive decisions misunderstands how electricity is
being generated today and how decisions are made about which plant to
operate.</hs_para>

noble Lords have argued today that we cannot do this and that it is not
possible, too difficult or not flexible enough. First, there are great
flexibilities in this system, which we would not wish to see removed.
Secondly, noble Lords should think about what they are saying.
President Obama said in his climate change speech the other week that
people in America who deny that we can tackle climate change are
betting against the ingenuity of the companies, financiers and
engineers who are all capable of rising to this challenge. This is not
rocket science. There is a plethora of technologies already out there
today that can quickly become commercial. There will be a whole host
more in my lifetime. If the Government say that we cannot hit these
targets, it really is a vote of no confidence in our country’s
fantastic ingenuity and engineering. That would be incredibly
regrettable.</hs_para>

target and do so with confidence, knowing that it can be done and that
we will be protecting consumers in future and boosting security of
supply. There is absolutely no point in waiting for two years, when it
will simply be kicked into the long grass and become a political issue
that it need not be. We have a long history of cross-party support for
action on climate change in this Parliament. It would be a great shame
if it were to be disrupted now for fear of a very small and quite ill
informed group of people who think
otherwise.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-02?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_02_PT_1/3D6659322207B8404FCF6F4EDD319C392A7BA6DE" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 2 July 2013">Tuesday,

this has been an excellent debate and, given the strength of arguments
on both sides, I really believe that with our reasonable and measured
approach to the decarbonisation target range, the Government have got
it right. I agree that a decarbonisation target range, set at the right
time, could provide further certainty for developing low-carbon energy.
That is why, having heard many strong views on the matter, the
Government brought these new clauses forward in the other place, which
now form Part 1 of the Bill. This will enable us to be the first
country in the world to set a clean energy
target.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070297000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070297000100">Having
said that—and as a number of noble Lords have highlighted and
illustrated with great skill—changing the Bill as proposed by
these amendments would not be the best way of achieving what I believe
are shared goals. I shall expand on this and hope to respond to some of
the issues that have been raised today. The issue of when we set a
target comes down to what will provide the greatest certainty for
investors. The noble Lord, Lord Browne of Madingley, made the point at

have recognised that investors need more details. That is why last week
we set out additional details about our reforms. We have published some
information about contract terms, which go to costs and thus value. We

of the arguments I have heard about not giving investors certainty are
covered by this point: industry itself says that it recognises that it
is now being given certainty. Looking beyond 2020, there are already
legal targets in place that clarify the future of electricity in this
country. There is the 2050 target, which is likely to require
electricity to be virtually decarbonised, and there is the fourth
carbon budget, which runs up to 2027 and requires the UK to halve
emissions in the whole

has a question, perhaps I could take it after I finish. To provide
further clarity out to
2030<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T18:13:53"></hs_TimeCode>, the
Government have committed to issuing guidance to National Grid on an
indicative range of decarbonisation scenarios for the power sector to
2030, consistent with the least-cost pathway to 2050. Just last month
the Government set out an ambitious position for 2030 at a European
level, to urge Europe to set a binding emissions reductions target of
50% by 2030 as part of the ambitious global deal—and 40% even if
we move unilaterally. Finally on this point, Amendment 4 has an
unintended consequence, in that it would prevent targets being set for
years beyond
2030<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T18:14:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070297000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070297000105">This
brings me to my second point: whether the Bill should provide a power
or a duty to set a decarbonisation target range. Of course there is an
attraction in saying in the Bill that the Secretary of State must set a
target by a certain date, as both the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, and my
noble friend Lord Stephen
propose<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T18:15:05"></hs_TimeCode>.
However, my honourable friend, the Member for Wealden, Charles Hendry,
pointed out in an article on this issue that it does nothing for any
Government’s credibility to set out a target before they are in
a position to say how they will achieve it. He
stated:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13070297000139" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070297000139">“The

essential that a decision on the long-term trajectory of the
electricity sector is taken when considering the pathway of the whole
economy towards 2050. 
<?notus-xml column=388?>As we set out in the carbon plan, it is likely that as well
as decarbonising electricity, meeting our 2050 target will require a
significant amount of heat and transport to be electrified. This
impacts not only on demand for electricity but on when that electricity
will be needed. The right time to consider this will be in 2016, when
we are due to set out the level of our economy-wide fifth carbon
budget, covering the period between 2028 and 2032. Setting a target in
2016 would be 14 years before it is due to be met. This is even longer
than is required under the Climate Change Act 2008 in respect of carbon
budgets, which are set 12 and a half years ahead.</hs_para>

is very important to recognise that the operation of the UK’s
power sector is intrinsically bound up with Europe. It falls within the
scope of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, which the noble Baroness
raised, which sets a cap on EU-wide emissions within its scope. The
European Commission has published proposals on what framework the EU as
a whole should set for tackling climate change between now and 2030.
While we have already announced our intention to argue for an ambitious
approach in Europe, it is too early to tell what will emerge. Both the
level of ambition and the nature of any accompanying EU regulations or
directives will be important considerations when looking at UK targets
for
2030.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070297000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070297000108">Moving

Committee on Climate Change and Amendments 11 and 14, I fully agree
with the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, that there should be a role for the
committee, and our proposed approach takes this into account. By
waiting until 2016 to make a decision on setting a target, the
Government can take on board the advice provided by the committee on
the level of the fifth carbon budget, which covers the 2030 period, as
part of its existing responsibilities under the Climate Change Act.
While I agree that it is important for the Secretary of State to take
into account the committee’s advice when setting or amending the
level of any target range—just as he does now when setting
carbon budgets—the committee’s role under the Climate

just want to touch on a couple of other issues before I conclude. One
is of discretion, which the noble Baroness, Lady Worthington, raised.
In relation to decarbonisation there is no question about the purpose
of the power. It is a power to set a decarbonisation range for the
power sector and that is clear and it is in the

Cameron, and the noble Baroness, Lady Worthington, also mentioned
investment certainty and supply chains. We have worked with industry
from the start to produce three energy industrial strategies. The
nuclear and the oil and gas strategies have been published. The
offshore wind strategy will be published in mid-July. These will ensure
that supply chains can develop and serve growth in the energy sector.
This Government have worked closely to ensure that we are reflective of
what industry has asked, and to ensure that consumers are at the heart
of our decision-making. Ultimately they are the ones who will be
picking up the price if we get it wrong, which is why our measures are

noble friend Lady Browning also asked if the target could be set
earlier. If a future Government wish to set a target range earlier,
they could choose to set the fifth carbon budget sooner. The
Government’s view is that this is not necessary or desirable.
The government position has always been clear: we do not believe that a
target range should be set before the fifth carbon budget, which covers
the corresponding period and which has been set in law. That will be in

those budgets are about emissions and take into account flows of
emissions using trading. It is not true that they give any certainty at
all about what will happen in the UK. What happens in the UK is
governed by UK policies, which include the RO and other support

a number of noble Lords have made Second Reading points this afternoon
rather than points which relate to this particular amendment. Be that
as it may, it is worth commenting on shale gas, which has come up
several times. It is worth pointing out that shale gas 
<?notus-xml column=390?>is about the most expensive gas to exploit that we know about on the
face of the earth. You have to use a whole range of technologies which
are mostly at the top of, or almost beyond, the range of conventional
gas exploitation. The noble Lord, Lord Lawson, is absolutely right when
he says—or implies—that gas is the least transportable of
the fossil fuels. If you get your shale gas from abroad, you pay a
premium of something close to $2 or $3. The real advantage of shale gas
is to those who have it themselves and can put it straight into their
national grid. If, in due course, we can do that, that will certainly

transient overproduction, will come back up to something like $7 from
the $8 that it was previously. That will reflect the costs of
extraction, with a modest premium for those who do it. The broader view
is that shale gas will mean that there is more gas to go round. The
result of its abundance will probably be that gas prices do not rise
nearly as much as they would have done in its absence. However, I do

number of noble Lords commented on technology. The first thing to
recognise is that in the sorts of technology about which we are
talking, the characteristic time between the inspiration of a new
technology and its coming into use is about 20 years. That is the
timescale in which we have to think of new technologies. There are two
technologies that will transform the energy scene in this country and
worldwide. The first is cheap and readily applicable carbon capture and
storage, which we do not have yet. However, there is a range of
possibilities in that area. I suspect that this is what the noble Lord,
Lord Dixon-Smith, was
referring<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T18:29:25"></hs_TimeCode> to in
his comments. Cheap carbon capture and storage, applied to gas, would
be a transformative change. The other transformative change would be
the ability to store energy. That would transform the role of our
intermittent renewables, which at the moment have to be managed
effectively on the
grid.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070297000121" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#13070297000121">To pick

<?notus-xml column=391?>Fundamentally, what the Government’s approach offers is somewhat
higher prices than we would have preferred in the short term, but
probably much more stable prices—and lower global

that the Government would use the setting of the carbon budgets as a
reason not to agree to setting a decarbonisation target, I tabled this
amendment to probe the logic of that. I have tried to explain, possibly
in vain sadly, that carbon budgets and carbon intensity are not one and
the same and should not be linked. However, I feared that I might not
succeed in making that point, so tabled this amendment simply to show
that the carbon intensity of electricity is a very clear indicator of
progress in the implementation of the Bill. Carbon intensity is a value
that is currently recorded and reported but, sadly, over the past
decade has not fallen. It fell dramatically between 1990 and 2000 when
we invested in CCGT gas plants which were more efficient and cleaner.
The carbon intensity of power fell from around 950 to around 450 to
500. That was achieved in a
decade.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307031000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#1307031000003">Since
then, I am sad to say that both the previous Government and this
Government have utterly failed to deliver anything comparable and
carbon intensities have been bouncing around pretty much at will,
reflecting the global prices of the commodities involved—gas and
coal. Last year, we saw almost a record high of 530 grams per kilowatt
hour in the UK in 2012. This is just wasteful carbon emissions, I am
afraid to say. Had we got a grip and introduced a proper energy policy
that took into account the carbon intensity and managed it down, we
would not have seen the high carbon burn that we saw last year, which
is displacing
gas.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307031000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#1307031000004">Members of
the Committee who are fans of gas ought to note that we have a common
enemy in coal, particularly coal treated in old stations built 30 or
40 years ago, some of which are now fitted with filtration
equipment that knocks their efficiency down even further. There is
probably no worse way of generating electricity in terms of carbon
emissions, yet there they were base loading all the way through last
year, pushing up the carbon intensity to record levels. As I have
mentioned previously, that can be addressed. The merit order of
existing plants, if it operates optimally, could take 200 grams off
overnight without the need to sign any long, expensive and hard to
negotiate contracts—if we simply introduce the right policy
framework.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307031000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#1307031000005">The
amendment would require budgets to start to be set in 2020, when it
would be possible to get emissions to around 200 grams per kilowatt
hour with very little in the way of any extra investment. Simply using
the investment that is already in the supply chain to meet our 2020
renewables targets, coupled with a change in the merit order, would
take us there. Beyond that, we can look at a target in 2025 of around
150 grams per kilowatt hour. Again, there is no great need
to invest in lots of new capacity to achieve that. It simply means
continuing to invest in renewables on roughly the same scale as we are
doing now, seeing the CCS demonstration projects get under way on gas
and coal and seeing the biomass conversions. Essentially, this is not a
hard trajectory. The point of putting down this amendment is to explain
that the pathway from where we are today, with ridiculously high carbon
intensity, to where we need to get to in 2030 to reach our legally
binding targets cost-efficiently is not difficult. If you want to see
the road map or the plan of how to get there, you need only refer to
the CCC’s reports on the subject, which contain a huge amount of
detail 
<?notus-xml column=393?>outlining this and explaining how existing kit and existing plant can be
used to reach very much lower levels than we have
today.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307031000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#1307031000006">I
also mentioned in my previous speech that we already have a carbon
floor price. The Government should accept that targets need to be set
that justify that policy. It is an incredibly distorting policy, with
no environmental benefits. As I have said before, reductions that occur
underneath the cap set in Europe are simply traded away. So it is not
about carbon. It is meant to be about securing investment in UK plc. If
that investment is not forthcoming—if, for whatever reason, the
policies in this Energy Bill do not deliver—the public and
Parliament have a right to be able to measure that. This is a
significant piece of legislation, taking wide-ranging powers. It is
matched in its size and significance by the existing carbon floor
price. It is only right that we take it upon ourselves to deliver an
outcome for these policies. That outcome must be a steady decline in
carbon
intensity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307031000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#1307031000007">Obviously,
I would not recommend the setting of a series of targets starting in
2020 and going five years beyond that if I was not confident that we
had the policies to deliver on that. If they work, CFDs are the
mechanism which the Government hope will be used to achieve this. If
the Government have confidence in their Bill and the measures contained
in it, they ought to have the confidence to set these targets. Many
people have made the point that flexibility is necessary, as we cannot
predict the future and should not be technologically specific in our
aspirations. I completely agree. I have said before, and will say
again, that the market should decide how best to meet these targets. It
will do it with much more efficiency than even the best minds in the
Treasury can
achieve.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307031000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#1307031000008">I
will stop there because I do not want to prolong this debate too much
and I am grateful for being able to raise this separate issue. When we
go through the Bill, I will speak to amendments concerning the energy
performance standard because that is the mechanism within this Bill
that could certainly deliver on these decarbonisation targets. Taken as
a whole, these targets are actually very sensible: carbon budgets
already exist and, knowing that, the Government can set them happily.
There is nothing to stop the Government and it is something that should
accompany this Bill. Consumers and wider society deserve some
accountability for all these powers that we are giving to the Secretary
of
State.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307031000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#1307031000009"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Verma" PimsId="5081" UID="1307031000167" xid="1929" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#1307031000167">Baroness

we are supporting decarbonisation, as the noble Baroness is aware, by
making low carbon more attractive with the EMR provisions. When we come

Rather than fettering any future Government, this Government has taken
the most important step of 
<?notus-xml column=394?>putting in place the legislative framework to allow a binding target
range to be set in 2016. As I said earlier, it has to be set against a
backdrop of a number of things and not taken in isolation. There are
two issues that we must address: first, whether the Secretary of State
should set future targets after the first target range is set; and,
secondly, whether he should set a target range for a date earlier than
2030.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307031000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#1307031000011">On
the first of these issues, I agree with the noble Baroness that there
is merit in the Secretary of State having the ability to set targets
for years beyond the setting of the first target. After all, we are
guided in this debate by the framework provided by the Climate Change
Act, which looks out to 2050 and not 2030. I am pleased to
say that the Bill already permits future target ranges to be set beyond
2030. On the second issue, I do not think that we should set a target
as early as 2020 because we already have a suite of targets and
measures that give very clear signals about the pace and trajectory of
the power sector up to 2020. A further target at this stage would
probably be very unhelpful and not very
useful.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307031000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#1307031000012">In
addition, neither the Committee on Climate Change nor industry leaders
have been calling for a decarbonisation target earlier than 2030. Their
support is for a target that clarifies the long-term trajectory of the
electricity sector. I think the noble Baroness accepts that that is a
far better forward-looking view than shortening the timescale and
adding uncertainty to industry by adding further targets to which it
would have to adjust. Industry already has certainty until 2020. The
issue about what more is needed, and when, beyond that date was aired

view was echoed at Second Reading by a number of noble Lords who argued
that a decarbonisation target would be a way to provide certainty to
investors. I think that I made the point clearly in the previous debate
that we need to be able to set it with the fifth carbon budget and
while looking at a whole range of other scenarios and mechanisms rather
than setting it in isolation. We also need to look at what other
countries are doing so that we do not put ourselves at a disadvantage
competitively, ensuring that we are among the world leaders in the
competitive race. I think it would start hampering industry if we keep

response. I have to point out that at the moment we have a policy
introduced by a Treasury, which is trying to achieve exactly what she
said that the Government should not do; namely, to affect the merit
order. She said that the merit order is subject to 
<?notus-xml column=395?>the market and that therefore we cannot do anything about it. Why then
have the Government introduced a carbon floor price, if not to
influence that merit order? That is exactly what it is designed to do
and trying to encourage. Generators will internalise the price of
carbon and therefore run their cleanest plant first. Let us be honest,
the cheapest way in which we can hit our carbon targets is simply by
supply companies switching to a cleaner station rather than a dirtier
one. That is the lowest hanging fruit possible, which is why the carbon
floor price has been
introduced.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307031000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0001.htm#1307031000015">I

not bankable. I know no one who is able to invest on the back of it. In

of the uncertainty of the carbon floor price. It is a suboptimal policy
and it does make me wonder whether the Treasury is happy to throw its
fine logic about not going further than Europe and always keeping with

introduce carbon floor prices and are trying to interfere with the
merit order but, on the other hand, we are not prepared to give the

that fails to recognise that under the Bill there is no certainty that
there will be any reporting on CCS. Repealing the triennial reporting

25 would make the annual requirement follow the enactment of the Bill

intensity of electricity over time. This Committee has already debated
the setting of targets for carbon intensity that are intended to give
investors confidence by requiring that the Government maintain policies
beyond 2020 to decarbonise electricity. However, we should not forget
that there is a near-term challenge significantly to reduce carbon

noble friend Lady Worthington has pointed out already, there is
significant potential to reduce carbon intensity simply by acting to
ensure the merit order of existing plant is optimised. Unfortunately, a
combination of low coal prices and high gas prices has led in recent
years to a significant increase in carbon intensity. Between 2011 and
2012, carbon intensity rose from 450 grams per kilowatt hour to 530

most efficient and that penalises the most polluting. Only then will
the merit order be such that we are achieving our goals at least

Minister may point to the annual reports contained in the <I>Digest of
UK Energy Statistics</I> as a reason for not introducing annual
reporting. However, this is a lengthy document, not intended for a
parliamentary audience and, indeed, not even laid before Parliament.

are on the subject of the reporting of carbon intensity, does the

frequent reporting than annually? As the mix of electricity changes to

supply is high and prices will fall and also times when the opposite is
true. Reporting the carbon intensity of electricity in real time will
enable customers to see when it makes most sense, environmentally and
economically, to use electricity. 
<?notus-xml column=398?>Reporting in real time would enable the development of tariffs that
allow customers with flexible demand to profit from moving their demand

Deben:</Member></B> My Lords, perhaps I might counsel the Minister to
be very careful about accepting these amendments. They seem to confuse
a range of different things. They also demand a degree of reporting
that might get in the way of the action that I hope will be carried
through. The reporting system we have at the moment was designed by
Parliament. It stipulates that there should be reports from outside the
ministry on the ministry’s and the Government’s
performance. If there are areas where it is not done properly, I, as
chairman of the climate change committee, would want to know that, in
order to see whether we should produce reports in areas that we do not
cover at the

very concerned about the current desire to report so often as we go
along that we do not actually do things. I see this throughout

issue here. The idea that we should have reporting more often than once
a year, and that we should have real-time reporting, are issues of such
concern that it would perhaps be better if we did not proceed down that
route during consideration of the Bill, where there are many decisions

start tying people down to very much closer targets, it will raise

Second Reading. I am president of the microgeneration group of the
Micropower Council. I am also the vice-president of National Energy

with fuel poverty, and that this was one of the issues I wished to deal
with during this Bill: hence the
amendment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307031000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0002.htm#1307031000047">The
other amendment that deals with this is Amendment 23. Both the noble

get the Minister to show some recognition that it will affect people in
fuel poverty and that we still need to do things to address

this section, Clause 2 sets out the matters that must be taken into

2(2)(e) refers to social circumstances, in particular the likely impact
on fuel poverty. My amendment seeks to link this to the aims of the
Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act 2000. The purpose of the
amendment is to ensure that there is recognition of the scale of the
impacts of the Bill on fuel-poor households, both now and in future

have probably strayed slightly into another section of the Bill, but it
is difficult not to do so on this issue. Electricity market reform and
the introduction of the carbon floor price will impose new and as yet
unknown costs on low-income and vulnerable households. The noble Lords,
Lord Deben and Lord Jenkin, in their earlier comments, tried to put
some figures on what they thought might happen to bills as a result of
some of the measures here, but we can only estimate what the effects
will be. The Warm Front programme, which provided public funding for
heating and insulation measures, to help fuel-poor households, came to
an end in March this year, and its replacement, the warm home discount,
is paid for by all energy consumers, including low-income households,
some of which cannot benefit from the scheme.
Interestingly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T19:06:54"></hs_TimeCode>,

expanded, their tax-funded energy schemes to help fuel-poor

important that this issue is brought to the attention of Ministers at
this stage, because I think that it is fair to say that the Green Deal
has not been a great success so far. It may well be transformed over
the summer, but, as far as improving the quality of energy-inefficient
households is concerned, it has yet to make the impact that some of us
were not sure about but others had perhaps undue faith in. None the
less, it is at the moment the only government-led initiative on energy
efficiency and it ought to have an impact on those households where the
quality of the fabric of the house is a major contributor to what we
call fuel
poverty<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T19:10:32"></hs_TimeCode>. Fuel
poverty is currently defined as households in which more than 10% of
the income is accounted for by energy prices. This may be subject to
redefinition in the next few months, but, even if the definition were
radically changed, I do not think that fuel poverty would disappear
before
2016<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T19:11:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307031000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0002.htm#1307031000055">Much
has quite correctly been made of the fact that all households will be
paying for a lot of the green measures being taken. These green
measures fall on electricity consumption. At the moment, some 8 million
of the 26 million or 27 million households in the United Kingdom do not
have gas. That means that, for the purposes of heating, they are
dependent in the main either on electricity or on oil. They therefore
pay a disproportionate amount of their energy costs in supporting these
so-called green measures. We should give notice to the Minister that
this will be a recurring theme, because households that are outwith the
gas grid are disadvantaged at the moment. Those households are doubly
disadvantaged because they have to pay what seems to be a
disproportionate amount of money as far as electricity is
concerned<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-02T19:12:25"></hs_TimeCode>. This
has been mitigated somewhat. At one time, there was an almost poll
tax-style arrangement whereby every household paid the same amount; it
is now going to be measured on consumption of units of electricity, so
that is a slight improvement. However, there is a long way to go
on this.</hs_para>

earlier today about the need for investment. There will be a series of

realise that, at this stage at least, this is a probing amendment.
Aneurin Bevan once said that silent pain evokes no response. We have to
remain mindful of the fact that a number of households in this country
are suffering a great deal because of energy prices that have been
rising, which are likely to rise even more and which, at present, we
are not confident will get the kind of mitigation that we had hoped
would come from the Green Deal because of the low take-up and the
almost total indifference to it of the private landlord. Of all the

lot of what needed to be said in this debate has been said by the noble
Baroness, Lady Maddock, and my noble friend Lord O’Neill.
However, at some stage we need to focus on fuel poverty issues. I
declare an interest as a non-executive director of the Offshore
Renewable Energy Catapult. I am very conscious that the change in the
structure of the market proposed in this legislation is complex. I echo
the words of the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, who said that the model is
complex and relatively expensive. With my commitment to renewal energy,
I know that we are talking in many respects of infant industries and
that there will be additional costs. I have no doubt that in the long
run we will see energy prices come down, not least through the
introduction of nuclear energy, but, frankly, in the long run we are
all dead. We need to try to find something now to mitigate the impact

regards change in the energy markets, as a policymaker I have always
felt that no change is a change for the better if it means that someone
else is worse off—the old concept of Pareto optimality that some
of us who are in our prime will remember. Under this legislation there
is a real risk that the most vulnerable will be worse off. The
Government’s own figures estimate that 4 million people in
England are fuel poor. Many of those are particularly vulnerable and
are also affected by, for example, the bedroom tax and stringency in
local authority budgets. They are the people who can least afford to

inability to turn on a heater has if your house is cold and damp. In
Coatdyke, where I and my title come from, people are issued with
hypothermia meters for their houses to make sure that they do not
suffer from hypothermia. I acknowledge that this provision does not
directly relate to that part of the country, but whether you come from
the north of Scotland, the Yorkshire dales, Derbyshire or wherever, it
is a damning indictment of our society that poor people have to choose
between putting on their heating or feeding themselves. That is a
choice none of us should have to make in a civilised society. In 2000,
we set targets that should be reached by 2015. The most recent work by

around these fundamental necessities of life. I do not like to put it
all to one side. I have stopped myself having anything to do with one
part of a business that connects electricity of any kind—it is
agnostic about the sort of electricity—but I try to keep in
touch with the same issue that we knew in the water industry as it
relates to the supply of fuel. There is an issue about some forms of
help that we thought would be more extensive: for example, solid-wall
insulation, which is a real problem in some of the poorest parts of the

Teverson:</Member></B> My Lords, I put my name to the amendment of my
noble friend Lady Maddock. In three areas of the draft Bill there were
major omissions—omissions as opposed to emissions. One such
area, which we will probably come to on day 7, 8 or 9, is demand-side
management. We have started to discuss decarbonisation. The Government
have started to rectify both those omissions. The third area is fuel
poverty. I will not go through the arguments again. As the noble
Baroness, Lady Liddell, said, 4.5 million people are affected. The
figure is slightly lower than the previous year for which statistics
are available, but it is still atrocious for a civilised society that
expects a certain standard of living and of life for its
citizens.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307031000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0002.htm#1307031000067">The
other area, which is slightly more contentious, is the excess number of
winter deaths. The figure for the winter before last is estimated at
24,000. That is an even greater indicator of a failure of policy, and a
failure to look after the citizens of this country. As the noble Lord,
Lord O’Neill, said, the Green Deal is absolutely the right
instrument, but it is taking time. I can see that the noble Lord is
looking sceptically at me. However, the Green Deal will not rely on
national budgets if we can make it work. It will be primarily privately
financed and self-funding, so at the end of the day political decisions
will be taken out of it. However, it still has to prove

and Climate Change but to other departments, and really try to balance
this change in legislation within a context of rising energy prices. I
believe that it will bring down those rising energy prices in the

2005, fuel poverty has been increasing by almost any measure. That was
not due simply to the fact that I had left the Government and my noble

that real fuel prices were going up and the effectiveness of
interventions on the energy efficiency side were diminishing. As the

Front, CERT and CESP affecting the total resources available on fuel
poverty but at the moment the ECO, which was supposed to replace them,
is not being spent efficiently. It may improve, but the unit price of
interventions is going up, supply companies are seriously concerned
about the cost of meeting their ECO requirements, companies in the
installation business are running out of work, installers and
insulators are being laid off, and for many others who are currently

a very difficult situation, which the Government need to address. I
agree with the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, that it cannot be addressed
directly in this Bill but at least when we are talking about the
multiple objectives of energy policy, one of them must be the social
objective of reducing fuel poverty. I hope, therefore, that the
Government can accept something like the wording proposed here and we
could perhaps look at the back end of this Bill to try to do something
very substantial about fuel poverty. It is an appalling record for both
the previous Government and this Government that we have failed to
address this problem, which affects the most vulnerable of our

Verma:</Member></B> My Lords, I agree that fuel poverty is a real and
serious problem faced by many households today. It is one that this
Government are determined to address. The intention of Amendments 15
and 23 is to require the Government to consider the impact on the fuel
poor of setting a decarbonisation target and provide for mitigating
action to offset any consequential impact. We have already taken
significant action and I disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Whitty,
when he says that ECO is not working. It is early days. ECO works
alongside the Green Deal and ensures that help goes to low-income and
vulnerable households to enable them to heat their homes more
affordably. 
<?notus-xml column=407?>Energy efficiency measures have already helped 75,000 households this
year. It is a long-term programme and, as with all programmes that are
implemented over a long period of time, the results are going to be a
lot slower than perhaps one anticipates. However, that is because there
are a number of processes that people have to go
through.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307031000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0002.htm#1307031000078">As
part of the spending round, last week’s Government’s
spending review announced an increased budget of £320 million
for the warm home discount in 2015-16, which I hope makes clear our
commitment to continuing action to tackle fuel poverty. The warm home
discount reaches 2 million households a year, including more than 1
million of the poorest pensioners. It offers direct support when and
where it is needed the most. So we are already taking considerable
action.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1307031000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130702-gc0002.htm#1307031000079">Fuel
poverty is already covered, in part, by Clause 2(2)(e),

not lose sight of the impact on the fuel poor as we seek to ensure we
have a safe, secure, low-carbon future. There are issues with the
suggested amendments as drafted which mean I cannot accept them.

in really important points to make the case that I was trying to make.

really concerned me was that we have all sorts of legislation around

Energy Conservation Act. The Government have obligations under that to
do certain things, and those obligations will be affected by what is in
this Bill. We need to be quite clear on how we are going to deal with
it. As I and other noble Lords have indicated, some of the schemes that
brought quite a bit of help to those with homes that were not energy

the light of where we are going in the future and in the light of this

regard to vulnerable people. In this case, of course, I am concerned
with those who are vulnerable—one Member said they were not
comfortable with the expression “fuel poverty”—in
the sense that they cannot afford to keep their homes warm. As I said
at Second Reading, it is something I have campaigned on for 40 years,
and I am always disappointed. The NEA, the charity that champions the
cause of the fuel poor, hoped when it was set up that it would not
still be going 25 years later 
<?notus-xml column=408?>and that we could have done something about it. I hope that, at least in
this legislation, we can recognise that we have not done too well and
that we have to have regard to it. I look forward to what the Minister

to withdraw the

18, which is related to Amendment 19. I expect the noble Viscount, Lord
Ridley, will speak to the other amendments in this group, which I also
support. Climate change can be thought of at three levels. First, level
1: do you accept the orthodox view of the relationship between
CO<Sub>2</Sub><Sub> </Sub>and temperature? Secondly, level 2: do you
accept what we are told about the impact of any given temperature
increase on the planet? Thirdly, level 3: supposing you accept levels 1
and 2, do you believe that the right set of responses is being proposed
in the right order? In other words you can buy in completely, as I
think the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, does, to levels 1 and 2 but remain
largely a level 3 sceptic, which is where I started. Levels 1 and 2 are
really about Second Reading things, which we probably have discussed

will never agree to binding limits on their emissions while they have
hundreds of millions of their citizens yet to be lifted put of poverty.
Although China aims to reduce the carbon intensity of its output, its
growth is so fast that its emissions will continue to rise for many
years, as was made clear by its negotiator at Doha. Between them, India
and China are planning some 800 new coal stations. Without these two

noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, but I will mainly address my remarks to
Amendment 20. I declare my interests as detailed in the register, which
include not just coal, but also wood, which I shall criticise. The
purpose of Amendment 20 is simple and I hope helpful to the Minister.
It is to check that we do not buy the wrong technologies. The only
reason for investing in wind is to cut carbon emissions. After last
week’s strike price announcement, it cannot be to cut
electricity bills. If one were to assume that every megawatt hour from
wind displaces one from coal, the cost of carbon reduction from wind
will still be exceedingly high—well over £100 a
tonne.</hs_para>

make this assumption? There is now good evidence from other parts of
the world that wind does not achieve anything close to the emissions
cuts assumed by the Government. National Grid recently announced that
wind power had saved 
<?notus-xml column=411?>11 million tonnes of CO<Sub>2</Sub> emissions here over 18
months and little back-up fossil fuel was burned to compensate for the
intermittency of wind. Even if this were true, it is just 1.5% of our
emissions, but it is a most misleading calculation. It assumes that the
only fossil fuel needed to back up wind was that needed to compensate
for the discrepancy between forecast wind speed and actual wind speed.
That is only half the story.</hs_para>

another study soon to be published, from Ireland, finds that the actual
savings of CO<Sub>2</Sub> due to wind turbines are less than half of
those assumed by the National Grid, DECC and others. The intermittency
of wind results in more start-ups and shut-downs of gas plants, which
uses fuel less efficiently and so produces more CO<Sub>2</Sub>. This
problem is bound to get worse in the future because, as wind capacity

only that any tonne of carbon dioxide saved by wind is likely to cost
us £200 onshore or £300 offshore, but that there is grave

charcoal without cutting its thermal capacity much, but greatly
reducing its weight. You are effectively driving off its hydrogen and
oxygen as water. This is quite different from any need to dry the wood
first. That is another problem. Therefore, biomass plants operate at
25% thermal efficiency, compared to 35% to 40% for coal. I
stick to the argument that to burn wood is to generate more carbon

loss of biogas from larger AD plants that are ideal for the production
of LBM and thus bio-LNG fuel because of their scale. It is not
practical or economical to source an aggregate biomethane from small AD

binding targets on both renewable energy and greenhouse gas emissions.
Getting the balance of support for bioenergy under different mechanisms
is important and my noble friend is correct that at present the level
of support in the heat and power sectors is relatively higher than with
regard to transport. This recognises that the barriers and costs to
deployment are different across the economy. We need to maximise
renewable energy in all sectors in order to meet our legally binding
target of sourcing 15% of our energy from renewables by 2020. We will
continue to work across government in implementing the renewable energy
directive to consider the best deployment of renewables.</hs_para>

the UK should be transparent. However, I hope I can persuade my noble

that some see the glass half full and some see the glass half empty.
