confusion in the public mind between debt and deficit? Is it not the
case that the debt is going up because the deficit has been cut by only
one-third and that, consequently, the debt is going up by two-thirds of
the rate that we inherited? Does that not show that we must make more
determined efforts to cut the deficit and that the idea of Mr Balls
that we are cutting too fast and too much is certainly not the
case?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307291000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0001.htm#1307291000007"><Member ContinuationText="Lord Newby" PimsId="2095" UID="1307291000061" xid="1358" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0001.htm#1307291000061"><B>Lord

House that in the financial year 2011-12 the net debt was £1,106
billion. On current plans, by 2017-18, when the percentage of GDP
starts to fall, it will be £1,637 billion, so the noble Lord

point.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307291000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0001.htm#1307291000008"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Peston" PimsId="165" UID="1307291000062" xid="1171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0001.htm#1307291000062">Lord
Peston:</Member></B> My Lords, is the noble Lord aware that research
evidence shows categorically that if you want to get the debt to GDP
ratio down, the vital ingredient is to increase the rate of growth of
GDP? That is the way to do it. Measures such as raising taxes or
cutting the deficit by cutting large chunks of public expenditure
simply do not work. Overall, the lesson 
<?notus-xml column=1532?>we have to learn is that an austerity package is not required; a package
concentrating on raising GDP is the correct
policy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307291000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0001.htm#1307291000009"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T14:39:59"></hs_TimeCode><Member ContinuationText="Lord Newby" PimsId="2095" UID="1307291000063" xid="1358" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0001.htm#1307291000063"><B>Lord

therefore have been very pleased to have seen the growth figures last
week. I point out to the House that a key factor in growth is the level
of interest that people have to pay and that, as a result of the
Government’s decisive action in 2010, interest rates have fallen
compared with the forecast, as a result of which we will, by 2015-16,
have paid £31 billion less in interest payments than was
expected in 2010-11.</hs_para>

McFall of </B><B>Alcluith</B><B>:</B></Member> My Lords, the Minister
has recognised that the public debt that this Government inherited in
2010 will be greater when they leave office in 2015. No less a figure
than the editor of the <I>Spectator</I> has said that the amount of
debt that this coalition Government will borrow will be greater than
the total amount of debt of the Labour Government in their
13 years from 1997. Is it not the case that there is not a
deficit reduction strategy but a growth reduction strategy, which has
been the most successful in history? This Government need to
acknowledge that and do something about it.</hs_para>

</B><B>Newby</B><B>:</B></Member> My Lords, I disagree with virtually
all of that. As I pointed out earlier, during the five years of this

noble Lord is suggesting that we should have borrowed even
more.</hs_para>

Howell of </B><B>Guildford</B><B>:</B></Member> Is not the noble Lord,
Lord Peston, leading us all into a bit of a false dichotomy? Of course
we want economic growth, and we are getting a little now. The growth is
coming back, as the noble Lord will have seen from the newspapers.
Although we would obviously like more of it, growth depends on getting
the debt curbed and on getting public expenditure under control. These
things are not opposites or choices but all have to go together. Surely
the noble Lord, who is a very good teacher and an expert, should be
teaching us that. That is what he should be telling your
Lordships.</hs_para>

Peston, is an extremely eminent economist and he knows, as a good
Keynesian, that the key at this point 
<?notus-xml column=1533?>of the cycle is the change in animal spirits—the sense to which
people have confidence to invest. Animal spirits have been very
significantly subdued over recent years. There is a suggestion in every
single figure that we now see that they are returning to the positive.
That, more than any single thing that the Government now do, will be
what drives growth
forward.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307291000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0001.htm#1307291000016"><Member ContinuationText="Lord Hughes of Woodside" PimsId="1055" UID="1307291000070" xid="1276" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0001.htm#1307291000070"><B>Lord
Hughes of </B><B>Woodside</B><B>:</B></Member> My Lords, the Minister

Newby:</Member></B> I do, my Lords, but with interest rates you cannot
have it both ways. You cannot have low interest rates for people who
want to borrow and high interest rates for those who want to save. On
balance, the Government’s view is that having had interest rates
low has kept families being able to spend, compared with having higher
interest rates. For example, a 1% increase in mortgage rates
would have added £12 billion per year to interest payments. It
would have sucked that out of the economy. If you have that kind of
reduction in expenditure and the kind of diminution of growth which it
entails it harms everybody, even those who are
savers.</hs_para>

issues. First, I can assure him that the process of reform is ongoing.
This Government have been able to negotiate a number of issues in
favour of the United Kingdom’s position. On the position in
Europe about whether there will be a treaty change in due course, views
differ. The Italian Prime Minister, Mr Enrico Letta, said recently that
we need a more flexible Europe, that the role Britain plays in the
European Union is a positive one, and that he thinks that treaty change
can be achieved in the near future. The noble Lord will also be
familiar with the statements from President Barroso and the plan
published by the four Presidents in December last year, which again
clearly show that the possibility of a treaty is definitely
there.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307291000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0001.htm#1307291000023"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Clarke of Hampstead" PimsId="2622" UID="1307291000078" xid="1806" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0001.htm#1307291000078">Lord

against small businesses. Does this matter concern the Government? The

then. There might even be a new treaty—the Germans are already
talking along those lines—that might be under negotiation in

the Government to stop taking decisions on European policy that are

over 10 years; that is six too many, I readily acknowledge. We also now
have an all-time low of young people in custody, for which both
Administrations and those working in the youth justice system should
take credit; there are fewer than 1,400 in custody, including only a
handful of girls. However, the noble Lord is absolutely right that we
are dealing with young people who, as well as often having a great
capacity for violence against other people and self-harm, are extremely
vulnerable and quite often exhibit mentally unstable behaviour. We are
bringing in both initial and ongoing assessments to try to make sure
that we can identify those who are at risk of either self-harm or,
ultimately, of killing themselves. Looking at the briefing on this, an
awful lot of hard work and deep study is going on, with the realisation
of exactly the problem that the noble Lord highlights: these are

Carrying on the policy of the previous Administration, we have tried to

physical intervention and with the maximum attention on trying to
manage difficult situations. A lot of the training addresses how the

commitment to provide access to liaison and diversion services for
offenders of all ages who come into contact with the youth justice and
criminal justice systems by 2014. A national liaison and diversion
development network has been created, bringing together 101 sites for
adults and young people with the aim of aligning service provisions
where appropriate, while recognising the different pathways required
for different ages. There are 37 youth pathfinder sites in this
operation. The sites screen young people under suspicion of committing
an offence, whether in police custody suites or in custody, and this
will be followed by a full health assessment capable of identifying a
range of
vulnerabilities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T15:00:58"></hs_TimeCode>.

aiding this process. The Government are taking the necessary steps to
ensure that we have enough capacity to maintain a secure electricity
supply at the most economic cost to the consumer. This will be achieved

Energy Bill to avoid future shortages of electricity supply. However,
as my noble friend has pointed out, these measures cannot come into
effect until 2018. Meanwhile, Ofgem, in its report of 27 June, has
pointed that reserve electricity capacity could fall as low as 2% by
the winter of 2015. This has been brought about by more capacity being
closed or mothballed than new plant coming in. Could not a better
balance have been achieved, bearing in mind that Ofgem has been warning

a greater diversity in the supply of energy. A key part of balancing
the service is the short-term operating reserve that we already have.

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, the NHS 111 service is not
unsafe—it is a safe service. In the vast majority of the country
it has been provided very well for patients. We were confident that the
service could be provided well, and so it has proved. The isolated
cases where the service has fallen short are highly regrettable, but
there is no issue about the quality of NHS Direct’s provision of
NHS 111. I am afraid the issue there is that it got its sums wrong and
cannot provide the service

very carefully at the GP contract. I cannot tell him at the moment how
far negotiations have reached, because we are only at the start of the

Reid of Cardowan:</Member></B> My Lords, may I gently advise the
Minister against complacency? Many of these changes in the NHS will
take time to show whether they are beneficial or otherwise.
Anecdotally, the successor of NHS Direct—111—appears to
be  in turmoil, both practically and commercially. The
deterioration in accident and emergency services is getting
exponentially greater; trolley waits are back, and predicted
potentially to reach crisis point. Sir Bruce Keogh’s report, if
read carefully, identifies as underpinning many of the problems in the
major hospitals a chronic shortage of skills and finance. Can I please
ask the Minister not to accept this with any degree of complacency and
to introduce some scheme of forensic appraisal of 111 and some of the
other issues which are arising from what looks increasingly like a
costly and disastrous reorganisation of the

complacent, and I certainly am not. Whenever problems and concerns
arise, we take them extremely seriously. I do not think anyone takes
issue with the concept of 111. Unfortunately, however, we have seen
problems arising in a few isolated cases. I emphasise that the vast
majority of the country is receiving a good service. Incidentally,
there is no evidence that attendances at A&amp;E have been affected by
the rollout of 111; in fact, attendances have not increased since 111

there is a very distinct difference between NHS Direct’s old

from 111 was excellent, in York. At the same time not only did the

Scott of Foscote:</Member></hs_speaker> Before your Lordships pronounce
on the satisfactory or unsatisfactory quality of these regulations, I
have a point which I endeavoured to make when these Motions were
debated in the Moses Room a week or so ago. It relates to the provision
regarding the appointment of members of selection committees, whose job
it will be, once the committees have been established, to deal with the
applications for appointments to senior judicial roles. The arrangement
is that senior judges—the president, the Lord Chief Justice, the
Masters of the Rolls or whoever it may be—will have the power to
nominate the members of these commissions. However, the regulations go
on to say that, in the event that the Lord Chancellor of the day is of
the opinion that the senior judge in question suffers from an
incapacity—presumably an incapacity to discharge the role of
nominating members of the commissions—somebody else has that
power.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1307293000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0001.htm#1307293000023">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T15:20:32"></hs_TimeCode>
am bound to say that, when I first read these regulations, I thought it
was thoroughly unsatisfactory for a senior member of the Executive to
have the power to pronounce on his or her belief in the incapacity 
<?notus-xml column=1545?>of a senior judge to discharge a statutory function that would otherwise
be exercisable by that judge. I made this point in the course of the
debate in the Moses Room and, since then, the noble Lord, Lord McNally,
has been kind enough to write me a letter about these points. He drew
my attention to similar provisions that can be found in primary
legislation—in particular, the Constitutional Reform Act 2005
but there was another Act that he referred to where similar provisions
are to be found<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T15:21:30"></hs_TimeCode>.
I was not aware of that. It is profoundly unsatisfactory that
provisions of that sort allow a member of the Executive to remove
powers from a senior judge on the Executive member’s belief in
the incapacity of the judge to exercise those powers without any
apparent necessity for the opinion to be backed up by medical evidence
or psychiatric evidence. It is not consistent with the constitutional
requirement of the separation of powers and I voice these objections
now.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1307293000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0001.htm#1307293000024">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T15:22:14"></hs_TimeCode>
sting is taken away by the fact that similar provisions have already
found their way into primary legislation but, nonetheless, the
existence of these provisions is unsatisfactory. I wish I had known
that they were there in primary legislation. I would have taken the
same objections at that stage. It is difficult to see why the opinion
of a Lord Chancellor, who is not a medical person or necessarily
even<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T15:22:47"></hs_TimeCode> a lawyer,
on the incapacity of a senior judge to exercise a particular statutory
function should by itself be enough to relieve the individual of the
power to exercise that function. The House should be aware of this
matter before allowing these regulations into legislation. I am not
proposing that the regulations should be voted down but the House

Lords, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scott, goes even further than
he did in Committee. These matters are not unconstitutional. Let me be
clear that the role of the Lord Chancellor to determine the incapacity
of the Lord Chief Justice and the President of the Supreme Court is not
newly created by these regulations. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord
Scott, has acknowledged, this role is already set out in extant primary
legislation. It is also true that these regulations come before the
House after extensive discussions with the President of the Supreme
Court and the Lord Chief Justice. The regulations have been examined in
detail by the Justice Committee and I think by the Constitution
Committee of this House—but I may be wrong on that. Certainly,
they have gone through quite a thorough mincer of committees and they
were discussed in Committee in the Moses Room.</hs_para>

Lord Chancellor’s letter to the Scrutiny Committee set out in
some detail why the normal procedure for determining incapacity of the
Lord Chief Justice was not appropriate in these circumstances. In
short, the heads of division who normally make this determination may
themselves be applicants in the appointment process in question.
Therefore, to ensure there is no perception of conflict of interest,
they do not have a role. It may also be helpful if I explain why we
consider it entirely appropriate for the Lord Chancellor to determine 
<?notus-xml column=1546?>incapacity. The Lord Chancellor has a significant number of
responsibilities through the process from requesting a panel is
convened, determining the content of the panel’s report and, of
course, making the final selection decision. The system is therefore
reliant on the Lord Chancellor discharging a range of duties and powers
appropriately. The Lord Chancellor, under Section 3 of the
Constitutional Reform Act, also has a statutory duty to protect the
independence of the judiciary. Therefore, if the Lord Chancellor were
to determine incapacity where that was not in fact the case, this would
be a breach of that duty. This means that in reality it is very likely
that the Lord Chancellor would consult the relevant members of the
judiciary to determine incapacity, but we do not consider it necessary
to spell out the nature of that consultation in the regulations. That
is particularly the case as relevant persons may be different in
different

regards determining the Lord Chief Justice’s incapacity, it may
be appropriate to consult him or her personally to determine whether,

be appropriate to consult the President of the Supreme

Lords, the purpose of this amendment is to give us a chance to discuss
the funding of social care and the Bill’s provisions before we
complete Committee, particularly given the continuing concerns that
social care is seriously underfunded and is not in a good position to
take on the changes—good changes, I should emphasise—in
the Bill. Those concerns have been around for a long time and formed a
major part of the evidence presented to the Dilnot committee and the
Joint Select Committee on the draft Bill. I declare an interest in that
I was a member of both those
bodies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T15:29:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307296000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0001.htm#1307296000002">On
the whole, most people support the basic architecture of the Dilnot
report and the Law Commission’s proposals enshrined in the Bill.
They simply do not believe that the funding is in place to implement
effectively the Bill’s good intentions. They remain unconvinced
by the Government’s assurances on funding. This is hardly
surprising, because the Government’s social care funding
strategy seems almost designed to confuse. Eric Pickles curries favour
with the Chancellor by signing up to swingeing cuts to local authority
grants, which inevitably reduces social care funding substantially.
Health Secretaries—quite sensibly in my view—then start
slipping cheques from the NHS to local government to mitigate, to some
extent, the Pickles butchery. Welcome as these cheques may
be—but probably not to NHS England—they usually have
strings attached and do not make good the shrinking base budget of
adult social care, which, I have to mention to my noble friends, has
been taking place since before the coalition Government.</hs_para>

the problems of funding adult social care predate the coalition, as the

know that the funding of social care for older people has not kept pace
with that of the NHS. In the 15 years from 1994-95 to 2009-10, real
spending on adult social care increased by around 70% for older people
while, over the same period, real spending in the NHS has risen by
almost
110%”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="1307296000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0001.htm#1307296000004">Before
the coalition, pay and prices in social care rose more quickly than
general inflation. There was—and continues to be—rising
demand as the number of older people and younger adults with care needs
increases. Social care budgets rose by about 1% a year in real terms in
the three years to 2010, compared with 5% to 6% for the NHS. We in the
Dilnot commission showed that in the four years to 2010, demand
outstripped expenditure by about 9%. We went on to say that in the
future this approach to funding would need to change.
However—and this is bad news for the Benches opposite—it
has not.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="1307296000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0001.htm#1307296000005">The
funding shortfall that the coalition inherited, of approaching
£1 billion, has got worse. The LGA has estimated that just to
keep up with demographic demand adult social care needs real-terms
annual increases of about £0.5 billion a year. To put right the
deficit and stop it getting worse, adult social care should start the
next financial year, 2014-15, with a base budget at least £2.5
billion higher in real terms than in 2010. The reality is somewhat
different.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1307296000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0001.htm#1307296000006">The
latest survey that I have seen from the directors of adult social
services states that by next April local councils will have stripped
£2.7 billion out of their adult social care budgets since 2010.
I have heard 
<?notus-xml column=1548?>Health Ministers say that this is being done by efficiency
savings—so that is all right then. In practice, it has been done
by denying people services, imposing tougher eligibility criteria and
cutting pay and payments to service providers, with their impact on
quality. These cuts have been mitigated by transfers the Government are
making from the NHS by the start of 2014-15. On the basis of
parliamentary Answers given to me, these look to amount to £1.5

Government have not made good from the NHS what they have taken out,
and have not protected the base budget against rising demand and
inflation—something that the Dilnot commission said was
essential if its proposals were to be implemented. My estimate is that
adult social care starts 2014-15 with an underfunded base budget of at
least £3 billion—some 20% of its
budget.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307296000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0001.htm#1307296000008">I now
turn to whether things get better between April 2014 and 2016, when the
main implementation of the Bill’s proposals starts. Before the
2013 spending review, a parliamentary Answer to me suggested that
approaching £0.9 billion would be transferred from the NHS to
social care in 2014-15. Page 34 of the Government’s <I>Spending
Round 2013</I>, suggests that another £200 million would be
provided to progress the new pool budget scheme. However local councils
still have to make another lot of savings in 2014-15, so it is
difficult to see these not wiping out at least half of the transferred
NHS
largesse.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307296000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0001.htm#1307296000009">However,
to be fairly generous to the Government, the £3 billion base
budget deficit could drop to £2.5 billion by the
beginning of 2016, assuming that the Government make the transfers that
they promised. It therefore seems to me that, however you cut the
figures, there is a pretty big hole in the base budget for adult social
care in the year in which the first tranche of the Bill’s
reforms begin. I am of course happy for the Government to provide me
with chapter and verse in writing on why my figures are

briefly to the cavalry that the Government think is coming over the
horizon—their proposal for a £3.8 billion pooled budget
for 2015-16 to join up local health and social care services. Everyone
in this House will welcome that pooled budget. I particularly welcome
it as someone who was involved with the joint finance initiative of
Barbara Castle, back in the mid-1970s. In some ways, we have not moved
on very far. There is a considerable lack of clarity about this
impressive-sounding figure. I therefore have some questions for the
Minister<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T15:36:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

whether the total figure is dependent on the Department of Health
making all the efficiency savings cited on page 34 of <I>Spending Round
2013</I> and is safeguarded from any raiding to meet emergency demands
by the NHS? Secondly, does the £2 billion that seems to be being
promised to local councils for adult social care include the
£335 million promised for the cap in 2015-16, as set out in
paragraph 9 of the Government’s very recent document,<I> Caring

billion at the beginning of the financial year, and how much of that
will in practice be offset by the 2.3% reduction in local government 
<?notus-xml column=1549?>spending in 2015-16, as set out in page 37 of the spending review
document? This is typical of what we are seeing from the
Government. Page 34 gives you some money and page
37 takes another lot away through another government department. It is
a bit like the guys who practise conjuring with peas under egg cups.
Finally, can the Minister confirm that £1 billion of
the £3.8 billion will be paid only if local authorities can
demonstrate outcomes? Therefore, in practice, the money may never reach
the local level in
2015-16<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T15:37:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

battle-hardened Whitehall warrior, I have to say that I suspect that
the social care chunk of the £3.8 billion will look a lot
smaller when we get to 2015-16. In principle, it is a bold and sensible
initiative on which the Government are to be congratulated. However, it
will not plug the gap in the base budget to which the Dilnot commission
drew attention, and which has worsened since we reported. It is
possible that the gap could be partially filled by the pooled budget
proposal but a lot of question marks remain over how much of that
budget will in practice help social care in 2015-16. I have to say to
the Government that because of the funding inadequacies there is a real
risk that people will be set up to fail with this new legislation. That
is why the Government and, I hope, my own Front Bench should support an
impartial review of the funding issues, as proposed in my amendment. I

feel in my role as a campaigner and spokesperson for carers—and
this is my second point. The Bill is all that I could have dreamed of

if all that results are fewer services that are harder to access, with
more pressure being put on carers to do the caring. I am seeing that

some less noticed factors all point the same way and add to the

in the care sector of 1 million workers—that is 35% of the
current workforce. That is assuming that the Government’s
immigration policy does not bite even more sharply than we think. You
have only to go into a home to see how they are kept going by caring
people who have come from overseas and are willing to work for the
minimum wage, or near it, to look after our older people for us. Given
the Government’s policy, these people will increasingly not be
available for this purpose and so wages will inevitably go up. That
will be a good thing because these people are terribly underpaid for
what they do—it amazes me that the services are as good as they
are, not that they occasionally fall short—but the cost to the
Government is very sensitive to wages: it is the main expense because

it will be much more difficult under the Bill’s scheme, because
at the moment self-funders have no idea what the local authorities are
paying for the

hear the Minister confirm that under the Bill, self-funders will be

received the absolute minimum of care in sometimes frightful
situations. That was the standard of the day. Today, there are some
extremely good care homes. My spirits are lifted every time I visit the
care home in Oxford where my mum is because the standards are so
wonderfully high—not that they are within the range of what the
fees the local authority pays would provide, but they are high. The
worst are dreadful and occasionally get exposed, but the majority, I
would say, are so-so. They have strengths, they have weaknesses; they

funded—and not just by funds transferred from an increasingly
strained health service. As has been reiterated many times throughout
the debates on this Bill, social care is in crisis. In the past few
years, as the Care and Support Alliance has shown, many tens of
thousands of people have lost vital services as a result of tighter
eligibility criteria. Their needs have not changed; they have simply
been redefined out of care, leaving them in many cases more isolated

then for a reassurance that their fears were not justified and that the
transition funding would not finish after one year. Sadly, he was
unable to give any such reassurance, so the situation for more than
20,000 severely disabled people threatens to become much worse. As we

squeezed across the north. It made me realise that councils in the
north find it laughable that the cap of £72,000 for care should
have any meaning for the citizens who live there. The outlook in the
north is totally different from that in the more prosperous south. It

really getting a response yet from the noble Earl, that the moment that
self-funders become aware that they are essentially subsidising the

absolutely convinced that self-funders will express the view that they
ain’t going to put up with it. I wonder whether the Government 
<?notus-xml column=1555?>have thought through the implications of that. I doubt that they have,
but those implications will have to be thought through. People will not
find it acceptable to be paying above the local authority rate, then
taking longer to get to the £72,000 cap, and then finding that
the local authority will fund them only at its rate, with potential
consequences for where they can be provided with care. It will possibly
not be in the care home to which they have already been paying for
their own resources. There is real concern about the financial
implications of the Bill, which noble Lords all generally welcome, and
the fact that the gap between the expectation and the reality could be

confronted by the very difficult funding pressures that are on local
authorities at the moment. Noble Lords have spoken eloquently about
that. My noble friend Lady Bakewell pointed to the differential funding
as a result of the Government’s change in formula as far as
local authorities are concerned. That is why the Labour Party has
called for £1.2 billion of NHS underspend to be
transferred to social care over the next two years. However, that is
just the start. We are going to see major demographic challenges, which
will affect the NHS as much as social care. That is why my noble
friend’s amendment has so much ingenuity in suggesting that the
Office for Budget Responsibility be asked to complete a review of

NHS funding as well. I was very interested in a piece in the
<I>Independent</I> this morning, emanating from Sir Bruce Keogh. It
pointed out that for the NHS since 1948, the amount of money that has
been made available has gone up by an average of about 4.5% a year.
Now, he says, we are looking at no increase at all. I am not sure that
the bodies for which the noble Earl’s department is responsible
have woken up to that. For instance, NICE continues to produce guidance
which, if implemented, would cost more money. The reports coming from
royal colleges and the Keogh review of the 14 trusts talk a lot about
staffing deficiencies, but the whole thrust still coming from these
reports is to increase expenditure. There is genuine concern that we
are talking up the expectation on health and social care knowing that
at the moment we cannot see our way to finding where the resources are
going to be. Without making this too much of a political debate, I
thought that Mr Lansley’s comments in the run-up to the previous

do not believe that such a review would be necessary or desirable. As
noble Lords will be aware, the Government recently announced the

decisions on care and support funding are taken by the Government at
the same time as spending plans are set for all areas of government. It

publish an annual fiscal sustainability report. The most recent of

been roughly flat over the period since 2010-11. The latest survey
shows that councils are expecting a small increase in expenditure next
year. The survey also shows that the vast majority of the savings that
have been made have been efficiencies. Councils have largely been able
to protect services. They should now, however, be looking at how they
can transform care by innovating and exploring new ways of working.

answer one or two of the questions posed by the noble Lord, Lord
Warner, on the £3.8 billion pooled budget, half of this fund is
made up of funding that is currently spent across the health and social
care system on areas relevant to both services, while the other half,
nearly £2 billion, is additional NHS money. To access this
funding, all areas will need to produce local plans, signed off by the
NHS and local authorities, for how the money will be used across health
and social care. These plans must demonstrate that social care services
will be
protected<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T16:15:16"></hs_TimeCode>.
Furthermore, £1 billion of the funding will be linked to
outcomes achieved, as I have outlined, based on a combination of
locally and nationally set outcome measures. Half of that funding will
be paid at the beginning of the year, based on performance in the
previous year, and the remainder will be paid in arrears against the
performance in
year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T16:15:37"></hs_TimeCode>. The noble
Lord, Lord Warner, asked me about that. To flesh it out a little more,
we are working with our partners in the sector, including NHS England
and the Local Government Association, on the detail of the pooled
budgets, but the principle is that only £1 billion will be
subject to payment by performance. All the pooled budget will be
subject to local areas, protecting social care—that is a key
point—helping to ensure that the money does not just compensate
for cuts to social care

whether the pooled budget includes £335 million that we have

individuals have chosen premium facilities or because the local

a large number of people. The Government are clear that local
authorities should have regard to the cost of care when setting their

whether that is not a legitimisation of what happens. Most
organisations representing self-funders feel that the higher premium
they pay is actually subsidising the rates paid by local authorities.

the Bill adequately addresses the disparity of care and support across

national eligibility criteria. That, of itself, will provide greater
transparency and consistency for people across the country. I do not
think that we will ever completely get away from variation in what
local authorities are prepared to consider adequately meets the needs
of individuals and we will see some independence of decision-making,

top of the spending-round announcements, I believe that the Bill will
have a positive effect on the NHS by strengthening joint working
between health and care and support. For example, Clause 3 requires
local authorities to exercise their functions with a view to ensuring
integration between health and care. In addition, Clause 2 creates a
clear legal duty on local authorities to ensure the provision of
preventive services. We want a service that reduces dependency, as well
as supporting those who already need care and support, rather than just
waiting for people to reach a crisis point. By slowing and preventing
the development of care needs, the onset of health conditions or the
loss of independence, we believe that preventive care can increase
quality of life for individuals, while having the potential to provide
longer-term financial savings to the public purse. It is only with this
greater focus on prevention and integration that both the NHS and care
and support can respond to the financial pressures of an ageing

half of the £1 billion of the rest will be paid up front, while

care. Then Health Ministers, almost in desperation and worried about
the implications for the NHS of what is happening to social care, long
before they were betting the farm on integrated care,
are—perfectly understandably—starting to slide money
across to prop up social care. That is what is going on. If I were a
director of social services these days, I would find it rather
difficult to plan my service response to a kind of resource allocation

Dubs:</Member></B> My Lords, it is very clear that this Bill puts upon
local authorities enormously complex duties as regards assessing the
care needs of disabled people. The way in which local authorities
exercise those decisions will have a major impact upon the lives of
elderly and disabled people and may well occasionally be unjust or
factually inaccurate. This will not be deliberate, but it sometimes
happens in the nature of decisions that are so difficult and sensitive.
The purpose of my amendment is to give the Government a duty to set up
a tribunal system for issues such as individual eligibility, care
plans, the level of personal budgets, and cases where individuals
believe local authorities have made errors of fact or law in their
decisions. Issues such as these can be challenged and put to the test.
It is a complex area and I say at the outset that this is a probing
amendment. Although it is quite detailed, I appreciate that the issues
are difficult and will need further thought. I am anxious to see what
the Government’s response is at this
stage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307296000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0001.htm#1307296000076">It
hardly needs to be said how crucial these decisions are for elderly and
disabled people. The system is hard for individuals to navigate. People
often feel that they are powerless in the face of such a complex
system. Where people lose out, in terms of the assessment made of them,
they can in the worst cases feel trapped in their own homes, unable to
get to work, unable to get out, depressed, and perhaps even suicidal.
The consequences can be very serious indeed. They may be left in a
vulnerable position without any ability to achieve redress.</hs_para>

there are other ways of doing this, such as going back to the local
authority and persuading it that it has made a mistake. That is not
very easy to do. One might be able to require the local authorities to
have a route by which individuals can formally request reconsideration
of care decisions where they believe an error of law or fact has been
made. Again, this is not an easy thing to do. One might even go one
step further and require local authorities to convene an independent
panel to consider social care decisions where there is a dispute
between an individual and the local authority. In theory, such options
might work; but in practice one would have to be absolutely convinced
that every local authority would do it, and do it properly. I am bound
to say that although some local authorities might be willing to move in
this direction, I am not convinced they all
would.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307296000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0001.htm#1307296000079">The
difficulty is that there are alternatives. One alternative is judicial
review. However, we do not want to be standing here and telling elderly
and disabled people to go through the costly business of a judicial
review in order to get redress for what ought to be a simple procedure.
Although my amendment is fairly lengthy, what I have in mind is a
process that should be simple. Not all tribunals need to be
complicated. Indeed, we know in the scheme of things that some
tribunals can work quickly, efficiently and in not too costly a manner.
I hope the Government will not say that people can take the option of
judicial review and that is okay, because I do not believe it would be.
In any case, going for judicial review would be a costly additional
burden for local authorities, and I do not think anybody wants
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307296000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0001.htm#1307296000080">Let me
repeat—it is inevitable that, on a national scale, some mistakes

I do not want to say to the Government, or to my friends in the Labour

am aware that the costs must be of concern, and I do not want to stand
here urging that something costly should be set up. But having some
proper tribunal system of redress would be a much better way in which
to resolve issues than to ask people to approach the local authority,
and I do not believe that we would be left with all that many cases,
anyway. I am hopeful, and I hope not excessively optimistic, that the
tribunal system would be there in place for a few cases that could not
be resolved in any other way. An appeal option must be a feature of any

Beecham:</Member></B> My Lords, I have a lot of sympathy with the case
that my noble friend has put in establishing the structure that would
permit appeals. However, there is one potential problem. I endorse what
he says about the undesirability of requiring people ultimately to have
recourse to judicial review, which is a lengthy and very expensive
process. However, it is likely that people wishing to make an appeal to
such a tribunal would need at least legal advice and, possibly, legal
aid. I would imagine, as matters stand, that such a procedure would be
out of scope of the legal aid system as it has been
“reformed”—I put that word between inverted
commas. Perhaps the Minister and my noble friend could indicate whether
they think that it would be a sensible addition to the terms of the

Warner:</Member></B> My Lords, I briefly intervene from the perspective
of a member of the Joint Select Committee, which proposed that there
should be some kind of body. Much of our thinking was focused on the
early days of these new arrangements. We thought it highly unlikely
that there would not be a lot of disputes in the first few years of
what would be a pretty major change to the arrangements. There are two
sources of potential dispute—those by people who do not like the
results of an assessment made about them, in some form or another, and
some of the stuff that comes out of making markets. There is the issue
of the rate for the job between local authorities and providers. We
could see some of those areas also leading to
disputes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T16:39:24"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T16:39:15"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T16:38:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that, in the longer term, things will settle down and there will not be
a great problem. However, even if the Minister is not prepared to
accept my noble friend’s amendment and make statutory provision,
the world would be reassured if the Government at least had a plan B so
that we do not end up with judicial review if things do not go well.
Rather, we end up with some kind of arbitration system which is low

Hunt of Kings Heath:</Member></hs_speaker> My Lords, subject to later
comments about funding and the issues raised by my noble friend Lord
Beecham, I have a great deal of sympathy with my noble friend Lord Dubs
in wanting to have some kind of transparent appeal decision. It is
clear from our debates on the Bill that local authorities will be
called upon to make decisions which will have a fundamental impact on
people living in their local authority area—eligibility, care
plans, personal budgets, support for carers, self-funders baseline
assessment and many more. We know that this will be hard for many
people and their families to navigate. At the moment, it appears that
the Government are relying either on local authorities themselves to
develop their own mechanism, which might not enjoy public confidence,
or on referrals to the Local Government Ombudsman. As my noble friend
Lord Dubs says, that would be on the basis of maladministration rather
than, perhaps, on the facts of the case.</hs_para>

review is hardly an option for many people. The reduction in legal aid
will have an impact on the ability of places such as law centres to
take JR cases forward on behalf of clients. I am the patron of
Birmingham Law Centre, which has had to close its doors. In the last
few years, the law centre was able to undertake a number of JR cases
but it is no longer there to do that. The availability of a simple,
low-cost appeal system would command some support.</hs_para>

We know that these tribunal systems have been used more frequently with
the introduction of the new arrangements. They command some public
confidence. While I do not want to add to the financial burden on the
system as a whole, I wonder whether it would be cost effective, as my
noble friend Lord Warner says, for there to be a simple, fast, low-cost
system. This will give people some confidence that, where they felt
that the local authority had not made a reasonable decision, there
would be allowance for it to be reconsidered. I am sure that this is a
matter for discussion between Committee and Report and perhaps the

As he has explained, the purpose of Amendment 104ZE is to include in
the Bill provision for adults to make an appeal to the First-tier
Tribunal if they disagree with the local authority about its decisions
relating to matters such as eligibility, financial assessments, care
and support plans and other obligations under this Bill. Often the
individuals who access the care system are some of the most vulnerable
in our society and it can seem daunting to challenge the decision of
the local authority. I entirely agree that it is important that such
people have the opportunity to make their voice heard if they feel
that  
<?notus-xml column=1566?>the local authority has reached the wrong decision in their case and
that their argument is given the fullest consideration before a
transparent, fair outcome is reached. The changes which the Bill would
bring about will result in many more people being brought into contact

now reviewing the current arrangements regarding
complaints.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307296000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0001.htm#1307296000091">The
current complaints arrangements for adult care and support were

However, our initial consideration of the benefits and disadvantages of
introducing a tribunal process, as this amendment proposes, is that
this would be likely to slow down the process of resolving complaints

Patel of Bradford:</Member></B> My Lords, my amendment affects Clause
68(5), which aims to provide a definition of aftercare services as they
relate to Section 117 of the Mental Health Act 1983. It was only just
over 12 months ago, while debating amendments to the Health
and Social Care Bill, that I was concerned about elements of that
legislation affecting Section 117, which could have had a
detrimental effect on the recovery of mental health patients. So it is
a little disappointing that we have to rehearse some of those earlier
arguments again today.</hs_para>

from the outset that this is not a probing amendment, nor does it seek
assurance or clarification. It is an amendment that I believe is
essential, and unless the noble Earl or the noble Baroness can persuade
me of a better form of words, they should look to accept it. I will
also tell the Minister from the outset that we are on the same side on
this issue. We both want the same outcome, which is that this extremely
vulnerable group of people covered by Section 117 gets access to all
the help and services that it needs.</hs_para>

in his speech at Second Reading, the Government have already redrafted
the original wording of the clause in response to the many concerns of
mental health organisations in the country. However, it is clear to me
and to them that we still need to do more to protect and safeguard this
essential statutory provision. I apologise if I speak at length on this
amendment, but it is essential that I make my case. I will try to be as
logical in my arguments as possible; therefore, I will first outline
why Section 117 is a unique statutory provision and needs the

have.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307296000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0001.htm#1307296000107">Secondly,

thanks to members of the Law Society, especially Sophy Miles, the chair
of the mental health and disability committee and counsel from the
Mental Health Lawyers Association. It is also important that the
Minister knows that I have received advice from Nicola Mackintosh, a
principal solicitor, who is widely recognised as a national expert in
community care, health and mental health law. I have taken seriously
all their views on this

117 of the Mental Health Act all about and why is it unique? As noble
Lords will be aware, that section concerns the provision of aftercare
services for people who are discharged from hospital treatment after a
period of compulsory detention in hospital. Parliament placed a joint
duty on health services and local authorities to provide that
aftercare. The group of people to whom Section 117 applies are the most
vulnerable in the mental health system. They have been detained in
hospital for psychiatric treatment following an established diagnosis.
There are two groups, one of which is made up of those detained under
Section 3 of the Act, and the other of those detained by the criminal
justice system for in-patient treatment. It is likely that those in
both groups will have had extensive previous contact with psychiatric
services and support, which have failed them and been unsuccessful,
hence they require longer-term detention for
treatment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T16:56:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

groups at the highest level of vulnerability because of risks to
themselves, including their own health, or others. They are in a
special group that has been recognised by Parliament as such. Among the
statutory provisions in community care and healthcare law, Section 117
is unique in several respects. First, it relates to the duty owed to a
particular individual. Secondly, it arises only in limited
circumstances and for a very specific group of people, and is not a
target duty. Thirdly, it is a joint duty placed on the relevant health
authority and the social services body to work together to provide
appropriate aftercare services, free of charge and for as long as
necessary, and to sort out the funding between them. The aim has been
to ensure that the group of people to whom the duty is owed receives
the services at the time that they are needed, thereby avoiding
extensive disputes about whether health or social care agencies are
responsible<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T16:57:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

code goes on to provide a fairly comprehensive list of factors for
professionals to consider when creating an aftercare package. These
include patients’ psychological and mental health needs,
physical healthcare, daytime activities, appropriate accommodation,
assistance in welfare rights and managing financing, social and
cultural needs and specific needs arising from drinking alcohol. The
services cannot be withdrawn until both

example. A man was sectioned in 1996 when he was very unwell. Since
that time, he has been stable and in receipt of joint supervision and
support by the then primary care trust and social services. He lives in
a London borough and qualifies for Section 117 aftercare because he was
previously detained under the Mental Health Act. He is in a supported
placement funded by social services. His social services care
co-ordinator decided that he could be discharged from the care home and
that there should be a review of the duty under Section 117 to provide
aftercare. However, the patient’s psychiatrist strongly opposed
this move, stating that his condition was only partially controlled by
medication and that he continued to have challenging behaviour as a
result of his condition. The psychiatrist strongly believed that the
joint duty was still required, as was funding under Section 117,
because the patient needed the supervision and safe environment that
was provided in the care home. As a result, that duty to the patient
has remained and he continues to reside in the care
home<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T16:59:12"></hs_TimeCode>. This
example shows that the effective healthcare being provided to keep the
patient stable and safe was directly dependent on the social care.
However, social services saw only that he was managing in the supported
setting, which led to the suggestion that he should move on, which
could have resulted in a deterioration in his health and well-being,
and eventually to his being readmitted to hospital. Without the joint
duty, a decision could be taken regardless of the views of a
patient’s medical
team.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-29?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_29_PT_1/C576D0A29B90E629220EAB1654BA00086208D3EE" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 29 July 2013">Monday,

example shows that the duty under Section 117 is not indefinite. It
continues only until such time as both statutory agencies decide that
the person is no longer in need of aftercare services. For some people
this will be a short period of time, for others it will be longer, but
the point is that the duty is unique because the client group is
unique. As Lord Justice Buxton stated in the Court of Appeal stage of
the Stennett v Manchester City Council case it applies to an “an

is also clear public health policy and purpose behind Section

remain in hospital any longer than they need and that aftercare

emotional harm and expense of deterioration. This is vital to prevent
our hospitals becoming bottle-necked. As we all know, it is more cost
efficient to work with people in the community than in hospitals. I
would argue that Section 117 focuses on ensuring the well-being of some

what does the Care Bill do? What is my issue with Clause 68(5)? The
subsection introduces a new, two-part statutory definition of the
aftercare services provided under Section 117 of the Mental Health Act.
There may have been some concern among the 
<?notus-xml column=1571?>Government that there was no definition of “aftercare
services”, as if this was an oversight that needed to be
addressed. However, let us be clear, there was no error and no
oversight. The aftercare services in Section 117 were deliberately not
defined by Parliament. This is because there is a wide variety of
mental disorders and the ways in which they manifest themselves require
the most flexible approach to meet a person’s needs and it would
be nonsensical to bind the hands of professionals in deciding what
services should be provided. Aftercare packages will be different for
each person and should be developed based on the needs of each
individual. Flexibility in the definition was therefore essential as it
would be impossible to list all the potential services that could make
up these individual aftercare
packages<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T17:02:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072912000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0001.htm#13072912000004">Clause
68 as it stands would result in this carefully crafted provision being
stripped of its content. Disputes could arise as to whether services
were required simply because of a physical as opposed to a mental
disorder. There could be a split in the service entitlement between
physical and mental symptoms, and expensive litigation between
authorities as to what was meant. There could also be far more disputes
between health and social care agencies because the definition would be
more restrictive than now.</hs_para>

all this, the person concerned would be stuck in the middle, needing

me give a real case example of the kind of issues that could arise. A
man has a severe anxiety disorder and depression. He lives in a
residential care home. He has been admitted to hospital because he has
become incontinent when anxious and this has resulted in an infection.
In hospital he becomes more anxious and attempts to self-harm on
several occasions. He is then detained under the Mental Health Act. An
assessment is undertaken which concludes that he needs nursing care and
not residential care. However, there is then a dispute between health
and social care about whether his nursing needs are a result of his
mental disorder or a physical health problem and who is responsible for
them. He remains in hospital unnecessarily for weeks without a decision
being made because of the stand-off. Eventually, through threatened
legal action against both health and social care agencies, reminding
them of their joint obligations under Section 117, they agree a way
forward which results in him being discharged from hospital to a place
which meets his needs and releases a hospital

demonstrates that vulnerable people may be detained in hospital for
longer than necessary while disputes are settled and that they are
usually not in a position to fight for aftercare services when disputes
such as this arise. Moreover, if it is decided that elements of care do

and his daily activities so as to keep appointments. The local
authority says that the floating support and welfare benefits advice
are generic services that are needed by many people, not just those who
have been discharged from a mental health hospital. These cannot be
described as needs relating to or arising from the mental disorder that
resulted in the man’s detention. The local authority

I find worrying is that some local authorities have already used the
Mwanza case to argue that social care services should be excluded from
Section 117 care packages. We know that during times of
economic austerity such as these, local authorities will try to reduce
their responsibilities for service provision if they can. A
prescriptive definition of aftercare services may allow them to do
that. A recent survey of 81 councils found that almost half said they
were planning to reduce spending on care services for adults,
specifically those with learning disabilities or learning difficulties.
Eight have already scrapped care for those deemed to have moderate
needs, leaving thousands of vulnerable people with reduced

has provided me with details of two current cases that I believe
clearly demonstrate the problems and show that local authorities will
sometimes refuse to provide care services until they are legally
required to do so. The first case is about a woman who was detained for
many years with a diagnosis of personality disorder. The local
authority only wanted to fund partly supported accommodation when she
clearly needed 24-hour accommodation. The local authority was willing
to fund the much needed accommodation only after a letter threatening
legal action. This delayed the woman’s

second case is of a man who was granted a deferred conditional

that the focus on aftercare is on preventing readmission to

Government’s view is that our proposed definition of aftercare
services meets the objective of providing clarity on the duty to ensure
such provision. That will give greater certainty to those needing or
providing aftercare so that it can be provided when it is needed. The
inclusion of a definition of aftercare services followed a
recommendation by the Law Commission that aftercare services should be
defined in accordance with a two-limbed definition from the Mwanza
case. This case law defined the services to mean services necessary to
meet a need arising from the person’s mental disorder and aimed
at reducing the likelihood of the person’s readmission to
hospital for further treatment of the disorder.</hs_para>

definition of aftercare services builds on the definition recommended
by the Law Commission. That was the starting point for the definition.
We accepted the recommendation of the Law Commission as a sensible
starting point, but we have gone further. The clause now clarifies that
the Section 117 duty requires services to be provided to meet needs
arising from or related to the person's mental disorder, as well as
reducing the risk that the person’s mental condition could
deteriorate, requiring their readmission to
hospital.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072912000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0001.htm#13072912000030">Following
public consultation, the Government expanded the proposed definition to
put it in the Bill in what we feel is a much improved form. The
noble Lord’s amendment omits the first limb of the

particular, his amendment weakens the connection between the services
required to be provided under 
<?notus-xml column=1576?>Section 117—I assure the noble Baroness, Lady Wheeler, that we

concerned that this amendment may confuse rather than clarify the
circumstances in which aftercare services should be provided. That
would run counter to the purpose of introducing a new definition. If
there are disputes over the aftercare services to be provided, the wait

would be in place to enable them to leave hospital could be prolonged,
something which the noble Lord wants to avoid. In our view, given that
it omits the criterion that services must have the purpose

can assure the noble Lord that the definite article does not simply
mean something singular but encompasses the plural as well, something
to which he briefly referred—the amendment is likely to give
rise to more disputes and administrative uncertainty than would be the
case with the clause as it stands. Examples of disputes arising under
the current Section 117, with no definition, highlight why a statutory
definition will add clarity. As highlighted by the Law Commission,
having no definition means that the interpretation is left to case law,

spiritual needs. The professionals involved include mental health
professionals, GPs, employment experts, independent advocates and
others. The proposed definition sets out the essential elements and
requirements for services to fall within Section 117. The Government do
not wish to be more prescriptive as aftercare services should be agreed

definition is very clear, as the noble Baroness has said. It is about
being related to “the mental disorder”. I know that the
Minister said that this is standard legislative language and that it is
not intended to be a singular disorder, but I disagree. First, the
definition does not give us a sense that aftercare should be holistic
and thus in line with the underlying well-being principle. Secondly,
the use of the definitive article in “the mental
disorder” is completely out of keeping with the Mental Health
Act. I can give a couple of examples from some of the trigger sections
of the 1983 Act. Section 1 of that Act defines mental disorder but
Sections 2 and 3, which refer to mental disorder, have no definite
article. The wording is completely separate from that of the Mental
Health Act, so officials should go back to the drawing board and look
at it a bit more carefully. It is very unclear and it poses huge legal

in any of its important trigger sections. What is important is that it
is not in keeping with the 1983 Act at all. Moreover, we have already
seen local authorities trying to use this case. We should be dictating
what happens. I am not sure whether the judge in that case—I do
not know if I should be saying this—was by any stretch a mental

completely different.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T17:15:00"></hs_TimeCode> Stennett

there might be something that we can improve on. However, I agree with
the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, that this is crucial because it is the
only piece of statutory provision we have to make sure that statutory
health services, the voluntary sector and social services work
together. Time after time over the past 30 years local authorities have
used any opportunity they can not to provide Section 117 aftercare
services. It goes to legal action and then they back off. Why do it
when we can resolve this? We do

Why introduce that level of doubt? We are on the same side and we can

Northover:</Member></B> My Lords, the Government have tabled a number
of amendments in relation to prisons to help clarify the interface
between local adult safeguarding boards and prisons. This group
of government amendments serves two purposes. Amendments 129
to 136 further clarify the relationship between prisons, approved
premises and local safeguarding adults boards. Obviously prisons and
approved premises retain a duty of care towards and responsibility for
the safety of all their detainees. Mechanisms are already in place to
hold them to account if there are concerns about the care or safety of
prisoners.</hs_para>

safeguarding procedures, so we believe that it should be left to local
discretion to determine whether it is appropriate for a governor or
other prison staff to become members, rather than a statutory duty.
This is the intention of the first part of subsection (7), which we
believe should remain. As such, local safeguarding boards will not
conduct inquiries or serious case reviews in relation to incidents
occurring while someone is in prison or approved premises with care and
support needs. However, we want there to be open dialogue between
prisons and approved premises and local safeguarding adults boards so
that the prisons and approved premises receive the information and
advice which the board can provide for the benefit of prisoners and
residents. This would not be possible with the draft clause as it
stands. It is therefore our intention that safeguarding adults boards
will be free to invite governors or other prison officers to sit on the
board and, whether or not a member, governors, directors or controllers
of prisons will be able to approach a safeguarding adults board to ask
for advice and guidance in improving their safeguarding arrangements. I
hope I have made the Government’s position in relation to
prisons and safeguarding clear through these proposed government
amendments.</hs_para>

remaining government amendments on Clause 69, Amendments 129 and 137 to
141, which clarify other matters. They make clear that a temporary
absence from prison or approved premises will lead to someone
continuing to be treated as detained in prison or residing in approved
premises or other bail addresses for the purposes of this clause. The
amendments also ensure that the rule in subsections (1) and (2),
regarding which local authority is responsible for an
individual’s care and support needs, applies to people bailed to
addresses other than approved premises. Finally, the amendments remove
the paragraphs which deem that once an individual has been sentenced to
prison they are to be treated as detained in prison for the purposes of
this clause. On reflection, the Government believe that these deeming
provisions are not necessary. That also removes the unintended
consequence that those given a suspended sentence would be treated as
detained.</hs_para>

great many have drug and alcohol problems. This is all compounded by
prisoners struggling to get access to services for a range of reasons,
and they are impeded by waiting times and transfers within 
<?notus-xml column=1581?>the prison system. Prisoners with complex needs may have too many
different agencies to work with when they are released. Prisoners with
such problems are particularly vulnerable, and the characteristics I

reoffending and greatly enhance people’s ability to rebuild
their lives on
release.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072912000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0002.htm#13072912000051">However,

clarity provided by the Government through this Bill, which places the
responsibility for the adult social care of prisoners on the local
authority where the prison is located. Clause 69 outlines the
responsibilities of local authorities towards people in prison with
care and support needs and ensures that they are able to access care
and support on a similar basis to those in the community. The Bill

by applying core duties to assess and meet needs on the same basis as

groups.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072912000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0002.htm#13072912000052">However,
I am concerned that, having made such a significant and welcome
commitment to the social care of prisoners, people in prison and people

69(6). I am pleased that government Amendment 105A allows safeguarding
adults boards to provide advice and assistance to protect all adults in

denying prisoners and people residing in approved premises the benefit

individuals at even greater risk. The offer of advice or assistance is
no substitute for statutory inquiry when safeguarding concerns are
raised. “Enquiry by local authority” not only protects
the individual, it also helps to shine a light on some of the most
hidden corners in our society. It is another tool to help ensure that
our prisons are safe both for vulnerable prisoners and for the staff
who work with them. An inquiry by the local authority does not
duplicate the excellent work undertaken by Her Majesty’s
Inspectorate of Prisons or by the prison itself. It complements and
enhances them and, most importantly, it could
help to save lives. While the Minister’s amendment is helpful, I

Bills that affect prisoners. We are about to start the Committee stage
of the Children and Families Bill. We have to try to remove a clause
that prevents young offenders being subject to the pathways for those
with special educational needs. Prisons are allegedly to be excluded.
Only last Wednesday, the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, raised a question about
jobseeker’s allowance and prisoners not having access to
benefits in time. I wonder whether the clause not applying to prisoners
was discussed or whether the Ministry of Justice has come to a view on
something that will affect an increasing number of people in the
prisons: the

need for local social services to be involved in prisons by statute and
by right. With due respect to the Ministry of Justice and the Prison

left to the prisons” and that it “should” be
statutory, or that they “can” invite members of
safeguarding adults boards into prisons, I do not think that that is

people are simply not trained enough to be able to conduct the care
that is so essential for the elderly element of the prison population.
There are many concerns over the fact that too many staff have simply
no idea about problems to do with dementia, which is but one of the
issues. To phrase this provision loosely and say that somebody from a
prison “may” be a member of the board is not good enough.
It really should be laid down in statute that somebody must be a
member. If it is not the governor, it must be someone from the senior
prison management
team<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T17:44:46"></hs_TimeCode>. 
<?notus-xml column=1583?>The other reason it must be a member of the senior management team is
that people change. There is such movement in the staff of a prison
that if you are not careful, you will not have somebody who knows what
they are doing and knows the people in the local authority to contact
if there is a problem with somebody who needs
care<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T17:45:10"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
important to have it statutorily laid down not just for somebody to be
responsible within the prison, but so that those who are responsible
for delivering support and care know precisely who to make contact
with. It is no good leaving it nebulous by just going to the prison and
finding somebody. If you do that, you will find that the
“somebody” is not there. I believe very firmly that
someone should be made responsible and accountable for this.</hs_para>

amendments 105B and 105D address those issues. On safeguarding

we saw most recently with Southern Cross residential care homes. The
Lords Delegated Powers Committee expressed concern at the Bill’s
failure to define what is meant by both “business

answer in passing in the following debate when the noble Earl the

Northover:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank noble Lords for tabling the
other amendments in this group on these very important issues. On the
amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Patel of Bradford, we
agree that a person with care and support needs should be protected
against abuse or neglect wherever they are. As I have already set out,
prison governors and directors have in place procedures to follow in
response to allegations of abuse or neglect. Governors and directors
will provide assurance to the National Offender Management Service and
Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Prisons, through their
inspection regimes, that those procedures and their implementation
provide similar protection to that available in the community. The
Prisons and Probation Ombudsman will investigate individual complaints
and incidents. I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T17:51:22"></hs_TimeCode>
can assure the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, that the Ministry of
Justice and the NOMS have acknowledged that there is a need for
improved directions to the Prison Service and probation trusts in this
area. They will be working with officials from the Department of Health
and stakeholders to develop instructions and guidance that will give
clarity about the roles and responsibilities of the Prison Service and
probation trusts in safeguarding 
<?notus-xml column=1585?>adults in their care. In addition, prison governors and other prison
staff will be able to approach their local Safeguarding Adults Board
for advice and assistance in improving their
arrangements<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T17:52:02"></hs_TimeCode>.
The MoJ was, of course, fully consulted on the provisions relating to
prisons in the Bill and will be working with the Department of Health
and NOMS to develop detailed guidance so that people who are concerned
about the safeguarding issue will know exactly how to raise it and get
advice on how to approach it. The MoJ is fully involved in the
development of all parts of this

noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, also raised the issue of a statutory
obligation on the senior management of prisons to take responsibility
for the care and support needs of prisoners. The governor or, in the
case of contracted prisons, the director, has the primary duty of care
for prisoners and is the appropriate first point for reporting
concerns. There is an investigations procedure in place for cases in
which prisoners suffer significant harm. Prisons are monitored by a
range of inspectorates, including the

Patel of Bradford:</Member></B> I just want to get this point on record
and then perhaps we can come back to it. I understand that prisons have
a whole range of safeguarding measures in place. When there is a real
problem that a prison has not resolved, why can a local authority not
have an inquiry for a person who is vulnerable and at risk? That is my
first question. If somebody is in approved premises, such as a bail
hostel, and living in the community like anybody else, and they have
been abused or are neglected or at serious risk, why should a local
authority not have an obligation to have a safeguarding inquiry? I just
cannot fathom why such a person would be

Northover:</Member></B> The point is that if local authorities must
also conduct inquiries in prisons and approved premises, we run the
risk of duplicating inquiries. Prison governors and directors have the
primary responsibility for preventing abuse or neglect of prisoners
with care and support needs. Prison governors already have a duty to
care for and safeguard prisoners. If we duplicate this responsibility,
we run the risk that the lack of clarity will mean that safeguarding
concerns fall between agencies. Noble Lords will be extremely familiar
with how this has happened in the past in other sectors. Therefore, a
decision has to be made as to where the expertise is and where the
primary responsibility is. The decision made in discussions with the
MoJ and NOMS is that the primary responsibility is with the prisons. We
have to make sure that they carry forward that responsibility.
Obviously, they will draw on advice in the way that I described, but we
need to make sure that there is one body with ultimate
responsibility<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T17:55:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072912000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0002.htm#13072912000071">We

should be left to local discretion to determine whether it is
appropriate for a governor or other

now turn to Amendment 105Q, in the name of my noble friend Lady
Browning and the noble Lord, Lord Touhig. It raises important issues
about how future statutory guidance will be issued under the Bill and
how it may interact with existing guidance. The noble Baroness, Lady
Wheeler, also asked about this. We intend to develop a single,
consolidated bank of guidance for local authorities covering all their
care and support functions under this part of the Bill. We will replace
all existing guidance that covers this territory to remove the
potential for future misunderstanding. Current statutory guidance for
local authorities is issued under Section 7 of the Local Authority
Social Services Act 1970. Future guidance on adult care and
support will be issued under Clause 71 of the Bill. The amendment also
proposes to require a consistent application of the definition of an
“NHS body”. We agree, of course, that definitions must be
clear and consistent in guidance and regulations and we will keep this
in mind in drafting regulations and guidance to ensure that key
terminology and definitions are consistent. I can assure the noble

105R, to which the noble Lord, Lord Low, spoke. The Government believe
it is right to allow local authorities the flexibility to delegate
their care and support functions to third parties. However, when a
local authority chooses to delegate any of its care and support
functions, this must not be a way of relieving itself of its
responsibilities for how those functions are carried out. This clause
does not absolve the local authority of its legal obligations with
respect to care and support functions. However, we believe it is
necessary that, when a local authority arranges with a third party to
carry out a public function, the local authority should have
contractual recourse against that third party for breach of contract.
Subsection (7)(a) ensures that this is the case. It is not a limitation
of the local authority’s ultimate responsibility for the
performance of its functions.</hs_para>

noble Lord, Lord Low, asked to be reassured about the application of
the Human Rights Act. I can assure him that the Human Rights Act
applies to the discharge of public functions, so even when a local
authority delegates its public function to a third party, that function
must still be carried out in a way that complies with the Human Rights
Act. Local authorities retain legal responsibility for anything done or
not done by the third party when carrying out the function. It follows
that any failure to carry out the function in a way that is compliant
with the Human Rights Act will be considered a failure by the local
authority. We do 
<?notus-xml column=1587?>not think that this needs to be specified in law as it is covered. The

authority delegates a public function to a third party, the function
must be carried out in a way that is consistent with the Human Rights
Act. It appears—I will clarify for the noble Lord if it is not
the case—that the local authority has to abide by the Human
Rights Act, but clearly, if it delegates something to a third party,
which does not adhere to it, the third party is not adhering to its
obligations to the local authority. By that device, the Human Rights
Act would end up having an effect on what those third parties could do,
even if they were not themselves directly responsible. However, I will

Low of Dalston:</Member></B> I am very grateful for that further
clarification. It is reassuring to hear that the third party is under
an obligation to carry out its functions in a manner that is compliant
with the Human Rights Act. However, it would offer further reassurance
if we were told that there was a remedy against the third party to
which the function was delegated as well as against the local
authority. I appreciate what the noble Baroness has said about a remedy
against the local authority. However, as appeared when we talked about
the application of human rights legislation a week ago, for remedies to
have a practical effect so far as third parties carrying out delegated
responsibilities are concerned, it is desirable—this was the
view of the Joint Committee—that there should be a remedy
against the third party to which responsibilities were delegated as
well as against the local authority. In this instance that is, if I may
put it this way, little more than a backstop. The remedy bites much
more effectively if it can be seen to bite on the third party, to whom
the responsibilities are delegated, and not just on the local
authority. I hope that that further clarification of my point will make
it easier for the noble Baroness to come back to me when she has looked

70(1) places local authorities under a duty to establish and maintain
registers of adults who are sight-impaired and severely
sight-impaired—blind and partially sighted, to you and
me—who are ordinarily resident in their area. Certificates of
vision impairment are completed by consultant ophthalmologists and
passed to local authority social services departments to decide whether
to register somebody as blind or partially sighted. This is intended to
provide someone with sight loss with a formal and reliable route to
accessing social care services and to assist councils in planning such
services. Guidance from the Department of Health and the Association of
Directors of Adult Social Services states that it should take no more
than 28 days from the health service issuing a certificate to the local
authority completing registration. However, we know that this does not
always happen, or at least not always promptly.</hs_para>

registrations have declined sharply over the past 10 years. The number
of blind and partially sighted people who receive some sort of
community-based provision has declined by 36% over the six years from
2005-6 to 2011-12, with a particularly marked decline after 2009. This
compares very unfavourably with the figure for all other adults with
physical disabilities, for whom the figure is 23%. It has been
suggested that the decline may be due to people not registering because
they do not see the point or feel that it would be stigmatising.
However, it is difficult to see why this should be. The benefits are
just the same as they have always been, and the evidence is that the
problems surrounding prompt registration are much more systemic than
attitudinal<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T18:08:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072912000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0002.htm#13072912000085">The
purpose of this amendment is to ensure that local authorities have a
duty to make contact with adults shortly after they have been issued
with a certificate of vision impairment to ensure a consistent approach
to registering adults who have been newly certified as sight-impaired
or severely sight-impaired. It builds on a suggestion by the Law
Commission in its report of May 2011 on adult social care law. On page
189, the report
states:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13072912000134" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0002.htm#13072912000134">“The

also ‘make contact’ with service

that the Government should consider extending the requirement to make
contact, to other service-user groups. Given the evidence on declining
registrations, this would seem to make sense for the visually impaired
as well. Only intervention makes a critical difference. Prompt
registration can be crucial for accessing services, and effective
rehabilitation. Nearly two-thirds of blind and partially sighted people
say that because of their sight loss, they need help to get out of the
house. However, without mobility training, which makes the greatest
difference soon after certification, blind and partially sighted people
are at risk of isolation and becoming housebound. There is also growing
evidence of the link between sight loss and falls. Local authorities
should step in before blind and partially sighted adults’ care
and support needs intensify. When people have to wait for someone from
social services to get in touch, it can lead to loneliness and
depression. At present, ADASS guidance suggests that first contact
should ideally take place within 48 hours, and certainly within two
weeks. As I have said, the assessment of need is meant to take place
within 28
days.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072912000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0002.htm#13072912000087">When the
registration process works well, people with registrable sight loss
access the support they need within weeks. However, the RNIB’s
<I>Lost and Found</I> report of 2009 revealed a variation in percentage
of people reporting that they received a visit from social services
within six weeks of their appointment at the eye hospital—a
variation that ranged from 88% in the best local authority, to only 14%
in the worst. In more than one area, patients reported waiting at least
seven to nine months for an assessment or a home visit. Dr
Stan Lopez, the head of a sensory impairment team in London, said that
blind and partially sighted people typically slip through the net at
the first
stage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072912000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0002.htm#13072912000088">This
amendment would help ensure that local authorities reached blind and
partially sighted people early, before they become depressed and
isolated, and there is deterioration in their well-being. Recently
published RNIB research studied the process of certifying and
registering people as sight impaired, to understand why registration
numbers have been falling. What particularly stood out was the extent
to which social services departments can make a difference to the
well-being of individuals, simply by making prompt contact. By making
contact early, the local authority can arrange low-level and less
costly support than if it waits for the individual to reach crisis
point following many months of struggling on their
own.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072912000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0002.htm#13072912000089">The duty
laid on local authorities by this amendment would be quite
proportionate. The rate of certifications of visual impairment issued
per 100,000 of the population in 2010-11 was 43.1. The 22,500 adults
certified as sight-impaired or severely sight-impaired in 2010-11 would
typically translate into a big metropolitan authority, such as
Birmingham, making contact with 430 newly certified adults a year; an
inner London borough, such as Westminster, contacting 50; and a largely
rural county, such as Cumbria, making contact with 320. Clearly, not
all these adults would end up receiving the same level of service or
even requiring a needs assessment. When you consider that there are
300,000 adults registered blind or partially sighted in England, this
duty is clearly proportionate. It would mean that the roughly 20,000
adults whose sight problems are serious enough 
<?notus-xml column=1591?>for an ophthalmologist to certify them in any given year are contacted
by their social services department, and at the very least offered
registration, which leads to individual benefits and entitlements, but
we hope also speedier access to services which will help support
independent
living.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072912000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0002.htm#13072912000090">When
the certification and registration process works well, service users
are able to access support quickly, and report that it changes their
lives. Building on Clause 70(1), which requires local authorities to
establish and maintain sight impairment registers, the amendment would
help them fulfil that duty by inserting a new subsection which would
require local authorities to keep up-to-date registers by making
contact with newly certified individuals. In summary, the amendment
would ensure newly certified sight-impaired and severely sight-impaired
adults are at less risk of losing out and falling through the gaps
between health and social care services. I beg to

his amendment. It raises some important issues. He emphasises that
local authorities need to follow up those who have been newly certified
as sight impaired or severely sight impaired in a timely manner where
they have indicated that they wish to be registered or to have an
assessment of their needs for care and support. Indeed, we have great
sympathy with his concerns. We accept that people who have acquired a
visual impairment should have an early opportunity to have access to
information and advice so that they can adapt to their situation as
quickly as possible and obtain any aids and support that will help them
to manage their lives
better.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072912000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0002.htm#13072912000093">As we
have discussed, Clause 4 requires local authorities to make available
universal information and advice on care and support, which will of
course be relevant here. But people who lose their sight suddenly can
also need more time to come to terms with their loss and engage with
the support that might be available to them. If that is the case, it
might be more appropriate to have a greater degree of flexibility
around the timescales for when that support is offered or re-offered.
Individuals differ in the way that they respond. We therefore believe
that it would be better if the detail of 
<?notus-xml column=1592?>this was covered in guidance, as it is for deaf-blind people, rather
than in the Bill or in the regulations. In response to the noble Lord,
Lord Hunt, there may well be a parallel here for deaf people, I am

to hear that the Government propose to work with RNIB on refreshing the
guidance. That will be very welcome. On that basis, I shall certainly
want to withdraw the amendment. However, I would like to make a couple
of points. The noble Baroness drew a parallel between the guidance on
visual impairment and that for deaf-blind people. The Law Commission
was in favour of upgrading the guidance for deaf-blind people to
regulation status. Perhaps when the Government look at that question in
respect of deaf-blindness and vision impairment, they may like to
revisit it and consider whether guidance or regulations are the best
vehicle<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T18:20:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072912000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0002.htm#13072912000096">I

500,000 people die each year in England, about two-thirds of them over

homes; today, most of us die in hospital. In his farewell report as
national clinical director for cancer and end-of-life care, Professor
Sir Mike Richards, now chief hospital inspector, reported that by April
2012, 42.4% of people were dying at home or in a care home. This is an
improvement from 38% four years previously. On present trends, this
means that it will be at least the end of the decade before half the
deaths occur in a place of usual

improvement in the national figures conceals considerable regional
variation. If you live in the south-west, with 48% of deaths occurring
in a place of usual residence, you have more choice than those of us
living in London, where the percentage drops to 35%. There is even
wider variation between local authority areas. The great majority of us
want to die at home or in the place where we normally live, rather than
in the impersonal environment of a hospital ward. Perversely, we end up
not only dying in the place where we least want to be but dying in the
most expensive place. Marie Curie research has shown that a week of
palliative care in the community costs about £1,000, whereas a
week of hospital, in-patient, specialist palliative care costs
virtually £3,000. The National End of Life Care Programme shows
an estimated potential net saving of £958 per person if you die
in the community rather than in hospital. Macmillan Cancer Support
polling has shown that eight out of 10 health and social care
professionals agreed that community-based, end-of-life care would save
money. On top of that, an unusual position is that nine out of 10 MPs
believe that their constituents should be able to die in the place of
their choice. This produces remarkable cross-party consensus among MPs

the present system and the new system that we are debating for access
to care are really longwinded, and a lot of people in this position, at
end of life, do not need a longwinded system of access. The DS 1500
certificate, which indicates that you have a terminal illness, can take
weeks to complete.

all know that NHS care is easier to
access<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T18:29:38"></hs_TimeCode>. However,
it does not link up with social care in most cases. A terminally ill
patient can get NHS care but it is really difficult to get social care.
Bring on integration, really. This is not fair for somebody who needs
and wants a dignified death—wherever it should be. As the noble
Lord, Lord Warner, has said, most people want to die at home. Often,
the inability to cope at home without any support and social care
drives people to hospital. Therefore, they find themselves ending up in
expensive hospital care in 
<?notus-xml column=1595?>a setting that is just not their choice. The noble Lord, Lord Warner,
has quoted some figures so I will quote a few more that support his
case. The Nuffield Trust has researched this and a 10% reduction of
hospital admissions for people at the end of life could result in
savings of £52 million. According to Marie Curie figures, this
would easily cover the costs of free care at home for all the people
who would die within a year—with some to spare. This also leads
into the debate of the noble Lord, Lord Warner, about moving funding
from health to care.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T18:31:45"></hs_TimeCode>We are talking
about £52 million that would be spent by people dying
in hospital. We would save that £52 million if we
were able to keep them where they wanted to be. The
£32 million assessment by Marie Curie is more than
easily

support the amendment presented by the noble Lord, Lord Warner. I want
to focus particularly on the first part of the amendment and I support
completely the sentiments within that. One of the points made by the
noble Baroness, Lady Jolly, was very important. It is important to try
not to have the elderly patients in the hospital so that their right to
die wherever they want to be is where they are before they have to come
in. The context here is not just the money. The noble Lord, Lord
Warner, is absolutely right to point out that it is hugely expensive. I
think that it is more than £3,000 if an elderly person is in
hospital and dies in hospital. It is very much evidenced by the fact
that they very often feel quite degraded by the lack of privacy when
they die in hospital. By definition, it is not the same as being at
home or, even, I would suggest a hospice, where people have very good
experiences. The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T18:33:07"></hs_TimeCode>

If I or anyone else in the hospital goes around the wards, the patients

and find it very difficult to maintain social networks and hobbies.

proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Warner, and agree with what all the
other speakers have said. I remind noble Lords that when care pathways
were introduced by the previous Government end-of-life care was not a
pathway. The noble Lord, Lord Darzi, listened to a group of hospice
workers. They said that they very rarely saw a death in a surgical ward
and that they believed that we should look at a care pathway for end of
life. What has been said today indicates that we 
<?notus-xml column=1597?>need to concentrate on bringing together health and social care,
bringing together social workers and
health<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T18:38:40"></hs_TimeCode> staff
and, above all, seeking the choice of patients. As has already been
said, most patients wish to live in their
own<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T18:38:22"></hs_TimeCode> surroundings
and the end-of-life care pathway would take care of not only the person
whose life is ending but also the relatives and family around them. I

Wheeler:</Member></hs_speaker> My Lords, we on these Benches are
grateful to my noble friend Lord Warner and the noble Lord, Lord Patel,
for bringing forward these amendments which ensure that end-of-life
care is discussed in the context of the Bill. The Government have
confirmed to the Joint Committee that primary legislation is not
required for the introduction of the proposed new palliative care
funding system or free end-of-life care once the Bill is passed. It is
right to seek up to date information on the progress of the end-of-life
care pilots and the proposed timescale for the publication of the
regulations and consultation, if the April 2015 deadline for any new
systems is to be
met<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T18:39:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072917000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0002.htm#13072917000012">The
amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Patel, endorses the Joint Committee
recommendation that assessment of the need for the care and support of
an adult who is terminally ill should be treated as urgent by the local
authority. We fully support that. As Marie Curie Cancer support says,
people get stuck in hospital at the end of life because the system
cannot move quickly enough to get a care package for alternative care
in place. It is established good practice in some authorities to fast
track assessment of people not covered by NHS continuing care. It is a
very fundamental requirement for people who are terminally ill and
should be a duty reinforced in the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T18:39:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072917000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0002.htm#13072917000013">There
is also a strong argument for joining up access to social care and
support with the DS1500 system for quick accessing of welfare benefits
such as DLA, although it is recognised that some of the degenerative
diseases such as motor neurone disease may not be easily dealt with in
this way. Will the Minister advise the House of the Government’s
view on this, and what work is being undertaken to ensure that benefits
and the care and support system work in a more integrated way for
terminally ill patients? It is now six years on from the introduction
of the 2008 <I>End of Life Care Strategy</I> to help people have the

strategy has made a vital contribution to increasing the profile within
the NHS and social care of end-of-life care through such excellent
programmes as the NHS End of Life Care, the Marie Curie Delivering
Choice Programme and the 2009 Dying Matters campaign to tackle the
taboo on discussing death and dying. However, as my noble friend has
shown, progress on providing real choice for people to die in the place
they want to, whether that is in their home, at a hospice, nursing home
or in hospital, if that is where they can receive the best palliative
and nursing care appropriate for their condition or personal
circumstances, has been frustrating and

of palliative and end-of-life care is still on cancer patients and
hospices, but even then, Macmillan Cancer Support research shows that
91% of cancer patients in England who die in hospital wanted to die
elsewhere, with 65% wanting to die in their own homes. Only 29% of
people with cancer are able to be at home when they die. The amendment
of my noble friend Lord Warner seeks to specify in the Bill that
regulations may include the right for an NHS patient to die in the
place they regard as home or their normal residence. As he readily
acknowledges, this can be achieved only if end-of-life care is
integrated across the NHS, local councils and hospices, and if it is
properly funded. His case for an integrated service for free
end-of-life care for terminally ill people who are likely to die within
six months is a convincing

research among health and social care professionals shows that 97%
identify the lack of financial integration between the services as a
key barrier to people receiving the care they need at the end of life.
As the noble Baroness, Lady Jolly, reminded us, the Nuffield’s
and other research projects point strongly to the cost-effectiveness
and potential savings that could be achieved with greater access to
social care and reduced hospital admissions at the end of life. The
Nuffield research also found that the use of social care currently
varies between local authorities and health conditions—for
example, people with dementia, falls and stroke use considerably more
social care in community settings than those with cancer, probably
because that is where they are already being cared for before terminal
illness has been diagnosed. Individuals with the highest social care
costs tend to have lower average hospital
costs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072917000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0002.htm#13072917000016">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T18:43:05"></hs_TimeCode>
fully recognise how crucial the seven adult palliative care funding
pilots are to mapping and understanding current patterns and resource
use across health and social care at end of life, and to collecting the
vital data from which the costs of an integrated end-of-life care
system can be properly assessed. These data span across care provided
by the NHS, voluntary and private sector in both acute and community
settings. The final data analysis report for the adult pilots and the
consortium pilot for children’s palliative care services is due
in June 2014, and the Government are committed to introduce a new per
patient funding system for palliative care by April 2015. Can the
Minister update the House on the progress being made under the pilots,
the emerging key themes and whether the timescale has been impacted by
the recent transfer of responsibility to NHS England? I understand that
there is a problem with progress and that the pilots have only recently
been provided with guidance on social care data collection—for
example, as regards where data are underdeveloped and will probably
take longest to collect. Is the Minister confident that the timescale
for pilot reports, evaluation, policy decision and consultation can be
met in time for implementation and that the Government will make a
decision on free end-of-life care by the end of this

two further issues need to be added to the debate. First, my noble
friend Lady Pitkeathley reminded us of the recent Carers UK Carers Week
survey which shows that much more support is needed for carers to help
them plan for the end-of-life care of the person 
<?notus-xml column=1599?>for whom they are caring. Many do not know how to plan for the death of
a loved one and how to look ahead to life when caring ends in terms of
returning to or taking up work, making social contacts and managing
financially. My noble friend was right to underline how crucial it is
to get this support
right<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T18:45:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072917000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0002.htm#13072917000018">Secondly,
it is as well to remember the findings of last month’s report
from Public Health England and Marie Curie Cancer Care on palliative
and end-of-life care for black, Asian and minority groups in the UK. It
is a timely reminder that, with black, Asian and BME groups
aged 65 and over set to treble in the next 25 years, there
is urgent need to address the reasons for their low levels
of use of palliative and end-of-life care services. The report
identifies major problems, including lack of knowledge about services,
misunderstandings, mistrust and lack of cultural sensitivity on the
part of service providers. How are the Government addressing this issue
and including it in their work to assess future service needs and
funding? Are the pilots collecting data on these vital

final six months of their lives. The Department of Health’s
<I>End of Life Care Strategy</I> provides a blueprint for improving

solve that disparity, it is important that we do not act prematurely.

therefore should be fast-tracked so that needs are met as quickly as
possible. We do not believe that the Bill should set out a list of
urgent situations where a local authority can meet an adult’s
needs without having yet carried out a needs or financial assessment,
or made an eligibility determination. The problem is, as we have
debated on many occasions in the past, that such a list could never be
exhaustive and might suggest that only certain situations could be

employment practices of providers that are contracted by the local
authority. The first 
<?notus-xml column=1603?>was on Clause 5, regarding the local authority’s market-making

There is no doubt that there is real concern about the employment
practices of a number of companies that work in the adult social care
sector and the lack of monitoring by local authorities in their
commissioning. One way or another, the Bill will be very much enhanced
if we can get to grips with this problem of poor employment practice. I
have no doubt whatever that the general use of zero-hours contracts and
the fact that those workers who are often low-paid have to pay the cost
of travel themselves and are not paid for the time they take to travel
from client to client leads inevitably to an impact on the quality of

example, the recent report of the Low Pay Commission has warned of lack
of compliance with the national minimum wage, such as by not paying for

Only family members cannot benefit. Today I received a letter from two

divorced, the other never married—and when the surviving parent
died six years ago they paid a great deal of inheritance tax. They feel
that the current law treats them unfairly and fear that the son, who
will inherit from both of them, will again have to pay a vast amount of

couples can choose to marry and thus benefit; and same-sex couples can

a fundamental flaw and a serious danger lurk within it. Let us remember
that it originally came from organisations such as the Christian

partnerships and same-sex marriage. It is not a proposal which emanated
from the carers’ movement. I have spent 15 years in this House

proposal equates two fundamentally different sorts of relationship:
those entered into freely and voluntarily as adults, and consanguine,
family relationships. Those two types of relationship have always been
treated differently in law, for very good reason. You cannot choose
your family, you are born into it. You have relationships with people
in that family which are wholly different, and your obligations to
those people are wholly different, from those in the families which you
create. That is why you do it. Also, you cannot leave a family into

questions about legal rights and responsibilities, arising from
specific family relationships and friendships, are not related to the
subject matter of the Care Bill. Nor do they fall within the
responsibilities of the Secretary of State for Health. Indeed, Carers

issues in this amendment, the UK’s progressive personal tax
system is based on the principle of independent taxation whereby
individuals rather than families contribute to the cost of providing
public services based on their ability to pay. In contrast, the
UK’s family-based welfare system helps people to move into and
progress in work while supporting the most vulnerable families on the
basis of need. The tax system does not reflect individuals’
personal or family circumstances because it does not need to. The
welfare system does that by providing support based on need, which
encompasses family circumstances and caring needs. That allows the tax
system to focus on raising the revenue that is necessary to fund public
services and welfare support in a more cost-efficient way while
ensuring that individuals feel they are contributing to public services

other relief, this means that fewer than 4% of estates left on death
pay any IHT at all, while two-thirds of all IHT is paid by those
estates worth more than £1 million. The inheritance tax system
provides for individuals to gift substantial amounts—for
example, shares in property—to others, including family members
or carers. As long as no strings are attached to the gift,
and the recipients survive for seven years after the gift is made,
there would be no inheritance tax consequences. In doing that, the
donor reduces both the potential value of their taxable estate in the

Advocate-General for Scotland (Lord Wallace of
Tankerness):</Member></B> My Lords, I beg to move that the Civil
Procedure (Amendment No. 5) Rules 2013 and the Rules of the Court of
Judicature (Northern Ireland) (Amendment) 2013 be approved. The Civil
Procedure (Amendment No. 5) Rules 2013 amend the Civil
Procedure  
<?notus-xml column=1614?>Rules 1998 to make provision for closed material procedures in civil
proceedings in England and Wales pursuant to the provisions of Part 2
of the Justice and Security Act 2013. The Rules of the Court of
Judicature (Northern Ireland) (Amendment) 2013 similarly amend the
rules of the Court of Judicature to make provision for CMPs in civil
proceedings in Northern Ireland brought in under the same
Act.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072920000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0002.htm#13072920000036">I
am sure that many of your Lordships present will be very familiar with
the background to these rules: the provisions of Part 2 of the Justice
and Security Act, which were debated thoroughly and considerably in
your Lordships’ House, but perhaps I may set the context. Part 2
of the Act makes provision establishing a closed material proceedings
regime for civil proceedings in the High Court, the Court of Appeal,
the Court of Session, and the Supreme Court. CMPs allow national
security-sensitive material which is held by a party and relevant to
the proceedings to be taken into account through its disclosure to the
court and a special advocate representing the interests of the other
party. The other party cannot themselves see the material.</hs_para>

at the outset that CMPs will be available only in civil
proceedings—cases where someone is suing or challenging the
actions or decisions of the Government. They will not be available for
inquests or for criminal trials and will not allow a person to be found
guilty of a crime without knowing the evidence against him or
her.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13072920000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0002.htm#13072920000038">A CMP
will be available in relation to any proceedings only if the court
makes a declaration that the proceedings are ones in which it should be
possible to apply to disclose material by way of a CMP. This can happen
only if the court is satisfied not only that the material in question
is relevant and that its disclosure would be damaging to the interests
of national security but that it would be in the interests of the fair
and effective administration of justice for a CMP to be available in
principle in those proceedings. In cases where the availability of CMP
has been requested by the Secretary of State, the court must also be
content that he or she has first considered a claim for public interest
immunity in respect of the sensitive material in issue.</hs_para>

the court may—but, equally, may not—grant a CMP
declaration which establishes the principle that closed proceedings may
be used in the relevant parts of the case where sensitive material
would be in issue. Of course, a special advocate will already have been
appointed to represent the interests of the other party. The party
holding the sensitive material must then apply again for individual
pieces of material to be held in closed proceedings and, in each
instance, the judge must decide whether or not the disclosure of the
material would damage national security. If not, it is heard in open
proceedings; and, if it would and should be heard in closed
proceedings, whether it may be summarised by a gist disclosed in
open—that is, to all parties to the
litigation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072920000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0002.htm#13072920000040">Once
that stage—known as pre-trial disclosure—is complete, the
judge must review the original declaration to ensure that the tests are
still met. If not, he must revoke the declaration. Indeed, the judge
may revoke the declaration at any point if he or she considers that it
is no longer in the interests of the fair and effective administration
of justice.</hs_para>

I of Part 82 contains rules about the scope, interpretation and
application of the part. Rule 82.2 modifies the overriding objective of
the Civil Procedure Rules for the purposes of Part 82 by placing a duty

objective continues to apply, so the court must still further the
objective of dealing with the case justly, but it must also ensure in

recent briefing published by Justice on the rules appears to suggest

since the amendments made pursuant to Lord Justice Jackson’s

the case justly.</hs_parafo>

accordingly a precondition for the making of a declaration. The
treating of the application for the declaration as Section 6

national security; but it does not secure that the second condition
does not have to be met. It is also worth remembering that the court
can revoke a declaration at any point if it believes that it is no
longer in the interests of the fair and effective administration of
justice. Those provisions in Section 7 changed the architecture of the

begin by thanking the noble and learned Lord, as I am sure other noble
Lords would wish to do, for his thorough and comprehensive introduction
of the rules—without so much as a pause for breath in the 12
minutes or so that he addressed the House. It was, as ever, a
compelling performance.</hs_para>

proposal to extend closed material procedures from the limited category
of cases where they previously existed into the area of civil law
claims involving the Government evoked much anxious debate in and well
beyond this House. Today is not the occasion to revive that debate but
rather to consider the nature and effect of the rules of court designed
to implement Parliament’s decision, enshrined in the Act which
received Royal Assent on 25 April. Notwithstanding the noble and
learned Lord’s closing remarks, it must be said that the process
itself might be described as something of a closed and rushed
parliamentary procedure, since the rules were tabled on 26 June after
what appears to have been a minimal consultation period of a mere 10
working days after draft rules were placed in the Libraries of both
Houses, and that without any prior announcement.</hs_para>

gestation period of the legislation, it is surprising that more time
was not made available to consult on rules which, on any view, reflect
a substantial departure from the principles of our jurisprudence, as
does the Act. In particular, they appear to qualify the overriding
principle, set out in Civil Procedure Rule 1, that the courts will deal
with cases justly and at proportionate cost. Did the Government think
to consult, for example, the Joint Committee on Human Rights, the
Constitution Committee of this House or the Justice Select Committee,
all of which expressed significant views on the legislation in the
course of its parliamentary journey? Who else was consulted and with
what response? The noble and learned Lord referred to the Delegated
Legislation Committee and so on. Were other bodies consulted? Did any
body in fact respond in this rather quick consultation
period?</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13072920000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0002.htm#13072920000060">As
ever, the Government have been quick to find justification for their
haste. There are, we are told, some 20 civil cases and some
applications for judicial review waiting in the wings—one of
which, we understand, has now been initiated. Are these the cases that
we heard about between the publication of the Government’s Green
Paper and the subsequent passage of the Bill, 
<?notus-xml column=1619?>complete with dire warnings about the likelihood of having to pay
millions of pounds, which might find their way into the hands of
unidentified terrorists? If so, can it really be the case that a few
weeks longer to consider the rules would have made much difference? If
not, a fortiori, there would surely have been even less of a
problem.</hs_para>

important issue of the effect of the rules as drafted on the principles
enshrined in the Act, governing the basis on which the courts have to
determine whether to grant an application of closed material
procedures, it is necessary to consider some other important issues.
The Ministry of Justice effectively appears to have transposed to this
new arena of civil law cases the procedures applying in the very
different world of special immigration appeal courts. In so doing, as
Justice and the Law Society have pointed out, they have paid no regard
to the way in which ordinary civil claims are conducted. How, for
example, could the so-called Part 36 procedure work, under which an
offer to settle can be made by a party, with adverse financial
consequences for the other party if the offer is refused and not
subsequently beaten at trial? Should this procedure be available where
closed material procedures apply, when by definition the adverse party
cannot properly assess the strength of the other’s case? If so
and it could apply, what modification could be made to it?</hs_para>

issues have been raised. For example, Rule 82.7 requires notice of
hearings to be served on the parties and the special advocate. There
was considerable support in debate in your Lordships’ House for
the media to be informed of the intention to use CMPs. Will the
Government consider a further amendment to the rules to this effect, or
will they provide an extra parliamentary process to secure that
possibility?</hs_para>

82.12 permits the court to receive evidence not otherwise
admissible. Section 6(4)(b)(iii) of the Act provides that
intercept evidence will become admissible. What other categories of
inadmissible evidence does the noble and learned Lord envisage will be
permitted under this rule or, conversely, what will continue to be
excluded under this rule? Paragraph (7) of Rule 82.14 allows but does
not require a summary of material not disclosed under CMP to be
provided to a party, even where national security material is not
included. Again, will the noble and learned Lord look at this,
especially where national security material will not be involved? The
rule may follow the wording of the Act, but it is open to the
Government to indicate that they would not rely on a merely permissive
obligation.</hs_para>

moment, there is the complete failure to address in these rules the
concerns expressed by the special advocates during the deliberations
over the legislation. The Justice brief, to which the noble and learned
Lord alluded, cites nine major concerns. I will cite just two of them:
the lack of any formal rules of evidence and the lack of a searchable
database of closed judgments. If the noble and learned Lord has not
seen the list, will he undertake to look into the matters raised and
respond by way of letter? It is true that the special advocates chose
not to revive those concerns, in the context of this limited period for

<?notus-xml column=1620?>consultation, but they are on the record. In my submission, they should
have been dealt with in the course of preparing the rules which we are

to what is potentially the most troubling issue arising from the rules.
Much of the debate around Clause 6 of the Bill, now Section 6 of the
Act, centred on the need for the judge to exercise discretion as to the
making of an order. Section 6 sets out two conditions, both of which
must, by virtue of Section 6(3), be met. The first is that a party
would, by virtue of a declaration, be required to disclose sensitive,
that is to say, national security-related, information or would be
required to do so but for a range of factors—for example, a
possible PII claim or enactment. The second condition is, and I quote

6(5),</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13072920000164" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0002.htm#13072920000164">“that

no reference is made to the second condition set out in Section 6(5). I

although the noble and learned Lord seems to dismiss the suggestion,
the rules appear to suggest that in the consideration of any
application under Section 6, the default position of the court must be
non-disclosure rather than any consideration of the underlying and
general objective to do justice in the case. It also draws attention to
the Explanatory Memorandum that avers that an application under Section
6 must be treated in the same way as one under Section 8, which does
not contain the potentially crucial second condition. That section

may be that, as the Minister James Brokenshire asserted in the Commons

intention. There seems to be a degree of uncertainty about this. In
that case, would it not be better for the avoidance of doubt for the
position to be clarified explicitly in the rules themselves? This would

Treasury took measures to shut down the operations in this country of

that decision on procedural and substantive grounds. During the appeal
to the Supreme Court, the Treasury asked the Supreme Court justices to
hear part of the evidence in a closed session. By five votes to four,
the Supreme Court agreed to do so. The noble and learned Lord, Lord

the court having what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Neuberger,
described as “real misgivings”, the majority concluded
that in the light of the submissions made on behalf of the Treasury,
the court had to look at that material in a closed session. After
looking at the material in a closed hearing, all the judges agreed that
it made no difference to the issues in the case. The Supreme Court
justices then made plain that they felt that they had been misled by
the Treasury into allowing a wholly unnecessary closed hearing, about

is particularly troubling because the noble and learned Lord and others
assured noble Lords during the passage of the Bill that closed hearings

criticism made by all nine judges of the Supreme Court of the request
made by counsel for the Treasury for a closed hearing when, in the
opinion of all the judges, there was no justification whatever for
making such an application, will the 
<?notus-xml column=1622?>noble and learned Lord tell the House what general guidance has been

overruled or undermined by anything in the rules now before the House
for consideration? I should explain that I believe that that is the
case; that is, that these rules must be interpreted and applied by
reference to the principles set out by the noble and learned Lord, Lord
Neuberger. That is one reason why I shall not oppose the rules today.
However, I would very much like to hear the noble and learned

shall identify the five central principles that the noble and learned
Lord, Lord Neuberger, emphasised as important from a common law

under these rules? Secondly, he said that the open judgment must say as
much as possible—consistent, of course, with national
security—about the relevant closed material. As he
noted,</hs_para>

these rules consistent with that principle? Thirdly, he said that the
court must consider whether it is possible to hear argument about the
confidential material in open court without referring to any secret
detail. Again, are these rules consistent with that basic principle?
Fourthly, he said that advocates have a duty to the court to consider
whether it really is necessary to ask the court to go into a closed
hearing on an appeal. The same principle must apply, I think, to
hearings in lower courts. Again, does the noble and learned Lord agree
that this principle will apply under these rules? Fifthly, and finally,

Goldsmith:</Member></B> My Lords, my noble friend Lord Beecham has done
the House a service by ensuring that we debate openly some of the
issues around this procedure and these rules, and he has done so in a
very effective and trenchant way. The noble Lord, Lord Pannick, has
raised some important questions. I will not repeat them, but I look
forward to hearing what the noble and learned Lord has to say in
response. In the light of the way that he has presented those arguments
and referred to the Bank Mellat case, I can be relatively short in my
remarks, but I have two questions that I want to

thank the Minister for the clarity with which he explained the
safeguards that are in place and the emphasis he put on the
requirements for the interests of justice still to be served

could mistakenly reach the view that that has become the overriding
objective in this category of case. The noble and learned Lord, in
remarks that will be carefully looked at—indeed mined by
advocates, special advocates and, I hope, judges—has underlined
that notwithstanding that statement, there are clear indications that
the interests of justice remain paramount. He referred to the duty or
requirements under Section 6 of the Human Rights Act, under Section
6(5) of the 2013 Act itself, and the fact that the first paragraph of
the overriding objectives will continue to apply. Overall, what that
indicates, if I understood correctly what the noble and learned Lord
said—I hope that he can confirm this—is that, in the
Government’s view, judges will still need to be guided by the
requirement to ensure that cases are dealt with justly in the interests
of the
litigants<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T20:13:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13072920000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0002.htm#13072920000079">Having
said that, I was one of those who was unhappy about this procedure. I
had had experience of closed material procedures when I was in office
and I had spent time talking to special advocates. In the end, the
House and Parliament were persuaded that the requirements were such

cases. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, that this is not the
occasion to go back over that

have two questions, apart from those that have been raised by other
noble Lords. First, going back to one of the safeguards which was
required by the Act, the requirement for a report which now is to be
found in Section 12 of the 2013 Act, could the noble and learned Lord
please consider with his colleagues what it is that the report is going
to contain? We know that by statute it has to contain numerical details
of applications and judgments, but what else is it going to contain?
One<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T20:13:51"></hs_TimeCode> of the
difficulties with these procedures is that because aspects of them will
not take place in open court, we will not know what the issues are that
have been given rise to by such proceedings. The Secretary of State has
the power under Section 12(3) of the
Act,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13072920000172" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0002.htm#13072920000172">“to

that the noble and learned Lord and his colleagues will consider
whether matters that are 
<?notus-xml column=1624?>considered “appropriate” would be the sort of thing that
show how well the Act is working and whether it is giving rise to the
problems that my noble friend Lord Beecham referred to, such as
applications under Part 36 and so forth. I hope he can tell us that
there will be a real attempt not to limit the reports made under the
Act to mere numbers of matters dealt with and declarations
made<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T20:15:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13072920000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0002.htm#13072920000081">The
second issue I want to raise derives from the Bank Mellat case. It is
very troubling that the Supreme Court felt it necessary to say what it
said. I do not know to what extent the Attorney-General was involved in
the decision to make the application for a closed material procedure,
but it would be a very useful safeguard to ensure that, at least at a
certain level, whenever applications are to be made for a closed
material procedure, the Attorney-General is involved. That will avoid
the situation where counsel who is instructed by his client, which is
the way the relationship otherwise works, simply has to accept the view
of the officials who are instructing him that the particular matter
gives rise to national security issues. It is very easy to say and it
is very easy to say it quite convincingly, but it is important that
there should be really independent scrutiny of whether it is justified.
There will not necessarily be cases where a Supreme Court is in a
position to look at it and say as trenchantly as the Supreme Court did
in the Bank Mellat case that the application was not justified. I look
forward to hearing what the Minister can say about the question of the
involvement of the
Attorney-General<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T20:24:07"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T20:17:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Marks of Henley-on-Thames:</Member></B> My Lords, I fully respect the
concern of the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, to scrutinise these rules, and
I share his view that they are of considerable importance. However,

on these Benches, I spoke and voted during the passage of the Justice
and Security Bill for amendments that implemented recommendations of
the Joint Committee on Human Rights, many in the name of the noble
Lord, Lord Pannick, and others. However, I also ultimately accepted
that with the safeguards we secured, it was better to enable those few
cases which otherwise could not be heard at all, because open hearings
would jeopardise national security, to be determined using CMPs. Since
then, as the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, has pointed out and the noble
and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, has amplified, we have had the Bank
Mellat case with the trenchant criticisms by the Supreme Court that the
application was made. However, those criticisms were applicable to the
particular circumstances of that case. It is important and significant
that the case nevertheless gave the Supreme Court the opportunity to
spell out the principles that ought to be applied when the courts are
considering closed material proceedings. I join the noble and learned
Lord, Lord Goldsmith, in welcoming those principles, and with the noble
Lord, Lord Pannick, in seeking clarification that they still apply. For
my part, it seems that they can and do apply under these
rules<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T20:19:03"></hs_TimeCode>. It was

noble Lord’s regret Motion puzzling is that the rules as drafted

briefly give one or two examples. The central point of Part 2 of the
Act is to permit CMPs to enable security-sensitive material to be used
in litigation without compromising national security. The rules provide
for a modification of the overriding objective, as has been pointed
out, to ensure that

court must still deal with cases justly and in accordance with the
overriding objective. I suggest that the modification is the minimum
necessary to bring the overriding objective in line with the decision
of Parliament to enact the legislation. Furthermore, the court is still
specifically bound, as the Minister pointed out, by Section 14(2) of
the Act to give effect to the fair trial requirements of Article
6.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13072920000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0003.htm#13072920000085">Earlier

and requires it to do so following pre-trial disclosure if it no longer
considers the fair and effective administration of justice test to be
met. That is a very important safeguard which, as my noble and learned

provide a comprehensive code for the involvement of special advocates.
They give the court judicial control at every stage to ensure that a
specially represented party’s interests are compromised as
little as is consistent with national security. This was one of the
cardinal demands of those of us who believed that it should be for the
court to determine when CMPs should be permitted and how they should be
regulated. In particular, a special advocate will be able to apply to
the court for directions under Rule 82.11, enabling him to communicate
with the specially represented party so far as national security
allows.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072920000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0003.htm#13072920000088">It is
a matter of record that the special advocates opposed this legislation.
They did so understandably, 
<?notus-xml column=1626?>because CMPs are contrary to the principles of open justice that lie at
the heart of our common law system, in which we hear and test evidence
made available to all parties in open court. No one disputed then or
disputes now that CMPs represent a derogation from those principles. No
one, I suggest, underestimated the significance of the decision we
took. In passing the Act, Parliament acted on the basis that it was
better for the few cases to which it applied to be determined with CMPs
than for them never to be determined at all, which was the
alternative.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072920000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0003.htm#13072920000089">My
central point is that these draft rules do no more than fairly and

second question very specifically relates to the special advocates, and
to vetting procedures for special advocates in Northern Ireland, where
I think it is a more difficult matter perhaps than in the rest of the

asked the noble Lord, Lord Bach, who was then the Minister, about the
vetting of special advocates in Northern Ireland. He replied that there
was a high level of vetting. He referred to credit checks, checks on
criminal convictions and so on—similar to those for a civil
servant. The documents that I have received so far, either in that case
or in the case of the Motions before the House tonight, refer not at
all to the special advocates and the level of vetting. I just want
reassurance that it is still regarded as a high level of vetting, given
the sensitivity of the matters, which inevitably come under the purview
of the special advocates, and I ask whether, in the difficult

the way in which he opened the debate tonight. It is commonplace to
observe that closed material procedures 
<?notus-xml column=1627?>touch on matters as sensitive, in terms of the fundamentals of our
system, as anyone can imagine. Having heard the extremely thoughtful
contributions of fellow Peers tonight, it occurs to me that, if it were
at all possible, it would be advisable—if I can put it that way
to the Minister—to take away the issues that have been raised
here tonight rather than push them through.</hs_para>

extremely thought-provoking points made by the noble Lord, Lord
Beecham. The noble Lord, Lord Pannick, referred to the five Neuberger
principles—if I may call them that—which all require, I
think, considerable further thought. The noble and learned Lord, Lord
Goldsmith, raised the issue of potential vetting, so to speak, of
applications by the Attorney-General of the day. I hope my noble friend
the Minister will not have any fear of going against precedent if he
considers it advisable to postpone passing these rules tonight so that

Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> My Lords, first, I thank all noble
Lords who have contributed to this debate. As my noble friend Lord
Phillips said just now, we are dealing with very sensitive issues,
which, in the debates on the Bill during its passage, received
considerable attention, not least because of the very fundamental
issues of the administration of justice to which they give rise. I
think my noble friend Lord Marks of Henley-on-Thames was fair in saying
that these rules that we now have are a fair and proper reflection of
the architecture and detail of the statute that was passed by
Parliament. The fact that it is in the form it is owes in many respects
a lot to the work of your Lordships’ House, which the Government
had no alternative but to pay heed to after the amendments were passed.
The legislation that is in place is the better for
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T20:29:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072920000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-0003.htm#13072920000096">A
number of important issues were raised. I will try to respond to them
but I am conscious that, as the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, said, I spoke
without pausing to draw breath. He made a number of important points
which I hope I will be able to capture. If I do not cover everything, I
will certainly write to him and circulate it to all noble Lords who
took part in the debate. I will also address the point he made about
the various points in the Justice briefing, although he identified only
one or two of

only was the statutory consultation followed with the Lord Chief
Justice of England and Wales and the Lord Chief Justice of Northern
Ireland, but we sought also to allow an opportunity for your Lordships

to do the same. I simply do not know whether the Northern Ireland Human
Rights Commission was engaged in this, or whether the Lord Chief
Justice of Northern Ireland consulted. Certainly, he was under no legal
duty under the Act to do so. I can also say that the rules were being
prepared as the Bill was going through and had to be very substantially
changed in the light of the amendments that were 
<?notus-xml column=1628?>passed. That was probably why they were not available at an earlier
stage. Notwithstanding that, there was an opportunity for consultation,

the Joint Committee on Human Rights and the Constitution Committee were
not consulted. At this stage, when we are dealing with rules, the

rules and, as I said, neither of them wished to draw any particular

the court will, as set out in Rule 36.14(4), take into account all the

is also important to say that these rules are not set in stone. While

of amendment to Civil Procedure Rules. If, at a future date, there were

Government have sought to improve the database of closed judgments that
is available to special advocates, and that work has been ongoing. I
will come in a moment to the other important issues about judgments,
which the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, mentioned. Of course, the
judge’s discretion is there throughout. Whenever the disclosure
has happened under Section 8, the judge is then required under Section
7 to look again to see whether it is still in the interests of the fair
and effective administration of justice in these proceedings for the
initial declaration 
<?notus-xml column=1629?>for closed material proceedings to continue. Almost every step along the

noble Lord, Lord Pannick, referred to the recent judgment of the
Supreme Court in the Bank Mellat case. What he said in many respects
reflected what was said many times during the debate, not least by me.
It was there from the very first Green Paper that the intention of the
Government is that closed material proceedings should be used in just a
very small number of cases. At the time when the Bill came before your
Lordships’ House, in the 12 months from October 2011 to October
2012, the figure of 20 was talked about. I do not have an up-to-date
figure, but I understand that it has not changed much. Some cases may
settle and new cases come in, but that is roughly the order of the
cases. It is certainly our view that these cases should arise only
where we believe it is strictly necessary. I do not believe that there
is anything in the rules that is contrary to the principles identified
by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Neuberger, as President of the
Supreme Court. I have no doubt, too, that in considering applications
for closed material proceedings, these will be drawn to the attention
of whichever judge is dealing with it. I am sure that the special
advocates involved will be very astute and keen to do so.</hs_para>

point is that these will be matters for the judiciary, and the
judiciary has indicated in that case at the highest level that the
threshold is quite a high one. I have no doubt that in the months and
years ahead there will be litigation on provisions of this legislation
when there will be an opportunity for judges to indicate—with
specific reference to this legislation—how it should be
interpreted. However, as I indicated, I do not believe there is
anything in the rules which run contrary to the principles that have

noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, asked me about what might be in
the review as opposed to just numbers. I will give him an indication.
For example, if there were a change to the rules of the
court—which would not come before your Lordships, it would come
before Parliament—that might be reported. In terms of
development there would be an indication from the Secretary of State as
to how he sees this law working out in practice. Maybe not in the first
year, but after one or two years when there is some experience of how
it works. I certainly would not see anything wrong in having a bit of a
narrative, which can perhaps be expanded, as is possible consistent
with the information and national security. The noble and learned Lord,
Lord Goldsmith, also asked me whether the Attorney-General was
consulted with regard to the Bank Mellat case. I simply do not know and
cannot remember being told. He and I know that there is some delicacy
as to what you say the Law Officers have been asked; but his comments
about the involvement of the Law Officer comes from a distinguished
former Attorney-General, and therefore I will certainly ensure that his
comments on this are drawn not only to the attention of my right
honourable friend the Attorney-General but generally to those who are
going to be involved in these cases.</hs_para>

the noble Lord, Lord Bew, made, was with regard to special advocates. I
have no detailed knowledge of this, but I have no reason to think that
the vetting is any less now. Of course, special advocates in Northern
Ireland are appointed by the Advocate-General for Northern Ireland, who
is of course one and the same person as the Attorney-General for
England and Wales, a position which the noble and learned Lord, Lord
Goldsmith, has previously held. Therefore, I think he can be assured

possible problem that might have existed in relation to costs of a Part
36 application is covered by Rule 36.14, as he says. But of course,
that does not leave the party in any better position to assess whether
to accept a Part 36 offer. There may not be a cost implication, but he
is not in any position to assess the strength or otherwise of a Part 36

move to go from nuclear, at certain times of year will probably rely on
French electricity generated from nuclear power.

turn to investment. As I have already indicated, we grounded the report
in the economic reality of our current situation. It was clear to us
that investment in energy, particularly in low-carbon energy, can bring
rewards in both jobs and growth. However, that investment has to be
unlocked, unleashed and brought forth. We discovered that this is no
easy task and, frankly, is the key issue to be tackled. Private sector
share values of generators have slumped across Europe, and the public 
<?notus-xml column=585?>sector across the EU is hardly in a position at the moment to make a
significant contribution. Ultimately, therefore, we will be heavily
reliant on institutional investors, those who manage our savings and
pensions, to provide that necessary investment. I was interested to
read in the Government's response that a meeting will be convened
between the Commission, member states and investors later in the year.

the issue through that type of dialogue, it was also clear that
investors would like clarity on the direction of policy. The Energy
Bill is designed to provide some clarity in the UK, but UK policy does
not sit in a vacuum distant from the EU’s own energy and climate
change framework. Our core policy recommendations related to that
framework, setting policy through to 2030 at least, with both clarity
and urgency. The Government have already made their position clear,
including a commitment to a unilateral EU 40% emissions reduction
target, with the option of a 50% target conditional on an ambitious
international agreement in Paris in 2015. The committee strongly
welcomed this strong commitment by the

we differed from the Government was on the topic of more specific
targets. A target is an intervention in the market and is therefore not
ideal. On that, we agree with the Government. However, it was not
possible for us to ignore the weight of evidence suggesting that
investment, particularly in low-carbon energy, requires some sort of
regulatory signal, and that the 2020 renewables target has been
pivotal—in fact, central—in boosting investment in that
sector and, critically, driving down the costs of those
technologies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T15:39:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307297000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#1307297000015">We

a purely theoretical basis, the Government’s argument has
validity, particularly for the UK energy market, supported by the
energy market reform. However, we find ourselves in an EU investment
crisis, where it is time for action and not theory. I would therefore
very much welcome the Minister’s comment, not on the ideological
principle of a technology-neutral approach in the UK, but on precisely
how the EU policy will demonstrate that the EU is committed to
low-carbon power and, above all, attract the necessary
investment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T15:40:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307297000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#1307297000017">I
will now say a few words about the ETS, the emissions trading system.
We devoted a lot of attention in our inquiry to the future of the
emissions trading system. I remind everybody that this scheme gives
companies the option of either buying the right to emit carbon, or
alternatively taking action to reduce emissions so that there is no
need to buy the emissions allowances. Of course, carbon needs to trade
at a price that is sufficiently high to influence the choices made by
emitters. As your Lordships are aware, this has not 
<?notus-xml column=586?>been the case. After trading at around €30 per tonne of carbon in
2008, earlier this year the price dropped to less than €3.
Clearly, there are a range of reasons for this. Probably the most
specific reason is the recession, which has driven down demand. The
classic case of a high level of supply and a low level of demand has
led to
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307297000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#1307297000018">The ETS
must be strengthened if it is to survive. Frankly, we see that as the
only realistic option, because we could not envision an EU-wide carbon
tax that would meet with general approval. The recent proposal to take
surplus allowances out of the market—with so-called
backloading—and put them back later has merit as a stop-gap
proposal, but frankly that is as far as it goes. In the longer term we
recommend the introduction of a floor price—in other words, a
minimum price above which carbon would trade. Critically, this would
give certainty to both investors and national treasuries, to which the
proceeds of the auctioning accrue. Clearly, carbon would ideally trade
above the floor price. For that to happen the overall ceiling on the
number of allowances needs to be tightened. There must be a clear
trajectory for tightening, so we can take this down gradually and
manage the
market.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307297000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#1307297000019">Those
are<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T15:44:40"></hs_TimeCode> our
recommendations for ETS reform. We consider that they can be presented
as part of a package of measures to attract new investment and support
efficiency and innovation. I would welcome any light that the
Government can shed on the progress they have made on establishing
their own policy on the future of the ETS, particularly as the
proposals for change are expected from the Commission towards the end
of the
year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T15:42:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307297000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#1307297000020">I
turn now to carbon capture and storage. One reason why it is so
important to strengthen the ETS is that a proportion of the allowances
was meant to provide a source of funding to support carbon capture and
storage demonstration plants. The low price of carbon has meant that
the available pot of money has been much smaller than anticipated,
which contributed to the lack of demonstration plants in the
EU.</hs_para>

a committee, we are very supportive of CCS. Realistically we can see
the challenges, but we would like to see the development of existing
and innovative new low-carbon forms of energy. This is critical.
However, it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T15:44:40"></hs_TimeCode> is
inevitable that for the foreseeable future fossil fuels will deliver
the majority of the EU’s energy. We have only to look at cheap
coal arriving from America, or the burning of lignite in northern
Germany, to see that there is still a massive dependence on fossil
fuels. It is because of this dependence that the lack of progress in
the development of CCS technology in the EU is deplorable. Unless we
get this to work, the whole of our future policy must be under
question.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307297000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#1307297000022">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T15:44:40"></hs_TimeCode>
see room for a regulatory approach to be developed at the EU level,

any new fossil fuel power stations, based of course on the results of
the pilot study. Disappointingly, the Government did not respond
directly to that recommendation in our report. Yes, the UK’s
emissions performance standard was mentioned, but my understanding is
that this will not affect gas. I would therefore be grateful if the
Minister 
<?notus-xml column=587?>could explain the Government’s position on potential EU

turn to shale gas, a matter of enormous interest in our report and in
recent months. We wished to understand from the outset whether the US
shale gas revolution could be repeated in the EU. The answer, we
concluded after listening to a wide range of witnesses, was that it was
unlikely in the short to medium

United States has 50 years of good seismic data, a conducive land
tenure system and has drilled 40,000 wells looking for gas. At the time
of our report, fewer than 100 wells have been drilled in Europe, so
there is quite a long way to go if we are to have a shale gas
revolution. There is undoubtedly potential for its
exploration—we see this happening in the UK and possibly
Poland—but the creation of an expectation that the EU can
compete on the basis of cheap fossil fuels in the short to medium term

investment. It would be one more uncertainty if we hung our hats on

in the United States is selling at between $3 and $4 per billion BTUs.
The major exporting countries—Russia, Qatar and
Algeria—rely on a price of $10 to $12 in Europe and maybe $15 in
Asia. We can only shudder to think—we saw it the last time the

consequences of a dramatic reduction in gas prices. I am sure that

potentially at a higher cost than if the single energy market were to
be working effectively. We welcome the Government’s approach to
the UK’s capacity mechanism as a short to medium-term provision.

the Prime Minister’s leadership towards reaching an EU-US trade
agreement. Our relationship with the EU is frequently criticised. It
has been said that this was due to our lack of involvement over the
years; for example, the low voting turnout at EU elections is notably
lower than at general elections because it is always said that,
“It doesn’t really matter”. However, our Prime
Minister obviously feels that it does matter, and rightly so. It
matters enough to bring this initiative to the Council. How refreshing
to have a positive initiative such as Mrs Thatcher had when she was
Prime Minister, with the Single European Act in
1984.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307297000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#1307297000032">Secondly,
like the noble Lord, Lord Carter, I want to highlight box 5 of the
report and the development of what is termed “unconventional
gas”. I am sure that many noble Lords will have read other
reports about fracking and the major successes that shale gas and oil
exploration have had in the United States. There may still be a debate
here regarding timing but my noble friend Lord Ridley has spoken and
written most eloquently on this and the extraordinary geopolitical
changes that could evolve from this
development.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307297000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#1307297000033">Thirdly
and finally, despite the title of this report—<I>No Country is
an Energy Island</I>—we still read about the great necessity for
an independent energy policy, which reputedly fracking could help
deliver. I return to the two buzzwords of the early 1990s that everyone
chanted. The first was “subsidiarity”, the idea that
decisions should be taken at the most decentralised level of government
consistent with effective action. The other was
“proportionality”, the idea that EU legislation should be
the minimum required to achieve a particular goal. Perhaps these ideas
should be revisited and built upon to cope with today’s exciting
new changes and developments. I greatly look forward to my noble friend
Lady Verma’s response to the debate, the topic of which will no
doubt have a huge effect on our future over

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, I am delighted to see the name of the
noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, on this list, and to follow her now.
This is partly because, with all due respect to other noble Lords and
Baronesses in the Room, we have spent rather a lot of time together on
this subject over the past few months, beginning upstairs in the
committee and in recent weeks here in 
<?notus-xml column=589?>the Committee stage of the Energy Bill. Much of that work in the early
months has been properly reflected in this report, and I praise the
leadership of the noble Lord, Lord Carter, and his very comprehensive
explanation of this
report.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072911000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000002">We
have to deal with two things in parallel: something that is going on at
the EU level and something that is transforming UK energy policy at the
same time, in developing new mechanisms to deal with the trilemma, as
was spelt out by the noble Lord, Lord Carter. How UK energy policy fits
within the overall EU policy is not an easy question to answer. If we
are honest about it, policy at the EU level has been piecemeal and
partial and aspects of it have been quite a mess; policy at the UK
level has not exactly been consistent either and has left us with some
very serious problems.</hs_para>

that. If we look at the record of most member states, we find that
there is a crisis of investment in energy in almost all of them. That
crisis has been aggravated by sudden changes of policy; the most
dramatic was Germany’s abandonment of the nuclear option but
there are others, including within this country, such as the change of
subsidy regimes and the change of direction in regulatory
matters.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072911000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000004">We
have also seen growing public opinion, of which we should take greater
account. On the one hand it is quite hostile to some forms of energy
development, notably—for reasons with which I do not
sympathise—to aspects of renewable energy, in particular wind
energy; in other countries, as well as to some extent in this country,
to nuclear developments; and elsewhere to the revival of coal. That
means that there is a political problem for Governments and for the EU,
as well as a technical problem, with which we grappled in both the Bill
and in the sub-committee’s work on this report.</hs_para>

encapsulated in a concern that the lights may go off all over Europe,
but it is even more fundamental than that. The issue is whether we have
grasped what the structure of the energy industry should be in 10 or 20
years’ time, in a context where we are trying to decarbonise,
increase Europe’s energy security and at the same time ensure
that the price paid for energy by both ordinary consumers and
business—which will have an effect on Europe’s
international competitiveness—can all be brought together. For
that reason as well, consumer reaction is part of the political reality
that we are
facing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072911000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000006">My
noble friend Lord Carter quoted the Commission and other European
institutions as saying that the internal market in energy would be
completed by 2014. That is Eurospeak at its worst. There is nothing
like an internal single energy market in Europe. We are a long way off.
We have 27 different energy markets. Some are still dominated by state
or ex-state incumbents. Others are dominated by companies that operate
right across Europe, such as our own. Still others have insufficient
investment because they have insufficient domestic companies to provide
that investment. Therefore, we have a hotchpotch of energy policies,
and the European effort of bringing them together has not, despite a
third and now a fourth energy package, created an internal energy
market in the sense that other markets have been created.</hs_para>

of this could be addressed by greater physical interconnection. A
strong case is made in our report for increasing the degree of
interconnection. The UK has some interconnections. In our Grand
Committee on the Energy Bill the other day, the right reverend Prelate
pointed out that he had an app on his iPad that could have told him
that we were 6% dependent on the French nuclear industry at that
moment. That is a reality, but we could get much more cost-effective
value for money from our energy system if two-way interconnection were
more the norm right across
Europe.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072911000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000008">However,
we have not only 27 different regulatory regimes but 27 different
contracting arrangements, 27 different energy mixes, and 27
different forms of anxiety about what the future holds. There is a lot
of anxiety, in eastern Europe in particular, for obvious reasons, about
being dependent on Gazprom and the whim of the Kremlin for its gas
supplies. We have seen the Government of Bulgaria effectively stopped
as a result of energy prices. We are seeing problems in the switch back
to the energy sources that we know. Heavily carbonised coal and lignite
are being adopted in Germany and Poland as the main platform of their
energy policy. As a result, their carbon targets are seriously in
jeopardy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072911000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000009">We
are faced with this range of problems. Overriding it is the level of
investment required to even address them. We are talking about
€3 trillion over the next period. It sounds a lot of money, but
some witnesses told us that the money was around and that the issue was
how we attract it and get it invested in energy. It will not come from
any of the member states, or from the energy companies’ balance
sheets. Some accusations of profiteering may be correct. There is a
certain lack of transparency in their balance sheets, as the Select
Committee’s report in the other place published today
underlined, but the fact remains that there is not a lot of money on
their balance sheets, and their stock market ratings are a fraction of
what they were 10 years
ago.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072911000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000010">If<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T16:05:03"></hs_TimeCode>
investment will not come internally, it must come from the markets. To
attract the markets’ money into energy in Europe, including the
UK, you need to give investors far more clarity and a greater sense of
direction on how that market will go. On the face of it, it is a
long-term investment with an almost guaranteed return. Some of the
provisions of the Energy Bill try to institutionalise that as far as
this country is concerned, but there is actually huge
uncertainty.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072911000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000011">This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T16:05:03"></hs_TimeCode>
is not surprising, given the fluctuations in energy policy and the
energy markets over the past few years. It is also not surprising given
that Europe is still floundering about whether it can actually make
effective the one measure which has been adopted on a pan-European
basis: the European trading scheme. At the moment it looks very poorly.
Certainly, at the market price it is not going to work. The European
Parliament and the European Council of Ministers were even reluctant to
make the relatively minor reforms to the ETS of the system of
backloading. This would tighten the market slightly in the current
phase and the next phase. They were reluctant to do that. If they are
also reluctant to adopt more radical measures, such as the carbon price
floor to which my noble friend Lord Carter referred, then we are in
serious difficulty.</hs_para>

successful part of pan-European policy so far is the targets for 2020,
most of which will be hit or almost hit. Yet there is still an argument
within Europe and within the UK—along with a certain reluctance
within the UK Government—about what the targets should be for
2030, particularly in relation to decarbonisation of the electricity
supply.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072911000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000013">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T16:05:03"></hs_TimeCode>
is also the big problem of how we tackle the technological challenge.
If we do not develop a technically, economically and commercially
effective form of CCS then there will be a reversion to significant
proportions of our energy supply being delivered by coal, by lignite
and even by gas. This would mean that nothing like the trajectory to
meet our decarbonisation targets for 2030 and 2050 can be achieved.
Without CCS—with unabated coal, unabated gas and unabated
lignite—there is no way in which those objectives can be
achieved.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072911000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000014">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T16:05:03"></hs_TimeCode>
are seeing not only a dash for gas—which is probably sensible
and rational at this point, although it will not be much cheaper in the
short term even with significant amounts of shale gas, and which is
itself carbon-intensive—but a significantly more damaging role
for coal. This is happening in eastern Europe and Germany, but if we
are not careful, it might also be a side-effect of the capacity
mechanisms that we are developing within this
country.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072911000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000015">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T16:05:03"></hs_TimeCode>
need technological progress on carbon capture and storage, which still
seems a long way off. We need a more genuine single internal market for
energy, which involves more physical interconnection. We need more
moves to harmonise our regulatory structure, and more effective
regulators. There is criticism here of Ofgem as a weak regulator, some
of which I agree with, but some of the regulators on the continent are
yet weaker and markedly less independent of the industry or the
government. We need to develop a common approach to developing this
internal market. It is a big challenge; a political challenge, a
technical challenge and an economic challenge. If we do not meet that
challenge, I think this report underlines the fact that there will be
serious failures right across Europe. We need to be careful that we do
not jeopardise whatever measures we put in
place.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072911000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000016">If
we go too far down the road of capacity mechanisms, state by state,
then we are actually moving in the opposite direction to achieving a
single market and the cost benefits which would come from that.
Although I broadly support the capacity mechanisms proposed in the
Energy Bill, there are consequences to relying too heavily on those
here. Some of the other mechanisms which have been developed in Spain
and elsewhere jeopardise the objective of a single market. Those of us
who are, broadly speaking, pro-European need to push for that. Those
who are perhaps more hesitant about that must recognise that it needs
to be an important part of the national policy, along with action at
European
level.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T16:05:00"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para><hs_time UID="13072911000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000085">4.05

the moment that is more worthy of considered attention than energy
policy. We have heard the carbon problems, the security of supply and
the problem of potential fuel poverty described as a trilemma, and the
European Union does not seem to be making the best fist of those
challenges. Part of that is due to the relatively recent focusing on
these issues. Energy policy was not an original competence of the
Union, despite the coal and steel community having been the original
organisation. Even since the treaty of Lisbon, with shared competences,
it has also been guaranteed that member countries would be free to

difficult issue, we have had a number of, frankly, shocking surprises
that have impacted upon a number of member countries of the EU and led
to sharp changes of direction. I think, for example, of the Fukushima
explosion and what that did to the Federal Republic of Germany, with
which we could have maintained a much closer dialogue if it had not
stood its policy virtually on its head, in so far as it has moved
towards abandoning nuclear power and rid itself of any commitment to
carbon capture and storage. If the European Union considers this to be
such an important issue, it ought seriously to contemplate the
development of institutional means of ensuring that discussion takes
place before these national decisions are taken, which can be very
disruptive of collective
decision-making<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T16:09:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072911000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000020">The
one thing that was absolutely clear, from almost all those who gave
evidence to our committee about the necessary investment in the
infrastructure and in technologies, was that the European Union should
endeavour to have a clear, predictable and lasting policy. Up to 2020,
maybe we will achieve what has been forecast and struggled for, and it
is encouraging that the Commission has indicated its support for a plan
up to 2030. However, Governments involved in this process are
inevitably reactive to what is going on on the ground and what the
temporary obsessions of their electorates may be. This is not a
recommendation of the committee, but we really ought to consider having
a continuing standing committee of the Council to exchange views and
keep each member country closely up to date with the movements of
opinion that are occurring in each member country. Coming together to
the Council for a short period of time has never seemed to me to be an
ideal way for such a powerful body to prepare for the decisions that
need to be taken. I strongly advocate the establishment of such a body.
The Commission cannot do this on its own. We have seen how national
Governments have switched position and made life extraordinarily
difficult.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072911000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000021">I

glad to follow the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, not one word of whose
contribution I disagreed with, so I do not need to repeat these

were considering fracking and shale, the emphasis switched, even in
this country, from scepticism about its relevance to our future to some
kind of 
<?notus-xml column=593?>optimism about it overcoming our problems. I confess that I see no

our tools and to formulate a scheme that will enable us to go forward,
not only to ensure our own security of supply, cost control and carbon
control but to influence the global picture. From time to time we have
been able to do so, but it is clear that Europe cannot do that

are a European committee and I believe that the EU now has a major role
to play in the trilemma of energy—the intricate balance between
security, affordability and decarbonisation—which has already
been spoken about. I might repeat what I said at Second Reading of the
Energy Bill: I believe that the greatest of these three is security of
supply. None of others matter unless we keep the lights

the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, said, the EU came to this role late in
the day, only since the treaty of Lisbon in 2007, but energy should now
be a major trans-boundary issue on a par with the environment,
international biodiversity, fisheries, cross-border water management,
international crime and the like. The EU now has a major role to play
in helping provide the lead and the infrastructure for cheap,
non-polluting and, above all, reliable energy for the whole
continent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T16:15:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072911000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000026">Clearly,
certain issues remain the responsibility of member states; for example,
the direction of travel and the speed of travel in terms of sources of
power generation. Keeping the lights on will indeed remain a national
responsibility. On the other hand, issues such as the emissions
performance standards can affect the quality of life across Europe and
should remain the prerogative of the

that the EU can do than mere regulation and controls, the most
important of which is interconnection. We had a good go at this when
debating the Energy Bill last week and I repeat that with the advent of
high-voltage direct current—HVDC—electricity can now be
transported across Europe, to Romania from Portugal and to Sweden from
Sicily, although north Africa is probably a better example because it
has huge solar potential. Soon it should be possible to make connecting
electricity from a windmill in Galway Bay to a house in Bulgaria as
easy as it now is to talk between those two sites on the telephone. I
am sure that noble Lords will remember 
<?notus-xml column=594?>the difficulty of making that telephone call only a few decades ago.
Energy transmission will be the same as telephone
transmission.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072911000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000028">To
create a pan-European electricity grid now would be to borrow at
historically low interest rates and would create a huge number of jobs
at a time when they are most needed. A pan-European grid would allow
intermittent renewables to complement each other: when it is not windy
in Germany, it might be sunny in Italy; when it is windy in Portugal in
the middle of the night, the power can go to Poland where they are just
waking up. Such interconnection could bring a whole new justification
to renewables yet to be built. For instance—this is a favourite
of mine—a Severn barrage producing the equivalent of three or
four nuclear power stations would cost less than HS2. Although it would
probably need a strike price nearly the equivalent to nuclear or
offshore wind for its first 30 years, for the next 100 years after
that, the electricity produced would cost only about 2p to 3p per
kilowatt. Even if it is being produced in the middle of the night, it,
too, can go to Greece or the like—and at that price they may
even be able to afford
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072911000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000029">European
interconnection will not only help keep the lights on but should also
ensure that our economy and industrial output has access to the
cheapest electricity available. That is not to say that we do not also
need our UK capacity mechanism to help us keep the lights on in the
mean time, as the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, said, because there is a
long way to go before we achieve such continental connectivity and
there is much work to be done. Not only must the European Commission
inject the funds necessary; the €9.2 billion available for
energy under the Connecting Europe Facility is, frankly, laughable when
you consider that it also includes gas storage and pipelines across
Europe. It is certainly not enough when we are told that before 2022 we
are going to need €104 billion for grid connections, including
€23 billion for subsea cables alone. The Commission must raise
both its own funding and European Central Bank funding, and permit and
encourage massive joint funding from the private sector. It has also
got to clear the questions of differing regulatory regimes that exist
across Europe, as well as the specification for the interconnectors and
who is going to own and manage the infrastructure in the future. In
other words, in order to secure private investors, the Commission has
to help decide, but perhaps not dictate, how those investors are going
to get a return on their money. It should also stick to the plan,
unlike some member states have done recently. Politicians must resist
the temptation to see energy companies making large profits and think
that this is somehow wrong. If these generating companies are going to
have to raise billions of pounds—€3 trillion, as the
noble Lord, Lord Whitty, says—I am afraid that, certainly in the
early days, they have to have huge profits in order to pay the
investors. If the investors get a sniff of the fact that some
politicians are going to step in and start taxing them, this investment
is not going to
happen.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072911000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000030">I
agree with the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, that we must try to avoid any
obfuscation on behalf of these companies. Everyone should be up front,
including the politicians, about the fact that we have to raise the 
<?notus-xml column=595?>money and that therefore the profits are going to follow, as night
follows day. There has to be full clarity across the board. Everyone
has to be clear in advance about what is going to happen because we
have to stick to the plan; otherwise, we will not get the
investment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072911000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000031">Another
area that all parliaments have to engage in, including the European
Parliament, is pressing the case publicly for interconnection and
helping to overcome public antipathy to the means of connection; that
is, pylons. I am afraid that in order to get the connection we have to
have the
pylons.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072911000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000032">Moving
on from the problems of interconnection—I suspect that we
probably had enough of that last week—the two other important
roles for the EU here are: to get the EU Emissions Trading Scheme
working effectively and to put more money into R&amp;D. I will not
expand on the EU Emissions Trading Scheme—ETS—because I
think our report does that effectively. But we need notice now of a
floor price to come in, say, 2020—and, yes, if necessary, a
ceiling price if that makes the politics easier—and we need an
increase in the annual rate of reduction of allowances after 2020, so
that everyone knows that the cost of carbon emissions is going to go up
between 2020 and 2030 and they should start planning and investing for
that now.</hs_para>

right should be part of a larger strategy. There is a view that the ETS
is now a busted flush and decarbonisation is better achieved by
regulation, targets or even specific carbon taxes. I sympathise with
that view but I would prefer to give the ETS one last push to see if it
can work. From our conversation with the Secretary of State, I gather
that that is also the Government’s position. We need to work
very hard on this because it is going to be very difficult.
Nevertheless, as I said, the ETS should be part of a larger strategy of
ensuring that the 2030 roadmap gives the clearest, most certain and
irrevocable signals for pan-European investment in energy up to 2030,
because the programme for investment during that decade is just about
to
begin.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072911000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000034">Turning
to R&amp;D, I note that the recent EU financial framework has increased
the overall research budget from €55 billion to €80
billion. But is this enough on a continent whose economic future
depends on being at the cutting edge of technology in so many different
fields? You have to ask how much of this will find its way into the
energy sector. During our investigations I was very struck by how many
of our witnesses reckoned that with the current windmills and PV panels
we are really only floundering at the edges of renewable power
generation, and how we have yet to make those important breakthroughs
that will achieve zero-carbon power emissions. We do not know what the
future will hold but, as sure as goodness, we need to spend a lot of
time and effort trying to find a way to a better future. We need to
considerably increase our R&amp;D
spend.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072911000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000035">That
brings me to carbon capture and storage. This is not so much of
European importance but is of crucial importance to the world. World
electricity usage is estimated to rise by 84% between 2008 and 2033,
and well over 50% of that new power will come from coal. Already
China’s annual increase in coal-powered electricity equals the
whole annual electricity demand of the UK. That is billions of tonnes
of CO<Sub>2</Sub> 
<?notus-xml column=596?>escaping into the atmosphere. But if we could pilot and promote an
effective and practical system of CCS, we would be doing something
hugely important to save the world. It would take most, or all, of the
sting out of coal and gas-driven energy. However, it became obvious
during our investigations that the rest of Europe seems to have turned
its back on CCS, so once again it is up to us, the UK, to keep our
nerve and push on with our CCS
projects.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072911000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000036">I
left my remarks on CCS to the end because I think they are the most
important. Europe uses 10% of the world’s electricity so what we
do and how we do it is not very important in the overall scheme of
things except to our own economy. But CCS is important and if we can
come up with a viable solution here, not only will we have a technology
that we can sell but one for which the world will—or certainly
should—be eternally
grateful.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-29?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_29_PT_1/7E429C2010904E7B279C6F3DCC4D040996E36806" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 29 July 2013">Monday,

start with a certainty. As others have said, the EU Emissions Trading
Scheme should be strengthened. Clearly it is not working at the moment.
This should be addressed. I hope that the Energy Bill will encourage
that to happen here. If it is not working here, one wonders what on
earth is happening in the other countries of Europe. As the noble Lord,
Lord Cameron, said, this country should take the lead. I am
particularly disappointed that the projected income from it has failed
to materialise. One of the areas to which the money would have been
devoted is research aimed at perfecting a system of carbon capture and

across the world, coal and other fossil fuels are the main source of
heat, light and power. I believe that they will remain so for many
decades to come. A reasonable way of combating the carbon emissions
involved is to trap them and store them where they can do no harm.
Natural gas, which includes shale gas, produces 57% less carbon dioxide
per kilowatt hour than coal. Even so, its emissions must be captured.
The policy brief, <I>A UK “Dash” for Smart Gas</I>,
introduced in March this year, contains a wealth of data that include
the US Energy Information Administration figures on world recoverable
resources of shale gas. Interestingly, China has the most. The United
States is next, with Argentina third. The UK has a tiny amount by

of this protection will be carbon capture and storage. In a Written
Answer of 20 June this year, the Minister pointed out that the 2013
Budget had announced  
<?notus-xml column=597?>the selection of two preferred bidders in the CCS selection competition.

security has obviously been strengthened by efforts and investment in
the renewables sector. I agree with others that it is slow and very
varied. There is tangible evidence on the questions of onshore and
offshore wind farms, the use of landfill gases, sewage sludge digestion
and anaerobic digesters. Studies of barrage and marine turbines also
have a role to play. However, the House of Commons report of 3 July
this year stated that job and investment announcements in the
renewables sector since 2010 show that in Scotland, £1 billion
has the potential to support 697 jobs; in Northern Ireland 878 jobs; in
England 1,287 jobs; and in Wales 1,395 jobs. What causes this
variation, even in our own country, and what is the variation across
Europe? Does anyone know? Does it matter? Are there things that we
could change to improve it? Will it be more advantageous to site energy
plants across the continent, or could enormous gains be made by
locating them in one place in a number of regions? Does energy
generation benefit from special factors, as our textile industry did in
the 18th
century?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072911000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000042">Investment
in renewables, broken down into English regions, shows an even greater
variation than the one I quoted earlier for the countries of the UK.
Hence, £1 million spent in the West Midlands has the
potential to support 8.24 jobs; in the south-east, it would support 6.1
jobs; in the south-west, only 1.12; and in the east, which has had more
than half the total recorded investment since 2010, it would support
only one job. Is it possible that the explanation for these figures
might indicate that certain types of investment in renewables would be
better made in one place than
another?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072911000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000043">I
turn to DECC’s annual report and accounts for
2012-13, and specifically to Table 8, “Total identifiable
expenditure on services by function, country and region, for
2011-12” under Chapter 8, “Financial Core Tables”.
Interestingly, expenditure in England on economic affairs was
£393 million, of which £119 million was spent in the
north-west. On environmental protection, the total for England was
£1,644 million, of which the north-west had
£1,044 million. DECC’s total spend in England
was £2,048 million, of which the north-west had
£1,165 million. Does this mean anything of which we
really should take note? Is it an important message that should be
considered in the energy security debate? If such variations are
happening in our country, one wonders what is happening in other
countries.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072911000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000044">Will Europe’s

Giddens:</Member></B> My Lords, I join other noble Lords in
congratulating my noble friend Lord Carter on his excellent
chairmanship of this committee. We now have a no less excellent
chairperson with us here  
<?notus-xml column=599?>today. I also thank Alistair Dillon, Aaron Speer and Kate
Chapman for all the work that they put into the report. We pretend that
we produced it but, unless it is illegitimate to say so, they wrote it
and produced some of the ideas that we incorporated as our own. Perhaps
we could ask to strike that out of <I>Hansard</I> if we are not allowed
to say it; I am not
sure<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T16:36:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072911000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000051">As
noble Lords have said, investment in energy is crucial for the EU and
its member states. The reasons can set out briefly and easily: first,
there is the need to combat climate change; secondly, energy security
is elemental to wider security in the EU; and, thirdly, as noble Lords
have said, this is a crucial moment in European history in terms of
economic recovery, and anticyclical investment to promote recovery
demands that energy should form a core part of that. The interesting
thing about the report is that it shows that these three are in tension
with one another. This is the famous energy trilemma, which I assure
noble Lords has now entered the energy hall of fame; since I read a lot
about energy, I have now seen many references to it, for which certain
figures sitting behind noble Lords should perhaps take the
credit<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T16:37:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072911000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000052">I
am pro-European—not just “broadly speaking”, as my
noble friend Lord Whitty is—and I believe that climate change is
one of the most dangerous threats that we face in the 21st century. It
is quite right that the EU has sought to combat this with its
“20-20-20” targets and its offer, which has not so far
been taken up, to increase one of those to a 30% emissions reduction
target.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13072911000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000053">However, as other noble
Lords have said, there is a really big range of problems with European
policy in terms of both climate change and energy. Other noble Lords
have drawn attention to at least some of the issues. I shall mention
three in the area of climate change policy, which I suppose is my prime
specialty. First, although I know the noble Baroness, Lady Parminter,
probably will not agree, the precautionary principle, on which Europe
has based a good deal of its environmental policy, is actively
incoherent and has had unfortunate consequences for European policy.
This was well demonstrated in a celebrated book by an American author,
Cass Sunstein, called <I>Laws of Fear</I>, in which he thoroughly
deconstructs the precautionary principle. Basically, the precautionary
principle prioritises the everyday statement, “Look before you
leap”. That is a good enough principle but, as with every
popular saying, it has its opposite—such sayings are very handy
for so-called common sense because with them you can make sense of
everything after the event—which is, “He who hesitates is
lost”. In my view the United States is right never to endorse
the precautionary principle. It has an inherent conservatism, which
follows from the fact that you are simply using one everyday saying and
not the
other.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072911000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000054">This<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
has had consequences for the EU’s attitudes to biotechnology and
to shale gas, which has an amazing history. We read about it for years
and now suddenly shale gas is on everybody’s lips. You cannot
open a newspaper without a mention of shale gas. I hope someone will
ban the word “fracking”. It is such a stupid word. All
the newspapers have headings such as 
<?notus-xml column=600?>“Not Fracking Likely”, and so forth. They should call it
“shale gas” or “shale oil”. That is much
more down to
earth.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072911000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000055">I<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
had a certain disagreement over shale gas with the committee, because
it is truly transformational. Europe cannot stand aside from it because
it affects energy prices so much. My noble friend Lord Carter said that
it is impossible for Europe to resist its impact. It has a very direct
impact on European competitiveness at the moment, for example
vis-à-vis the Americans. Therefore, shale gas will have a
transformative effect even if the Europeans do not drill lots of wells
themselves, which they probably will. Europe will have to import gas,
probably from Algeria, where it exists in large amounts. The price in
Algeria will probably come down a lot, and will tend to meet the
American price. I see it as being a transformative thing whether you
like it or
not.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072911000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000056">I will
not spend a long time on the second problem with climate change policy:
the failure of the ETS. This was much discussed by other noble Lords
who contributed to this debate. It is a big test for Europe. Can it get
its act together on this? The temptation is just to fiddle with it, and
to do backloading and so forth. That is hopeless. It has been a failure
in the core terms in which it was established. It is all very well to
have a floor, but it should probably have a ceiling. The danger is that
the ETS will be an example of how not to do it for the rest of the
world as they start their own schemes. California’s scheme seems
to me to be much better thought-out, with a floor and a ceiling and
more chance of being effective. Whether Europe can get its act together
on this is a big thing. It is not at all easy to
do<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T16:42:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072911000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000057">Thirdly,
as other noble Lords mentioned, there is the return of coal in Europe.
As someone who is deeply concerned about climate change, to me this
is very important. Coal is returning, not only in terms of
heightened production but also the import of coal from the United
States, extraordinary though it would have seemed a few years ago. You
would never have believed it would be possible. Cheap coal is coming
from the United States because of shale
gas.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072911000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000058">This<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
is probably the most lethal thing in terms of emissions. If you believe
that climate change is dangerous, you must reduce emissions. This shows
that it is a mistake simply to suppose that if you have a certain
proportion of renewables, you are thereby reducing emissions. It
depends on what you do with the rest of your energy mix. It may
therefore be a bit unfortunate that the EU took on a renewables target,
because it should also have set a coal target. There is an EU policy on
coal, of course, but it is not
functioning<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T16:43:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072911000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000059">Moving
on to energy itself, there are major problems to which other noble
Lords referred. The main one is simply the structural difficulty of the
European Union. It wants to implement grand plans, and at this point in
its history it needs grand plans. However, it does not have the
capability to do so because most policy in key areas is in the hands of
member states. This is particularly true of energy. There is an
unbelievable diversity to the energy mix of European countries. Poland
gets 70% of its energy—not 70% of its electricity but 70% of its
energy—from coal. That is really archaic in contemporary 
<?notus-xml column=601?>terms. Sweden, on the other hand, gets 49% of its total energy from
renewables. It is extraordinary. France has the highest proportion of
nuclear energy in the world, while Germany is phasing out its nuclear
altogether. It is a horrible mix for the EU to have to deal with, and
it will hamper
investment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072911000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000060">We
need large-scale investment, as other noble Lords said: really big
investment. I am not at all convinced that the markets will supply it.
In the EU we will probably have to add quite a lot of direct
intervention. The EIB is too small and does not have the resources to
provide it. The ECB is unable to do so. Therefore, the dilemmas are
huge. I do not see where investment on the scale demanded will come
from. It seems to be another bit of paper. The European Commission has
these massive goals, but in the mean time the whole thing is limping
along.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072911000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000061">I will
pass over modernisation of the grid. My main difference with what other
noble Lords said is that I do not think that it has proceeded very far
at all. There has not been much progress. We still have energy islands
in the middle of the European Union. The Baltic states are an energy
island. They get almost all their energy from the former Soviet Union.
There are several energy islands. The most important
interconnections have been made where states have particular driving
needs. I refer, for example, to what is happening in Germany at the
moment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072911000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000062">I will
finish with two questions for the Minister. The Government made a very
detailed and good response to the report, but when the response
discussed the ETS, it stated that it had worked and had served to
reduce carbon emissions. I hope the noble Baroness will forgive me when
I say that that is a ludicrous thing to say. The mechanism has not been
there to reduce carbon emissions. It may have made an impact in its
very first phase, but carbon emissions have come down for a cluster of
other reasons, including the recession. A big thing facing Europe is
what will happen when we get an industrial renaissance. Europe is not
really prepared for the expansion of emissions that will come from
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072911000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000063">Secondly,
in the light of what the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, said, I would like
to hear the Minister’s response on German Energiewende: energy
transformation. What view do the Government have of that? One reads so
many things that suggest that the Germans are stupid to try to reduce
their energy system to large-scale renewables. They are not stupid. I
have studied this in some detail. They have a very sophisticated
policy. They have thought about all the things such as interdependence.
You can get the most amazing technologies that transfer intermittent
energy at the borders of countries and normalise it. Germany has a well
worked-out plan. It might not work, but I would be very interested to
hear the Government’s view of the German
experiment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T16:47:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-29?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_29_PT_1/B3C3FEE374B54F777050FBDF039E58C9E79F2CC2" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 29 July 2013">Monday,

Parminter:</Member></B> My Lords, it is always a pleasure to follow the
noble Lord, Lord Giddens, and I look forward to discussing in Committee
the merits, as I see them, of the precautionary principle, and the
benefits 
<?notus-xml column=602?>that it has brought to the environment both of the UK and, more broadly,
of Europe. Like other members of the sub-committee, I thank our
chairman, the noble Lord, Lord Carter of Coles, for his excellent
chairing and for the debate today. I also thank the Government for
their response. They found that there was much with which they could
agree, although on the targets for renewable energy we obviously have a
strong
disagreement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072911000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000065">Given
that a number of us are speaking today, I will choose one issue on
which to focus. I am sure that colleagues who have been sitting through
the Energy Bill will be delighted to hear that I am not going to not
speak on my particular topic of interconnections because the noble
Lord, Lord Cameron, spoke so well about it and because, following the
very welcome comments of the Minister last week in Committee, I look
forward to returning with an amendment on
Report.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072911000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000066">Instead,
I will turn to the issue of shale gas and the need for a robust
regulatory structure for its exploitation in the European Union. Both
our report and the Government’s response are cautious about the
likely extent of EU-produced shale gas. The Government state
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13072911000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000082">“it
should not be assumed that it will bring impacts comparable to those
seen in the
US”.</hs_quotefo><hs_parafo UID="13072911000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000077">However,
the Government, while not getting too excited by the idea that shale
gas can reduce Europe’s energy dependency or solve the problem
of high prices, have clearly been persuaded that it can at least stop
an increase in dependence. In recent weeks we have seen the Government
easing the path for shale gas companies with generous tax breaks and
the creation of the Office of Unconventional Gas and Oil to encourage
the development of the industry. Beyond that, they have said that they
plan to cut environmental permitting processes from the current 13
weeks to less than a
fortnight.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13072911000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000067">What
is needed now is a robust regulatory framework that gives certainty for
investors and addresses the environmental impacts. However, in their
response to our report, which calls for a regulatory structure for the
exploitation of shale gas in the EU, the Government argue that they
are,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13072911000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000083">“not
convinced that substantial new action at EU level is
required”.</hs_quotefo><hs_parafo UID="13072911000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000068">It
is clear that securing an EU regulatory framework will not be easy.
Both France and Bulgaria have banned extraction but José Manuel
Barroso, the President of the European Commission, has said that those
member states that wish to begin fracking—I use the term
unapologetically—should do so. The Commission plans to bring
forward a proposal for a framework on shale gas by the end of the year
but it is not yet known whether this will be just guidelines or
something more
robust.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13072911000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000069">It
is disappointing that the Government seem to see the prospect of a
revised EU framework as something that could seriously restrict
opportunities for exploiting shale gas resources rather than as an
opportunity to address the genuine environmental concerns that it
brings and, as crucially, to help deliver public confidence in the
process. The events of the past two weeks at 
<?notus-xml column=603?>Balcombe in West Sussex, where Cuadrilla is drilling for oil, could
indeed mark the beginning of open guerrilla-style warfare if such
concerns are not addressed.</hs_para>

ourselves that the existing EU regulatory framework is designed for the
conventional hydrocarbon sector. Fracking presents a whole series of
new challenges. There are real concerns that the chemicals used in
hydraulic fracking can seep into water supplies, as Water UK, the
industry body that represents all major water suppliers, made clear
earlier this month. It was Water UK, not a group such as Friends of the
Earth, that went on to highlight that aquifers can be contaminated by
fracking, by leaks from wells or by the poor handling of chemicals or
wastewater on the surface, and that fracking requires huge amounts of
water, which will inevitably put a strain on supplies in areas around
extraction sites. All this is in addition to the small earthquake
tremors caused by the horizontal drilling necessary to extract the
gas.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13072911000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000071">These
issues need addressing and it is not sufficient to be thinking in terms
of minor amendments to the existing regulatory framework, as the
Government seem to wish to do in order to help grow the industry rather
than deliver sustainable shale gas extraction. Given what they say in
their response to our report, what is the Government’s approach
to the Commission and counterparts in other member states to influence
their thinking on the proposal for a framework on shale gas? Do they
want minor amendments to a regulatory framework prepared for the
conventional hydrocarbon sector or do they accept the need for such a
framework to take into account the full environmental impacts of shale
gas?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072911000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072911000072">Only by
delivering a robust regulatory regime can the legitimate environmental
concerns about shale gas be addressed and, just as crucially, public
confidence secured. As the shale gas exploiters admit, their attempts
to test Britain’s shale gas potential will be hamstrung unless
they can win that public
support.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-29?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_29_PT_1/00A23E843A97E900F9370E3BC3E95387FD424EB8" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 29 July 2013">Monday,

in general about energy policy, then concentrate on five points in the
report, and then come on to shale gas and comment on what the noble
Lord, Lord Giddens, said. My general point is that if the three aims of
energy policy are to cut costs, cut emissions and keep the lights on,
the country seems to be doing quite well on the second, rather badly on
the first—partly because we are setting the pace in Europe on
the second—and risking serious trouble on the third, as far as I
can see and as far as Ofgem seems to be telling us, because of lack of
investment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T16:55:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072913000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072913000005">I
have to admit that I am not convinced that the Energy Bill, on which
the Grand Committee is working so hard, will change the picture much.
It seems to maintain the current balance between the three objectives
and is a bit of slow-burner, with capacity payments—whether or
not they are a good thing—not coming in for another five years.
Nor do I believe that achievable changes in EU energy policy would make
a great difference either, although some of those proposed by the
committee make obvious good sense; for example, it is clear that the
ETS badly needs reform and that the most obvious reform is the
backloading of the auction of allowances, which I really hope will be
agreed second time
round<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T16:56:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072913000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072913000006">However,
there is not a great deal that the EU can do given that the treaty
makes it clear that each country’s national energy mix is a
matter for it alone. Like the committee, I think that there could be
rather greater stress on interconnection in energy grids and energy
pipelines, for oil as well as for gas and electricity—the report
is curiously silent about oil, which is likely to remain the principal
transport fuel for Europe for some considerable time to come. If you
look at countries such as Bulgaria, which, as the report points out, is
still 100% dependent on Russia for its gas, and the Baltic states,
where most links still run back to old Soviet suppliers, it is clear
that interconnection should be a priority. It increases competition,

hope that the Commission will not stop trying to encourage member

general, however, I would not want the Commission to be too ambitious
this year. The committee is rather more expansive, and the points that
I shall now make on the report are where I think it is asking either
for a little too much or for the wrong thing. Sometimes, its enthusiasm
has run away with it. I give five examples: first, paragraph 54
recommends that the Commission should require member states to submit
obligatory annual reports on national energy policies and should assess
those reports for the compatibility of such policies with the
EU’s state aid
rules.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072913000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072913000009">It
would be very good if the EU did have a single market in energy rather
than 27, as the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, pointed out, but it does not.
If energy 
<?notus-xml column=605?>were widely traded across national frontiers, it would be
reasonable—indeed, essential—to apply the competition
rules assessing the fairness of national support schemes, but I am not
sure that member states, including the UK, are quite ready now for the
Commission to step in. For example, with regard to the announcement
last month that the strike price for offshore wind in the UK might be
as high as £155 per megawatt hour, would we want the Commission
to tell us that that was potentially a breach of European competition
rules?</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13072913000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072913000010">The
point is that it is no accident that the treaty says what it says now,
which results from a long process of negotiation and is as far as the
member states were prepared to go. They have not conferred on the
Commission the power to run a real energy market. I therefore agree
with the Government’s rather guarded response to this
recommendation, and I think that the Commission is quite right to be
pretty reticent about applying the rigour of state aid rules in the

Giddens:</Member></B> I thank the noble Lord for giving way. There is
an interesting discussion to be had about having a parallel to the
European semester in energy. The European semester appears to have
achieved quite a large rate of acceptance, obviously because it
originated in the eurozone, but it is not completely implausible to
suppose that you could have some kind of analogue to that which would
be to everyone’s benefit, precisely because we are, or we want
to be, using interdependent energy, and it would make sense to get the

Kerr of Kinlochard:</Member></B> I entirely agree with the noble Lord.
An exchange of ideas, of the kind that the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan,
was talking about, would be highly desirable and moderately helpful.
However, the committee’s report talks about the application of
the state aid rules. We are moving on from something like the European
semester on economic policy to something like the entity talked about
in the French-German paper at the end of May, which would have fiscal
rules enforceable with sanction powers. That is not likely to happen in
the short term, but I do not think that full application of the rigour
of state aid rules is either necessary or desirable at the present
stage of the development of EU energy

98 deals with nuclear power. The Commission is trenchantly urged by the
committee to address outstanding issues, particularly liability, waste
and, again, state aid. Why? Is it plausible that the Commission could
find a solution that would satisfy the nuclear French and the now
anti-nuclear Germans? What are we supposed to do? I do not understand
the purpose. Do we need a single common answer? Provided that safety
rules and high safety standards are enforced across the whole of the
Union so that safety is assured—remember that the closure of
their Chernobyl-style plants was a precondition for accession countries
joining the European Union—subsidiarity should apply. I do not
see why there need be an EU regime for waste or a particular EU level
of liability rules, let alone state aid 
<?notus-xml column=606?>rules. I note that the Government’s response passes over this

the subject of border taxes, I know that what we are talking about are
global border taxes, but that seems like the argument that a financial
transaction tax would be fine if it was global, when we know that it is
not going to be. Paragraph 133 talks about the idea that imports from
countries with low energy costs and environmental policies that we deem
inadequate should be subject to an import tax in order to reduce carbon
leakage. The Commission opposed this, citing huge administrative
complexity. I agree, and I would also cite higher costs for our
businesses and consumers, the certainty of retaliation against our
exports and the probability that the precedent would prove interesting

fourth point is that I am uneasy—I am getting into deep

What growth assumptions would underpin that target? If a member state
of the European Union managed, by the skill of its economic policies
and the energy of its population, to achieve an astonishingly high
growth rate and therefore higher energy use, what would we do about the
binding target? Would it mean that the state would have to be fined? If
so, we would need to amend the treaty to give ourselves the power to do
that. Let us not go there. Again, the Government’s response

of investment because companies do not base investment decisions on
such targets. They are moved to invest or not invest by the clarity,
consistency and credibility over time of the policy regimes in force in

deters investment is uncertainty, not targetry. What deters investment
in this country is in part the hypocrisy of on the one hand doubling
the social and environmental costs paid by the energy consumer through
his utility bills—the carbon taxes, installation costs,
smart-metering costs and other energy-efficiency costs that have
doubled in the past 12 months—while at the same time supporting
and encouraging populist criticism of the industry for putting up
prices. Of course it will put up prices if it has to charge all the
levies in its bills. I find it objectionable to make the consumer
rather than the taxpayer foot the bill for environmental policy. That
seems to me to be socially regressive. But if you do not allow profit,
you will not get investment. For the investor, long-term targets are
neither here nor there. That may sound cynical but it is

Gazprom, which is why Mr Putin plays up the environmental fears. The
intriguing table at appendix 7, which shows that gas and nuclear are
already the best buy, underestimates the extent to which gas will be
the best buy. The data are DECC data, and therefore probably reflect
the Government’s view that in the medium term gas prices are
likely to remain at about their present level. I am pretty sure that
they are actually going to fall, and therefore I think that the

evidence and interviewed witnesses, one thing that struck all of us on
the Committee was how wrong all the forecasters had been in the
previous 10 years. I would put my money on the current forecasters
being equally wrong, which makes it a much harder report to write. It
also makes it very much harder for the Government and the EU to get it
right for the future. The situation is extremely difficult but I firmly
believe that the Government are right in going for the broadest
possible energy mix. That is the safest way of getting at least some of
the right solutions.</hs_para>

CCS is a continual problem and I fear that I am very pessimistic about
it. I look forward to seeing the results of the research that we are
doing, but there should be far more concrete examples of the commercial
viability of CCS if it is going to be a power in the future. That is a
problem for much of the EU because countries have built CCS into their
estimates for meeting their climate change figures, and the UK is
particularly noticeable on this. If we do not get CCS, the figures that
we are talking about will not be met. There is of course the problem
that the powerhouse of Germany is against
CCS.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072913000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072913000039">It is
important that we have a decarbonisation target for 2030. I ask my
noble friend what progress has been made towards the 40%. My niggle and
my concern is that if we in Europe go too hard on such targets and
growth begins again, what is going to happen to our heavy
CO<Sub>2</Sub> users such as steel and cement producers? Are we just
going to import those products? In which case, we will have carbon

has been said about interconnectivity; indeed, my noble friend Lady
Parminter raised it last week. We looked at it but perhaps not in
detail, given the time. More could be done with community schemes
to try to ease the problem of interconnectivity.
Interconnectivity is not the be-all and end-all; far more can be done
locally that would reduce the necessity for
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072913000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072913000041">It is
clear that invention and research are the way forward and will help us
to sort out the problems. One thing that I think struck all of us was
that if someone could invent a sensible, economic way to store
electricity, there would be real hope because we could start to manage
the problem. I would love to be the person who did that because one
would have a worldwide market for that. We need new investment but,
again, that is not the only way to tackle this. We need to reduce
demand and keep up energy efficiency. Energy efficiency in houses is
the best way of reducing one’s energy
bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072913000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072913000042">New
products have been talked about quite a lot today. Have the UK
Government or the EU looked into their viability? By that I
mean—I am looking at it from a different point of view from most
other people—the cost of a new energy as a proportion of the
value that we derive from it. It is called the economic return on
energy invested. Much depends on where the resource is but, in simple
terms, there is no point in producing 100 barrels of oil, or its
equivalent in other forms of energy, if 100 barrels or more are
consumed in the extraction process. That would not make
sense.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072913000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072913000043">Let us
stick with oil. Oil was extracted in the 1930s at a rate of more than
100:1, so for one barrel of oil you could produce 100 barrels. That was
a very good return and oil companies were very profitable. By the
1970s, that had reduced to 30:1. The new wells today are about 10:1. In
stark contrast, nuclear is estimated to be more than 60:1, so on that
basis it looks a much better source of energy.</hs_para>

Yes, we might have written the report somewhat differently had we known
of the massive reserves just referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Kerr,
but we did not have that information when we wrote it. The estimation
of the economic return on energy invested for shale gas is only 5:1.
That just does not make it economic in Europe. It will not be the quick
fix that some of us hope. At a 5:1 ratio, it would absorb one-sixth of
GDP, which would make for a very different future. That would have huge
implications for the consumer. It is important that the Government and
the EU look at the figures. The figures I have been quoting came from a
Tullett Prebon report called <I>Perfect Storm: Energy</I><I>,</I><I>

the efficiency of existing reserves and how they are utilised, I was
interested to read in the newspaper today as I came down on the plane
from Scotland that the oil rigs in the North Sea are now standing idle
for more than 140 days a year, which is a substantial increase on what
was happening 10 years ago. It just 
<?notus-xml column=611?>goes to prove that, although you can have huge reserves, there remains
the question whether you can get those reserves out

new development needs public support—the noble Lord, Lord
Whitty, touched on this and was absolutely right—and we mention
it in paragraphs 176 to178 of our report. Everybody knows that there is
a problem, but a lot of people are against every solution that comes
forward. We might have shale gas at Balcombe, but it saddened me to see
children on the front line with banners. It is their future that we are
talking about. We will all be pushing up daisies pretty
soon—well, within reason; I still think that I am one of the
youngest in the committee—but if young children are protesting
against even research into what could be under the ground, let alone
the extraction, there could be a problem. We had problems in Scotland
where the new transmission lines are going across some lovely country;
we have problems with PV panels in Suffolk. It is a huge problem that
the whole of Europe has got to get to grips with. The noble Lord, Lord
Carter of Coles, reminded us of Germany. It solved the problem; it did
not put a high-power transmission system down the centre of its
country; it just exported the system through its neighbours to get it
from the north into the south. That might work for Germany but it does
not work for everyone, and it certainly upset the markets in those
countries through which the pylons
went.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072913000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072913000047">We now
have a constant clash between the generators, people and the
environment. It was interesting to read that, after all the windmills
that have been built in Scotland, despoiling quite a lot of lovely
countryside, the Scottish Government have announced that there will not
be any windmills in national parks. Those in Scottish renewables say,
“Oh! This could be the end of the renewables era; this is going
to set us all back”. You have the big six companies exploiting
the situation that we find ourselves in to get the maximum benefit for
future contracts. It is not easy for any Government to be in that
position where there is so much lobbying and we know that, as we move
from one system to another, everyone will try to exploit
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072913000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072913000048">I move
back to the UK to put two concluding questions to my noble friend.
First, I heard on the radio this morning that a deal has been struck
between the EU and China on PV. Can she say anything to us about that?
What implications might it have for the manufacturing of PV in Europe?
No one seemed to have an answer or to quite know the figures, so any
further information might be
helpful.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072913000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072913000049">My
second question, again relating to the UK, came from the Energy and
Climate Change Committee report, which indicates that £112 goes
on our energy bills for social and environmental problems. That is
about 9%, and the figure is going to go up to 33% in 2020. In view of
the concern of the noble Baroness, Lady Worthington, for the
environment and her interest in climate change, and of what she did for
climate change, I now call that bit on my energy bill the
“Worthington whack”. Now I have personalised it for her,
and I can pay it much more happily when I know that. Does the Minister
agree with the committee that this should be a tax rather than going on
energy

am not a technician in this area but wanted to say a bit about the
behavioural issues that, with all the complications that we have and
the formidably intricate interrelationships between the hard sciences
of energy, profoundly difficult economics and the uncertainties of
Europe, may well be seriously compounded just by simple, human
behaviour. The straightforward need for consumers to heat their homes
and for energy to be available for all the other activities that make
for civilised living, including employment, recreation and, as the
noble Lord, Lord Whitty, was pointing out, producing more food, will
become more politicised as prices increase, particularly if supplies
become uncertain. During our considerations I heard more than one
sceptic express the view that the lights might go out by 2017 and I
have heard it said again in this

Government acknowledged in their response to our report that the EU
must urgently implement its third internal market package in order to
reduce prices to consumers, promote cross-border trade and provide
incentives for efficient investment. However, the language—I
come back to this as a social scientist—is that of uncertainty,
“may” and “believe”. For example, they

with consequential climate change, it has become necessary to engage
the public in a debate about changing their lifestyles. Changing human
behaviour is not easy, especially when understanding is limited. In our
report we acknowledge that public concerns can be a significant
obstacle to development. We heard on a number of occasions about
Germany, where the issue was that there was a need to put a grid from
north Germany to south Germany. It is public opposition that has
delayed that, and that is the key point about that
example.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072913000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072913000055">A
similar reaction is building up to the possible development in the
north of England and some EU countries of the extraction of gas from
shale, even before plans have been considered. There is a real need for

Worthington:</Member></B> My Lords, I am delighted to be able to wind
up this debate for the Opposition. I also extend my congratulations to
my noble friend Lord Carter and to the many members of EU Sub-Committee
D who participated today and who contributed to this excellent and very
timely report. As has been mentioned, we have been locked in Committee
for weeks—we have our ninth session tomorrow—and it is
quite nice to have a slight change of perspective and to look at things
from an EU
angle.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072913000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072913000061">Many noble
Lords have mentioned the energy trilemma and the challenges that it
poses. It is even more of a complicated puzzle when you add the EU
dimension. A number of noble Lords spoke very eloquently about the
particular challenges of trying to achieve any degree of coherence
across 28 member states. What struck me in this debate was the paradox
between the current set of member state-driven policies, which resulted
in a huge diversity of energy policy and an apparent lack of cohesion,
and a much more aspirational vision, which was set out very eloquently
by the noble Lord, Lord Cameron, of a much more integrated
Europe—a Europe that can capitalise on and exploit all its
natural advantages in order to create a security of supply that is
affordable and low-carbon. We have a vision of how it could work but we
are also very well aware of the limitations of how it is currently
working.</hs_para>

towards that vision and try to alleviate some of the inherent
difficulties? It is absolutely clear from the contributions we have
heard today that there is a strong sense that we need a clear plan and
that we should stick to it; that this should not be subject to the
winds of fortune, to the degree that is feared at the moment; and that
there should be a long-term
vision.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072913000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072913000063">That
brings me on to one of the key recommendations the committee made: that
targets should be set for 2030. In a very welcome contribution to the
debate, the report is quite clear in stating that there ought to be a
2030 target for emissions. Indeed, I am sure that the Government would
say that they support that. Where there is a difference between the
committee’s recommendations and the Government’s current
policy is on any sub-targets that relate to that time period. We have
heard quite strong arguments for why targets at a lower or subdivided
level are important to give investment signals.</hs_para>

at the Government’s response to the committee’s
recommendations and I am slightly disappointed that, while the
Government provide quite a lengthy description of why a renewable
target might not be necessary—indeed, similarly, they are not
persuaded by an energy-efficiency or demand target—the
committee’s recommendation that a decarbonisation target should
be considered is not really addressed. Perhaps the Minister can say a
few words about why, having rejected the need for a renewables target
for 2030—many people would perhaps challenge the rationale for
that but let us accept it on its surface merits for the
moment—there is not more about the alternative of a
decarbonisation target for the electricity sector for 2030. I do not
want to rake over old arguments, but it is quite clear that in the UK
we are very strongly supportive of the setting of a decarbonisation
target for 2030 and we would like to see it—or at least a
commitment to it—in the Bill.</hs_para>

Government are quite as supportive. I found this sentence in their

is quite weak. The words are far less emphatic than those of the
Secretary of State in person. He stated that the Energy Bill would set
a decarbonisation target and that there was no need for additional
criteria to be met. However, here we have a qualification being added.
I would like some clarity from the Minister on that. It seems to be a
step
backward.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13072913000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072913000066">I
will take this opportunity to try to elicit a response from the
Secretary of State. I wrote to him on 3 June and congratulated him on
announcing targets for 2030. I also asked a few questions: not least,
whether he would clarify some of the detail in relation to that
announcement. I have not yet had a response. Perhaps a message could go
out that it would be very good to have a response to my
letter.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072913000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072913000067">Many
topics have been covered and I am conscious that we have had a very
full debate. I do not wish to detain the Committee much longer.
However, I will 
<?notus-xml column=615?>say a few words on some of the topics that have been covered. When we
discuss EU policy on energy, the Emissions Trading Scheme cannot be
ignored. It was introduced as the flagship climate-change policy of the
European Union. Considering the widely different policies across Europe
on energy, it was something of a success to introduce a single policy,
accepted by all 27 member states and adopted also by Norway and
Switzerland. It is currently functioning. It has had its teething
troubles—let us not be shy about admitting it—but it is a
very harmonising
policy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072913000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072913000068">It is
a matter of regret that the scheme has been hit by a number of problems
associated with its inherent lack of ambition. The targets were set far
too generously. This was severely compounded by the recession, and the
fact that emissions have fallen far faster than anyone could have
predicted. A number of noble Lords have said that predictions about
energy tend to be wrong. This is an example of where they were very
wrong. Unfortunately we did not have a response mechanism built into
the policy that enabled policymakers to take swift action to correct
it. We have very low prices and we do not have a carbon floor price or
a carbon ceiling price. That was a decision that was
taken.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072913000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072913000069">As was mentioned in the
debate today, other emissions trading schemes are choosing different
routes. It is notable that the Californian scheme, perhaps recognising
one of the failings of our system, put in a strategic reserve to enable
prices to be kept in a corridor, with a cap and a collar. It is perhaps
time for the EU to swallow a bit of pride and accept that the scheme
was not perfect the first time around and that we could do with some
reform. I note that the UK Government are committed to trying to
achieve that reform and have stated that they want proposals to come
forward from Brussels by the end of the year. That is very welcome. We
hope to see them passed into law as soon as possible. However, there is
still a question on timing. We might get proposals from Brussels in
2013, but it is unlikely that they will be legally signed off before
the elections in 2014. Then it will be for the new Commission and
Parliament to debate this once more. I share the Government’s
passion for this but I do not fully support their optimism that it will
be as easy as we have been led to believe by the answers we have been
given.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072913000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072913000070">There
is an added complication for the UK. We have a system of carbon budgets
introduced by the Climate Change Act. I am grateful to the noble Earl,
Lord Caithness, for attributing all the costs associated with a
low-carbon economy to me. I am afraid that I cannot and will not take
credit for that. The Government have done a fair amount themselves, in
particular by introducing the carbon floor price, which I never
recommended and about which I have serious questions. However, I go
back to carbon budgets. As the noble Earl said, I was involved in
passing the Climate Change Act, which was based on the concept of
carbon budgets. We proposed that they should be least-cost and
flexible. The idea was to get the Treasury involved in managing them,
and to create assets and liabilities out of emissions and emissions
reductions. We are not there yet, but that is the
philosophy.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-29?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_29_PT_1/CA420BF88F69B46C1AB0584656273E67AF2D74DF" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 29 July 2013">Monday,

hope is a robust system that is intended to give investor confidence,
but it is subject to a review. That review was never part of the
plan—it crept in when the third carbon budget was
accepted—but is timed for 2014. The reason why I am dwelling on
this point is that, as we have mentioned, the EU reform of the ETS is
not likely to be agreed until 2015, so to have our review a year before
Europe has agreed its plan seems to be out of kilter. That will just
add further complexity and confusion. If I have a question, it is
really this: could we hear more about the rationale for reviewing our
system of carbon budgets in 2014, when it is widely accepted that
Europe will not have its plans sorted out until 2015 regarding both the
energy and climate package and the reform of the ETS, which I am sure
will form a part of

turn to CCS, which naturally leads on from the ETS because the ETS was
supposed to be the Europe-wide policy for supporting CCS. I am quite
sad that I was not able to attend any of the committee’s
evidence sessions because I am sure that it received many interesting
contributions. I know CCS from a UK perspective but I am equally
troubled by the fact that it has not taken off at the EU level. I was
grateful to the report for trying to identify some of the reasons why
that is so, the failure of the ETS to provide funding being the primary
one. I do not think it is as simple as that, though; as the report
alluded to, Germany’s opposition to it and the lack of public
support have also dented its progress.</hs_para>

number of things are being considered in the EU right now regarding the
ETS directive. They include the application of an energy performance
standard similar to the product standard that the EU has shown that it
can manage quite effectively for vehicles, the idea being that perhaps
now the time has come for product standards for power stations as well.
There is even talk of a new form of support for CCS in the form of
mandatory CCS certificate trading as a potential additional support
mechanism. It would be interesting to hear what the Government’s
thinking is on the potential for additional measures for CCS at the EU

noble Lords, Lord Giddens and Lord Kerr, have alluded to the claim that
the failure of CCS and the ETS has led to a return to a quite
substantial reliance on coal. It will come as no surprise that this is
an issue that I care about, as it affects not just Germany and indeed
Poland, which has always been and continues to be heavily reliant on
coal, but the UK. Policies are in place in the UK to try to ensure that
we do not see a continued long-lasting reliance on coal. I hope that
that will continue to be monitored carefully to see that there is no
swing back to more coal, mothballing of more gas or life extensions
being applied to our existing coal stations. This is a gap in our
policy at UK level and indeed at European level, and it needs careful
monitoring<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T17:48:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072913000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072913000075">There

not mix in parts of England. 
<?notus-xml column=617?>I do not think that anyone can know for certain whether shale gas is the
nirvana that is claimed and can provide the low-cost, affordable,
low-carbon energy that we all hope that it can, or whether it will be
held up even almost before it gets to start by a lack of public
support. It is another of the great uncertainties of energy policy, and
it is one that will no doubt develop over time—probably quite

final thought—I notice that I am slightly over time, so
apologies for that—is that if I could politely ask the committee
to consider a future topic, it would be that environmental regulation
carried out by the EU has been shown to be successful. The large
combustion plant directive and the industrial emissions directive are
worthy of further study. That could be tied in with the CCS directive
currently being discussed, along with a look at the non-market
regulatory interventions into the energy market that are having a big
impact. They tend not to be really dealt with or understood in great
detail. I must confess that trying to get to grips with the IED and all
its details and flexibilities is quite a
task.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072913000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072913000077">Perhaps<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T17:54:40"></hs_TimeCode>
the Committee might consider taking some evidence on those important
energy-related regulatory instruments, to complement the work it has
done on the ETS and other policies in this report. I for one would find
that incredibly helpful. That is no reason to do it, but I think that
there are some good cases for seeing what Europe has done in a
regulatory way. This could be compared with what has happened with
vehicles, vehicle standards and product standards, and then seeing how
that could translate across to energy. We have had a fantastic debate.

first, full implementation of the internal energy market, delivering
well functioning gas and electricity markets that will contribute to EU

with a 40% unilateral target for the EU, a point made by the noble

turn to the points raised during the debate. As I have said, if I
cannot answer them, I shall write to noble Lords. The noble Lord, Lord
Carter of Coles, and a number of other noble Lords asked how the
Government’s EU policy would attract investment. An ambitious
greenhouse gas target for 2030 combined with a functioning Emissions
Trading Scheme will give a very strong signal to investors. This
approach is echoed in the response of the Institutional Investors Group
on Climate Change to the Commission’s Green Paper on a 2030
framework. The noble Lord, Lord Carter, and others also asked what the
Government’s position was on structural reform of the EU ETS. As
I have said, we need urgent reform of the EU ETS to reduce the surplus
of allowances in the system. We are analysing detailed options for
structural reform and are working towards a more detailed government
position, which I hope to bring forward in the

noble Lord, Lord Carter, and others asked whether we supported the idea
of an EU-wide carbon price floor. The UK carbon price floor is the
first step in our electricity market reforms. It does not cover every
sector in the EU ETS and is a separate, UK-only tax. There needs to be
a clear justification for taking fiscal action at EU level rather than
national or local level, but the UK is not alone in pursuing wider
decarbonisation policies beyond the EU ETS, with the majority of EU
countries pursuing policies to encourage investment in low-carbon
generation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072913000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072913000091">The

noble friend Lord Maclennan asked whether the Government should
consider a standing committee of the Council to exchange views and
update member states on domestic issues affecting energy policy. That
is an interesting suggestion which is worthy of further consideration,
but such mechanisms already exist at working level—for example,
the electricity and gas co-ordination group. There are usually around
five Energy Council Ministers meetings each year, so a number of things
are already going on. Still, I will take that matter back and give it
further
thought.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072913000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072913000093">The
noble Lords, Lord Carter and Lord Whitty, my noble friends Lady Byford,
Lady Rawlings and Lord Caithness, and others asked how we could support
the development of CCS at European level. The Government believe that
the priority for CCS is for the European Commission to work with member
states and industry to deliver the first full-chain European projects.
In our response to the Commission’s recent communication on CCS
we advocated that there should be reform of the ETS and an ambitious
2030 greenhouse gas target; that existing funding should be made
available to CCS; and that there should be support for CCS research,
innovation and development. It is true that there has been a recent
increase in coal and lignite generation. However, a study commissioned
by the Government has shown that the economic outlook for coal is poor.
For example, in Germany three major energy companies have announced an
end to new coal.</hs_para>

had made in Europe towards a 40% greenhouse gas target. One of the
reasons that the Government set out our position on a 2030 greenhouse
gas target was to encourage others to be equally ambitious. The
Secretary of State has set up the Green Growth Group of like-minded
member states that are ambitious on climate change. Most member states
are still considering their positions and we expect to have a clearer
picture in the coming months. In the mean time, the Government are
working hard to make the case for 40%.</hs_para>

asked whether extra money for environmental and social policies would
go on to consumer bills or be a tax. Of course, as my noble friend
knows, taxation is a matter for the Chancellor and his question is way
above my pay grade. But we are focused on policies to deliver a
low-carbon transition and security of supply at the lowest possible
cost to the
consumer.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072916000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072916000006">My
noble friend also asked about PV in China. I think I need to write to
him on that because the response needs to be a little more detailed
than I am possibly able to give to the Committee today. But he is right
to raise the point about support for particular technologies. Since we
remain uncertain about future costs and prices, we need to be flexible

our electricity market reforms and adopting them. Of course, different
circumstances apply to different countries. However, lots of countries
have shown an interest in what we are doing here. We

noble Baroness, Lady Worthington, asked about the decarbonisation
target. We had a lengthy debate on this in Committee. As I said then,
and will say again today for the benefit of the members of the
committee, the noble Baroness is right that we need to look at
decarbonisation and how we do it. The Government are setting a target
range in 2016 in the context of the fifth carbon budget, but I know
that we will have further debates on this and it would be wise to allow
those debates to happen during the passage of the Energy

2014 when EU decisions are not going to be until 2015. The European
Council is scheduled to consider proposals on EU climate and energy
packages for 2030 in March 2014. It is crucial that the EU takes a
position on this in 2014 in advance of the global climate talks in
2015. The EU’s long-term trajectory is also indicated in the
Commission’s low-carbon road map to 2050, but the noble Baroness
is right that there is a need to set carbon budgets with a view to what
other economies are committed
to.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072916000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072916000010">I have

continue to work with investors, stakeholders and our EU partners to

contributions got off to a cracking start when the noble Baroness, Lady
Rawlings, took us straight to fracking. I am in the camp that rather
approves of the word “fracking”. However,
“subsidiarity” is a separate matter to which we should
return. My noble friend Lord Whitty commented on the failure of the
single market and the fact that too many changes in policy were
detrimental to investment going forward. The noble Lord, Lord
Maclennan, made some very telling points, but the one which stuck with
me was that the EU had not made a good fist of its energy policy. He
put it very simply, and it points to the fact that we need to do
something about
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072916000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072916000013">The<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>

Cameron, made several very powerful and well informed points. I will
take away his image of the grid in Europe becoming like the cellphone.
I fervently hope that it will happen. It was a wonderful analogy and we
must do everything we can to make it happen. As always, I learnt
something from the noble 
<?notus-xml column=623?>Baroness, Lady Byford. She found that the US data put us at third in
energy security, and I am going to scurry off immediately and read that

sooner.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072916000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072916000014">The<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>

needs to do something at this time of economic chaos, and this should
be one area of it. I was very taken with Minister’s point that
we should look to Germany because there are things to learn. We must
learn from every place we can. The noble Baroness, Lady Parminter, with
her usual clinical focus went straight for the regulatory framework for
shale gas and she made a very important
contribution.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072916000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072916000015">The<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
noble Lord, Lord Kerr, landed a characteristically elegant punch on the
matter of oil, which is absolutely right, as is his knowledge of the
treaty. I disagree with him about two things. The whole concept of
state aid seems to me to need examining. The idea that a state in a
market can subsidise one generator of power to the disadvantage of the
nation seems rather strange. The whole idea that we should not have
consumption targets seems to be something that we could debate another

noble Earl, Lord Caithness, always finds a good point. He made a point
about forecasts, and one thing is very clear. All the evidence we have
had over time suggests that forecasting is incredibly difficult. Even
in the life of our inquiry, and subsequent to it, 
<?notus-xml column=624?>the shale gas forecasts were revealed to be incredibly wrong. The noble
Baroness, Lady<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-29T18:12:40"></hs_TimeCode>
Howarth, made a point about human behaviour. Her distinction between
the need for pure science and social science was incredibly well made,
and is something that all politicians seeking to drive change must pay
attention to. How do we carry people with us? How do we balance popular
accord with the need to go
forward?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072916000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130729-gc0001.htm#13072916000017">Very
importantly, my noble friend Lady Worthington brought her experience in
this whole area, particularly her understanding of CCS. Her suggestion

These guidelines were prepared to implement the commitment made by EU
Foreign Ministers in December 2012 to make a distinction in relevant EU
agreements and funding programmes between the State of Israel and
Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. The
guidelines reiterate the long-held EU position that bilateral
agreements with Israel do not cover the territory that came under

It is rare for such incursions to pose a significant risk to life.
However, we were deeply concerned by reports of an incursion in which a
Spanish Guardia Civil vessel pursued a jet ski in British Gibraltar
Territorial Waters (BGTW) on 23 June. According to eye-witness reports
non-lethal shots were fired by the Guardia Civil during this unlawful
incursion. This was a serious violation of British sovereignty and
endangered the safety of Gibraltarians. We have protested to the

with global standards and EU requirements, regulated firms in the UK,
including banks and Money Service Businesses (MSBs), must have systems
and controls in place to know their customer and adequately protect
themselves from money laundering and terrorist financing. It is a
decision for each firm how it implements the regulations and ensures it
is compliant. Firms and regulators are expected to take a risk-based
approach to ensure the measures they take are effective and
proportionate. Extensive industry guidance is available to firms on
this, which the Government gives legal weight to through approval from
Treasury Ministers. The Financial Conduct Authority has responsibility
for providing advice to banks on how to comply with their regulatory
obligations.</hs_para>
