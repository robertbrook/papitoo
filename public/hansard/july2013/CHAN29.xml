Food security is a well understood concept. We are talking about

food prices in the UK are a very serious issue and not, I think, a

It is important that we support that in every way we can. I notice that

roosting in them. Churches are not field barns; they are places of

that schools can offer. I would not expect any Church school to
discriminate against any child, whatever their personal or family

to his statement on Army reserves. You, Mr Speaker, have rightly
admonished the Defence Secretary in the strongest possible terms, and
today’s Order Paper says that there will be a clarification
statement, but by the time I rose to speak, we had still not received
it. Surely the Defence Secretary should now have the guts to come back
and subject himself to the scrutiny of Members, who will finally have
adequate information in front of
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070444000217" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/debtext/130704-0001.htm#13070444000217">I

he has been so busy composing an edict on the content of his
departmental letters that he is not doing the day job. Apparently, he
has demanded prose worthy of Jane Austen, George Orwell and, rather
oddly, Matthew Parris. Does the Leader of the House agree that if the
Education Secretary spent less time telling everyone else how to do
their jobs and more time doing his, we would not have a shortage of a

there will be a further opportunity for a debate in Opposition time.
She might like to use that to go beyond the debate that the Opposition
had on lobbying and to consider third party influence in the political
system. We will bring forward a Bill relating to that issue, but the
Labour party, before it deals with any motes in anyone else’s
eye, must take the beam out of its own eye, which is that it is run by
the trade unions.

where third-party influence is rife. It is a party where 81% of its

influence; it apparently buys the opportunity to select Labour party

introduce will not change that situation, but it is in the gift of the
Labour party to do it, and the fact that it has not and that the Leader
of the Opposition does not do it is a demonstration of how weak he is
in his own party, as he would be in any other

Friend the Prime Minister. The use of food banks increased tenfold
under the last Government. One of the critical changes that have taken
place is that before the election the Trussell Trust had been looking
for food bank access to be advertised in jobcentres, but whereas that
was not given by the last Government, it has been given under this

Revenue and Customs, have made considerable progress in moving away
from 0845 numbers; I am told that 95% of its personal tax callers now
use an 03 or equivalent number. I know from my experience at the
Department of Health that part of the principle behind the shift from
NHS Direct to the 111 telephone system, which is in principle the right
thing to do, is moving away from an 0845 number to a simple, easy to

we should not be too confident about it. The WMS contains no details of

what the requirements are for each of the bases; it does not provide
any moving dates; it does not say which constituencies personnel are
going to; it does not state if they are moving locally; it does not
give the base locations in any of the cities; and it does not explain
how Kilmarnock ended up, in handwriting, on the list. May we have a

ownership in Bolton and Wigan, and at similar factories, which are
looking to create 35 jobs for disabled people, including former Remploy
employees. In addition, Remploy has already confirmed that it has
received an asset bid from a social enterprise organisation for the
purchase of assets of the textiles business. This may create potential
job opportunities for those disabled
people<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T11:47:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070444000343" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/debtext/130704-0002.htm#13070444000343">We
have put in place a people help and support package for all disabled
employees to provide a comprehensive range of support for all disabled
individuals made redundant as a result of Remploy factory closures.
This tailored support is available for individuals to access for up to
18 months after their factory closes and includes access to a personal
caseworker and a personal budget to help individuals with future
choices. I can confirm that the personal caseworkers have already begun
engaging with employees on stage 2 Remploy sites. This has provided an
important opportunity to give individuals currently at risk of
redundancy the information they need about their opportunities moving
forward. We will continue to do everything we can do in finding them
work.</hs_Para>

shall turn now to the substance of the review. The Minister often cites
the Sayce review, as did her predecessor, as protection for her
decisions. I would remind the House, however, that the Sayce review did
not recommend the speedy closure of the Remploy factories in the way
that the Government have progressed it. Indeed, it recommended a phased
development of the process. Once again, however, the review has been
brought into play.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T11:51:46"></hs_TimeCode>The
Government’s aim has always to get rid of the Remploy liability
in this financial year, and no matter what else was said, this was

course I welcome the fact that viable bids have been received for some

another.</hs_Para>

quality and timeliness of its work. Given that the factories are under
pressure of closure, will the Minister tell us whether she or any of
her officials had any engagement with MOD procurement officials to
encourage them to use Remploy as a supplier, given that it had carried
out the work successfully over many years? It has never been properly
recognised that much of the kit worn by our service personnel in
Afghanistan and Iraq was made in Remploy factories. Did the Minister

defence debates a year in this House in Government time, but when the
Government allocated time to the Backbench Business Committee they gave
up, among other things, those general defence debates. I am therefore
grateful to the Backbench Business Committee for giving those of us
with an interest in defence and security some of that time back. I hope
that when members of the Committee read the report of the debate they
will feel that it was worth while and that if we make applications in
the future we might get similar debates, perhaps twice a year after the

delegates to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly—I see in the

today, an hon. Member who had seen the agenda for this afternoon simply
said to me, “You are having this debate, but why do we need
NATO?” It is a question that those of us who believe that there
is still a need for collective security and joint action with our
allies must answer convincingly, not just for fellow Members of the
House who do not share our view, but for members of the public who are
often sceptical about the defence and security missions with
which our country is involved and increasingly want a say in defence
and foreign policy matters.</hs_Para>

the cold war, it was fairly easy to explain why we had NATO and why we
needed to work jointly with allies to defend ourselves. Europe was
divided by an iron curtain. We in democratic states to the west wanted
to preserve our freedom, our human rights, trade union rights, property
rights, freedom of speech and freedom to protest while the states in
the east—the USSR and its fellow travellers in satellite
states—did not share those values. The Soviet Union was well
armed with conventional and nuclear weapons and demonstrated that it
was prepared to use those military assets to crush the Hungarian
uprising in 1956, to blockade Berlin, to invade
Czecho- slovakia in 1968 and to try to destroy the Solidarity

Georgia, for instance. Indeed, I have had heard Russian

elsewhere; and to protect human rights and stop ethnic cleansing, as in
Bosnia, Kosovo and Libya. We needed NATO to provide humanitarian

Hurricane Katrina in the United States, when other NATO states sent
humanitarian assets. We have needed NATO to counter the threat of

command, encompassing both ISAF, the NATO mission, and the US-led
Operation Enduring Freedom. Between 2005 and 2008, we published reports
calling for better burden sharing between NATO member states and for
caveats imposed by some of the national contributions to NATO to be
lifted. As early as 2004—nine years ago—we highlighted
the need to accelerate the build-up and strengthen the training of
Afghan national security forces; we stressed that particularly strongly

2002—more than a decade ago—we were stressing the link
between security and development assistance; and from 2006, in reports
and resolutions we called for what is now described as the
comprehensive approach: diplomacy, defence and development
co-operation. Again as early as 2004, we identified that much aid was
used inefficiently because it was not channelled through Afghan
institutions, and now even 50% of US aid is channelled through the
World Bank’s trust fund and the Government of Afghanistan.

reconciliation talks with moderate elements in the

Assembly is an effective forum for sharing good ideas and good practice
and, where we identify good practice adopted by one country, we try to
persuade others in the alliance to support similar approaches. Often,
it is easier for legislators who do not have executive responsibilities
to reach conclusions on these matters than it is for members of a
Government. We are still, even now, debating defence budgets, following
the reports we produced some years ago on burden sharing. As we know,
Robert Gates, the former US Defence Secretary, in his outgoing
statement, called on Europe to step up to the mark on defence spending,
and it is clear to our Assembly that most countries in Europe do not
spend enough on defence. Indeed, only two—Britain and
Greece—spend the 2% of GDP that NATO
recommends.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070444000469" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/debtext/130704-0002.htm#13070444000469">When<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T12:48:25"></hs_TimeCode>
I put that point to our Secretary of State, as I have a number of
times, he says that, with the economic situation so fragile, now is not
the right time to press Governments of other countries to increase
their defence expenditure, but I believe it is necessary for security
reasons, and that the way to get through the difficulty is to seek
commitments that, as the economic situation improves and Governments
receive a taxation dividend from growth, they will devote a proportion
of it to greater defence expenditures. I do not think we have public
opinion on our side for that proposition at the moment, which is
another reason we need to do more to explain why we have the security
structures we have in NATO and why it is necessary to maintain them and
finance them properly. Both the NATO Parliamentary Assembly and NATO
itself need to do more to get their case into the public domain, and I

been proud to find the French, the Spanish and the British working as

battle of Trafalgar there were a lot of French and Spanish sailors in
the British fleet, just as there were quite a number of British sailors

treachery—more a matter of expediency. In those days, when a

February this year, in Oslo, the Deputy Secretary-General of NATO,
General Verschbow, suggested that the 2% target might be replaced by an
aspiration that no single ally needs to provide more than 50% of
certain critical capabilities. I am always suspicious about
aspirations, but what would the consequence of this be? In my view it
would reduce the last remaining pressure on our European NATO allies to
maintain their defence spending at respectable levels. It would be a
negative aspiration rather than a positive one—it would say what
countries did not need to do rather than what they did need to do.

they do not need to
do.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070444000491" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/debtext/130704-0002.htm#13070444000491">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T13:09:23"></hs_TimeCode>

its own. In all the major conflicts of the past, we have nearly always
acted in concert with others—including our Commonwealth
partners—and we have drawn on support, equipment and people from
other nations. It is a fantasy to think that the UK will ever again act
unilaterally in deploying its armed forces. All future
military operations will be conducted as part of a coalition. We no
longer have the range of platforms, personnel or financial resources to
go it alone. We also face an increasingly complex set of challenges,
many of which do not respect international borders or the traditional
rules of engagement. We need the greater thinking power of

opening up of the high north makes it imperative that we maintain a

also be aware that China is moving in our direction. It has sent
through an ice-enabled ship on at least two occasions recently and is
agreeing mineral trading rights with Iceland, which will facilitate
regular voyages into our backyard. We need to be aware of that. I am

McCartney:</Member></B> My hon. and gallant Friend makes a good point.
There are a number of anomalies, such as the situation of the
dependency of the Falklands Islands and the tensions between Greece and
Turkey, which of course are both member nations, in Cyprus. There are
certain cases, of which he gave a prime example, in which article 5
perhaps has a little

management is another core task of NATO, and it has a unique and robust
set of political and military capabilities to address the full spectrum
of crises before, during and after conflicts. Of course, my hon. and

Bosnia<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T13:21:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070444000527" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/debtext/130704-0002.htm#13070444000527">Another
task is co-operative security. The alliance engages actively to enhance
international security, through partnerships and by contributing
actively to arms control, non-proliferation and disarmament. Other
recently added facets of NATO’s work are cyber-security, which
has been much in the news in the past fortnight, energy security and
the threat posed by climate
change<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T13:22:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070444000528" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/debtext/130704-0002.htm#13070444000528">NATO
has been at the heart, and at the head, of command and control for
current and recent western military interventions and operations. In
many ways, it now delivers the military aspects of the United
Nations’ work. I will highlight three examples. First, as we
have heard, there is the international security assistance force, the
NATO-led security mission in Afghanistan that the UN Security Council
established in December 2001 under resolution 1386. Secondly, there was
Operation Unified Protector, the NATO operation enforcing UN Security
Council resolutions 1970 and 1973, concerning the Libyan civil war.
Those resolutions imposed sanctions on key members of the Gaddafi
Government and authorised NATO to implement an arms embargo and 
<?notus-xml column=1107?>a no-fly zone and to use all necessary means, short of foreign
occupation, to protect Libyan civilians and civilian-populated
areas<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T13:23:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070444000529" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/debtext/130704-0002.htm#13070444000529">Thirdly,
there is Operation Ocean Shield, which was referred to earlier. It is
NATO’s contribution to the anti-piracy campaign off the coast of
the horn of Africa, following the earlier Operation Allied Protector.
Naval operations began early in 2009, having been approved by the North
Atlantic Council, and primarily involve warships from the UK and the
United States, although vessels from many other nations are
also
included<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T13:23:35"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T13:23:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070444000530" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/debtext/130704-0002.htm#13070444000530">That
brings me to some of the challenges facing NATO, a big one of which is
duplication. The operation against Somali piracy is a good example. I
have been with the NATO Parliamentary Assembly to Djibouti, which is
strategically placed on the horn of Africa, and there are clear signs
of overlap and mission repeat. We have not only the NATO-led mission
but an EU-led operation called Operation Atalanta, also known as
European Union Naval Force Somalia. There is also an
independent French air base, a US army camp and a Japanese air
base. Time and time again, I ask the commanding officers how much
liaison there is between the different operations, and I have never got
a satisfactory

comments. I will give another example of what duplication does. It can
confuse command and control, and further evidence of that is the EU
force headquarters being set up in Belgium, in a similar location to

final area of concern is budgets, to which many Members have referred.
There is an increasing balance of capabilities within NATO. Eighteen
member nations are spending less on defence from their current budgets
than they were four years ago, and as others have said, only three
allies have spent the target of 2% of more of GDP on defence in the
past couple of years—the United Kingdom, the United States and
Greece. We have already heard about the situation in Greece because of
its GDP<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T13:28:52"></hs_TimeCode>. Would

of the Warsaw pact and NATO, and the decades-long nuclear arms race
with costs borne by both sides and the economic problems that ensued as
a result. Then there was the election of Gorbachev as President of the

Afghanistan from 1979 onwards and—hey presto!—the Taliban

be uninvented; indeed, Einstein in his later years said that if he had
his time again, he would have been a clockmaker rather than making the
discovery he did. He did not make it with the intention of starting
nuclear war, but that was a danger that came from it. Obviously nuclear
weapons cannot be uninvented, but it is possible to give them up. South
Africa did so, as did Argentina, Brazil, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. There
are nuclear weapons-free zones around the world. The prize surely would
be a nuclear weapons-free middle east, which would require the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty conference that was envisaged to include Iran
and Israel to actually be held rather than endlessly procrastinated on.
It will not be easy; of course not. But if we do not start somewhere,
more people will get off the nuclear non-proliferation treaty trail and
go elsewhere. Egypt has already left the NPT because of inaction by the
nuclear powers over the middle east nuclear-free zone. Should not we be
doing the same in terms of an Arctic nuclear weapons-free zone as a
step towards a nuclear-free world? Everybody says they want a

First, he said that NATO was looking for a role in the early 1990s and

time NATO commanders were very reluctant to get involved in those
conflicts. It was the international community, through institutions

all recognise that the world has changed. NATO was born into a Europe
that was divided, and it formed the bedrock of our security for 60
years. The world was split between two diametrically opposed systems of
government that were forged out of the second world war, the largest
conflict in history. For much of its existence, NATO has been
preoccupied, rightly, with conflicts between states, but as hon.
Members on both sides have said, that has now shifted. It is no longer
simply about interstate warfare. In Bosnia and in Kosovo, NATO has
involved itself with civilians as well as states and this new role has
been cemented in Afghanistan and, more recently, under the
right to protect mandate delivered by the UN in Libya. That latter
conflict displayed a strong example of how NATO, in accordance
with international will and international agreement, was able to
deliver effective military capabilities to prevent, I believe, the
escalation of that conflict and to hasten the end of
hostilities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070444000569" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/debtext/130704-0002.htm#13070444000569">Humanitarian-led

NATO allies expect the US and the UK to bankroll European defence. It
is right to expect our allies in NATO to contribute fairly to the
upkeep of NATO forces, and I call on Ministers not to be shy in their
discourse with our European counterparts. Calling for member states to
contribute fairly is one part of ensuring that the organisation remains
effective. For NATO to be effective, we do not just need a willingness

be willing to fund that resource, so we have the ability to deploy when

together, we can create the flexibility essential to meeting the array
of challenges in the 21st century. For example, it is wasteful to buy
planes that cannot land on another country’s aircraft carriers,
to have to supply different types of bullets for different countries,
or to have radio systems that cannot be integrated or talk to each

However, the EU can play a role in developing institutions and

partnership with NATO where possible. As I and other hon. Members have
said, the gaze of the United States is now firmly on the Pacific.
Having EU structures, where appropriate and necessary, to help plug the
gaps left by the Americans, who are now more concerned with Beijing

officers who are doing a fantastic job, which includes 46 British

point was made about the internet and cyber-warfare. NATO has a
facility in Estonia—I have visited it with the Select Committee
on Foreign Affairs and I know that the NATO Parliamentary Assembly has
also visited it—to bring together best practice for dealing with
cyber-warfare. As we have seen from the media headlines in the last few
days, we will face significant challenges, not just from states but, I
suspect, over the coming decades from private interests and private
companies spying and stealing data and commercially sensitive material.
We also know of reports—I am not in a position to say whether
they are true—that the Iranian nuclear weapons programme was
seriously set back because of the activities of some countries and the
so-called Stuxnet, and there are other areas where these matters are
also of great importance.</hs_Para>

be looked at seriously. There needs to be international co-operation to
deal with threats to our security, which might come not from terrorist
bombs but from somebody sabotaging a banking system or undermining the
supply of electricity or water to our major cities by making a minor
change to a software programme, albeit one with potentially disastrous

final point relates to the United States, which has already been
referred to several times. We have heard about the so-called pivot
towards Asia, President Obama’s strategy of leading from behind
and all the other concerns that we have as Europeans. The NATO
Parliamentary Assembly provides one of the few forums for members of
the US House of Representatives and the Canadian Parliament to come to
meetings at which we can have regular discussions with them. Sadly,
given the nature of the insane political system in the United States

for its members to get abroad very often, because they have to spend
all their time raising election campaign money or fighting
re-elections, normally in their primaries.</hs_Para>

<?notus-xml column=1117?>the politics of other countries better. The current President of Turkey,
Abdullah Gul, was a member of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly for many

Gapes:</Member></B> Without straying too far from what I was going to
say, I can say that the NATO Parliamentary Assembly produces reports
which are published online and are published in draft form before final
versions are produced. Every year the NATO Secretary-General produces a
response to the points made. It is a bit like the relationship between
Select Committees and the Government. Recommendations are made,
reports are published and then the NATO bureaucracy—the
Secretary-General, on behalf of NATO as an institution—responds
to the assembly’s recommendations. The Secretary-General and
other senior NATO figures come before our meetings. We hold them to
account, whether at the February session in Brussels or the autumn
meeting, which rotates among different countries.</hs_Para>

not a democratic parliamentary structure. It works through a consensus
arrangement between the different member Governments. In a sense, the
NATO Parliamentary Assembly is far less democratic than other
bodies—there is no qualifying majority voting, like in the
European Union—while the European Parliament has a lot more
powers. Nevertheless, the work we do as parliamentarians, representing
our national Parliaments but also understanding and working in

the last few days, I have been analysing what was supplied to
Gaddafi’s Libya in the five years prior to the outbreak of the
Arab spring. The UK was one of the NATO suppliers, and was far from the

contributing to the substantial Libya-Gaddafi arms stockpiles.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T14:09:42"></hs_TimeCode>That five-year
period ran from the beginning of 2006 until the end of 2010, which was

the House a brief snapshot of the arms export licences
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T14:09:59"></hs_TimeCode>that were

components for assault rifles, armoured personnel carriers, command and
control vehicles, military utility vehicles, military communications
equipment, cryptographic equipment, electronic warfare equipment,
artillery computers, and components for surface-to-air missile
launching equipment. The decision to issue an export licence for that
last item— components for surface-to-air missile launching
equipment—was made here in London, in blissful but
understandable ignorance of the fact that within a few months NATO
aircraft, including those from this country, would be overflying Libya
to establish the no-fly zone.</hs_Para>

months leading up to the outbreak of the Arab spring in 2011, the
present coalition Government continued the policy of the previous

export licences that were granted to Libya’s Gaddafi regime
covered items including small arms ammunition, semi-automatic pistols,
sniper rifles, assault rifles, machine guns, military communications
equipment, cryptographic equipment, military cargo vehicles and, once

countries. In NATO countries, the value of weapons relates to their
military capabilities. We ask how capable a weapon is, how much
firepower it has, how accurate it is, and so on. In that part of the

safe from foreign conflict. NATO not only won the cold war, but keeps
the peace. People should not forget the adage “If you want
peace, prepare for war”, as that is what NATO is

is the watchword—preventing wars rather than fighting them. That

abolished suddenly. Nobody is going to make a decision at some NATO
summit that NATO has had its day and will be wound up. The great danger
is that NATO withers. I put it to the House that, with the war fatigue
following Iraq and Afghanistan and the lack of appetite for NATO to
play its deterrent peacekeeping and stabilisation role across the
world, NATO is already withering. The collapse of key components of
NATO is another danger, as is the uncertainty and the question mark
that still exists over the continuation of our own nuclear deterrent.

explain to the House why that idea simply does not bear
scrutiny. At a time of crisis, putting a nuclear submarine to sea to
stand guard over our country is a very public act, because submarines
go to sea on the surface. The submarine would be exposed to possible
enemy pre-emptive attack, and our foreign policy would be exposed to
accusations of escalation and inflammatory acts at a time when
sensitive international negotiations were taking place. A continuous
at-sea deterrent that is not at sea 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, is
not a viable deterrent. It would be vulnerable to attack and vulnerable
to misinterpretation, and at a moment of crisis we would hardly ever
dare to put it to sea. I cannot imagine why it takes intelligent people
so long to work out that if we are not going to order four submarines,
we might as well not order
any.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070444000629" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/debtext/130704-0003.htm#13070444000629">I

American forces. The Americans can do so much less unless they have
international support, and we are always their first port of call in
that regard. It is our influence over American policy that gives us our
leverage. That is why, when there is a really big international crisis,
the American President does not call the French, the Germans, the

Americans train our crews for NATO operations, and, indeed, we train
theirs. We certify their crews for readiness at sea. The relationship
between our two nuclear submarine fleets is deeply symbiotic. It is
burden-sharing in the real sense of the term. If we were not to

me make two more points, which will serve as a coda. Last week the
Public Administration Committee published a report, “Engaging
the public in National Strategy”, which explains how
“deliberative” polling can be used more effectively to
help us to understand what motivates our voters, what aspirations they
have, and what sort of country the British people want ours to be.
Members of the public were asked a number of questions, one of which
concerned nuclear forces. It became clear that most people in the
United Kingdom would order the four submarines: 57% said that they
would rather do that than give up our nuclear weapons altogether, which
is what the alternative amounts
to.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070444000638" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/debtext/130704-0003.htm#13070444000638">Let
me say finally that the great danger—the wild card—is
Scotland. The Scottish people must make their own decision about their
independence, but even if they vote for it, if they want Scotland to
continue to be a member of NATO, they had better accept that the 
<?notus-xml column=1124?>British nuclear deterrent will remain at Faslane. It
would be impossibly expensive to move it, and were they to insist on
scrapping it, they would deliver a fatal blow to the affordability of
our nuclear deterrent. If it were brought down to some other part of
the United Kingdom over a short period and stationed there—if a
deep-water port were found where all the weapons systems and weapons
storage and protection facilities would be welcome—not only
would Scotland be giving up the largest employer on its own the west
coast, but it would be wrecking NATO. The fact that Scotland has taken
a stronger anti-nuclear stance than any other NATO
member—refusing, unlike any other NATO member, not just to admit
visiting nuclear forces but to allow any nuclear forces to be stationed
on its soil, even in a crisis—means that it would never be
allowed to join
NATO.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-04?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_04_PT_1/9636296337C01B75C761F42E1FF837635FB62735" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="4 July 2013">Thursday

It is very difficult to identify sometimes where these attacks are
coming from. State actors such as China, North Korea, Iran and Syria

<?notus-xml column=1126?>whatever we do within NATO, we must try to work in

am about to conclude Mr Deputy Speaker—I think you might be
looking at your watch. The problem is that our potential enemies remain
our potential enemies. Symmetric warfare between states is not dead. We
may think it is. We have not had a war for 70 years, when Europe
historically had six or seven each century, and thus the public ask,
“Why do we have to spend money on defence?” The problem
is that that has not gone away and we may well be surprised.</hs_Para>

Ismay’s definition, is gone. No, NATO is required because it

the Member for Islington North (Jeremy Corbyn) touched on that period

some agreement on this among some Government Members, that the then
Conservative Government, under their policy programme “Options
for Change”, too readily reached for the so-called peace
dividend, cut too far and too fast, and badly undermined our
capability. They did not comprehend the stark warning from Senator Pat
Moynihan that the world was still a dangerous place and that the end of

all the problems. This is a ridiculous way for Government Members to
continue, because many Conservative Members at the time of
“Options for Change”—those who were involved very
much on the military side—were concerned at the cuts that were
taking place. They did recognise that they were not planned, that the
Treasury was taking too much out of defence and that that was to the

the current Administration seem to be repeating that error with their
policy of drastic retrenchment in our military capability. That is
damaging not only in itself—we will have a debate on
that—but in the message it sends to Washington, because there is
a proper debate in Washington about the balance of military expenditure
and its deployment. We need to get that into perspective, because it is
undoubtedly true that, as President Obama says, America is still the
indispensible power. We should recognise that US defence spending is
twice as much as that of the other NATO countries combined, including
Canada and Turkey. Furthermore, as we all know, the US spends its
money, particularly in the equipment programme, more
efficiently.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Bridgend mentioned. The move from an estimated
60% focus on the Atlantic and 40% focus on the Pacific to a 50:50
balance is a shift, but 50% of the US defence budget is still more than
that of the rest of NATO put together; the US is still a formidably
effective and overwhelming presence. Our real concern should therefore
be voices on Capitol Hill, as people there may become weary of what
they would see as carping criticisms from Europe. They may question
whether, after the end of the cold war, the US still has that
obligation to show such a commitment to European defence unless
European countries, including ourselves, show a similar level of
commitment.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-04?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_04_PT_1/E1771CFD842577C309822A1DD186095A6088963E" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="4 July 2013">Thursday

Member for Colne Valley (Jason McCartney), regarding his remarks about
Somalia, that I think it is unfortunate for us to start to pose NATO
against the EU in that context. Somalia is a particularly bad example
to pick. There is no uncertainty in the mind of a serving rating or
officer about the chain of command—the person who is giving him
the orders is above him in the chain of command. In fact, Somalia has
been enormously effective in dealing with piracy—not one ship
has been captured by the pirates this year and there has been a
dramatic drop in piracy and in the number of people being
held—and in integrating the international efforts of countries
with different traditions, and perhaps even different objectives, but
with a combined objective of trying to keep the sea lanes open and to
protect seafarers, vessels and cargos. Those operations have been well
synchronised between the various parties. It shows that where there is
a properly organised European component that can play a useful part and
is an encouragement to countries of the EU to step up their
contribution to defence within that framework, rather than a cause for
criticism<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T15:03:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

any kind of war. He will know that NATO has reduced the types and
numbers of its sub-strategic nuclear forces by more than 85%. Moreover,
the alliance has declared its reduced reliance on nuclear weapons and
has ruled out their use except in the most extreme cases of

estimated by some analysts worldwide as being in excess of

will illustrate how the problem works. An individual sets up a firm in
a country that keeps the names of directors a secret, then links that
firm with another firm in a respectable place such as the United
Kingdom, where the details of who owns a company do not have to be
registered if it is owned by another company. They then set up nominees
to be directors of the opaque firm, register with the corporate
registry in the initial country, open a bank account for the original
firm and funnel money through the firm in the legitimate area to the
original firm in the opaque

are many examples of that, and all areas of our national life, such as
football, now seem to be covered by such structures. Whether it is
illegal or legal, it is a major problem for transparency. We as
legislators should be particularly concerned about any illegal aspects,
and the banks have been at the forefront of those, as we have seen with
the problems of money laundering. HSBC funded Iran with transactions
involving £19.4 billion through shell companies over seven

point about criminal sanctions. The banks’ uniqueness is that

hon. Friend and I are saying, and what I interpret the Financial
Services Authority to be saying, is that responsibility must be taken

talking not about small, missed operations but about huge major
operations that funnel vast amounts of money. It is easy for banks to
identify and track such operations, yet they choose not to do so. There
seems to be a particular problem of huge reputational risk to the City
of London because banks based in the UK have been those most often
caught out. However, I have produced a document that demonstrates that
this is not simply a UK problem. In recent years, every one of the top

spectators and those who are owed money when the clubs go bust, has a
clue who owns what bit and where and how. These major institutions are
an example of how deep the problem has become and how we have failed to
deal with it. We need to look to our regulations, such as those being
introduced on banking, and think about how they can be applied to UK

the Prime Minister. He has stated that he thinks beneficial ownership
information should be in the public domain. The head of tax at the CBI

territories, as they then were. There are considerable contingent
liabilities, as we saw with the Falkland Islands and elsewhere. Those
territories look to us to offer them protection, but as my hon. Friend
pointed out in an intervention, there is a quid pro quo. The quid pro

we should be able to expect their banking systems and company

small and medium-sized enterprises cannot cheat in that way, and the
collapse in the high street is being exacerbated by the tax advantages
enjoyed by the internet companies that facilitate online shopping.
Indeed, the international internet companies are among the most
significant offenders when it comes to tax avoidance. Their business
model is built on an apparently free offer to consumers, but the
services are paid for by advertising, which is targeted through the
collection of personal data from consumers based on the cookie system.

corporate structures and tax performances, in the context of the cost
to society and the public purse that they are creating. Everyone agrees
that online child abuse is a serious crime. We in Parliament, the
public and the industry are committed to its eradication. The Internet
Watch Foundation is a fantastic organisation that takes down sites that
carry child abuse images. It is a membership organisation for the
industry, so we were all shocked to hear of the very small
contributions that the industrialists were making to its work.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T15:51:25"></hs_TimeCode>Until a month
ago, Google was donating £20,000 to the Internet Watch
Foundation. In recent weeks, it has upped its contribution to
£250,000 a year for four years, and the other media
organisations have collectively offered a further £250,000 a
year for the same period. I learned this week that Facebook makes a
contribution of only £10,000 a year.</hs_Para>

problem with that is that the Internet Watch Foundation is hugely
strapped for cash and unable to deal with all the alerts it receives.
It is worried, because a survey that it undertook has suggested that,
although 1.5 million people have seen child abuse images, only 40,000
reports have been made to the organisation. It is calling on the public
to report more, in the interests of child protection, but it requires
more resources to enable it to respond. Furthermore, once members of
the public start to respond, they are not going to be able
to distinguish between the different categories of
image—illegal, obscene and indecent—and they will report
everything that disgusts
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T15:52:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070444000756" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/debtext/130704-0003.htm#13070444000756">We
have a similar situation with the Child Exploitation and Online
Protection Centre—CEOP—which is the part of the police
force that deals with these issues. It believes that 60,000 people in

so limited that it was able to secure only 1,570 convictions last year.
At the same time, the companies that distribute that material are not
paying the taxes that would help properly to resource the police.

PayPal, John Lewis, Procter &amp; Gamble, EE, Hewlett Packard, Betfred,
Bing, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Google, BSkyB and Western Union. Facebook
has now agreed to do a manual sweep to remove the advertisements from
the sites, because the advertisers do not want to finance them and do
not want to be seen to finance them. It would be helpful if we had
public statements from those companies on their views on that, and on

resource-rich countries, but as a result of weak governance and
widespread corruption, finances do not always reach

seems to be terribly easy to set up anonymous companies and trusts. It
is very cheap to create complex corporate structures, and the practice
of using “nominees” does not help at all. I hope that the
Minister will emphasise the need to put beneficial share ownership into
the public domain. A “many eyes” procedure would ensure
that company ownership was subjected to continuous tests. I agree with
the hon. Member for Bassetlaw that we should not just leave it to HMRC.
Beneficial owners are individuals—living people, real-life human

action task force, the intergovernmental body that sets global
anti-money laundering standards and makes recommendations, has said
that the system does not work, and that it is much too easy to avoid
due diligence. In many countries, company service providers are all too

economies are ineffective in preventing companies from being misused by
money launderers. Six of the G8 countries and 18 of the 27
European Union member states are listed as being “not

willing to pay a small amount—I think it is £200 or
£300—can create a fake ID through a company and then use

way of preventing abuse of anonymous companies is for countries to
require all information about beneficial owners, the names of all
people behind trusts and foundations, to be put into the public domain.
It is essential for such information to be public, rather than being
accessible only to the police and other law enforcement agencies. There
is no interrelationship between most of these countries, and they
cannot carry out the necessary tests. If only HMRC or the police can
gain access to our information when fraud is suspected, it will
not be possible for us to check other countries’ systems, or for
them to check ours.</hs_Para>

that banks could be charged with greater duties to ensure that they are
more compliant and rigorous in exercising their duties to ensure that
money laundering does not take place, but they have a conflict in that
they stand to make very big profits in accepting the business of rich

stringent, but, as has been said already, they bear down heavily on
smaller companies and it is the big, professional organisations that
are trying to launder money through the system on a major scale and

fine levied by the US authorities after admitting that its anti-money

dollars at least for drugs cartels, terrorists and pariah states such

the hon. Member for Wells (Tessa Munt) said, at the G8 summit, the
Prime Minister made a great media blitz of his supposed crackdown on
corporate tax avoidance. He tried to get UK-controlled tax havens to
sign up to an OECD agreement on providing tax information. He also
tried to secure a worldwide standard on automatic tax information
transfer, to get the G8 countries to reveal the identity of shell
companies and to help developing countries to get their rightful
entitlement to tax. All those are extremely worthy objectives and no
one in the House would demur from any of them, but all he
achieved—it is achievement, rather than aspiration, that matters
when one is Prime Minister—was a bland statement in favour of
the principle of tax information transfer, without any actual means of
enforcement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:09:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Minister defended that feeble result by claiming that little can be
done without international agreement and that it takes time to build
that, but that is not true. Of course the best result would be
an internationally agreed set of rules, but even in the absence of that
there is a great deal that Britain can and should do. First, as a
number of Members have said, the UK controls 10 Crown dependencies and
overseas territories, which collectively embrace over one fifth, I
think, of all the world’s tax havens. Most of them have signed
up in principle—<I>[Interruption.] </I>Well, we shall see, but
they have certainly signed up to the proposal for tax information
exchange, and it is now within the purview of the British Government to
enforce that proposal, if there is any reneging or backsliding, by the
simple expedient of refusing to recognise any financial transactions
emanating from those areas if there is any failure to secure full
compliance.</hs_Para>

will generate a great deal of resistance, not least from the tax havens
themselves, but also I suspect particularly from the big UK banks,
which are the main users of these tax haven facilities. Since the Tory
party continues to get more than half of its income every year from the
banks—<I>[Interruption.] </I>There is no need to roll the eyes

therefore want to ask the Minister the following question, which I hope
he will answer: will he assure the House that the Government will
enforce these tax information exchanges with the tax havens they
control? I agree he cannot do that without international agreement in
the other havens, but he can control these ones. Alternatively, are we
simply going to find that the Prime Minister’s fine words, which
we all agree about, will just fade away in a puff of smoke after he has

makes the Chancellor’s remonstrations about tax avoidance being
immoral seem perverse is that he himself has now emerged as the arch
proponent of tax avoidance. He is changing the controlled foreign
company rules from 1 January next year to allow any multinational
company with a subsidiary in a tax haven—and as the Minister
knows very well, 98% of those companies do have a subsidiary in
a tax haven—to reduce their corporation tax liability from 23%
to a mere 5.5%. Given the boast of the Prime Minister and the
Chancellor about cracking down hard on corporation tax avoidance, that
is breathtaking hypocrisy. The message is, “Don’t worry
about artificial tax avoidance. You needn’t do anything about
that, because I am going to serve it up to you on a

the Government went even further. They have put forward the pro-tax
avoidance proposal of the patent box, a wheeze whereby any patented
process applying to any part of an enterprise, however trivial or
minor, not only secures a reduction in corporation tax to 10%, but
applies to the entire enterprise. Frankly, the more the
Government go on in this way, pushing corporation tax almost to zero,
the more tax avoidance fiddles become redundant, because the Government
are doing it for them. Perhaps that is the Government’s

to do. It would have made it clear that any scheme whose primary
purpose was to avoid tax, rather than being any genuine economic
transaction, would be invalid in law and struck down. In order to
discourage perpetrators of this attempt to bend the will of Parliament,
there would be a sizeable penalty for attempting to subvert that will.
My Bill had only a 10-minute showing on the Floor of the House, thanks
to Tory filibustering of the prior Bill on that day, so perhaps I might
take this opportunity to ask the Minister: does he accept the general
anti-tax-avoidance principle? If he does not, what are his reasons for
rejecting it? I think he will say that the Government are putting up
their alternative—the so-called GAAR or general anti-abuse
rule—but that really does not meet the ticket. I wish to say
why, and I hope that he will listen to why the Government’s GAAR
is really no alternative.</hs_Para>

Government will have to prove that in the outcomes that we see over the

that if we opt for a rule that is limited to dealing with the worst
kind of tax avoidance, it suggests that the rest is rather less
important in the Government’s mind; I cannot see the point of
having a GAAR if one is also going to “include” other
abusive tax procedures, about which there is equal concern. I am sure

schemes to inform HMRC in advance about each new scheme they introduce.
I understand that something over 100 new schemes have been disclosed in

still leaves two problems. First, it can take HMRC many years to defeat
any of the schemes if it goes to the courts and, secondly, some of
those promoting such schemes will go to great lengths to avoid

coming to the same view on tax avoidance as we did on the banks, and

small contribution will be about the way in which proceeds of crime
have found their way into the financial sector, and I will seek
assurances from the Minister that the Government are doing everything
they can to deal with the issue of proceeds of crime within our
financial structures. Some £675 million is owed by 178 criminals
who were each ordered to pay back £1 million or more after their
conviction. Prosecutors are unable to force repayment by 45 offenders
whose debts to the taxpayer total £225 million. Clearly, the law
as currently written and the existing structures are not sufficiently
able to deal with the way in which these proceeds are kept by the Mr
Bigs who, having committed horrendous crimes, are able to continue with
their life after prison and are not asked to pay back what they
owe<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070444000822" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/debtext/130704-0003.htm#13070444000822">I

absconding—once somebody is out of prison, there is no way in
which they can be made to pay this money—implementing the EU
Council framework decisions on the execution of orders freezing
property or evidence, and making sure that agencies work together so

the Home Secretary reclassified khat as a class C drug because she
believes that sales of it have entered our financial systems and fund
Islamic extremist groups such as al-Shabaab. In January the Advisory
Council on the Misuse of Drugs said there was “insufficient
evidence” that khat caused health problems. The panel 
<?notus-xml column=1152?>found “no evidence” that khat, made from the leaves and
shoots of a shrub cultivated in the horn of Africa and the Arabian
peninsula, was directly linked with serious or organised crime. The
problem is that once these drugs are banned, they go underground and
the drugs barons are able to launder even more
money.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070444000827" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/debtext/130704-0003.htm#13070444000827"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:34:47"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Jim Cunningham" PimsId="2803" UID="13070444001471" xid="147" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/debtext/130704-0003.htm#13070444001471">Mr

say that the parent company should be investigated. It set up two

the Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann) pointed out that the
responsibilities of the two Front Benchers relate to different

welcome the fact that tax evasion was on the agenda at the G8 and the
Prime Minister is right that we need to pierce the corporate veil. Lack
of transparency enables criminals to hide behind shell companies and
launder the proceeds of crime. In our view, however, the Prime Minister
left the heavy lobbying until too late and the international commitment
to breaking down corporate secrecy was weak. In fact, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:36:53"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Oldham West and Royton (Mr Meacher) has said, it

required information? Will there be an obligation to record the owner
of bearer shares where the owner is not registered and the issuing firm

are told that the Government are reviewing all of this, but it seems to
me that there is plenty of wiggle room. Will there be an obligation on
the part of the registry to carry out due diligence on the information

resources to do that? Past studies have revealed that Companies House

the Government are committed to a crackdown on crime, why have they

seems to us that an offence of reckless banking needs to do more than
deliver symbolic sacrifices after the event. We need managers to be
held liable if they turn a blind eye to those who are committing crime.
They should have a responsibility to monitor what happens. No single
person brings a bank to its knees and no single person should be
responsible for UBS, Société Générale or
Barings, whatever some may want us to believe. There are further people
who are also responsible, and we need to ensure that the law allows for
other people to be prosecuted. Nowhere is that more apparent than in
the Government’s record on basic economic crime such as the
failure to ensure that people are paid the minimum wage. In the past
three years, only two bosses have been prosecuted for that, and
workplace inspections have halved in the past 12 months. It seems to us

Minister has demonstrated leadership on this issue on the international
stage. The Government are committed to tackling illicit activity and
the misuse of corporate vehicles to facilitate such activity, and we
are well aware of the impact such things have on the UK and the global
economy. Such misuse is made possible because companies can be used to
hide who is really in control and who is the beneficial owner. Hidden
beneficial ownership to facilitate criminal activity is a long-standing
issue, and international standards have proved difficult to implement
effectively for many jurisdictions. For that reason, the Prime Minister

Gauke:</Member></B> It is perhaps worth saying a word or two about the
Crown dependencies because they have received criticism during the
course of the debate. There is nothing illegal about an international
structure, especially in a globally integrated economy, but what must
stop is the use of offshore structures to hide assets and income
illegally, and to evade taxes. The overseas territories and Crown
dependencies have all committed to automatically sharing information to
fight tax evasion, and to producing national action plans to set out
how they will improve beneficial ownership transparency. The Crown
dependencies have already published their plans, and the overseas
territories have committed to do so by the end of the year. This is a
significant step forward in transparency, and we will continue to work
closely with the overseas territories and Crown dependencies to ensure
that the action to which they commit is robust and ensures the
effectiveness of their systems. It would be a pity for this debate to
give the impression that we do not acknowledge the significant progress
made in recent months.</hs_Para>

to the G8, there was collective action to improve transparency of

national action plan. The US, France, Italy, Japan, Canada and the UK,
as well as the Crown dependencies, have published their plans already,

G8 action plan means a number of things for the UK. First, we will
legislate to ensure that all companies know who owns and controls them.
Companies will be required to obtain and hold information on their
beneficial ownership—a requirement that will make it harder for
criminals to hide their identity, and easier for law 
<?notus-xml column=1158?>enforcement bodies to trace company misuse. Secondly, we will require
that information to be held centrally at Companies House and made
available, at a minimum, to law enforcement and tax authorities. Again,
that will enable law enforcement and tax administrations to track down
beneficial ownership information much more quickly. It will also help
us develop better working relations with our international

cross-border
investigations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:54:21"></hs_TimeCode>.
To address the point raised by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:54:19"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

act, such as enabling greater scrutiny of the accuracy of the
information and allowing investors and others to understand better with
whom they are doing business, there would also be legitimate concerns
about individual confidentiality and whether the information would

through dissolving companies without payment that HMRC makes regular
use of. As an example, HMRC frequently requests restoration of
companies to the register and then liquidates them, an act that allows
liquidators to pursue directors for misfeasance and other wrongdoing.
As a Government, we have reinvested in HMRC significant sums to deal
with tax avoidance as a
whole.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070444000879" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/debtext/130704-0003.htm#13070444000879">We

31 July, the administrators of the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation
Trust will present their proposals for the future of health services at
Stafford and Cannock hospitals. They, as well as Monitor, to which
they report, and the Government, have a tremendous
opportunity to show the way forward for the NHS as a whole, which
celebrates 65 years this week. This trust special administration is the
first under the Health and Social Care Act 2012 and is a chance to show
how emergency, acute and maternity services can continue to be provided
affordably, locally, safely and to the highest standards. We are also
talking about the administration of a trust that has been the subject
of intense scrutiny since the revelation of appalling standards of care
in some parts of Stafford hospital in the period to 2009. Since then
the improvement has been marked, as the Care Quality Commission has
evidenced, although there is no complacency about that on our
part.</hs_Para>

of Stafford, we were showing just how much we value the services
provided at Stafford and Cannock. We were also expressing our concerns
about the future—a future that the contingency planning
team’s report, which came out earlier this year, said was
unlikely to include the provision of most acute, emergency and
maternity services in Stafford, even though our maternity services have
some of the best outcomes in the country. When the trust special
administrators produce their report, I hope they will provide us with
complete access to the data on which they worked, as well as the
assumptions made—something that did not happen with the
contingency planning team.</hs_Para>

was, I have to say, unfortunate. 
<?notus-xml column=1162?>Both organisations were running to independent

that the proposed downgrading of services at Stafford was somehow the
direct consequence of the failures in care until 2009. Let us be

trust are long standing. It should never have been granted foundation

the impression that exposing poor care somehow resulted in threats to
services had a double effect. First, blame was completely unjustifiably
put on those who spoke out. Secondly, the impression was given that if
people speak out in future anywhere else, local services might be at
risk. The result is that Stafford has experienced ups and downs in the
last few months. They include the wonderful coming together of a
community of all ages and a group supporting the services at the
hospital working across the political divide. Sadly, however, we have
also seen cases of threatening behaviour against Julie Bailey and
members of Cure the NHS, who courageously brought the serious problems
at Stafford to

I wish to focus on the future, and I am going to concentrate on
Stafford hospital although Cannock, too, is vital. Stafford is one of
the many small district general hospitals up and down the country that
play a vital part in our emergency and acute infrastructure. The number
of acute beds has fallen substantially in the past 20 years, including
in Staffordshire. The new PFI-funded hospital that opened recently in
Stoke has 250 fewer beds than its predecessor, although it
is none the less a wonderful hospital.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T17:10:02"></hs_TimeCode> all welcome
the fact that the length of hospital stays has fallen sharply, to an
average of less than four days, but a report from the Royal College of
Physicians published last year pointed out that there is little room
for further reduction. Indeed, as the population begins to age, the
average length of stay might start to creep up again.</hs_Para>

only way to manage acute beds, even at the current capacity, is to
ensure that people do not have to be admitted in the first place. I am
sure that we all want to see that happen, but it will depend on
expanded community provision and the better integration of health and
social care. That will happen, but it is not happening yet. Even when
it does, my firm belief is that although it might halt the increase in
demand for acute services, it will not reduce it at this time of a
rising and ageing population.

are listening to experts who say that we need substantially increased
rail capacity by 2035, so I am sure that they will also listen to the
experts who say that we cannot cut any further the local and regional
capacity for emergency, acute and maternity care. I say to Monitor and
to the Government that 
<?notus-xml column=1163?>Stafford is ready to be a national leader in such integration, with
patients and the provision of the highest quality of care put
first. However, that demands time and co-operation.</hs_Para>

first element of co-operation involves a larger acute trust. In the
case of Stafford, the obvious partner is the University Hospital of
North Staffordshire in Stoke. Working with UHNS as one team will bring
advantages to both hospitals and both communities. For Stafford, the
chance to become part of a university hospital will be an exciting
prospect. We already welcome third, fourth and fifth-year medical
students from Keele university medical school, and they report that
they value the experience of working in a busy district general
hospital. For the clinical staff at Stafford and at Stoke, the chance
to work as a much bigger team across two sites would bring greater
opportunities for them to develop their skills and experience. Frankly,
for Stafford, it would also ensure that there was much less chance of a
return to the complacent culture of the past that the Francis report
identified as a major problem in parts of the
hospital<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T17:12:22"></hs_TimeCode>. For
Stoke, which is already under considerable pressure as a result of the
reduction in beds and has had to reopen up to 100 old ones, coming
together with Stafford would offer welcome additional capacity. It
would also create a larger catchment area, which would make some
specialties that are currently marginal at Stoke much more
viable.</hs_Para>

this would not be easy, as UHNS also has a substantial deficit and a
PFI cost that is frankly unsustainable. I urge the Government to do
everything within their power to cut the cost of UHNS’s PFI so
that the 750,000 and more people who would rely on a combined major
acute trust—whether in Stoke, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Leek

point—that this debate is not just about a relatively small

a pretty efficient national health service, but it does run on tight
margins, so that if we take one acute hospital out, it could have
effects right across the whole region. Local clinical commissioning

third element of co-operation comes from Monitor itself. Under the

and then be forced to pick up the pieces of acute foundation trusts
around the country that fall into deficit as a result of the tariff
cuts it has made. Monitor has the chance to challenge the assumption
that acute services can continue to squeeze out annual
efficiencies—in some cases, and not just in Stafford—of
up to 7% a year, while elective services enjoy a relative

look into 14 hospitals where there had been two years of higher than
standardised mortality ratio indicators. That work is now reaching
fruition. Following a report as damning as the Francis report, which
looked into the culture of the NHS, we thought it right to investigate
other hospitals that could give rise to concern, and we now think it
right to examine the findings of Sir Bruce Keogh’s report before
we report back to the House. We also set in train Camilla
Cavendish’s review of nursing and Don Berwick’s inquiry
into a minimum-harm and no-harm culture in the NHS. All those inquiries

they raise concerns. It is right that we drill into how to ensure that
we listen to staff in learning how to put things right in local
hospitals. We must also ensure that we create a culture in which trust
managers always listen to what front-line staff tell them. In my own
experience, when things go wrong in front-line patient care, it is
often because there is a disconnect between management and front-line
staff. That is why the Government, through the Health and Social Care
Act 2012, are embedding in the NHS a culture of clinical leadership,
which will benefit patients

the future of Stafford hospital and the issues raised in the debate,
the events that took place led Monitor to intervene and, over the past
few years, there has been a whole health economy approach to improving
services at the trust. That has led us to where we are today. Monitor,
as the regulator of foundation trusts, appointed a TSA at the trust in
April 2013 to determine the future provision of services at the trust.
As we know, that process is ongoing.</hs_Para>

cannot discuss that in much detail. Nor is it known what the TSA is
likely to propose. It is right that that process is free of political
interference. However, what I would expect, and I am sure that my hon.
Friend would agree, is that the TSA fully engages with key stakeholders
during that process, including clinical commissioning groups, local
health care providers, local authorities and local MPs, which I have
been assured is the case. The TSA is legally bound to consult on its
proposals and I would expect that any proposals meet the four tests for
any service change and reconfiguration, which were set by the former

an issue I can dictate from the Dispatch Box or the Secretary of State

important that that is done without political interference, so the

Malcolm Bruce</B> (Gordon) (LD):</Member> As you know, Mr
Havard, we are having two debates this afternoon: this one, and then
one on the Department for International Development’s engagement
in Pakistan. They will be approximately equal in length, depending on
hon. Members’
contributions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070443000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070443000010">The
Select Committee on International Development took the view that it was
important that we engage in the process of the post-2015 development
goals, and we took evidence from a fairly wide variety of sources. We
reflected first on the achievement of the millennium development goals
for 2015, and thereafter on what we needed to take forward. When the
MDGs were set up in 2001, they were rather slow in gathering momentum.
Some people suggested that they were hatched in a basement of the
United Nations, which is probably slightly unfair, but they certainly
were not the product of wide consultation. Nevertheless, over time, the
MDGs became a definite focus of development policy for the UK and many
others. It is interesting that in its annual report, for example, our
own DFID would put against the country programmes a series of traffic
lights indicating how well a country was doing in relation to those
goals. In time, a lot of developing countries took ownership of their
responsibility for securing development goals.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13070443000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070443000011">However, we
must also reflect that the goals were somewhat mixed in their
intentions and expression, and slightly different in substance.
Although they were helpful in driving the agenda, we clearly were not
going to hit them, and many countries—particularly the weakest
ones; the ones that the UK is most engaged in—are off course for
achieving them. It would be unacceptable to arrive at 2015 and say,
“Well, that was an interesting exercise. Here are the overall
performance indicators of who got how far towards them,” and
have that be the end of it. We recognised that we had to ensure that
the job was not left unfinished and that we moved forward. The UN then
appointed a high-level panel with our own Prime Minister as a co-chair,
which reported a few weeks ago.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13070443000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070443000012">The first
thing that we were concerned to address, whatever the new process did,
was much wider ownership of it through thorough consultation and
engagement. I think that we can honestly say that the process has been
much more inclusive than the original one. However, we also wanted it
to address some of the shortcomings of the original goals, such as the
fact that a goal of halving absolute poverty by 2015 could leave the
other half of 
<?notus-xml column=316?>people in absolute poverty. Also, if absolute poverty is $2 a day, it is
much easier to raise somebody to that level from $1.90 than from $1, so
there is a tendency to concentrate on lifting those people just below
the margin. Ironically, that means that the poorest of the poor could
be left further behind. That did not always happen, but it could be the
consequence, and we were anxious to ensure that such unintended
consequences were not incorporated into the next round of
goals.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070443000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070443000013">It
is also important to recall that there are huge inequalities. The
question of how well we have done globally on achieving various MDGs
can disguise the fact that some countries are nowhere near, whereas
countries such as China and India have made the biggest progress and
account for the highest proportion of the success. Even within
countries, it may be possible to show that targets have been broadly
met, yet some communities may have fallen completely behind. Again, we
were anxious to ensure that things were much more inclusive in the
future and that the disparities within communities were addressed. We
also thought that, ultimately, having a livelihood—perhaps a
job, but some means of earning a living—is the best way out of
poverty, and that that needed to be incorporated into the
goals.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070443000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070443000014">In
that context, we were pleased that the high-level panel was appointed,
and we were extremely pleased that our Prime Minister was given such a
prominent role within it. That was testimony to the UK
Government’s commitment to development; we will deliver 0.7% of
gross national income this year, unlike many countries. The quality and
focus of what we do is also highly respected. It is essential that we
acknowledge that that has been achieved through strong cross-party
support, and this is an achievement of which our country can be
justifiably proud.</hs_Para>

comment on the justification for that decision for those who choose to
criticise it. Any of us who engage in countries where poverty is severe
and endemic understand completely that however difficult our problems
in the United Kingdom, they in no way compare with the absolute poverty
that exists in parts of sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia. We should be
absolutely clear that as long as we have the capacity to work in
partnership to help to lift those people out of absolute poverty, we
should be unashamed in our commitment to doing
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T13:36:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070443000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070443000016"><Member ContinuationText="Fiona Bruce" PimsId="5527" UID="13070443000191" xid="1049" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070443000191"><B>Fiona

Malcolm Bruce:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. In
countries that have lifted themselves out of absolute poverty, whatever
role aid has played—one likes to think that delivering health
and education infrastructure contributes to that—ultimately it
was their own economic uplift, taking people with it, that turned those
countries around, although that has not solved all their problems.
China still has 200 million people living in absolute poverty, while
India has 400 million, but they have lifted huge numbers of
people out of poverty, which is a fantastic achievement that has more 
<?notus-xml column=317?>to do with the dynamics of those countries’ economies than with
aid, although I contend that aid certainly helped them achieve that,
particularly when it was targeted and focused.</hs_Para>

valuable as the 2015 MDGs have been, they left many people behind, and
in many cases, they did not deliver a clear and identifiable
qualitative benefit. For example, the process of enrolling children in
primary education says nothing about whether they actually learn
anything, and we often found that enrolment did not lead to completion.
Even when it did, the quality of the education was so poor in some
cases that it was questionable whether much benefit was achieved.
Nevertheless, having that driver meant that something was done that
would not otherwise have happened. There was variation, because in some
cases the quality of education did make a material difference and the
children stuck at it.</hs_Para>

anxious to contribute to the debate about what we should do next. We
wanted to say first that we could not arrive at 2015 without moving
forward to what happens next, and that the process had to be conducted
in such a way that there was ownership around the globe right from the
outset. Goals had to be drawn up together, not imposed from
above.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070443000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070443000020">Since<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T13:30:00"></hs_TimeCode>
we published our report, the high-level panel has reported, and I hope
that it is appropriate for me to comment on the panel’s report
because I hope that it reflects our contribution a little. It is a long
report that includes a lot of information, but two specific aspects are
the five “transformative shifts” and the 12 proposed
goals, which have sub-goals attached. To be absolutely clear, the
high-level panel has not sought to finish the job. Its objective was to
set the framework and push out ideas about what the principles should
be, and the second part of the process will turn that into clear,
quantifiable, realistic goals that can take us forward for the next 15
years.</hs_Para>

five shifts, the first of which is to leave no one behind, which
addresses one of the fundamental failings of the 2015 MDGs. The second
shift—putting sustainable development at the core of
things—which we also recommended, is absolutely essential. The
dilemma is that we live in a rich part of the world—a very rich
part of the world compared with where the poorest people
live—but people in poorer parts of the world aspire to the kind
of living standards that we enjoy. If they are to do that in the same
way that we did, we are short of the resources of two
planets.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070443000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070443000022">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T13:49:37"></hs_TimeCode>
cannot turn around and say to those people, “Thank you very
much. We are very rich, and we are sorry, but there are too many of you
and you are too far behind. You can no longer have that
aspiration.” That would be intolerable—indeed, it would
not be
accepted<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T13:40:58"></hs_TimeCode>—so
what we have to say is, “How do we work together to enable you
to aspire towards our level of living standards in ways that are
compatible with sustaining life on the planet?” It is therefore
welcome that sustainable development is involved in one of the five
transformative
shifts.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070443000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070443000023">A
further shift, which is relevant to my hon. Friend’s
intervention, is transforming economies for jobs and inclusive growth,
because ultimately that is fundamental to sustainable poverty
elimination. Another shift is to 
<?notus-xml column=318?>build peace, and effective, open and accountable institutions for all.
That is not just a pious declaration, because we know that the greatest
poverty persists where there is conflict or in post-conflict
situations. Ending conflict and moving people out of conflict are
absolutely essential if we are to eliminate absolute
poverty<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T13:40:00"></hs_TimeCode>. The
final shift is to forge a new global partnership, which I think means
that every country should sign up to the new agenda, including those in
the developed world, so that this is not an “us and them”
scenario, but a global
compact<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T13:42:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070443000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070443000024">From
those shifts, the high-level panel has proposed an outline of 12 goals,
the first of which is to end poverty. The second is to empower girls
and women, and achieve gender equality. As I have said on many
platforms, I believe that that is one of the core necessities for
poverty reduction and development. In too many poor countries, the
exclusion of women, and indeed how they are treated, hold back their
entire society. In my Committee’s recent report on violence
against women and girls, we make the point that if women are treated as
chattels, if they are beaten and mutilated and if they are denied
rights to livelihood, legal representation and land, the whole society
is denied the benefits of a proper partnership for growth and
development. We feel strongly that that is an absolutely central
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T13:42:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070443000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070443000025">The
third goal is to provide quality education and lifelong learning in
recognition of the fact that when primary and secondary systems have
failed, people have to be given opportunities as adults. We must ensure
that we deliver quality education. The fourth goal is to ensure healthy
lives and basic health provision, while the fifth is to ensure food
security and good nutrition. Again, a report that the Committee has
just published identifies the changing patterns of what is needed if we
are not just to feed the world, but to feed the world nutritiously. Too

improving living standards way above the basic minimum that defines

global shared responsibility and cannot just be left to be dealt with

Malcolm Bruce:</Member></B> It is somewhat due to our decision to
concentrate a high proportion of our bilateral aid programmes on
countries that have emerged from conflict. The objective analysis shows
that countries that have recently been in conflict, or are still in
conflict, have the highest rates of poverty and the greatest resistance
to poverty reduction, partly because they have dysfunctional
Governments, corruption and a lack of law and order. I stress that that
does not lead to the conclusion that it is too difficult to go there.
We have taken a conscious decision of saying, “It is very
difficult, but we will go there. It will be harder, but we believe that
our engagement will ultimately help them to get out of this
bind.” For example, Professor Paul Collier makes the point that
the effects of preventing a war are difficult to quantify. He is clear,
however, that the consequences for poverty and hardship of failing to
prevent a war will be phenomenal and set back a country for a whole
generation, so it is a reverse
process.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070443000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070443000035">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T13:50:54"></hs_TimeCode>
have gone to the most difficult places with a view to helping them to
get out of conflict situations and to build up their capacity to
function. That is difficult, however, because we are talking about
countries such as Yemen, Somalia, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of
the Congo, Pakistan and Afghanistan—those are the countries on
our list. I make no apology about saying that it is right that we are
there and it is good that we address those problems. We are making
progress, but we have to be honest with people, because things are a
darn sight more difficult in such countries. We could much more easily
spend all our aid in India and China, where we know it would have
transformative results, but that would leave the others out of the
equation, and that is what we must not do and it is what the post-MDG
settlement must not do. Instead, we must say that no one should be in

Friend touched on the importance of job creation, which the Committee
considered a crucial development challenge. Employment was included in
the original MDG framework, but it was perhaps not sufficiently
prominent and it failed to capture the public’s imagination in a
way that people in the poorest and most vulnerable circumstances in
developing countries say that it should have done. For them, it
is  an absolute priority: once they have food, water and,
interestingly enough, roads, they really want jobs. They want roads so
that they can get access to
market<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T13:52:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

the most important things that the Department for International
Development is doing in places such as the Democratic Republic of the
Congo is supporting rural road infrastructure? As we saw in, I think,
2011, a road was built to a place that had been cut off for 20 years.
Rather than it taking five days for people to get to market, only 60 km
of new road meant that they could do so in two hours, which enabled
them to bring their produce in, sell it and enjoy their
livelihoods<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T13:52:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070443000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070443000043"><B><Member ContinuationText="Fiona Bruce" PimsId="5527" UID="13070443000201" xid="1049" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070443000201">Fiona
Bruce:</Member></B> That is an excellent example of the importance of
roads. Another relates to Ethiopia, which the Committee also visited.
Roads have been built into areas that were originally little more than
bush, and, as a result, a health centre and a school can then be built.
There is a degree of “villagisation”, whereby families
who had perhaps been eking out a living separately in the bush can come
together, form a community and support one another. My hon. Friend is
absolutely right: roads are
essential<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T13:53:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070443000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070443000044">Jobs,
too, are essential. Africa is a young continent, but one where, unless
we focus on job creation, we will face an increasing employment
challenge for youngsters aged up to 25, as the generations, which are
now often in school, develop from childhood. One challenge is that we
have focused so much—quite rightly—on primary education:
there are now probably millions of children with some form of primary
education, but with very limited opportunities for secondary and,
certainly, tertiary
education<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T13:54:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070443000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070443000045">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T13:54:34"></hs_TimeCode>

high-quality, targeted tertiary education, vocational skills and

business leaders, the technical skills and the young people to run with
the vision of developing industries in their communities. If we do not
get those skills and do not focus on developing them, we will miss a

should consider how to transport some of our skills and strategic
understanding of how to develop business and build technical skills. We

every individual who is interested in supporting the developing world
has something to offer—people might be interested in going out
there to help to support countries that are, as our Chairman said, far
less well off than ours. In further education and business
development, we need to consider how people who might have taken early

digress slightly, but may I mention the global poverty action fund? We
need to re-examine whether it is focused correctly. A minimum of
£250,000 is a huge amount of  
<?notus-xml column=322?>money—for example, an aspiring group of people in this country
seeking to help to build a medical or teaching
centre may not need to raise such a sum—so will the Minister
look at that again? Furthermore, the fund is open for applications for
an extremely limited time, often only several weeks—I believe
that the current window closes on 9 July, after only a few
weeks—but we want to encourage people who might have run
businesses in this country to consider applying to the fund to see how
they can share

to jobs as a means to end aid dependency, one thing that we need to do
is ensure that local authorities in developing countries can maximise
any opportunities for inward investment from countries throughout the
world. The BRIC countries—Brazil, Russia, India,
China—are looking to invest in Africa, and we must ensure that,
when new factories and developments are built, the indigenous
population and their local authorities have an opportunity to benefit.
Local councils should be able to negotiate with contractors, developers
and industrialists to ensure that the local community benefits
properly. Those are sophisticated skills, but the UK can support them
and we need to ensure that the new MDGs are
focused<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T13:58:45"></hs_TimeCode> on
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070443000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070443000050">We
also need to consider a more holistic approach to job creation,
ensuring that there is a suitable environment for business development
in those countries. Thus, water is necessary not only for the
development of individual, family and village life, but for businesses.
Water and sanitation are critical, and unless people have access to
sanitation they cannot run a decent business. Land title is essential,
as is access to finance and the ability to run a business
strategically. There is a huge opportunity for us to examine how local
authorities in those countries can work with local business people, so
that we in turn can support them and maximise the opportunities for
local job
creation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T13:59:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070443000051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070443000051">We

considering jobs and job opportunities between the ages of 12 and 14,
before they start to study for their GCSEs, and we need to do the same
for children in Africa and other countries, and consider secondary and
early-years education to see what education, skills and training can be
invested in those young people to link directly into job opportunities
in their countries and local communities. We need an holistic approach

devastating to see the effect of starvation, disease, poverty and,
linked to them, lack of education and health care. People tell me that
pensioners in this country suffer fuel poverty—indeed they do
and they need help—but our country is rich enough to do both
things. A lot of Government spending is wasted, and we could channel
more money into helping people such as our own pensioners who often
live in fuel poverty, while also helping people who live in third-world

asked me what got me interested in Ethiopia I said, “You
did.” He did an enormous and unbelievable amount of work and if
any one person put the issue on the agenda it was him. I should have
mentioned him earlier. Some people say that that work set Ethiopia back
because it is a wonderful place for tourists to visit but they will not
do so because of the poverty—there is probably something in
that—but we cannot ignore what goes on there and that people
were starving to death. Although things have moved on considerably in
Ethiopia, each and every year about 6 million people there
still do not have food security and are dependent on assistance. I am
certainly in favour of emergency relief and of development aid, which
is important in helping countries develop infrastructure, irrigation
systems and other things that will help them move towards
self-sufficiency over a period of

right hon. Friend is also right to talk about trade and employment,
which will enable people to become better off. Over the last few years,
each time I have gone to Ethiopia I have noticed renewed confidence in
its economy and in business, which appear to have moved on a little
since each previous visit. That is encouraging, but I do not want to
overstate the situation and an awful lot remains to be done. To move
forward properly, Ethiopia must free up its telecoms business, its
banking and financial services sector and the ownership of land. An
awful lot needs to be done, but there is progress.</hs_Para>

countries need confidence in democracy and the private sector to enable
them to move forward a little quicker, but many of them have brief
histories. Ethiopia has a long history of about 2,000 years that we
know about, but it does not have a long history of democracy and that
is how we must view it in some ways. Everything is relative. We still
get elections wrong in this country, even today, so we should not be
too judgmental about other
countries.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070443000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070443000064">In
response to my intervention, my right hon. Friend put his finger on the
difficult problem of measuring and chasing certain aspects of progress.
Often the poorest people—those who are most
desperate—live in the sort of countries that it is difficult to
get aid to in one form or another, and where it is difficult to help
them towards development, with Somalia being the most obvious example.
However, we have to work and do our best—almost by going under
the radar—to get aid, assistance and help to people who we do
not know or have contact 
<?notus-xml column=325?>with, but who are the most desperate of all. Doing so is difficult, but
anything worth doing is never easy. I hope that we will continue trying
to help such people and continue trying to work with countries in
Africa and the heads of those countries, as we are doing, to take them
towards peace. Again, as
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T14:10:29"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Gordon said, we cannot measure this, but I hope we can help
them to avoid conflict in the first place. That is far better than
going in to sort it out, which is not always
possible.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T14:10:29"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

to speak for much longer; I know that another debate is coming up.
Again, I congratulate the Members involved on compiling the report. To
me, this area is one of the main reasons that I entered politics in the
first place. I will be in the House tomorrow, supporting the European
Union (Referendum) Bill, and I am a complete free marketeer. I am
considered to sit on the right wing of the Conservative party, even
though such terms are nonsense, because most people would follow me in
what I will say and do tomorrow. However, when it comes to
international development, we have a moral duty to do what needs to be
done. In addition, we should not forget that the better off we can make
countries throughout the world, the more secure that makes this
country, and the more opportunities it gives us in this country. From a
purely selfish point of view, there is a benefit to what we are doing.
To my mind, however, that is not the main reason for doing it; the main

particularly, job creation, although
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T14:14:05"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Congleton (Fiona Bruce) spoke eloquently about that, so
I shall not spend too long on the subject. It is estimated that 150
million people are unemployed in the world outside the developed
countries, and 60 million of those are young. Women are particularly
affected, and some 1.49 billion people are in vulnerable employment. I
suggest that those are underestimates, frankly, but they are the
figures that we have. It is vital that the new post-2015 MDGs take that
situation fully into account.</hs_Para>

there was an<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T14:15:12"></hs_TimeCode> MDG
concentrating on that issue, it was probably the least successful one.
Over the past 10 or 15 years, vast numbers of people have been pulled
out of poverty in countries such as China, but that has not been seen
as much in other countries that suffer from acute poverty. The main
reason was the lack of job creation, which is why we have to
concentrate on that. It is all very well to say that some of those
countries will now have great opportunities, because mineral wealth or
oil and gas are being discovered, but those industries do not create
huge numbers of jobs. The key is that revenue from that natural wealth
is put into real investment that creates jobs. Agriculture in
particular, and especially small-scale agriculture, has a huge role in
creating jobs.</hs_Para>

York Central (Hugh Bayley) was once the chairman of that network, and
he played a great role in setting it up a few years ago. The World Bank
has two goals: first, to eliminate absolute poverty by 2030—by
which it means people on $1.25 a day or less—and, secondly, to
concentrate on the bottom 40% of the income range. That is vital,
because this is all about reducing income inequality while increasing
the incomes of those who need the most. That is where employment and
job creation comes in and, in that area, we must take account of the
role and potential of young people.

hon. Friend the Member for Congleton mentioned many drivers of job
creation, such as land title and access to finance. It is good that
DFID is heavily involved in both those areas. I have mentioned this
issue before in the House, but I will do so again today, because
through an excellent programme in Rwanda, which I believe is coming to
an end, DFID financed the creation of title deeds in to pretty much
every single 
<?notus-xml column=327?>part of the country. There are 10 million individual plots at a cost of
about £40 million. It is one of the best development projects I
have seen funded by DFID—in fact, it is one of the best of all,
so I congratulate the Department. I encourage it to look at other
countries in which that particular programme could be rolled out. I am
glad to say that the software used was created in the UK and that the
implementation was done by a company from the United Kingdom.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T14:18:23"></hs_TimeCode>I know that DFID
takes access to finance very seriously and is involved in work on that

second point is about maintaining the gains. I am chair of the
all-party group on malaria and neglected tropical diseases, and we are
delighted at the progress that has been made on tackling malaria. Over
a decade, the number of deaths has come down from about 1 million a
year to probably no more than 600,000 a year through the mass
introduction and distribution of long-lasting, insecticide-treated bed
nets, through rapid diagnostic tests, and, of course, through the
latest drugs that are based on combination therapies with
artemisinin.</hs_Para>

malaria can rapidly come back if we do not continue to control it, as
we are doing, for instance, with indoor residual spray. We saw in
Zanzibar in the 1960s that malaria had almost been eliminated, but the
foot was taken off the pedal, so within 10 or 20 years, it was a
scourge again right across the islands of Unguja and Pemba. We have
seen that in other countries as well, including, even more recently, in
Zambia, where malaria staged a bit of a comeback two or three years
ago. It is therefore vital that we continue programmes tackling
malaria, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and neglected tropical diseases. In the
case of neglected tropical diseases, the mass drug distribution
programmes that have been so successful have been financed by a
public-private partnership between the pharmaceutical companies, which
have provided the drugs free of charge, and aid agencies, such as DFID
together with the Gates
Foundation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070443000078" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070443000078">That
brings me on to my third subject—health systems. We often, and
rightly, want to tackle individual diseases, be that polio, pneumonia,
malaria, HIV/AIDS or TB, but this is actually often about tackling many
of those things together through health systems. On a recent visit to
Tanzania, I was delighted to see that rather than there being a silo
mentality on individual diseases, that country, with support from DFID

the Nile perch, and factory farming of

ensuring that we preserve the gains that have been so painstakingly
achieved in the past decade and a half; ensuring the environmental

gains that cannot be maintained in the long term because they are

millennium development goals, when they were established, provided huge
momentum in addressing some of the most pressing challenges facing
developing countries. Admirable progress has been made. Examples of
that are the significant reductions in extreme poverty and infant
mortality; access to primary education for children; improvements in
the living conditions of slum dwellers; and major advances in the fight
against disease, including HIV and others. Although we are often
restless about the fact that more progress has not been made, it is
important to take stock and recognise that the starting point was not a

million people have been lifted out of poverty. Britain has led the way
on debt relief, and people, particularly those in Jubilee 2000,
campaigned to ensure that Labour Government had the impetus and the
backing to make it happen. Campaigners, international and domestic
NGOs, UK community organisations and faith-based organisations are
critical not only in applying pressure to our Government and other
Governments to ensure that they do not lose sight of what is at stake
in failing to continue to work towards achieving the MDGs, but in
ensuring that the next round of discussions, as hon. and right hon.

there have been setbacks, lessons are

developing countries should be partners in coming up with goals over

challenge has been well documented in this and previous reports. We
need to think about the fact that there will be more poverty in
middle-income countries than in developing countries. The high-level
panel needs to put that at the heart of the debate about where we go in
future. Any attempt to tackle the challenges of poverty must come up
with an approach, a narrative and a response that find a way to get to
the poorest in the growing economies of middle-income countries such as
India, China and Indonesia, as well as Africa, which is also growing
economically.</hs_Para>

question of how we respond to some of the domestic criticisms on giving

the remaining time, I shall focus on economic growth and development.
Hon. and right hon. Members have mentioned the importance of
employment, economic growth and the role of the private sector.
Opposition Members very much support building self-sufficiency and
creating opportunities for people to become independent and be able to
look after themselves, which is at the heart of what people want. We
need to ensure that the allocation of DFID resources through private
sector programmes is transparent and properly monitored, just as we
would expect with NGOs, and that public money is not used in an
ideological manner. We must look at where the impact is, whether the
outcomes are those that we sought—creating opportunity, jobs and
economic development—and whether the programmes are

that the Committee will interrogate the CDC about its role in
de-risking investment opportunities for companies, because that is one
reason it was set up. Too often, people have been concerned that it
replicates what the private sector can do and does not act as much of a
catalyst to enable innovative finance to go into 
<?notus-xml column=332?>those countries. I hope, therefore, that that will be looked into, as
well as some of the private sector funds that DFID has recently set up.

have two other points to make. The first is about the impact of
conflict on women in particular, and on children. We see all too well
that that is another major issue that risks setting back any progress
made on development. For example, in the Burmese state of Rakhine,
which I visited recently, progress is being made, but the treatment of
certain minorities and of women in those groups is setting back
progress. We need to ensure that human rights and women’s
empowerment are at the heart of development, and I welcome the
references made to that by the high-level panel and by the
Committee<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T14:40:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070443000105" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070443000105">Secondly,
we need to recognise that world demographics are rapidly changing.
Increasing populations, and a growing middle class in India, China,
Indonesia and many other countries, present major opportunities, but
also pose major challenges due to the pressures on natural resources.
As is pointed out in the report, the high-level panel discussion must
integrate sustainable development goals into the post-millennium
development goals framework. Segmented, siloed approaches will not do

Minister will be aware that a major additional support for developing
countries is remittance income, which eclipses development aid from the
whole world put together. Recent changes, led from the US, are
affecting the UK, with banking facilities to remittance companies and
money transfer companies being removed by Barclays bank. Therefore,
hundreds of billions of pounds are at risk of not getting to developing
countries, and the cost of sending that money might increase. In
countries such as Somalia, which is a post-conflict state, family
members are not getting money into their loved ones’ pockets. We
are talking about very poor people who do not receive development aid,

damaged, an even greater challenge is posed to international
development budgets, in addition to the tasks at hand of reducing
poverty, improving health incomes and tackling educational
inequalities. What is the Minister going to do about that issue, which
will affect hundreds of thousands of people just in the UK, never mind
in other countries? I would be happy to brief her after the debate, if

an ambitious focus on working with developing countries, NGOs, and
local organisations and populations, both here and in developing

tackling inequality, and promoting human rights and labour standards at
the heart of the post-2015 goals. If we do not do that, the
international community should not be surprised, for example, that in
countries such as Bangladesh we witness more than 1,100 people
unnecessarily losing their lives in industrial accidents that could
have been prevented had labour standards and human rights standards
been properly applied. The high-level panel and the international
community must ensure that human rights, labour standards and

hope that our Government—DFID Ministers working with other

made about creating opportunities and building self-sufficiency and
independence in people’s lives, so that over time our assistance
will be less necessary. Our assistance will always be necessary when
there are humanitarian challenges, but development assistance will be
less needed over time if we get our act together and ensure that we
genuinely help to lift people out of poverty, and give them the

five transformative shifts that drive the new development framework are
key. First and foremost is the commitment to leave no one behind, which
goes to the heart of the issue that many Members raised, and to keep
faith with the original promise of the millennium development goals and
finish the job by eradicating extreme poverty in a
generation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070443000117" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070443000117">A<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T14:49:24"></hs_TimeCode>
number of Members raised issues of equity and equality, and there is a
commitment to ensuring that every single goal is achieved for everyone,
in every social and income group, regardless of gender, ethnicity,
disability, where someone lives, what religion they practise, or
whether they are in extreme poverty. That is a radical departure from
the previous MDGs, and is the shift that will make the most significant
difference, because countries will not score unless they have done hard
work for the hardest to reach, the most marginalised, the most
difficult and the poorest
extremes.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T14:49:59"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T14:49:28"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070443000118" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070443000118">Secondly,
the panel called for sustainable development to be at the core of the
new framework. Several Members have raised the issue of integrating the
millennium development goals with the sustainable development goals.
Although the streams are separate—the open working group is
working on the sustainable development goals—that second
transformative shift will put sustainable development clearly at the
core of the new
framework<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T14:50:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070443000119" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070443000119">That
recognises the fundamental link between the environmental, social and
economic pillars of sustainable development. For example, we can
deliver food security for all only if there is an efficient and
sustainable use of natural resources. It is absolutely clear that we
need to bring together the review of the millennium development goals
and the Rio+20 follow-up to deliver a single development framework, as
the Committee recommended in its
report.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070443000120" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070443000120">Third<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T14:50:28"></hs_TimeCode>ly,
we need to transform economies to provide jobs and inclusive growth,
which was mentioned by several hon. Members. Clearly, we need to lift
people out of poverty through economic development and growth, to
unleash the dynamism that gives everyone economic opportunities, and to
harness investment and the private sector as the drivers of
development<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T14:50:54"></hs_TimeCode>. As

hold that dear, and we work closely not just with people in terms of

groups and faith NGOs throughout the world. We cannot really do

issues of women, and of women in conflict, have been raised. In
relation to providing peace and stability, DFID—the UK

our development work. With respect to lifting families out of poverty,
if a woman is empowered with education, has children later, has some
power over her own life and has economic empowerment, her children and
the community will be better off. As the international champion in the
fight against violence against women and girls, our fight is obviously
against violence against women—how can we have development when
half the population basically cannot go outside their own
door?—but there are also campaigns on female genital mutilation,
which is a symbol of women’s

the stand-alone gender goal, which I think is imperative. However,
there could be goals on poverty, hunger, education, equality, jobs,
economic growth, good governance, peace and stability. Hon. Members

good and succinct as it is. This is the beginning of the process, and
the next two years will demand a huge amount of work if we are to bring
that seminal piece of work to a concrete conclusion that we can all
deliver. As has been said, the early MDGs were phenomenal drivers for
good, but they did not always achieve what they set out to do. Like
other Members, I have visited schools, including one in Zambia that has
100% attendance, but a 96% failure rate. We have learned from the first
MDGs, so I am very hopeful that we will do better with the post-2015

highlight three of the Committee’s recommendations that are
particularly important. The first is on the rights of women, which I
have already touched on. The more times that that can be raised by more
bodies, the more capital it will gain until we reach universal
agreement that part of, if not all, the answer is the empowerment of
women. The second recommendation is that the post-2015 development
agenda reflects the needs of the poorest, about which I could not agree
more. As has been said, we need to listen to the voices of the poorest,
and that is what the high-level panel did. For the first time, from
surveys such as the My World survey, and mobiles, the internet and
old-fashioned clipboards and pencils, schoolgirls in Rwanda and urban
workers in Brazil have all been heard. Thethird recommendation

right hon. Friend the Member for Gordon that we should take the MDGs as
a starting point for the post-2015 goals. He highlighted the important
lesson that halving poverty sometimes has the perverse incentive
whereby we do not try to reach the very poorest. It is because that is
important that the high-level panel has called for disaggregated data

right hon. Friend raised the issue of fragile states. He rightly
identified the real issue that countries emerging from, or still in,
conflict can be left behind in relation to development. The high-level

to security. It has addressed that through the stand-alone illustrative
goal of ensuring stable and peaceful societies, for which targets in

the behaviour of security

Malcolm Bruce</B> (Gordon) (LD):</Member> I think it is fair to say
that the International Development Committee was a little bit more
controversial in some of our comments and recommendations on Pakistan
than we were on post-2015 development goals. The Committee wants to
make it clear that we have absolutely no hesitation in asserting the
fact that the relationship between Britain and Pakistan is fundamental
and indissoluble. It is absolutely essential to both countries as a
force of history and a current reality. We have more than 1 million
people of Pakistani origin living in the United Kingdom, and we have a
shared interest in ensuring that Pakistan is a successful country that
manages to overcome the challenges that it faces.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T15:02:50"></hs_TimeCode>Secondly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T15:02:51"></hs_TimeCode>,
we want to make it clear that, more than anything else, we believe that
the United Kingdom should stand with the poorest people of Pakistan and
that our objective is to engage in helping them to achieve a better
quality of life. That might mean that we will be a candid friend of
Pakistan rather than a sycophantic one.</hs_Para>

population of Pakistan is projected to rise from 180 million to 205
million by 2020, and the simple challenge that the country faces is
that population growth is faster than economic growth. One does not
have to be a top mathematician to calculate that as the population
rises, unless something fundamental changes, the numbers of people in
poverty will increase. That is one of the more depressing analyses for
our development and aid programme across our bilateral
partners<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T15:04:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070443000146" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070443000146">In
that context, the Government have a perfectly understandable ambition
to raise the aid programme—the bilateral funding to
Pakistan—from £267 million to £446 million by the
end of this Parliament. We completely understand that, but we have some
grave reservations about doing it if nothing changes, and that was an
essential aspect of our report.</hs_Para>

we looked at the areas in which the Department for International
Development was engaged, which were predominantly health, education and
governance. In all cases, they were the right areas on which to be
focused. Will the Minister update us on some of the specific points
regarding those areas about which we raised
concerns?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070443000148" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070443000148">There
is a big programme of commitment to improve maternal help, which we
support, and it is absolutely essential that that is delivered. Two
health support mechanisms are in place. One, the lady health workers,
is longer established, while the other, to which DFID has given
substantial support, is community midwives. A practical thing we
discovered was that where those mechanisms should be complementary and
working together, they were operating dysfunctionally as two separate
institutions. One reason for that was how people were paid. As we
understand it, lady health workers get a flat salary to provide help on
maternal health, child health and general health issues, which is what
our own community nurses do. Community midwives, on the other hand, are
specifically there to support  
<?notus-xml column=339?>women through childbirth. They are paid a much smaller flat rate plus so
much per delivery, so that has created two classes of health workers in
the same area.</hs_Para>

saw a particularly good example of co-operation between a lady health
worker and a community midwife, but that had more to do with the fact
that they were sisters-in-law than that the system itself was working
fundamentally as we would like. I do not know whether the Minister can
give us any information about whether that situation has been addressed
and improved. I want to make it clear that they are both good basic
concepts, but how they were functioning was not serving the interests
of the people as well as might have been the case.</hs_Para>

the biggest part of the Government’s programme is support for
education, especially, but not exclusively, in Punjab. It is worth
reporting that when we were meeting the then Prime Minister, he
spontaneously raised the issue of Malala, who was sadly shot and is now
living in this country, before any member of the Committee raised it
with him. That incident was an indication to us, and a wake-up call
among people in Pakistan, that there really had to be clarity about the
right of girls to have an education and the Government’s
full-square backing for that principle. None the less, it was
satisfying to hear that statement from the Prime Minister, but it does
not remove the fact that the challenges are very real. As we know,
Malala’s colleague who was shot at the same time has now come to
the UK because she says that her ability to pursue her education in
Pakistan has been totally compromised.</hs_Para>

scheme in Punjab that we looked at, which has been developed by Michael
Barber, is doing extremely good work and is working closely with the
Chief Minister, Shahbaz Sharif, the brother of the new Prime Minister.
The good news is that he is staying in post, because there was some
concern that if he moved, that might compromise the relationship. Good
relationships that deliver good results are clearly totally
satisfactory. The problem is that if the relationship breaks down,
there is not the infrastructure to fall back on, so one hopes that that
good relationship will
continue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T15:08:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070443000152" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070443000152">A
number of things have been said to us about that programme suggesting
some aspects are good, but some questionable. The fundamental objective
is to ensure that teachers are appointed on merit, that they turn up
and teach, and that their pupils also have an attendance record.
Michael Barber has acknowledged that that is the sum total of what has
been achieved at this stage, which means that the quality of the
education still has a way to go. At one particular school we visited,
we were shown a demonstration lesson. When we sat down at the back of
the class and flicked through the exercise book, we found that the
pages before and after that particular lesson were blank. The lesson
had been a show piece; the fundamentals were not there. Clearly, that
is a real
concern.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070443000153" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070443000153">Indeed,
we have had a follow-up visit from one of our witnesses, Dr Matthew
Nelson of the school of oriental and African studies, and he raised
further points of concern. He does not deny that appointing teachers on
merit is the right objective or that the Chief Minister and his
officials entirely buy into it, but he says that there is plenty of
evidence that merit is available to be bought, and is being bought on a
large scale. He says that it is a good idea to appoint people on merit
rather 
<?notus-xml column=340?>than because they have a political connection, and that is absolutely
right. The point he makes, however, is that exam marks, which are the
test of merit, are subject to endemic corruption; effectively, people
can buy exam results and present themselves as having merit when they
have absolutely no capacity to be a competent teacher. I will not read
them out, but Dr Nelson gives examples of how the process
works<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T15:10:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

obviously a concern, but we recognise that the approach taken by
Michael Barber and the commitment of the Chief Minister are real and
are having results, although the two of them are probably facing more
challenges than they would like. If the Minister can address those
challenges now, that would be good; if not, perhaps he can write to us
saying what proposals are being taken forward. We should certainly not
abandon the programme, but we must make sure that it works effectively
and delivers the right results.</hs_Para>

Committee’s concern was not so much that DFID was not tackling
the right issues or not approaching things in the right way—I
have indicated some of the challenges that need to be
overcome—but that an awful lot of development assistance has not
achieved substantial results. One slightly disturbing thing we were
told was that the education programme being pursued by DFID was quite
similar to one pursued by the United States Agency for International
Development some years ago. When that programme finished, the benefits
fell away completely, and we obviously hope that DFID will find a way
of ensuring that that does not happen again.</hs_Para>

However, we compiled and published our report during the election in
Pakistan—the previous Government had demitted office, and a

are not just a matter of morality and justice—I will come back
to that—but essential to Pakistan’s survival. If Pakistan
cannot raise its tax base from below 10%, it will not be able to
support its people by providing the basic services they not only have
the right to expect, but absolutely need. No aid programme from outside
can make up that shortfall; if Pakistan does not find the resources
from within its own, admittedly weak, economy, it will not be able to
sustain services—certainly not with the population growth it
faces.</hs_Para>

British Government, aid partners and the IMF must look

funding health and education in Pakistan when the richest people there
contribute absolutely nothing towards those services and do not use
them, because they buy private education and private health. That is
not only a moral issue, but a fundamental issue of financial survival
for Pakistan.</hs_Para>

Pakistan the biggest single recipient.</hs_Para>

have seen a series of e-mails. In the past few weeks, the IMF has been
engaged in Pakistan. The country is looking for further funding,
despite the fact that there  is a substantial amount—$10
billion or $12 billion—of surplus deposits in Pakistani banks,
which is about equivalent to the loan Pakistan is looking for from the
IMF. In other words, there is some sovereign resource available in
Pakistan. Again, we are not suggesting that the IMF should not engage,
but it should make it absolutely clear that increasing the tax
contribution is part and parcel of the package of agreements.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T15:15:35"></hs_TimeCode>I understand
that IMF officials have maintained a fairly resolute stance, but I am
slightly concerned to hear that the Pakistani Government’s
response has been to journey to Saudi Arabia to see whether they can
get funding from that source so that they do not have to meet the

is a sensitive issue, but it must be confronted. It is made somewhat
more difficult by what was, on the face of it, not a bad change in the
Pakistani Government’s approach to government. The 18th
amendment to the constitution devolved the delivery of services to the
four provincial governments. I am a believer in devolution, and it is
probably better to have local government delivering more services,
because it is accountable to the distinctive provinces of Pakistan.
However, if the money is not raised at either level, devolution is an
abdication of responsibility; it is basically giving the provinces
responsibility without the means to deliver services. If a formula is
not developed to ensure that the money flows, one can imagine what the

we met were outspoken in saying that they could play a much more useful
role in ensuring that aid and development spending reached the people

are more outspoken critics of Pakistan than donors or others because,

essence of all this is that Pakistan’s stability is crucial to

must face the reality that unless something changes, India’s GDP

want on health and education. They should be robust in ensuring that
our further commitment and increased engagement is matched by an
increase in the tax base.</hs_Para>

it did not believe its Members should pay taxes. I wonder what the
British public would think if we passed such a motion here. It is done
with a completely innocent face, but the people in question are much
richer than any of us—or certainly than most of us—and
they stand as political leaders, seeking to lead their country
presumably to a better place. I cannot think of any politicians who
stand in democratic elections and do not offer at least a vision and
prospects. However, for that to happen, they must play their part and

want to make one qualification to what I have said, which I think that
the Minister will understand. The small number of people in Pakistan
who do pay their taxes should not be screwed with an increase so that
the people at the other end of the scale need not pay. Nothing should
be done, either, to increase the burden on the poorest of the poor. The

it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070443000168" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070443000168">I
do not apologise for dwelling on those issues, because they represent a
watershed in our relationship with Pakistan. I want the country to

they have been stuck in a situation in which their world does not
improve, and in which, because of corruption and a lack of commitment

your chairmanship, Mr Gray, and to follow
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T15:21:45"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Gordon (Sir Malcolm Bruce), who as
usual has given the speech that we would all want to give, but cannot.
I have found the past three years as a member of the Committee, under
his chairmanship, to be a delight. I had not been to Pakistan before
our visit, and my right hon. Friend led the group expertly; such things
are particularly important when one is going to a country such as
Pakistan for the first time. We all got back in one piece and in
reasonable good humour, which I gather may not always have happened on
such visits in the
past<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T15:22:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=343?><hs_Para UID="13070443000170" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070443000170">The visit, as
well as being my first, was an eye-opener to the tremendous country
that Pakistan is. It is the sixth most populous country in the world,
with a population of 180 million—it could go well over 200
million by 2020—nearly 40% of whom are aged 10 to 29. Of course,
Pakistan has huge challenges, which it is trying to meet, and we must
review its condition in the light of them. One is terrorism. Tens of
thousands of ordinary Pakistanis have died in terrorist attacks in the
past 10 or 15 years. Members of the International Development Committee
must always remember when we visit such countries—I am sure that
this applies to the Minister too—that although we may be working
with the country’s Government or its members of Parliament, we
are working for the people who, day in, day out, suffer terrible
problems such as terrorism and the challenges of low income. I remind
the House that as many as  one in three Pakistanis live on 30p
a day, or less; one in 11 children in Pakistan die before their fifth
birthday; and half of all the country’s adults—two thirds
of its women—are illiterate, with 12 million children out of
school. Those are the people for whom the UK’s international
development programme is designed. It is true that members of
Parliament in Pakistan do not pay their taxes, but ultimately our role
under the International Development Act 2002 is to tackle poverty
through international development. I am glad to say that that is
fundamentally what DFID does through its programmes in Pakistan. We saw
some excellent
work<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T15:24:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070443000171" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070443000171">I
want first to dwell on positive areas of international development work
in Pakistan. Most of that, of course, is carried out by Pakistani
citizens; we just support them in that work. It is often forgotten what
huge humanitarian challenges Pakistan has faced in the past decade. In
2005 the Kashmir earthquake affected approximately 3.5 million people.
In 2008-09, internal displacement affected approximately 3 million
people, and the 2010 floods affected 20 million—a third of the
population of Britain. Imagine if even that proportion—say, a
tenth—of our population, which would be 6 million people, were
affected by floods. How would we cope? We find it a struggle to cope
with snow on the railway tracks. They had to cope with 20 million
people affected by
floods<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T15:25:23"></hs_TimeCode>. In 2011,
as an afterthought, 9 million were also affected by floods, and in
2012, the year when we visited, monsoon floods meant that 3 million
people needed external support.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T15:25:30"></hs_TimeCode>Often people
grow almost weary of hearing such figures, yet the Pakistan Government
at national and regional level must deal with such challenges year in,
year out. Ultimately it is the Pakistani people who must deal with
them, and I am in awe of how they do so.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13070443000172" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070443000172">Secondly, I
want to give what I might call a little vignette—although it
would not be a vignette to the people who suffered from the problem in
question. The chief Minister of Punjab, Shahbaz Sharif, who has been
re-elected, impressed us with his grasp of matters. We heard that he
had personally undertaken 17 Ministries himself, perhaps showing a lack
of confidence in his colleagues. He clearly has tremendous energy and
abilities. In 2011, the year before we were in Pakistan, there was an
outbreak of dengue fever, which killed 300 people in Lahore alone. He
was determined that that should not happen again, and initiated a
substantial public health programme, getting rid of standing water to
remove the breeding grounds of the flies that carry dengue
fever.  
<?notus-xml column=344?>As a result in 2012, when there was an outbreak, no
one died, as far as we know—if they did, the number was very
small. A challenge was met and tackled.</hs_Para>

I was encouraged—with the caveats that
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T15:27:09"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Gordon mentioned—about education. Sir
Michael Barber, as I believe the Prime Minister mentioned in the House
of Commons on Tuesday following his visit to Pakistan, has done
excellent work in the Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa education
programmes. We visited a new school, a little like one of our new free
schools, which was set up on the voucher system supported by DFID, I am
glad to say. The children who attended that school were almost
exclusively the children of workers at a nearby brick factory. Indeed,
some of them had worked at the brick factory before coming to the
school. An enterprising, wonderful Pakistani woman set up the school
using the voucher system and was enabling a couple of hundred children
to be educated, albeit at a basic level, at low cost in the community,
instead of having to provide labour—often, I am afraid,
indentured labour—at the local brick factory. That was possibly
the most encouraging thing I saw on our visit to Pakistan, and the work
of DFID enabled it to
happen<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T15:28:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070443000174" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070443000174">There
was therefore a lot to be encouraged about, and to give confidence in
the future. However,
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T15:28:45"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Gordon has also mentioned the things that give us
cause for concern. The first is the very low level of tax revenue, at
less than 10% of GDP, and the failure of the wealthiest to pay their
share—or, even, anything—towards public services. As my
right hon. Friend said, they do not use those services, but that is not
an excuse. There is also financial mismanagement. We heard about the
amount of money that the Pakistan Government have in various funds and
bank accounts. Apparently they have not yet adopted the policy of
consolidating funds in a few accounts or one account, as is normal in
public financial management. As a result, there was not as much grip on
the public finances as there might have been. Can the Minister say
whether that issue, and indeed the issue of tax revenues, has been
raised with the Pakistani Government?</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13070443000175" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070443000175"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T15:29:49"></hs_TimeCode>Then,
of course, there is the issue of corruption, which comes up time and
again. It is something that is very difficult to deal with and to speak
of. I hope that the newly elected Government of Pakistan will tackle
corruption, because corruption is anathema to development. If a country
has a corrupt Government, it will not develop. It might get some form
of development, but that development will be wasted, it will be
inefficient and the country will not get the kind of development that
it needs to bring all its people out of
poverty<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T15:30:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070443000176" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070443000176">In
conclusion, our report on Pakistan was an opportunity—certainly
for me—to see for the first time a country that faces huge
challenges but that also has huge opportunities, and one in which
Britain has a vital interest. That interest is not just a strategic
one, but much, much more than that. It is a human interest, not only
because of the Pakistani diaspora who make such a wonderful
contribution to our country—there are well over a million of
them in the UK—but because of the 180 million Pakistanis, and
rising, who are looking to their Government and to those other
Governments, such as the UK’s, who support their Government, to
give them the chance to fulfil their talent and to seize the
opportunities that a country such as Pakistan must rightfully
seize.</hs_Para>

Member for Gordon (Sir Malcolm Bruce), and other members of the

issues that, as a member of the Committee who participated in the visit

that I am glad to have the opportunity to

is quite clear to me why the UK has such an important development
partnership with Pakistan; it is because of our history and because of
the need for us to work with the Government of Pakistan to resolve
security problems that threaten both Pakistan and neighbouring
countries. Integral to that development process is empowering women to
get an education, play a full role in society and have their human
rights defended.</hs_Para>

before we went to Pakistan, we heard about the dreadful shooting in
that country of Malala, a schoolgirl who was shot simply because she
had the effrontery to wish to have an education. That event stunned
people around the world and, interestingly, changed attitudes in
Pakistan considerably. I went with some other members of the
Committee—a sub-group—on a field visit to Haripur in
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where we went to a school. It was a Government
girls’ secondary school, where the girls re-enacted a piece of
drama, asserting, as a consequence of Malala’s shooting, the
right of girls, like boys, to have an education, enter the labour force
and have professional standing. It was extremely moving. When I talked
to parents and teachers after the performance—there is a
parent-teacher association at the school—they were very clear
about the fact that the shooting of Malala had to change the nature of
politics and society in Pakistan.</hs_Para>

that visit, it struck me that, although the UK is a major aid donor, we
do not always listen enough to the voices of women in the countries
where we are working. It also struck me that, at the very least in
respect of Pakistan, we ought to establish an advisory panel of women
to work with our Department for International Development office to
ensure that all our programmes address the women’s dimension of
the issues that they aim to address, whether it be education or health
care.</hs_Para>

we were in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, we also met representatives of a number
of Pakistani non-governmental organisations, including a quite
inspirational woman, Maryam Bibi, who leads a women’s self-help
organisation called Khwendo Kor. I have known Maryam Bibi for a 
<?notus-xml column=346?>number of years. She did a postgraduate degree at York university and
then returned to the tribal areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where
women’s rights are often threatened. She has done some
remarkable things, such as establishing schools for girls and then
standing up to men who threatened to kill her for doing so. She has a
very persuasive manner. When we met her on this visit, she told us that
she had been running a campaign to try to persuade Pakistani society in
these conservative tribal areas to recognise that women should have
rights of inheritance. She did that not by demanding those rights as a
woman, but by seeking to find male community leaders who would make the
argument. She had been talking for many weeks with a mullah, who
appeared intellectually persuaded that women should have a right to
inherit, but was unwilling to make a statement to that effect in Friday
prayers, which was what she was urging him to do. That went on for many
weeks and then, eventually, he made the statement. Maryam Bibi asked
him what had finally changed his attitude, and he said, “Well,
you persuaded me early on, but it took a long time for me to get my
will changed, so that my wife could inherit.” He did not want to
call on others to do something that he had not done
himself.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070451000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070451000007"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T15:37:37"></hs_TimeCode>Maryam

Pakistani women advising us—not only on what the problems are,

second issue in Pakistan that I want to discuss, which struck me like a
bolt out of the blue, was the gross—indeed,
grotesque—violation of human rights that comes from debt

meeting the head teacher and some of the other teachers as we visited
the classrooms, we had the opportunity to meet some parents. Those
parents were brick kiln workers. They were very, very low paid and
looked down upon by various members of society, and were living on the
margins of a city in an area where the state had not deigned to provide
a school, which was why a small private initiative had been set up to
provide an education of sorts for their children. A state school would
not have done any good anyway, because the children also had to work in
the brick kiln. Consequently, the private school was arranged so that
the children could come rather earlier in the morning than they would
to a state school and so they could leave after lunch to do their share
of labour in the brick
kiln.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070451000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070451000010">Those<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T15:39:45"></hs_TimeCode>
women told me that every one of them—every one of those
parents—was indebted to the brick kiln owner and that debts
ranged from 100,000 rupees to 300,000 rupees. Sometimes, they had taken
out loans for things such as weddings, but more often because of injury
and because they needed medical treatment. The typical earnings for
people working in the brick kiln were 350 rupees per week per
family—for husband, wife and two children. Those people owed
perhaps up to two years’ wages. Such a debt for people on such a
low,  
<?notus-xml column=347?>subsistence income is one they will never repay. Indeed, one woman told
me that she had inherited her debt from her husband when he
died.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070451000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070451000011">Once
someone gets into that kind of debt, there is no escape. Those people
are illiterate, so even if they wanted to challenge the brick kiln
owner over their debt, they would not have the skills to do so. One
huge value of providing education for their children is perhaps that,
in the next generation, it will be less possible for usurious
moneylenders to pull the wool over those people’s
eyes.</hs_Para>

that problem with the Chief Minister of Punjab. He told us that the law
prevents debt bondage. His adviser, Zakia Shahnawaz, said that the
intention was to introduce a Bill to establish a minimum wage of 600
rupees and to reinforce the law that ended bonded labour. I hope that
that happens; it is desperately needed. If each wife and husband each
earned 600 rupees a week, the children would perhaps not need to work
in the brick kilns as well and could go to school in the normal way
like other children. The debts of those people should be written off.
Such debts should not exist in any civilised society anywhere in the
world, but for that to happen we need not just UN resolutions and
outrage expressed in this Palace of Westminster, but practical action
to work with such people—the poorest of the poor and the lowest
of the low—to give them the ability to go to court to challenge
what is being done to them, crushing them and their
children.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070451000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070451000013">Although

hon. Friend the Member for York Central (Hugh Bayley)? Such speeches
and the work of the Committee say it all about why we need to continue
to speak up for the most vulnerable people in the world and those who
are powerless to act. It is a credit to hon. Members on both sides of

we all know, and the Select Committee report highlights this, Pakistan
is making progress, especially on the political side. It has
successfully transitioned from one democratically elected Government to
another. Of course there are challenges, but that is still to be

World Bank, Pakistan saw a decline in poverty levels between 2008 and
2010 from just under 35% to 
<?notus-xml column=348?>17.2%, which is obviously welcome. That represents progress, but there
are still major concerns. The testimony of
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T15:46:26"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for York Central about the effects on the very poor,
particularly women, sums it up. Some 12 million children are still out
of school, which is the second highest population in the world.
Pakistan also has one of the lowest levels of female participation in
the labour market. Some 12,000 women die during pregnancy or childbirth
each year, which is completely scandalous in a country that could be

should, rightly, be a challenge to those people as we challenge

hon. Members are well aware, Pakistan also faces environmental
challenges. Humanitarian disasters in 2005, in Kashmir, and in 2010
have cost billions, displaced some 20 million people and undermined
economic growth. We need to build resilience through our efforts to
ensure that there is proper adaptation and preparation so that any such
future disasters will not cause as much chaos and

points in the report about the role of the British Pakistani community.
As we all know, the community has more than 1 million people who can
channel significant influence and resources to their country of origin
through trade and investment, and who have insights and knowledge that
could be shared by our Government to play a more constructive and
positive role than they have been allowed to do. Similar practices
could happen with other communities in  the
UK.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070451000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070451000021">As
I said in the previous debate, such communities make a massive
contribution through remittances. In the case of Pakistan, £627
million was sent in 2010 alone. That significant amount of assistance
goes directly to families to supplement the very small amount of money
that they have, even with international aid efforts. We must ensure
that any change to what banks do does not undermine that effort,
because that would force millions of people in countries such as
Pakistan into
poverty.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070451000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070451000022">The
challenges for Pakistan on corruption and tax collection have been well
described. The Opposition feel strongly that we must look into building
strong mechanisms through budget support. Support for tax authorities
will be critical. I hope that the Minister will respond to some of the
points made about specific measures to build a sustainable process for
taxation and revenue, and to prevent avoidance and evasion. Our efforts
must be conditional on effective governance, as that is what our
taxpayers expect from us.</hs_Para>

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T15:51:26"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend 
<?notus-xml column=349?>the Member for York Central mentioned, the major challenge for a country
such as Pakistan is protecting the needs of women and minorities.
Pakistan’s human rights challenge is massive. The treatment of
particular groups, notably women, and incidents such as the
high-profile case of Malala Yousafzai, who sought her basic right to an
education, are unacceptable. They also do not speak for
Pakistan’s proud history as a nation. Women played a formative
role in the anti-colonial movements of 1947 and subsequently, and
Pakistan has human rights lawyers—strong feminists and powerful
women—who are working hard to ensure that their country is not
hijacked by a small minority of extremists. We must shore up those
women and the male human rights activists who are speaking up for all
the population of their country, including minorities such as
Christians and Hindus.</hs_Para>

Pakistani community has a critical role to play in supporting Pakistan

rest of south Asia, have a proud history that needs to be tapped into.

must constantly work to protect minorities in this country, Pakistan
and other parts of the world, and that is why we must ensure that in
the post-millennium development goals discussions on the high-level

the Government take this issue seriously. I worry that they do not
always feel at ease with the language of empowerment and rights. I hope
that when the testimonies are heard and explored, and considered
alongside the risks to development when there is not a proper rights
and empowerment agenda—a genuine one, as opposed to
rhetoric—people will make a stronger case for putting human
rights at the heart of the development agenda, rather than treating it
as an add-on. I have faith that the Minister will push his Prime
Minister to do so in his role in the high-level panel. The hon. Member
for Stafford (Jeremy Lefroy) made the case clearly that the issue of
minority rights affects all societies, especially societies coping with
massive development, economic and security challenges.</hs_Para>

with two additional points. Pakistan is the country with the fourth
highest number of deaths of children under five. Additionally, in the
UN’s report on the global gender gap, Pakistan ranks 133rd out
of 135, so it is very much at the bottom, although there is no reason
why it should be there. Pakistan has incredible people, and especially
women, who could be in the driving seat to advance the cause against
those issues that affect women so badly and hold its society
back.</hs_Para>

the report and tireless work of the members of the International
Development Committee. Its timely report comes at an opportune moment,
given the new Government in Pakistan. As aid budgets increase, we must
ensure that our investment in Pakistan genuinely supports those in

exploitation and abuse, and creates hope and opportunity in a country

Pakistan has a unique opportunity to advance and to lift millions of

corruption and the other issues raised in the report. It also involves
ensuring that the public interest is put at the heart of
Pakistan’s development, not the interest of an elite minority,

historic elections, which mark the first time a democratically elected
civilian Government in Pakistan have served their full term and then
handed over to another through credible elections. In the face of

UK’s development programme is well placed to help. Since the

UK aid has helped 1.9 million children in school, provided
cash transfers to more than 2.5 million people and provided life-saving

the Committee set out, our development support must be dependent on
policy reform that fosters increased economic and social development.
That is why UK development programmes with the Government of Pakistan
proceed only on the condition: that the Government of Pakistan provide
the bulk of the funding and commit to increase their spending; that
they deliver on agreed results and reforms; and that UK public money is
protected from corruption. Those benchmarks are at the heart of all our

national level, we have helped to generate significant increases and
improvements in the Government’s income support programme, which
is a financial safety net for the poorest and most vulnerable. The new
Government have announced a 25% increase in the programme’s
budget, which is a commitment of almost £500 million in the
coming year. The risk of corruption has also been reduced—thus
trying to ensure that the programme reaches those who need it most.
Over the coming months, we will hold formal talks with the new federal
and provincial governments as soon as we can to agree joint priorities.
Central to those discussions will be economic reform, particularly on
tax.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070451000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070451000042">The

revenue, which is exactly what we are doing. We agree that, without
more revenue, the Pakistani Government cannot meet the needs of their
growing population. We have had initial discussions with the new

<?notus-xml column=352?>official level, and we are clear on what needs to happen. Pakistan has
one of the lowest tax takes in the world, which has to
change.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070451000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070451000043">Early<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:05:10"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:05:36"></hs_TimeCode>
signs from the new Government are positive. In their recent budget,
they committed to increase their tax-to-GDP ratio, which is currently
less than 10%, to 15% by 2018, and they took some initial steps towards
that. I assure hon. Members that our Prime Minister raised that matter
forcefully during his visit to Pakistan last week. We are already
providing advice on how they can deliver that commitment, and we will
continue to push for early, bold action, starting from the top. The
richest must pay their fair share.
Our<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:05:47"></hs_TimeCode> Prime
Minister had positive conversations with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on
that issue during his visit, and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of

other international finance institutions to ensure that any future IMF

As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:06:16"></hs_TimeCode> negotiations
with the IMF proceed, we are exploring how best the UK can provide
assistance alongside other international partners. That includes
considering the possibility of offering Pakistan expertise and advice
from Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, but we are clear that
co-ordinated action through an IMF programme, rather than individual
donors setting their own reform conditions, offers the best long-term
prospect for securing
reform.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070451000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070451000045">It
is absolutely essential that the new Government take steps to address
corruption, because corruption limits economic growth and erodes
confidence in the state. Our governance work already focuses on such
corruption. In Punjab, for example, we are supporting the Government to
curb low-level corruption by officials, and to improve service delivery
as a result. Every day, 30,000 people are providing feedback on
government services, via their mobile phones for instance, and action
is being taken against those accused of corruption. We look forward to
discussing what more we can do with the new Government as they develop
their own priorities in that

to addressing corruption is effective governance that ensures the rule
of law and empowers citizens—what our Prime Minister calls the
“golden thread.” The Committee suggests that that is
lacking in governance work, and I want to make it clear that it runs
through our portfolio. Our new sub-national governance programmes will
operate across two provinces and benefit more than 7.5 million people,
thereby improving the ability of government to deliver key services,
including security and justice. Now the new Government are in place, we
will review our approach with them to identify opportunities where more
can be
done.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070451000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070451000047">We

right hon. Member for Gordon mentioned the health sector. In recent
years, service provision has changed significantly through the
devolution of responsibilities from federal to provincial government,
as both the Committee and the Independent Commission for Aid Impact
have noted. In response to that change, we have significantly
redesigned our support for health.
Let<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:09:26"></hs_TimeCode> me assure
the House that the redesign has addressed the concerns expressed by
ICAI and the Committee, and has taken on board the lessons from the
previous federal approach. DFID’s new provincial health and
nutrition programme supports local governments to manage both community
midwives and lady health workers, so ensuring that their remits are
complementary. Our funding will also only be provided when there is
clear evidence that results are being
achieved<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:09:59"></hs_TimeCode>. In a

implement policy changes that will foster economic and social

Malcolm Bruce:</Member></B> I thank the Minister for a succinct and
positive response to the debate, which shed a clear light on the
Government’s determination to take the opportunity to turn
things around. It is important that the new, democratically elected
Government—the first to secure the transition—have the
responsibility and an opportunity to make the changes. My only caution
is that, while I welcome their commitment to increase the tax take to
15%, such commitments have been made in the past and not delivered. We
clearly need positive measures for that to

completely agree with the Minister that the most effective way to
achieve things is through donor co-ordination, because all the donors
working together and singing from the same hymn sheet is more likely to
get a co-ordinated response. I welcome what he said about bringing
together lady health workers and community midwives, which seems to be
something that could be done, so it is great to hear that it is being
done. We can do it ourselves as well, but I hope that the Minister will
convey to Sir Michael Barber that he is doing an excellent job of work,
although there are some concerns about merit meaning what it
says—perhaps something could be done about
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:12:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070451000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/halltext/130704h0001.htm#13070451000053">Overall,
we want to share with the people of Pakistan an absolutely joint
commitment saying that they deserve a future that is a lot better than
the recent past. We have to ensure that the aid community can find the
partners—partners in Pakistan—to achieve that. As the
Minister rightly says, without a functioning partner outside agencies
ultimately cannot deliver. The reason why we put the caveat that we did
in the report is that, willing as we may be to support the poor people
of Pakistan, the effort will only work if their leaders want it to work
and are prepared to work with us. I am, however, encouraged by what the
Minister has had to say. I hope that the next few months in particular
will see some positive progress in that

new herd breakdowns has doubled every nine years and in the last decade

England alone, over 5.5 million bTB tests were performed leading to the
slaughter of 28,000 cattle with the disease costing the taxpayer nearly

the Bovine TB Eradication Advisory Group for England, draws upon
successful approaches to eradicate bTB around the world, including
Australia, New Zealand, Michigan in the Unites States of America and
the Republic of Ireland. These demonstrate the importance of applying
stringent cattle control measures in combination with tackling any
significant reservoir of infection in wildlife, whether it is water
buffalo, brush-tailed possums, white-tailed deer, or badgers. An
additional factor which has contributed to their success is the fact
that their programmes are either led by industry or delivered by

strategy builds upon the measures applied currently including testing
of cattle and other animals, additional controls in affected herds, and
controls to address the reservoir of infection in badgers. The
Government are proposing to work in partnership with the industry to
develop risk-based packages using all available tools to protect
low-risk areas of England, stop the geographical spread of bTB and bear
down on the disease in endemic
areas.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13070439000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/wmstext/130704m0001.htm#13070439000067">As
well as using available tools the Government will continue to develop
new ones. I have already achieved a major success in securing a
concrete road map from the European Commission on the deployment of
cattle vaccination. I am committed to meeting the minimum time scale
but that is at least 10 years away. The Government will also continue
to invest in the development of an oral badger vaccine and in new
diagnostic tests for tuberculosis in cattle and badgers, which could

approaches.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13070439000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/wmstext/130704m0001.htm#13070439000068">The

some—now or in the future—that do not deliver the

people who are automatically enrolled or automatically transferred into

scheme to join. In addition, the long-term nature of pensions means it
may not be clear how good an outcome a scheme will deliver for members
until they have paid into it for many years. It is therefore
particularly important that sufficient protections are in place to
ensure that schemes are run in a way that is beneficial for members.

weekly earnings increased by 1.3% on the year, and CPI inflation
increased by 2.4% over the year to April. However, the best way to deal

2012 the number of people employed in the UK increased faster than most
of the UK's major competitors, including the US, France, Germany, Japan

partnership working between Network Rail and its delivery partners to
secure key projects and outcomes more efficiently than would otherwise

industry's commitment to partnership working to reduce the costs and
meet the challenges set out by the McNulty report. By working towards a
single, collaborative contract based around shared values and
behaviours, the Alliance has been able to achieve significant savings
when compared with traditional methods of contracting. Through direct
engagement with the supply chain, from tender through to contract

Hammond:</Member></B> The Government has made a clear commitment not to
toll existing road capacity and this has not changed. We have always
said we would look at schemes which would fund significant new capacity
through tolling. There will be cases where the combination of the
significant expense of the scheme and the distribution of the benefits
means that it is fair that users meet some of the costs of the scheme,
rather than general taxpayers. This would be in very limited
circumstances where schemes deliver new roads or transform an existing
road into an entirely new route beyond all recognition and there is a
strong economic and commercial case for a contribution from
tolling.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13070463000037" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/text/130704w0001.htm#13070463000037">Transport:

policy around voluntary national insurance contributions. However,
income-based jobseeker's allowance is available to self-employed people
who meet the eligibility criteria. The Department administers a wide
range of benefits and allowances that are available to people on low
incomes. Self-employed people who meet the qualifying criteria may be
entitled to housing benefit, help with council tax and NHS charges.

this information. In responding to last year's consultation 'Getting It
Right for Victims and Witnesses', we identified persistently targeted
victims as being one of three groups of victims who can suffer the
greatest impact of crime. We know that crime, even when seemingly less
serious, can have a devastating impact on victims when committed again
and again over a period of time, particularly where a person is
deliberately targeted. That is why persistently targeted victims are
one of three groups of victims eligible for enhanced services from
criminal justice agencies and service providers.</hs_Para>

Ministry of Justice, and launched in 2010, has specially trained staff
who help families cope with the trauma of the murder or manslaughter of
a loved one. This includes helping them inform employers about their
situation and accessing legal advice. It then remains for employers to
decide, taking into account someone's contract of employment and any
relevant legal requirements, the position they take in respect of
employees who find themselves needing to take time off work when

cathedrals which charge for entry give free access to those attending
services (of which there are a number every day of the week), to those

Sandwich Islands (GSGSSI) were only recently made aware of the
biosecurity policy breaches which occurred in March 2013 and are still
in the process of establishing the full facts surrounding the
situation. Nevertheless, they have advised the UK Government that the
breaches were contained in a small area and detected within a few days
of occurring, at which point appropriate mitigation action was taken,
for example, incineration of prohibited items. An initial assessment by
GSGSSI concluded that it is unlikely that either of these breaches will
have resulted in any adverse
impacts.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13070463000101" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130704/text/130704w0002.htm#13070463000101">Turks

councils should require new town centre uses to be located in existing
town centres out of preference. Only if there are no suitable and

consideration be given to siting such development outside of town
centres. In considering proposals for town centre uses that can only be

Giving the GIB scope to borrow up to £500 million of

services with less than 0.5% not able to receive DTT services at all.
However, DTT, cable and satellite digital television services together
cover practically 100% of UK households, so that in all but the most
exceptional of cases, everyone should be able to get digital television
by one means or another. As well as subscription services, digital
satellite TV offers non-subscription reception options for a one-off
equipment and installation cost, but with no on-going monthly payments.
There are no plans to require broadcasters to improve the DTT coverage
levels agreed for digital television switchover in 2006.</hs_Para>

Arts Council England (ACE) as an arms-length body of Government has
identified four priorities to sustain and develop a 21st century public
library service including making the most of digital technology and
creative media. While many public library services run by the local
authorities across England already promote digital literacy and
provision of access to computers and the internet, the Society of Chief
Librarians (SCL) in partnership with ACE and The Reading Agency,
launched the Universal Offer's initiative in January 2013 which
included the Universal Digital Offer that defined the minimum a public
library authority should provide and what customers should expect from
their public library. This includes free access to the internet for
every customer for a minimum period of time and staff trained to help
customers access digital information. This initiative is being rolled
out across public libraries in England during 2013.</hs_Para>

NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due
to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in outpatient

example, people may sign up to the ODR when they register with a new
general practitioner, when applying for a new passport, when applying
for a European Health Insurance Card and when applying for a Boots
