has been agreed and published. On 4 July the Culture Secretary updated
the other place by way of a Written Statement, as I did in your
Lordships’ House, on developments since the cross-party
agreement on 18 March. On 30 April the Press Standards Board of Finance
petitioned the Privy Council with an alternative charter. The PressBoF

have on many of the exchanges we have had on this matter, that the
priority is to ensure that there is a resolution in place so that the
victims can be reassured that it can never happen again. It is clearly
in everyone’s interests that the committee acts swiftly to
consider the charter in a manner consistent with delivering a robust
and justifiable

Prescott:</Member></B> My Lords, the agenda, the rules of decisions,
the timing and attendance are determined by Cabinet Members. They have
decided to give the press charter greater priority. Is the Minister
aware that there is division on the press charter as a number of the
papers do not support it? It is not consistent with Leveson’s
request for independence—free of government, free of Parliament
and free of the press. In giving priority to this they have chosen to
make a controversial political decision inside the Privy Council. That
may inevitably mean a division of opinion between Parliament and the
monarchy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T11:08:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T11:09:45"></hs_TimeCode> agree with my
noble friend. That is precisely why we are going through the procedures
that we are, which we must do for legal reasons. The PressBoF charter
will be considered swiftly, as I said. But Parliament has already, as
we know, passed two Acts of Parliament—the Crime and Courts Act
and the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act. All the recommendations
made by Lord Justice Leveson will provide strong and effective
incentives for relevant publishers to join a recognised independent

Howells of St Davids:</Member></B> I thank the Minister for his Answer.
Does he recognise that talking therapies are more effective for
treating eating disorders, yet to date there is no legal right to
receive talking therapies, as there is for drugs? Recent figures
outline that more people than previously are waiting longer than the
targeted access time of 28 days to receive those therapies, especially
those under 18. In fact, the figures show that those under 18 are
sometimes referred to mental hospitals rather than being given such
therapy at the time. I respect the fact that the Government have
committed to make measurable progress by March 2015 to parity of
esteem, and that they cannot make any commitments before that. However,
I am concerned that there appears to be no monitoring of this
situation. The fact that this is urgent does not seem to be taken on

three-quarters before their mid-20s. That is precisely why we are
investing a large sum of money—£54 million—over
the four-year period 2011-15 in the Children and Young People’s

parity of esteem. It depends on ensuring not only that mental health
services are given their fair share of the budget but that the right
treatments are delivered to the right people, and that everyone in the

up with NHS England what the right metrics are in order to judge

of mental health problems, including eating disorders, and on providing
support in schools. Particularly, we have provided £3 million of
funding over two years to the BOND Consortium, which is led by
YoungMinds. The aim of that is to build capacity in the voluntary
sector to support the access that schools have to local services. We

<?notus-xml column=402?>agree with her that the risks associated with long-term use of
tranquillisers have been well recognised for many years. There are
several authoritative sources for guidance for prescribers on this
issue. I believe that that guidance is having an effect because, as I
said, the prescribing rate has considerably diminished of late. There
is no shortage of guidance out there. There is the national formulary,
which already describes the importance of gradual withdrawal from
benzodiazepines, and there is a wide variety of other impartial and

The previous Government started a process with regard to remuneration
for senior bankers, which has been strengthened in several respects.

Patel:</Member></B> My Lords, it is a pleasure to open this debate on
the future funding of health and social care. I would like to thank all
noble Lords taking part in the debate today. Looking at the list of
speakers, no doubt we will hear radical views and provocative ideas in
an altogether interesting debate. I thank in particular  the
Minister and the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, on the Opposition Front Bench
for taking part today. Perhaps neither of them will be willing to put
forward what the views of their own parties would be if they were in
Government post-2015, but who knows? They might be persuaded to do
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T11:38:36"></hs_TimeCode>. The
procedures of the House mean that the Minister has to wind up the
debate. However, any questions put to him about future Government plans
for funding health and social care beyond 2016 would be, in my view,
inappropriate, and I, for one, would not do so.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T11:39:29"></hs_TimeCode> hope that we
have an open debate which can form the basis of a wider public debate.
In my view, that is necessary before the next general election, and
only this Chamber could facilitate such a debate. I also thank the
Library staff and the many organisations outside, chiefly the Nuffield
Trust, for providing detailed briefings to facilitate this
debate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T11:39:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0001.htm#13071154000069">Last
Friday, 5 July, was the 65th anniversary of the establishment of the
NHS through a bold and courageous piece of legislation that established
free healthcare for all, irrespective of the ability to pay. Despite
its many faults and occasional disasters, even to the point of causing
harm and death to patients, and the daily reports of its shortcomings,
it remains the most cherished public service—to the extent that,
much to the bewilderment of foreign visitors, we celebrated it at the
Olympic opening ceremony. Some say that it is our only national
religion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T11:39:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0001.htm#13071154000070">The
NHS is the most successful and envied health system in the world. I
have had the privilege of working in it for 39 years and 62 days, and I
was trained in it for five years before that. Today, over 1 million
people are at work in the NHS, over 70% of them female, and many
thousands more provide a voluntary free service. Over 1.5 million
patients and their families will be in contact with the NHS. Each
month, 23 million people visit their doctor or a nurse. Every minute,
five 999 calls will be answered by the ambulance service.
The NHS has delivered many innovations: drug developments, new devices,
CT and MRI scans, ultrasound and innovative surgical procedures. In
September, a member of your Lordships’ House will celebrate 25
years of his heart transplant, which is quite an achievement. It has
also delivered assisted conception, complex treatments and much more.
In fact, in some ways we have failed to harness the potential of the
National Health Service to deliver innovations, including healthcare
delivery<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T11:41:09"></hs_TimeCode>. The
majority of people who come into contact with 
<?notus-xml column=407?>the health service are satisfied with their care. Of course, it fails
some people and that is unacceptable, but all this suggests that the
NHS is a good ship, and any future plans need to bear that in
mind<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T11:41:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

of brilliant design or of politics and circumstance? Are the continuous
changing of structures and reorganisations beneficial or merely
ideological? In an odd way, the strength of the system is that it is
resilient enough to absorb change to meet changing needs and yet
continue to provide care. I do not believe that any other health system
in the world is able to do that, certainly not under the insurance
model of funding. However, in prolonged austerity, can a service that
is free at the point of use survive and continue to do so? If the
answer is “yes”, how will it have to change? If the
answer is that it cannot survive as a free service at the point of use,
who is best placed to make the argument to the public for the
alternative? Is it the clinicians, the politicians or the
managers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T11:42:29"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0001.htm#13071154000072">There
does not seem to be much of an appetite to change the model
drastically. A poll of public views suggests that there is a
willingness to contribute financially for minor, non-clinical services,
but the majority want a free service at the point of use and are
willing to pay higher taxes if the efficient use of money can be
demonstrated. In a recent report from the Nuffield Trust on the NHS as
viewed by 65 politicians, many of them previous Secretaries of State,
managers, clinicians and others, the majority feel that the founding
principles of the NHS are deeply enshrined. Some, however, do not feel
that that is so and say that we are sleepwalking towards destroying the
NHS. Some, like the noble Lord, Lord Warner, who unfortunately could
not take part today—I think he is sorting out the US health
service—feel that we should start exploring the basis on which
we fund the NHS, which is with a complex mix of hypothecated taxes,
user charges, and so on. Other notable voices such as those of Stephen
Dorrell, Alan Milburn, the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, and Kenneth
Clarke, say that despite the financial challenge, the NHS should remain
free at the point of
use<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T11:43:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0001.htm#13071154000073">Expenditure
on the NHS has risen constantly since its establishment in 1948. In its
first year of operation, the Government spent £11.4 billion. In
2010-11, the figure was 10 times greater, at £121 billion. At a
growth rate of around 4% per year, in GDP terms that was 3.7% of GDP at
the inception of the NHS to nearly 8.9% now. A reduction in funding and
cost savings over the next decade will, based on historical cost
growth, produce a funding gap of £54 billion by 2021-22. Sir
David Nicholson made a speech yesterday suggesting that it might be
less, but that is the figure worked out by
PricewaterhouseCoopers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T11:44:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

drivers of increased NHS spending are population growth, growth in
national wealth, cost increases and developments in medical technology.
An ageing population with an increasing number of older people is
thought to be much less important as an increase in life expectancy
merely delays the healthcare costs associated with death. If we follow
the trajectory of spending over the past 50 years to the next 50 years,
we will spend one-fifth of the nation’s entire wealth on the
provision of health and social care.
Of<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T11:45:43"></hs_TimeCode> course 
<?notus-xml column=408?>there will be the benefits of better health, quality of life and a
positive impact on productivity and economic activity. However,
spending at that rate will also produce diminishing returns and
therefore costs will always need to be controlled.</hs_para>

remain free at the point of use, the NHS will have to change. We will
need to find a better way of spending £120 billion. Some, such
as the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, and Sally Davies, argue for a plan to
reduce demand: a strategy of disease prevention. Demographic and
behavioural trends will put increased demands on the service. By 2023,
the population of England is projected to be 58 million, with those
aged over 75 accounting for 10% of the population. There will be an
increase in the number of people with long-term conditions such as
diabetes, vascular disease and dementia, and there will be more cancer
survivors. People with such conditions account for 64% of out-patient
appointments and make up 70% of in-patients. For every £10
spent, £7 goes towards the health and social care of these
patients.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13071154000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0001.htm#13071154000076">In
2011, nearly 25% of the population were obese. Behavioural factors such
as smoking, drinking, obesity and a lack of exercise will have a
significant effect on the health budget. The public and private
sectors, particularly the food and drink industries, will have to
contribute to preventative strategies, voluntarily or through
legislation and taxation.
One<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T11:45:43"></hs_TimeCode>-third of
healthcare costs are consumed by three categories of patients: mental
health, vascular disease and cancer. The last two will double in
incidence in 10 years and 40% of that incidence is based on the
behaviour and attitudes of the public.</hs_para>

technological progress will push up healthcare costs as new technology
is expensive and will increase life expectancy, particularly of those
with the highest healthcare costs. Likely developments in the medium
term include better cancer care, better drugs for cancers, focused
radiotherapy and ultrasound, the molecular targeting of cancers with
drugs, nano-medicine, embedded chip monitoring of disease progression,
genomics, better stratification of patients for treatment, proteomics,
population genomics for risk identification, personalised care and, in
regenerative medicines, cell therapy such as the treatment of
age-related macular degeneration, autologous stem cell therapy, gene
therapy, tissue engineering, robotic surgery, drugs that will slow the
progression of diseases causing dementia, and many
others<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T11:48:41"></hs_TimeCode>. Other
cost pressures will be rising wages, which can be controlled
temporarily but not in the long term, and will affect productivity.
These costs have stagnated since 2010, probably because of a reduction
in labour. Productivity growth of 4% a year, year-on-year, cannot be
sustained; neither can cost savings without providing care differently,
which will mean managing public and political attitudes. It will also
mean the better use of data and technology, which have the potential to
transform treatment and the management of care.</hs_para>

are there for finding funds from other sources? The public view, as we

interesting. The public want free care at the point of need, but may

<?notus-xml column=409?>clinically unnecessary procedures. Some would accept increased taxation,

am sure that there will be proponents of other ideas for raising funds
or reducing costs. Arguments for co-payment will come to the fore; the
experience of New Zealand and France may be of interest in
understanding that. There have been novel ideas such as taxing the

risk<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T11:50:26"></hs_TimeCode> foods and
alcohol, as we did those responsible for fixing LIBOR interest rates,
to pay the costs of the Armed Forces covenant; charging for GP
appointments; and part-insurance, either for the young or the older
population, on the California model. The evidence suggests that the
public have no appetite for any of the above. Charging those not
entitled to the service would be more acceptable if it was incremental.
The majority of the public see the NHS as a morally special property
and therefore expect it to be adequately funded, even to the detriment
of some other public services, if that is the
choice.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0001.htm#13071154000080">Any<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T11:51:29"></hs_TimeCode>
changes to NHS funding would require the public to be convinced that
the current system is working as efficiently as possible before
considering radical changes. The public want to be involved more and
more with the NHS, including on decisions related to funding; changes
need to be explained to the public, with a public debate before any
legislation. The public have a strong attachment to the founding
principles of the NHS and will not accept a radical change to the
current model of funding. The only likelihood of success is through an
incremental approach. I beg to

McColl of Dulwich:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble
Lord, Lord Patel, for securing this
debate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T11:52:03"></hs_TimeCode>. There
are two subjects on which I would like to comment. First is the
underlying cause of the ever increasing demands on the NHS; they are
due, of course, to the ever increasing number of patients with
diabetes, eye disease, high blood pressure, strokes, heart attacks,
cirrhosis of the liver, cancer, worn-out knees and hips, and so
on<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T11:52:22"></hs_TimeCode>, as the noble
Lord, Lord Patel, has already said. But it has to be pointed out that
most of these conditions have a single cause, and that single cause is
obesity. The obesity epidemic is the worst epidemic to afflict this
country for 90 years; it is killing millions and costing billions and
the cure is free: simply eat and drink fewer calories. A great deal of
obesity is due to that poison called alcohol, a cause not only of
obesity but of many
diseases.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0001.htm#13071154000082">This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T11:53:24"></hs_TimeCode>
enormous problem has been bedevilled by the Department of Health,
Health Ministers and opposition spokesmen, and that quango NICE, all
misleading Parliament by stating that all the calories we eat is spent
on exercise. This is totally untrue. Exercise  is good for the
heart, helps keep the cholesterol at a safe level and improves the
feeling of well-being, but it is not effective at reducing weight. One
has to run 10 miles to take off a pound of fat. Really obese
people cannot exercise, and they do not need to in order 
<?notus-xml column=410?>to lose weight; all that they have to do is to eat and drink fewer
calories. NICE has informed me that it is going to correct its
misleading advice, but it will not be published until January next

this enormous obesity epidemic is obviously bankrupting the NHS. It is

is the extra funding to pay for the ever increasing demands going to

the inception of the NHS he realised that there was a major problem. In
October 1949 he announced, in another place, “We propose to
bring in prescription charges in order to discourage people from using
the NHS excessively and unnecessarily”. I suspect he really
wanted to put the charge on going to see the GP but he realised that
that would be political

might learn a lesson from the radical changes in the dental services

doctor up front and, if they cannot afford it, are reimbursed. There is
an attraction in the patient paying up front because he is not asking
for charity, he is employing the doctor. It changes the relationship.

However—and this is different—it would be naive to think
that the process of massive service 
<?notus-xml column=411?>redesign, given the time and complexity of doing it, will by itself fund
the significant gap consequent on the increase in demand. We will,

increases of between 45% and 90% in the five main chronic conditions in
the long term. The number of those with multiple conditions will

I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Patel, that David Nicholson is clear
in what he said today but is underestimating the scale of the

a considerable time, even if there is stronger political leadership on
these changes than we have seen from any political party so far. These
are big systemic changes that will take 10 years and require
investment. The benefits will not always be cashable and there will be

that I suspect is shared by many other noble Lords: this debate is
about my care down the line. I would like to examine the challenges
facing us on future health and care funding, the public expectation of
the future delivery of these services and how the public can be seen as

ageing and the gap between pension age and life expectancy is
increasing. Thus, the ratio of taxpayers to pensioners is decreasing.
According to the ONS, the population of over-65s will increase by an
average of 1.8% a year between 2014 and 2021. Coupled with other
factors such as the rising population, this will create an increase in
demand for NHS services of 4% a year. I appreciate that there are other
figures but those were the results of my research. Pension entitlement
has caused pensioners as a proportion of spending to increase from 17%
in 2010 to 21% in 2015. This proportion is likely to increase with
fewer working-age people to fund it. However, we must remember that
older people generate some £40 billion for the UK economy, and
this will increase to £70 billion by 2030.</hs_para>

contrast the views on welfare entitlement as a whole between
generations. Recently, the <I>Economist</I> highlighted that more than
two-thirds of people born before 1939 consider the welfare state one of
Britain’s proudest achievements, whereas less than one-third of
those born after 1979 say the same. Polling by YouGov shows that those
aged 18 to 24 are more likely than older people to consider social
problems the responsibility of individuals rather than of the
Government. They will become the taxpayers who fund our health and
social care system in the future and will make the political decisions,
yet their views on the state’s responsibilities to individuals
are markedly different from those of baby boomers entering retirement
now, so things will have to
change<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T12:05:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0001.htm#13071154000098">Clearly,
there must be a debate on where the public’s priorities lie. By
2061, non-health departments will have had to reduce their proportion
of net government spending from 80% to 50%. This 50% would apply to
education, pensions, benefits and defence. So how do we fund future
health and social care? What behaviour and attitudes need to change? I
think we all agree that we cannot continue as we are. If it is funded
purely out of taxation, excluding all efficiency savings, for every 1%
increase in healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP—that is
around £15 billion—it would add to the 
<?notus-xml column=413?>tax bill of every household in the UK another £570 a year. To put
this in context, a 1p increase in income tax would yield only an extra
£5.32 billion per annum for the Treasury, so it would require a
3p rise for each extra percentage point. The sums are now beginning to
sound really

there are efficiency savings to be found, such as extra investment in
preventive care and the use of technology, which, as a recent Deloitte
report for Scope has shown, achieves average returns of 30%, which
would reduce the number of people entering the system at crisis level.
Do we cut big-ticket spending items, such as Trident, which is
projected to cost £20 billion, or High Speed 2,
estimated at £32.7 billion? Do we means-test access to primary
care? Do we cut pensions in return for better social care? Do we
encourage planning for old age to include care and pensions? Here I

changed the face of the Games. They were the envy of the world. The

noble Lord, Lord Patel, on securing the debate. As we have heard from

NHS is, how high public expectation remains and the problem of rising
costs—it’s own health check has just been referred

want to talk a little about care systems and the models that we might
need to develop. Experience on the ground tells us that care systems
are very fragmented. As systems such as family stability collapse, many
people are isolated and struggle to access care and health services.
The current system is very skewed towards the delivery of episodic
interventions around particular crises. We need to look below that. We
need to step back and see how we can create a culture of engagement,
support and well-being for people that puts those episodic
interventions in a different context and perhaps provides a context in
which they would be less necessary and less frequent. I shall raise
some questions about models and capacity, not least in relation to the
elderly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0001.htm#13071154000114">I
work in the county of Derbyshire. Last year, in the city of Derby, I
organised a commission, the Redfern commission, which looked at models
of care in our community and how we could contribute alongside the
statutory provision. We had a public hearing looking at models of care
for the elderly. One of the experts who came as a witness to that
public hearing raised three issues. She started by talking about
people’s feet and the fact that proper foot care is very
important to allow people to continue to have mobility—to be
able to shop, do their cleaning and have social intercourse. Very
simple things that require microengagement make a huge difference to
people’s well-being and health. She also talked about the
reluctance of doctors to diagnose depression in elderly patients who
suffer a lot of loss. She said that something like 2 million elderly
people are diagnosed with clinical depression, but there are probably
far more, and it is hard for them to get treatment or even support on
the ground. She also raised the lack of provision of advice for elderly
people about sexual health.</hs_para>

be dealt with not through episodic major
interventions but through a culture on the ground of support, care and
contact. It is voluntary groups—churches especially—that
in most communities provide lunch clubs, outreach and all the things
that allow people who are otherwise isolated and struggling with
medical and social care conditions to be supported. However, 87% of
local authorities are setting their eligibility criteria at substantial
or higher. I think we need models that look below the surface where
people need care and can be sustained more realistically. In  a
parish in a rural group of parishes, the parish, the diocese and the
Simeon Trust have brought together resources to appoint a chaplain. In
that rural area, that lady visits 140 people regularly to monitor them,
to put them in touch with each other, to help to assess them face to
face and to know when support from the medical and care system might
kick in, so that people do not get to an acute moment. There is a
community system of monitoring, care and contact.</hs_para>

needs to be developed. The Dilnot report said that there has to be a
new relationship between individuals and the care system. Beneath the
radar of the formal care system, there are enormous resources in the
voluntary community that can allow that to happen. Will the Minister
consider how the Government, local government and the framework of
formal systems can enable a small amount of investment to encourage
voluntary and church groups doing this face-to-face work on the ground
that provides the context for care and well-being to flourish and grow
so that the demand for the major interventions that are so costly might
be more controlled and probably reduced because of a better sense of
well-being at grass roots level? I would be interested if the Minister
could comment on that model and how it might be encouraged and
developed to create greater capacity in our systems of social care and
health
provision.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_11_PT_1/0883B6B0FB231BF4D9B5E0987DA98ACF9E5B6F4A" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 11 July 2013">Thursday,

one that has been suggested during this debate is to increase taxation.

increase in taxation. Of course, we know that the demand is going to be
much greater<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T12:22:25"></hs_TimeCode>. We
could settle on giving a greater proportion of public expenditure to

have learnt a lot already this morning, and expect to continue to learn
more. I am particularly struck by the consensus among the noble
Baronesses, Lady Jolly and Lady Boothroyd, who said that things cannot
continue as they are. However, I want to come at this from the bottom
up, as it were—from how technology and patient expectation will
drive changes both to the structure and, by necessity, to the funding
of healthcare services, and in particular, how digital and genomic
innovation will have an effect on the National Health Service. It is a
subject that has been much discussed at the International Centre for
Life in Newcastle, of which I have the honour to be honorary president,
and I declare my interest

is not all bad news. We are likely to see huge reductions in the cost
of certain procedures as a result of innovation. IT, 3D printing in
surgery and new materials are all helping to drive down various costs.
I believe that the cost of a cataract operation has come down
dramatically because of an increase in the speed of doing it and a
decrease in the cost of the materials. This is, of course, bringing
operations within the reach of the poor in other countries as well as
in this country.</hs_para>

sequencing has come down from costing billions to thousands in the past
decade alone. As we know, however, if we make things cheaper, people
will want more of them. I suspect that, through new technology, we will
soon be putting enormous demands on healthcare services. We will use
our smart phones to find out precisely what kind of lurgy we have,
rather than just accepting that we have one; what kind of allergy we
have; which drugs work best for our particular condition; and indeed,
checking our blood for early precursors of cancer. At the very least
doctors will have to get used to dealing with us online. I have a

end-user innovation, as it is called, turning medicine upside down, as
it has done to so many other industries, and if we continued to think
of medicine as a top-down business in which the doctor knows best. In
the past,
treatments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T12:27:11"></hs_TimeCode> have
too often been designed to treat the population rather than the
individual. For the patient, the change will be great in many ways, and
there will no doubt be some savings. For example, we can have many more
virtual appointments. As Eric Topol, who has written a book about this,
says:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13071154000440" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0001.htm#13071154000440">“I

hospital-acquired infections as well. Overall, however, it will vastly
increase costs because personalised medicine means not only more demand
but more expensive sorts of demand. That is bound to push up costs well
beyond what any pooled system can bear in terms of cross-subsidy,
whether from the rich to the poor or through
insurance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T12:27:53"></hs_TimeCode>. It
will undoubtedly raise ethical issues. If precise genomic diagnosis or
drug toxicity information is available to some individuals and not
others, it will put enormous strain on the budget of the NHS and the
principle of common access to it. There will then effectively
be  a form of rationing. Added to that, of course, is the
growing burden of us all living much longer, as the noble Lord, Lord
Filkin, said, and of having up to five conditions when we are old,
which I believe is the average, not to mention the obesity epidemic
which my noble friend Lord McColl mentioned.</hs_para>

is obvious that we face rising healthcare costs as a proportion of
household budgets. That is why it is vital to turn the NHS as far as
possible into an organisation that tries to drive down its costs in a
ruthless fashion. The Government have made a good start on this. The
NHS is on track to make £20 billion of efficiency savings by
2015 and, we hope, more beyond that. However, as many noble Lords have
said today, this will prove to be a drop in the ocean. Not even the
NHS’s most ardent champions would at the moment call it a
ruthless pursuer of cost-efficiency. It has none of the usual levers
such as competition or fear of losing business to other providers that
drive up efficiency and quality in the commercial world. No amount of
top-down diktat will substitute for those
trends<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T12:29:31"></hs_TimeCode>. To meet
the bottom-up challenge coming from patients and from technology,
health funding needs to experience a form of bottom-up reform. Sixty

course, when you consider the great changes of the past 60 years, it is
remarkable how the NHS has met the health needs of the nation, and done
so in a very cost-effective way. However, that does not mean that this

care funding faces three major pressures. Just 24 councils now offer
adult care for those with moderate needs, and national eligibility
standards will restrict this further. The cost of long-term 
<?notus-xml column=420?>care will expand significantly, with Ministers this week telling the

is a major challenge to the aim of a comprehensive, universal health
and care system. So what can be done? The truth is that if we want
good, comprehensive, universal care, we will have to find a way to pay
for it. The obvious route is taxation, whether direct or in the form of
a levy or giving tax benefits to private health insurance. Yet such new
taxes will be hard to sell to the public. Why? Because while the NHS
generally delivers good care for a reasonable cost, many patients feel
that social care is of a low quality. Others have witnessed
inefficiency and poor treatment in their local hospitals. They will not
be content to see taxes go up simply to pay for more of the same. Of
course, for more management consultants, not hospital consultants, that
would be fantastic. So we must demonstrate how we will improve our care

develop new skills and structures for workers throughout the National
Health Service. I have a personal interest, as my wife has been a
midwife and a tutor. She knows first-hand how better and up-to-date
training and career development for those on the front line can
transform patient care. However, many of our health career structures
and much of our training still seem stuck in the 19th century. From
care assistants to consultants, from matrons to health technologists,
we need to rethink career development in the health service totally.

reason we need to change how we develop our people is that technology
is radically shifting how patient needs are identified and treated, as
the noble Lord just mentioned, in everything from social care to heart
transplants. To take just one example, the Scripps Research Institute
is developing embedded sensors in the bloodstream to alert users if
they are at increased risk of heart attacks. Such advances create new
treatment routes for those seeking better health, which means that new
ways of offering care will be needed, such as advising people at risk

Turnberg:</Member></B> My Lords, this debate is extremely timely and I
congratulate the noble Lord on introducing it so well and on stealing
some of my best lines. It is hard to get away from the fact that we are
in for a rather prolonged period of constraint on public spending that
will inevitably impact on funding for health and social care. It cannot
be denied that we are falling behind as inflation in medical care runs
ahead of general inflation.</hs_para>

is a commonly held assumption that the NHS is a bottomless pit but that
is just too simplistic. During the years of relative plenty, when the
Labour Government dramatically increased funding, we saw a remarkable
improvement in care: waiting lists virtually disappeared; GPs could be
seen on the same day in most places; waits in A&amp;E departments came
down; patient satisfaction levels rose; and productivity, despite views
to the contrary, rose too. The number of operations and other
procedures rose by 50% during the decade starting in 2000 and hospital
lengths of stay fell by 27% from an average of 10.5 days to 7.7 days.
So money did talk but now, as we deal with the Nicholson challenge, we
are failing to keep up. We are seeing a rise in waiting lists and a
fall in staff numbers. The pips are squeaking and we are beginning to
see a fall in
standards.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000154" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0001.htm#13071154000154">So
how do we fill this funding gap? The Wanless report of a few years ago
suggested that we would need to find 10.6% of our GDP by 2021, while
John Appleby, in his report for the Nuffield Trust, suggested 
<?notus-xml column=424?>that in 50 years’ time we would need to put 20% of our GDP into
the NHS. Fifty-year predictions are just a little fraught but he said
it would be affordable—that is an important point—if our
total GDP increased threefold, illustrating the point that the better
off a country is, the bigger proportion of its GDP it can afford to put
into healthcare. We have not been short of ideas about how we might
fill the looming gap but few are free of problems. Doing nothing is
clearly not an option as we will just see a steady deterioration in
standards and quality with a public backlash, voter disillusionment and
a change of government, whoever is in
office.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0001.htm#13071154000155">That
leaves us with three options: become more efficient, find more money or
ration what we provide for patients. First, there are always
efficiencies in a system as huge as the NHS but there are limits and we
are pretty close to them now. So-called reconfiguration of hospitals is
a popular idea at the moment. Close a few and the community services
will pick up the bill for caring for the patients. I am all for
focusing specialised services in a few places, as it certainly saves
lives, but, unfortunately, it does not save money. I am all for closing
small, inefficient hospitals and moving money into community services,
but simply redistributing funds does not give us any gain.</hs_para>

agree here with my noble friend Lord Filkin but, in the face of the
enormous pressures building up, I really cannot see that even more
efficiency savings are sustainable for very long. As regards finding
more government money, I cannot see much prospect of that either, at
least in the short to medium term. It would mean taking a bigger slice
of the cake and leaving less for everything else, which would not be
very popular. Only when we manage to increase our GDP and reduce our
debt would we be able to consider taking a bigger slice of the cake.
Then we could look at limiting what we provide in the NHS; that is, we
could define a basic package of care but stop funding some types of
treatments. Again, that is not likely to be very popular and defining
which treatments should not be available in the NHS will always raise
hackles. As a way of controlling costs it was found to be pretty
ineffective in Oregon a few years
ago.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000157" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0001.htm#13071154000157">Then
there is the possibility of co-payments by patients—we have
heard about that. We have already broached that principle in the UK,
but experience elsewhere is not encouraging. When they tried it in
Germany, they saw a rise in the number of patients who avoided visiting
their doctors when they were ill or who failed to fill their
prescription. The impact of charges for care will have to be examined
very carefully if we are not to see a fall in the number of patients
who need care but who avoid getting it for financial
reasons.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000158" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0001.htm#13071154000158">At
the end of the day, we will have to choose between a number of
unappealing and potentially unpopular options, but one thing is
absolutely clear: doing nothing is not one of those options. It is
essential that we have a more open debate with the public about these
possibilities. A cross-party discussion is desperately needed, as many

the very beginning of this journey. A wonderful project which has come
out of the Open Data Institute here in London illustrates why data are
such an important part of this debate. In 201-12, the NHS in England
shelled out more than £400 million on statin drugs, from a total
drug budget of £12.2 billion. However, in collaboration with
Mastodon C, Open Health Care UK—a small start-up developed by a
programmer and a doctor—managed to look at every prescription
written for statins from every GP in England by using a dataset
provided by the Open Data Institute. They looked at the regional
patterns and discovered that, if doctors had prescribed the white label
version, they would have saved more than £200 million. The
variation is remarkable. Imagine the potential savings if this was
applied across many other classes of

Hollis of Heigham:</Member></B> My Lords, as we know, social care,
health and social security expenditure is being driven by the growing
number of the elderly. It accounts for two-thirds—£110
billion—of our welfare budget. As local authorities face 50%
cuts, we are none the less going to need 65% more hours of care from
the same number of working-age people in the next 15
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T12:56:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0001.htm#13071154000171">People
talk airily about the extra life expectancy since Beveridge’s
time—it was then five years after retirement; it is more than 20
years now. They argue that there should be a fixed proportion of adult
life for retirement—let us say 30%—and that the pension
age should rise accordingly, saving some £15 billion a
year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T12:56:36"></hs_TimeCode>. However,
the health and social care statistics should give us cause for thought.
Those extra years are not enjoyed as years of good health but are years
of chronic disability. At 65, we may enjoy a decade of good health,
followed by a decade of growing but chronic disability, such as
arthritis and diabetes, impairing our ability to walk, to reach, to see
and to hear. Finally, there are perhaps two to five years—this
has not changed much—of conditions involving heavy dependency,
including Alzheimer’s, with substantial personal care
needs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T12:57:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

life, therefore, are largely extra years of chronic disability, but it
is heavily class-specific. The better-off will live longer in good
health—and they include those commentators who seek to encourage
the raising of the state pension age—but for everyone else,
those extra years of life will be added to the years of chronic
disability. In my city, in two wards that are one mile apart, there is
11 years’ difference in life expectancy and 15 years’
difference in healthy-life 
<?notus-xml column=427?>expectancy. The gap is widening. It is deeply unfair to raise the state

released each year. Decent state pensions under the new Pensions Bill

courageous attitude to integrating hospital, primary and social care,
we can cope. Half of the growth of the older old is indeed due to
increased longevity, but half is due to the post-war baby boom. In a

securing this debate and on his excellent speech. In fact, there have
been many excellent speeches and, as a result, I have completely

interests, mainly
abroad.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000178" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0001.htm#13071154000178">The
core issue here is that we have an NHS designed and created in the
previous century that is trying to deal with the problems of this
century. We have an NHS that is focused on illness not prevention, that
separates GPs and primary care, that is designed to treat episodic
illnesses—heart attacks, infections and cancers that are not
chronic diseases—and we need a different sort of health service.
We need a massive change in the way that it is delivered, using
technology, using staff differently and changing the infrastructure. I
agree with the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, that that is a 
<?notus-xml column=428?>major change, and that it is the fundamental change that needs to be
done, but we can make a start on it. It is important that we have a
clear vision of what we want our health and social care system to look
like in the future. This debate is not just about funding. Using the
wrong model to deal with today’s problems is a recipe for
inefficiency. We are not alone. Every developed country has the same
issue. If we look across the Channel at, for example, France and
Germany—which, incidentally, spend 20% and 25% more than we
do—according to the United States Commonwealth Fund, they are
less efficient in how they do it than we are. So this is a common
problem. It is a big problem but we can make a start on
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000179" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0001.htm#13071154000179">There are
no simple solutions but let me mention two possible ones. First, the
most interesting study on waste in health systems comes from the United
States. It is estimated that 30% to 40% of expenditure in the health
system in the United States is waste. The biggest reason for that is
not overtreatment and the sort of things you would expect in America;
it is a failure to co-ordinate care. It is somebody with multiple
problems having to go to one doctor for this problem and to another
doctor for that one. It is a failure to co-ordinate that and having
repeated inputs into the system. It is also not getting the treatment
right first time. Those are the biggest impacts on waste. I suggest to
the Department of Health that it might wish to use the same methodology
to look at waste within the United Kingdom because I think we will see
a lot of
similarities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000180" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0001.htm#13071154000180">Paradoxically,
we need to focus on quality in order to manage costs. As people working
in industry will know, this is the way to do it. The Japanese guru,
Kano, talks about three levels of quality. The first level of quality
is doing it right first time—actually doing what is needed to
deal with the problem, making sure that if you are in hospital that the
X-ray or whatever is needed is done in time so that you do not have to
spend the rest of the following week there as well. The second level of
quality is doing the same thing but with cheaper inputs. The obvious
question in the NHS is: to what extent can things that are done today
by doctors and people working expensively be done by other people
within the system? And the third level of quality is adding something.
It is only that third level of quality that adds cost; the first two
save cost. We see it across industry and in the best examples in the
UK. Many people in the NHS know this and there are many isolated
examples. This could be the really big push that I believe is needed to
tackle many of these
issues.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000181" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0001.htm#13071154000181">The
second area, which I have touched on, is staffing. Reducing the drug
budget by 10% saves 1% of the NHS budget; reducing staffing by 10%
saves 6% or 7% of the NHS budget. We need to be much bolder and braver
in thinking about who does what within the NHS, particularly when we
are aware that new technology allows things to be done. We know how we
can do that well. There is plenty of evidence of task-shifting or
substitution, using people who are less trained and skilled but
properly supervised to do things, not least from the All-Party Group on
Global Health which I chair and which published a report looking at
this worldwide and demonstrating how this could be done.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=429?><hs_para UID="13071154000182" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0001.htm#13071154000182">So those are two areas
where I believe there is a great deal more that we
should be doing. Before we get too radical about trying to change the
financing system, we should be focusing on changing the NHS. In
conclusion, this debate needs to be about the NHS and the social care
system we need. There are no simple answers but there are many
promising leads. Political, NHS and social care leaders need to do much
more to lead and to win the arguments about the future with a sceptical
public. There is at the moment, I believe, no clearly articulated
vision from either Front Bench. We need one if the NHS and social care
are going to continue to serve the UK population effectively in the
21st
century.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_11_PT_1/F89E990880B05212A68A7606D3D69D8FFF788A95" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 11 July 2013">Thursday,

for 10 years’ time should be ignored. If you predicted
backwards, you would find that you were spending negative sums of money
30 years ago. NHS growth has been very uneven. The NHS grew
from 3.5% of GDP to 4.5% over 30 years and then from 4.5% to 9% in 20
years, the fastest growth being since 1997. We have been accelerating
growth and we did that because of the determination of the Labour
Government to increase the proportion of GDP spent on health. There was
a target and that target was achieved. GDP growth was good at that
time. GDP growth will not resume at anything like the level we had up
to 2007. We will have much slower GDP growth with much more attention
paid to reducing the size of the state’s share in total
spending. We spend up to 48% now and we are going to reduce that to 44%
by 2017, but once upon a time we spent only 36%. We will have to reduce
it to something like that, and within that smaller share we will have
to find money for the NHS. Productivity will have to grow. I must
disagree with my noble friend Lord Turnberg. Productivity did not grow
between 1997 and 2010. As the King’s Fund report shows, it fell
by minus 0.2% per year. Between 2011 and 2015, it will grow by 5%. That
is not my number; it is the King’s Fund’s
number.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13071154000185" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0001.htm#13071154000185">What
is to be done? The first thing has to do with universality, which is
one characteristic. The noble Baroness, Lady Boothroyd, was quite
right. How do we ration this to only people who are entitled? When I
arrived in 1965 I was given a card by the NHS with my number on it and
I was told I had to show it. Nobody has ever asked me for the card. Why
can we not have that very simple thing? The Labour Party abandoned the
idea of an identity card. It would be very simple to have our NHS
number, which exists somewhere in the ether, and to be asked to show it
whenever we go to  the doctor. That would sort out the tourists
from the citizens. That is one
thing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000186" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0001.htm#13071154000186">Secondly,
we have to make people aware of what they are getting. My biggest worry
about the NHS  is that people are not aware of how much they
are costing the organisation. If we are spending, say, £2,000
per capita, give everyone something like an 
<?notus-xml column=430?>airline loyalty card containing 2,000 points and say, “These are
your points for this year”. Every time you used the NHS, you
would be shown how many points had been deducted. If you missed a GP
appointment, it would cost you twice as much as going to that
appointment. No one would need to pay anything, but this would make
people aware that there are costs for what they do. As people in middle
age typically will not need treatment, they would accumulate points
over a lifetime so that they could finally spend those points when they
needed them. You could have a lifetime budget of shadow points. This
would be very good for people. Since I do not have much more time to
speak, I think I can sit
down.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_11_PT_1/3B35F743386E1F75DE350D850F66D9E420B24501" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 11 July 2013">Thursday,

subject of the debate, the future funding of health, and the very
objective and fair explanation by the noble Lord, Lord Patel, of the

fact: very unusually, we have had a social experiment in paying for the
National Health Service. When the previous Labour Government
substantially increased health expenditure, which was a very good
decision, they paid for it by increasing the national insurance
contribution. Far from being unpopular, that was an extremely popular
decision.</hs_parafo>

we have to take the next step, which is to break down the
Treasury’s reluctance to earmark taxation and have on
everyone’s tax form what is spent on the National Health Service
out of their taxation contribution. They can break it down further into
what comes straight from tax and what comes from national insurance.
Most people in this country have felt for many decades that their
national insurance contribution pays for the National Health Service.
Many people are arguing for a greater contributory element in our
social financing. The NHS provides a wonderful vehicle for that; it is
popular and people are prepared to contribute more. If we had earmarked
taxes on our tax forms and if we then raised national insurance
contributions, all that would be seen for what it was on the tax form.
In my view, that would gradually shift the national insurance
contribution and it would be seen to be the mechanism of funding, but
you would still need a taxation

suggestion, and it could be done initially to simply explain the

Graham. I, too, add my  
<?notus-xml column=433?>congratulations to the noble Lord, Lord Patel, on securing this very
timely debate. Why do I say timely? As so many other noble Lords have
said today, it is an opportunity to look at some of the underlying
causes of the escalating costs of healthcare and what can be done about
it. The National Audit Office recently released figures showing that
30% of all non-emergency hospital admissions are avoidable. With
resource inefficiency such as that alongside the pressures from our
ageing population, technological advances in healthcare and increasing
public expectations of the system—we have heard so much about
these today—it is clear to me that standing still and having
more of the same is not an option, particularly in a prolonged era of
less public
money.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000208" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0001.htm#13071154000208">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T13:23:35"></hs_TimeCode>

want to focus my remarks on the ways in which the existing £120
billion budget could be better spent, fully recognising that this is
only part of a much wider debate. The Select Committee received
overwhelming evidence that a radically new system was needed with a
funding model designed to ensure that health and social care funding is
aligned so that it incentivises preventative care, early diagnosis and
intervention, and active management of long-term conditions, thereby
avoiding worsening health and the unnecessary use of acute hospital
stays—with the home, in essence, becoming the hub of
care<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T13:25:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000210" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0001.htm#13071154000210">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T13:25:03"></hs_TimeCode>

particularly to have older people with long-term conditions receiving
good joined-up primary care, community care, social care and effective
out-of-hours services; that is, a health and social care system that
works well 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. I think we would all agree
that we do not see that at the moment. This would be designed to shift
funding from acute and emergency services, which currently consume more
than half of the NHS’s budget, and allow for more investment in
community and social care.</hs_para>

parties, to consider more fundamental changes in the run-up to the next

British people, who understandably fear changes to the local hospital
arrangements on which they rely. However, it is a conversation in which
we, as parliamentarians, need to engage with the public openly and
honestly, as many noble Lords have said today. I, too, was very
interested in the recent findings of the King’s Fund and Ipsos
MORI deliberative event, which the noble Lord, Lord Patel, referred to
at the beginning. It is very interesting to see how little appetite
there was for the charging of clinically necessary care. When the
former Health Minister, my honourable friend Paul Burstow, was looking
at ways in which we could use more widely the resources that we and the
wider community have, he put it very succinctly. He wrote

we will not forget that patient pathways are the most cost-effective
and care-effective way of treating people in the future. However, we
need to think about prevention being better than cure, as was said by
the noble Baroness, Lady Tyler. Public health is defined as the science
and art of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting
health  
<?notus-xml column=435?>through the organised efforts and informed choices of society, public
and private organisations, communities and individuals. This requires a
change in the culture of the population served to a health and
well-being approach to life and a personal commitment to living a

McColl<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T13:30:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000217" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0001.htm#13071154000217">Changing
the culture of the NHS is an even more important issue. The prime focus
must be on the principle that all aspects of public health are centred
on the personal pathways of the population and the provision of health
and social care given through those pathways to a healthy population.
Changes must be made to the culture of the delivery of health and
social care towards those who live independently, supported where
necessary by expert professional teams that are educated in the
delivery of holistic care to meet mental, physical and emotional needs
within the community. Hospitals should be required only for the
diagnostics, treatment and research that cannot be delivered in the
community. To make all these changes, outstanding leadership skills are
required. This can be achieved only by an open and honest approach to
the population which helps them to understand that to live longer,
healthier lives, changes have to be applied through a much more active
and aggressive approach to the prevention of disease and the promotion
of health. These changes must be assisted and supported by expert
clinicians from all health and social care professions who utilise the
good of what is in place while identifying the large gaps that exist.
They must make those good not only by correcting the education and
training of the workforce but by engaging the assistance of families

communities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000218" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0001.htm#13071154000218">The
education and training needs of the NHS social care workforce need to
be radically examined to ensure that the overarching focus of care
delivery in this country is public health-supported by the treatment of
disease. This strategy requires a refocusing of the distribution of
funding towards these aims. Florence Nightingale once said that
hospital beds should be reduced in London. Perhaps we should look at
the way in which our hospital beds are used and ensure that hospital
services are cost-effective and care-effective within the framework of
the patient pathways determined by the health and social care teams.
This should be done to support patient pathways in a seamless way from
diagnosis through to treatment. In turn, we must utilise the support of

too, thank the noble Lord, Lord Patel, for his opening remarks, but
also for allowing us to debate one of the key social issues that we
will face over the next few
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T13:33:52"></hs_TimeCode>. I warm to
the noble Lord’s optimism, although there is no doubt that the
NHS is in the midst of an unprecedented financial challenge. The supply
of funding is not keeping pace with the growing rate of demand for
healthcare. More people need care and they want it to be better than it
has been before, but we know that growing pressures on finance could
impact on the quality and experience of patient care. As Sir David
Nicholson said today, hospitals are staring down the barrel of having
to cut doctors and nurses from their employment, actions that could
lead to another Mid-Staffordshire scandal unless the NHS radically
reforms. I know that my noble friend Lord Desai warns us, I suspect
with good cause, to be wary of long-term financial projections.
However, there seems to be a general consensus around the work of the
Nuffield Trust, which says that cost pressures on the NHS are likely to
grow by around 4% a year up to 2021-22 due to the growing demand for
healthcare to meet the needs of a population that is ageing, growing in
size and experiencing more chronic
disease<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T13:35:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

in the impact of social care. There is no doubt, looking at public
sector finances, that local authorities have borne the heavy brunt of
the reductions. As adult social care is the largest part of
discretionary spend within local government, it has inevitably been
affected. A&amp;E services were under the cosh this last winter. There
can be no doubt that one of the main reasons for this was a reduction
in social care provision and in the additional burden that our carers
have had to face because of the reduction in support services available
to them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T13:35:58"></hs_TimeCode>. Sir
David Nicholson’s response was to call for a dramatic
reconfiguration of services, including the centralisation of specialist
services. I should like to put that point to the noble Earl, Lord Howe.
Will Ministers support radical reconfiguration of services? So far, we
have seen little sign of that
occurring<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T13:36:23"></hs_TimeCode>. Will
the Minister also ensure that clinical commissioning groups get on with
approving radical changes instead of, as seems to be the case at the

services?</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13071154000223" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0001.htm#13071154000223">On
that reconfiguration of services, I want to ask the Minister about
today’s decision of the Competition Commission to reject the
proposed merger of two hospital trusts in Dorset. That must be the most
ridiculous decision that has ever been taken in relation to the
necessary reconfiguration of services. His right honourable friend the
Secretary of State has spent his time in office going around attacking
the NHS. It would be nice to think that the Secretary of State might
issue a mite of criticism of the Competition Commission for what it has
done. The signal this will give to the health service is that
reconfiguration of services will not be allowed because of the
Competition Commission’s ludicrous intervention. I hope that the
noble Earl will be able to say something positive about what Ministers
will do to stop the Competition Commission doing this in the future. It
will be impossible for services to be reconfigured if in Dorset, a
small county, two small district general hospitals are prevented from
merging. This is very serious

more optimistic<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T13:37:57"></hs_TimeCode>
than some noble Lords. My noble friend Lord Graham, in his marvellous
speech, will also recall, as I do, the beloved and late Lord Donald
Bruce, who was Nye Bevan’s PPS. He sat just behind the noble
Earl when Nye Bevan introduced the NHS Act 1946, when the Commons was
using the Lords as its Chamber. Nye Bevan always said that the NHS will
always be with us as long as people want it so. It is my contention

want it to continue with us.</hs_para>

course, it is clear that muddling through is unlikely to be feasible,
and spending more will always have to be an option. My noble friend
Lady Hollis made a very powerful case for redistributing priorities.
The noble Lord, Lord Owen, argued for earmarked taxation. Some noble
Lords have argued that higher spending on health and social care should
not be seen solely as a debt or a burden but as an improvement and an
investment in the economy and the economic and health well-being of
people’s lives. I have no doubt that the public will continue to
expect the NHS to be a tax-funded system free at the point of need.

extraordinary—£3 billion has already been spent on the
stupidest reorganisation the health service has ever gone through and
much more money will be wasted in the future. Secondly, in central
government there is heavily centralised procurement. I welcome that.
The Government are not allowing individual government departments to
procure separately. We should do the same for the health service. We
cannot afford to have 500 different organisations procuring. Thirdly, I

is much to be gained. The shift to prevention offers much. The need to
integrate health and social care is becoming broadly accepted
everywhere. People need to shift from being passive consumers of care
to active partners in their own health. The system needs to become much
more open and transparent. Above all, I put my money on innovation. In
this country we have fantastic scientists who are inventing new medical
treatment and equipment day after day but we are very slow to use that
in everyday practice. The academic health science networks, NHS
England’s specialist commissioning facility and the assurance
that NICE guidance is aggressively adopted would give us a foundation
for an efficient health service where innovation is adopted quickly and
the benefits are seen not just in the quality of patient care but also
because the global pharmaceutical industry will see that the NHS
continues to be a strong place in which to invest in the future. We
must want to get to where health and wealth run closely together. If we
can do that, the future of the NHS is a good
one.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_11_PT_1/F0D3EF6FCE9D7B977F73FA35DA05976D61E39F25" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 11 July 2013">Thursday,

systems across the world are facing huge and very similar challenges.
The noble Lord, Lord Filkin, quoted a number of sobering and
inescapable statistics. Our population is ageing. The number of people
aged over 65 in England is set to increase by 50% by 2030 and the
number of over-85s is set to double. New treatments and technologies,
while very welcome, often increase costs. Of particular importance,
more people are living longer with long-term conditions. There are now
15 million people in England living with a long-term condition and that
number is rising fast. By 2018, an estimated 2.9 million people will
have more than two long-term conditions, up from 1.9 million
in 2008.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000232" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0001.htm#13071154000232">More
people need to be supported to manage their conditions well and this
means, as my noble friend Lady Tyler and many noble Lords have
identified, that the NHS and social care need to find ways of working
more closely together. This includes, as the noble Baroness, Lady
Emerton, reminded us, managing older people’s care proactively
to help keep them out of hospital, as well as ensuring that the care
and support people need is ready and waiting for them when they are
ready to leave hospital, along the seamless pathways she talked about.
It also means making sure that the NHS is there for us all in an

to protect health spending in 2015-16. We are setting up a £3.8

delivery—to which I will return in a moment. We are providing
better and more proactive care for the vulnerable elderly. We are
introducing a new national minimum eligibility threshold to protect
access to social care services—again a topic to which I will

billion in 2015–16. All this investment will go towards
delivering improving services and boosting integration. Although
funding continues to rise, meeting rising demand represents a huge
challenge. The noble Lord, Lord Kakkar, was absolutely right. Greater
efficiency is vital here and I am pleased to say the NHS is already
delivering significant efficiencies. Thanks to the dedicated and
hard-working NHS staff, the service delivered £5.8 billion of
savings during 2011–12 and approximately £5.1 billion for
2012–13. This means that the NHS is on track to deliver up to

Rix, and the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, spoke about the importance of

2015 to support social care services and we have committed another
£0.5 billion since. We calculated that this would be enough to
maintain services if councils achieved 3% efficiency which was an
assumption in line with the projections of The King’s Fund, the
Local Government Association and the Association of Directors of Adult
Social Services. This included money transferred by the NHS to support
social care services that benefit health.</hs_para>

in which to deliver efficiency is to create a genuinely joined-up
service, correcting the failure to co-ordinate care that the noble
Lord, Lord Crisp, spoke about so well. With some of the biggest users
of the NHS being those who also use social care services, we need to
make fundamental reforms to the system to ensure better integration
between services. In delivering these efficiencies to date, the NHS and
social care have clearly made huge strides in working more closely
together and getting more value from the public money that they
receive. Too often, people still fall through the cracks. The 
<?notus-xml column=440?>changes announced in last month’s spending round represent a
significant opportunity to do more; rather than continue simple
transfers from the NHS to social care, the spending round announced a
£3.8 billion pooled health and social care budget. This is a
radical step forward in reducing the silos of separate local budgets
and will be a powerful driver of local integration. The aim is that the
pooled fund will be directed at activities that have a clear benefit
across both the health and care systems, and it will be given only on
the basis that services are commissioned jointly and seamlessly between
the local NHS and local

and well-being boards, as well as being the local hub for planning
service provision, will play a significant role in spending pooled
budgets. To access this funding, local partners will need to agree a
collective plan for how it should be used, including distribution
within the health and care system. Plans will cover how areas will
protect social care services; achieve seven-day working in social care
and health to support patients being discharged and prevent people
being unnecessarily admitted at weekends, which is an abiding problem;
ensure better data sharing between councils and the NHS, with a
requirement for the NHS number to be used as a unique identifier; and
ensure a joint approach to assessments and care and support
planning<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T13:51:30"></hs_TimeCode>. Some

number of noble Lords have drawn attention to the wider picture and

significant funding shortfall by 2020-21. I am not sure that it would
be wise of me to ignore those predictions, as the noble Lord, Lord
Desai, sought to advocate. Clearly, we are experiencing the biggest
financial challenge that the NHS has faced. Work to set the NHS on a
sustainable footing in the long term has already started. I have

NHS England will lead that work to build on the gains and efficiency in

make the decisions that it thinks are in the best interests of
patients, which is why we set up NHS England to work with local

some good examples of where that has happened. Evidence from the four
whole-place community budgets suggests that savings from integration
could be very substantial. In their business cases, the pilots that we
have run suggest that the net savings that could be achieved over five
years are: Cheshire West and Chester; £26 million; Greater

to get ahead of these trends and, indeed, influence them. As my noble

start in delivering efficiency savings, but it is important to take on
board the fact that savings in the first two years have been reliant on

changing needs and expectations. As lifestyles, society, technology and

charging for or privatising services. Local empowerment is the key
here. It is not fruitful or wise to go for

respond to the needs of local people. Decisions about the future design
of services need to be made as part of an ongoing conversation between
commissioners, providers, local authorities, and the communities they
serve. Clinical quality and local need should be at the heart of those
decisions. As the noble Lord knows, we have made it clear that we
expect proposals for significant change to meet four tests. There
should be strong public and patient engagement; the proposals should

we are debating today is the health of one of the great pillars of our
democracy and liberty; namely, our legal system and the way citizens
may benefit from or challenge laws which, as this House knows well, are
painstakingly established for the good of the community. Access to
justice is every bit as vital to our societal health as access to
health services. In an ideal and affluent world, the need to fund legal
services would be seen to be as compelling as the NHS and as deserving
of ring-fencing, albeit with controls to prevent malicious or frivolous
use. Our courts are like the NHS but with a far older pedigree. Our
justice system has been the admiration of the world and a model for
emerging democracies elsewhere. This is the country that litigants come
to, if they can afford it, to seek justice that they feel is denied to
them at home. This is the country that sends judges and barristers
overseas to help new countries establish a decent legal system. I 
<?notus-xml column=445?>need hardly point out, in this week of Middle East chaos, how crucial

regulatory objectives for the legal profession, such as consumer
protection, the rule of law and a strong, diverse and independent legal
profession, are a fundamental pillar of the Legal Services Act 2007 and
the basis upon which successful regulation of the legal profession is
measured. My overarching concern with the proposals set out in the
Ministry of Justice consultation, Transforming Legal Aid, is that they
will undermine these objectives to such an extent that regulators and
lawyers will not be able to mitigate the risks that arise as a result.
Moreover, since the LSA is primary legislation, I consider that the
Ministry of Justice should not pursue a policy which either is, or
risks being, inconsistent with it without full parliamentary debate. I
ask the Minister to provide that opportunity by giving the House the
chance to debate primary or other legislation before such profound
changes are

review, which it is proposed will be cut back, enables every citizen to
challenge officialdom. Even when the chances of a successful JR are

they must stay within the legal boundaries and observe human rights;
otherwise, they will be brought to book. Any diminution of this, no
matter how severe our national financial situation, must be treated
with the utmost seriousness. That is because everything we do,
especially in this House, is built on our centuries-old acceptance of a
functioning rule of law that is there to defend and protect all of us.

the media of the notion of greedy lawyers and litigants drunk on public

choking off challenge and redress. How are people going to be able to
challenge medical negligence, housing problems and treatment in prison?

Government need to save money. Here we are talking about £220
million a year, although some say that the sum does not take account of
recent falls in the outlay on legal aid. This sum pales when one thinks
of, say, expenditure of taxpayers’ money on council credit cards
and failed NHS IT systems, or Apple and Vodafone not paying tax. Shave
a little off HS2, and we would have it, although the profession 
<?notus-xml column=446?>has in fact come up with other ways of saving money that would render
unnecessary the Ministry of Justice proposals. It is not helpful to
compare our legal aid expenditure with that of other countries because
they have inquisitorial systems whereby the work equivalent to that
carried out by our barristers is done by officials before the court
hearing. Those costs have to be on the state balance sheet somewhere.
They could be cut by putting more of the legwork of an offence trial on
to other organs of the state. They could be cut by reducing the outflow
of new criminal offences from the legislature. They could be cut by
removing some children’s cases from the criminal system and
shifting them elsewhere. The organisation Justice has calculated that
releasing around 6,500 prisoners from custody every year would make up
the necessary savings in the justice system. We need to take a holistic
view of expenditure. We need to know whether the ministry has
calculated the additional costs that would be incurred if its proposals
were to be implemented, quite apart from the broader balance of social
benefit and detriment. I am not convinced that the deep calculations,
allowing for the slowing down of the legal system and more failed cases
and appeals, have been carried out or revealed. The knock-on effects
may well wipe out the
savings<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:13:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

children and mental health, but I hope that the Minister will bring
forward a proper impact assessment of what the cuts will really save
and what they will not save. There is a clear risk to the most
vulnerable and even the middle class in society. A threshold of
£37,000 per household is unsubtle and will lead to defendants
not having equality of arms when representing themselves against the
police and a barrister acting for the Crown on the other side. Nor is
there provision in the proposals for vulnerable defendants who simply
cannot cope on their own. What of the impact of cross-examination on
his alleged victims by an accused acting in person, about which we read
so much in the media? Prisoners are to lose legal aid in relation to
what happens in prison. The consultation is possibly over-optimistic in
stating that the prisons complaints system can replace legally aided
advice for prisoners. I have heard estimates that the complaints system
is as expensive, if not more so, as using a solicitor.</hs_para>

especially hard hit by the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of
Offenders Act, known in the trade as LASPO, which commenced the
restrictions in legal aid. This is the second bite of the cherry. The
impact of that first Act has not yet been observed, although we know
that there has been a 27% increase in disputed cases concerning
children. Social welfare law and family law have become largely
ineligible for aid. Some 57% of those affected are women, who bring 73%
of the education cases and, a few years ago, formed 62% of the
applicants for family legal aid. It pains me to say it, but women may
be less able to represent themselves than men and lawyers in general.
In sum, the interests of the public could be damaged in that there may
not be competent representation, and the criminal justice system may
fail to convict the guilty and acquit the innocent.</hs_para>

according to the consultation, will be the introduction of
price-competitive tendering. Giving out contracts based on cost alone
removes any 
<?notus-xml column=447?>incentive on the providers to exceed the minimum standards of service.
Going for the cheapest ignores the reality that defence lawyers have to
work with the individuals they represent; they have to work at weekends
and be ready to deal, by definition, with the weakest members of
society and cope with their wider problems—rather like the NHS,
which we have just debated. Tendering for this legal work cannot be an
accurate or exact measure because the length and complexity of cases
are unknown. Currently, lawyers in the local community have experience
and reputations that are known to the local police and courts. Mergers
of small firms may destroy that, along with the availability of
specialist skills, for example, in human trafficking or war crimes
which are not to be found in the large new corporate pile-them-high and
sell-them-cheap providers. The supermarkets and haulage companies who
will hold themselves out to do this are unlikely to send the
appropriate cases to barristers, thereby reducing the calibre of
advocacy and future judicial material. Once they have secured the work

prices.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000269" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0002.htm#13071154000269">I am
particularly concerned about the tapered fee. We are all innocent until
proven guilty and have the right to plead innocence and face trial.
That is not inefficient; it is the rule of law. There must be no
influences brought on a decision to plead guilty, such as a higher fee
for the adviser or the inability of a solicitor to conduct a trial if
the client were to plead innocent. The client, even now, should be
inquiring of his or her representative as to whether that
representative has any interest in an early guilty

irrational to propose, as the MoJ has done, to reduce fees on a daily

necessary, the jury may take time, and the legal arguments and
cross-examination may be complex. Let us imagine a health system in
which the longer the operation takes, the less the surgeon will be
paid. We should either have fee cuts of 17%, as proposed, or PCT
interference in the market. We do not need both. If there is to be a
17% cut in fees, firms should be left to work out how they will manage.

way.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000271" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0002.htm#13071154000271">What
about the barristers whom I regulate? Criminal lawyers earn a great
deal less than MPs and have to bear their own expenses. The Bar has
worked hard to improve diversity but there are now only 400 pupillages

fear that the profession will become exclusively the domain of white,
middle-class, self-financing advocates because young people will have
no assurance of even a modest legally-aided income as they set out at
the Bar. I do not see how they can survive with the education debts
they are chalking up these days, not to mention the cost of qualifying
as a lawyer. No wonder social mobility is less than it used to be. I do
not wish to read any more exhortations from diversity tsars to increase
the number of young people from underprivileged backgrounds in the

Faulks:</Member></B> My Lords, I begin by congratulating the noble
Baroness, Lady Deech, on securing this debate on these recent and very
controversial proposals. I declare an interest as a barrister regulated
by the board she chairs. Although barristers are not naturally
enthusiastic about regulation, the Bar Standards Board has won
increasing respect from practitioners. I wish that I could say the same
about the LSB, the
super-regulator<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:22:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000275" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0002.htm#13071154000275">On
3 December 2012, I spoke in another debate initiated by the noble
Baroness about what can be described only as the overregulation of the
legal profession. I am glad to say that the Government have now
announced that they have embarked on a wholesale review of legal
service regulations following concerns over their complexity and the
unnecessary burdens that they place on the sector. That debate clearly
had some effect, and I hope that what is said today in your
Lordships’ House will similarly cause the Government to think
carefully<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:22:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000276" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0002.htm#13071154000276">I
also declare an interest as a barrister who, while not often paid by
legal aid, has experience of the way that the system works, has acted
with legal aid and has sat as a recorder in the Crown Court. When
proposals are born out of a need to save money, there is a significant
risk that cuts will be made in rather a crude way and that the legal
system as a whole will suffer long-term damage. These proposals have
met with extraordinarily widespread criticism, much of it admittedly
from interested parties. However, it seems to me—and I may be
alone here in believing this, or almost alone—that there is some
good sense at the heart of what the Government suggest in the
introduction of PCT. Indeed, in March 2010, the previous Government
produced a Green Paper that said, in relation to the restructuring and
the delivery of the criminal defence services, among other
things:</hs_para>

criminal defence service is highly fragmented, with a large number of
small suppliers and relatively few large suppliers … We believe
that these market trends are not sustainable. Therefore we believe a
future tendering process would ensure a more consolidated market, with
a smaller number of more efficient suppliers, required to undertake the
full range of the services we
need”.</hs_quote><hs_para UID="13071154000277" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0002.htm#13071154000277">I
therefore expect that the party opposite will applaud at least the
concept that these proposals contain for the restructuring of legal
services.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13071154000278" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0002.htm#13071154000278">It
is of course
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:24:26"></hs_TimeCode>important that
any restructuring does not result in a degradation of the quality of
justice or its availability. I, like the noble Baroness, welcome the
Secretary of State’s announcement that he will carry out a
further consultation before finalising his plans. He has also said that
he is looking again at the important question of choice of lawyer. I
look forward to seeing precisely how he reflects this question of
choice in any amended plans. I admit that I find it rather an elusive
concept. Of course, it is desirable that anyone charged with an offence
should be represented by lawyers in whom they have confidence. However,
choice is unlikely to be an absolute matter. Indeed, I reject the
suggestion that those charged with criminal offences are incapable of
making informed choices. Some of them are quite experienced consumers.
I can remember, on a couple of occasions when I was a young barrister,
being introduced to a defendant by my instructing solicitor, to be met
with the comment, “I do not want him”. That, I think, was
an expression of freedom of choice in terms of
representation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:25:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000279" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0002.htm#13071154000279">Some
of the personal attacks on the Lord Chancellor are highly regrettable.
I also find the suggestion that lawyers in this area are overpaid and
are, in effect, milking the system unfair and unsubstantiated. It is
the habit of all Governments to publish rather misleading figures about
earnings at the top end by practitioners in legal aid. These figures
never tell the whole truth. The average earnings of a criminal
practitioner are extremely modest. It is vital that we preserve the
possibility of lawyers doing this important work. What is at stake is
not just the standard of living of lawyers, which may be regarded by
some as of secondary importance. It is much more important that we
maintain the quality of justice for which this country rightly has an
extremely high

does not permit me to examine the other proposals in detail. I can say,
however, that the alarming increase in expenditure on legal aid by
prisoners deserves careful examination. Some of this is explicable by
the fallout from IPP sentences, abolished by this Government; I have
considerable personal experience of the litigation arising from this.
However, I understand that these cases, concerned with actual
detention, will still receive legal aid. When it is for trivial
disputes, I have some sympathy with the Government that they can
properly be resolved by the alternative remedies. Similarly, judicial
review, vital though the availability of this remedy is for
constitutional reasons, does not mean that the availability of legal
aid is not subject to some careful scrutiny. I found the evidence of
the Lord Chancellor to the Justice Committee on this point

Committee on Human Rights, of which I am a member, which is looking at
the human rights elements in these proposed changes. I do not think
that these changes warrant the wholesale condemnation that they have

immigration removal centres; many more were detained in prisons.

draw your Lordships’ attention to some recent decisions of our
highest court in claims that could not in practice have been brought

<?notus-xml column=451?>on the Home Secretary’s ability to detain individuals using
immigration powers. The Supreme Court held that the Secretary of State
was applying an unlawful policy when detaining foreign national
prisoners, in that the real policy entailed a presumption in favour of

decision of the House of Lords in Simms in 2000, which held that Prison
Service policy and instructions preventing prisoners from having oral
interviews with journalists, even on questions of whether they had been
wrongly convicted, were unlawful. That claimant would no longer be
eligible for legal aid, as he will be excluded under the prison law
reforms. Thirdly, in Al-Skeini in 2007, the claim arose from the deaths
of six Iraqi civilians and the brutal maltreatment of one of them,
causing his death. Each of the deceased was killed, and the
maltreatment was inflicted by members of the British Armed Forces. That

his evidence to the Justice Committee in the other place on 3 July
2013, the Lord Chancellor admitted that the changes are, at least in
part, ideological in nature. He asserted that matters relating to
conditions in prison should be dealt with through a complaints system
and a prisoners’ ombudsman. However, judicial review is a remedy
of last resort: only those cases that have arguably not been

Marks of Henley-on-Thames:</Member></B> My Lords, I add my
congratulations to those of noble Lords who have already spoken to the
noble Baroness, Lady Deech, on securing the debate and the way in which
she opened it. I also declare an interest as a practising barrister. My
noble friend Lord Phillips of Sudbury, who is unfortunately unable to

his professional life, he wishes that he had been able to contribute to

the debate on the gracious Speech, I suggested that there was a need
for a fresh settlement between the Government and the professions over
legal aid. I am bound to say that the past few weeks have more than
ever convinced me of that. The Government and the professions appear at
times to be in a hostile stand-off. It is bad for both the Government
and the professions, but it is also bad for justice and bad for the
public’s confidence in our system of
justice.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000292" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0002.htm#13071154000292">The
starting points are that we recognise the need to save money in this
area and that the professions must recognise that the Government do not
owe them 
<?notus-xml column=452?>a living. However, the Government must accept that the professions are
not simply special pleading but have genuine and justified concerns
about access to justice for the many who need, but who cannot afford to
pay, lawyers. Of course, they include the most vulnerable in our
society, but we should not forget that they also include millions of
ordinary people who can meet their day-to-day expenses but cannot
afford the sudden demands of expensive legal costs for them or their
families.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13071154000293" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0002.htm#13071154000293">A
new settlement can be achieved only by dialogue, and it is therefore
welcome that the Government have already been responsive to the
consultation, particularly over the issue of choice of lawyer. For
myself, I regard the right of a defendant to choose his lawyer as
fundamental for three reasons. First, it is wrong for the state which
prosecutes a case to choose the lawyer on the other side. Secondly, it
is essential for a defendant to have confidence in his lawyer. That
brings practical benefits in sensible and early guilty pleas where
appropriate. Thirdly, choice in this area is a simple matter of
liberty<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:36:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000294" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0002.htm#13071154000294">I
confine myself in this short speech to making a handful of points about
the Government’s proposals. Much of the controversy has of
course centred on PCT. I suggest that there is much force in the
argument that competition based on price rather than quality risks
lowering standards. If we set only a minimum standard, we will get
advocacy of a minimum standard—the so-called race to the bottom.
Tendering should be based on quality as much as on price, and that
should be made explicit in the application process. A precedent for
that is to be found in the Health and Social Care Act, where, on
persuasion, substituting competition on quality against a tariff for
the original proposal for competition on price significantly improved
the Government’s
proposals<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:37:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000295" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0002.htm#13071154000295">The
Government have invited the Bar Council to help to design a system of
tendering based on quality. It is a matter of regret that the Bar
Council has not accepted that invitation. Exactly that kind of dialogue
is what I consider to be important. When the noble Baroness, Lady
Deech, next sees the Bar Council she might consider taking that back to
suggest a change of view in that area.</hs_para>

concern is the number of providers and their distribution. I believe
that a reduction from 1,600 to only 400 providers is far too great. It
will badly affect smaller firms and reduce the possibility of both
choice and competition.</hs_para>

has been drawn to the problems in multi-handed cases, where a number of
defendants may need separate representation. However, I suggest that
those problems could be addressed in part if we reconsidered how far
the existing professional rules on conflicts of interest are working in
accordance with the public interest. Should it not be possible for
solicitors in the same firm to act for defendants in legally aided
criminal cases where there are conflicts between the defendants’
accounts but no financial conflicts of interest for the firms
concerned? Of course, there would have to be safeguards in such a
system to ensure that confidentiality was maintained, but barristers in
the same chambers have always appeared against each 
<?notus-xml column=453?>other and the distinction between self-employed barristers and partners
in the firm is not, in my view, an overwhelming
obstacle.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000298" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0002.htm#13071154000298">However,
the present proposals risk creating advice and representation deserts
where no appropriate legal advice or representation is available. This
the Government have recognised, but the proposals also risk creating
specialism deserts. The danger of advice deserts could be addressed by
increasing the number of providers in more sparsely populated areas.
The specialism issue is more difficult. I fear it may become impossible
to find solicitors specialising in particular areas of crime—for
example, fraud or sex offences—throughout large areas of the
country. Correspondingly, specialist lawyers may find that work in
their fields is not financially supportable, so specific measures are
needed to allow specialists to practise.</hs_para>

briefly to civil legal aid. The proposals on judicial review are
claimed by the Government to assist in ensuring that applicants’
lawyers will be paid only for cases in which they get permission, which
will filter out weak cases. However, in practice many of the strongest
cases are settled at the pre-permission stage where the body, often a
local authority, admits fault and settles. Why should we not fund cases
such as those, especially since the Government are rightly committed to
encouraging early and economical settlement of litigation? The proposal
to deny an oral permission hearing in all cases deemed to be totally
without merit, while it may be acceptable in cases where there is legal
representation, is entirely unacceptable in cases where a judge is
needed to tease out the applicant’s case on an oral
hearing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000300" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0002.htm#13071154000300">Finally,

why the residency test may be at least a relevant consideration in some
cases, but given the examples set out by the noble and learned Lord,
Lord Irvine, it is very difficult to see  that it can be
imposed justly in a blanket way. If the Government are not prepared to
reverse this proposal, I urge them at least to preserve a discretion.
There are other areas for consideration, but I look forward to hearing
the Government’s

continued availability of legal aid for people at the point of
repossession, civil legal aid was cut under LASPO for debt advice. The
advice and justice systems will inevitably feel the impact of this
cutback. First, the free advice and pro bono legal advice sectors will
not be able to cope with the rise in demand. I know that the Money
Advice Trust is very concerned that services which do not provide legal
advice, such as the National Debtline, will see this upsurge but no
longer have anybody to whom they can successfully refer clients at the
point at which the advice needed is legal advice and beyond the
expertise of general debt advisers. What assessment have the Government
made of the likely increase in demand for debt advice leading to legal
advice, and what do they consider will be the impact on individuals in
debt, often through no fault of their
own?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000305" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0002.htm#13071154000305">Secondly,
it is thought that there will be a significant increase in the number
of people forced to represent themselves in court. This carries the
substantial risk of creating delays in proceedings and greater
inefficiency. There is also a high risk that many litigants in person
will find themselves left with exorbitant court costs, as they are not
only unable to represent their cases effectively due to their lack of
legal expertise— regardless of the merits or otherwise of their
case—but are unable to afford the services of costs draftsmen
who would be able to negotiate costs on their behalf. This in turn is
likely to lead to the perverse outcome of further debt. Indeed, court
fines have already risen significantly as a category of debt problem on
which the National Debtline is called to advise. It is now in the 10
most common types of problem debt and is more common even than
mortgages.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13071154000306" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0002.htm#13071154000306">I
am also concerned about the implications of the additional cuts
currently being consulted on, which aim to reduce the legal aid budget

Minister comment in as much detail as he is able on the proposal to
recover legal aid from universal credit? This proposal is of very
serious concern to the free debt advice sector, and it is likely to
exacerbate problem debt among vulnerable groups. As far as I know, no

Scotland of Asthal:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, very warmly thank
the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, for bringing forward this very
important debate. I declare my interest as a practising member of the
Bar, a recorder, a deputy High Court judge and chair of the All-Party
Group on Domestic Violence.</hs_para>

heart indeed that I rise to speak in this debate. During the passage of
the LASPO Bill, a number of us in this House on all Benches raised
serious concerns about the likely impact of the then proposed changes
to legal aid, Lord Newton of Braintree being not least among them. I
think of him every time we debate these issues. Our experience over the
past 30-odd years had shown clearly the importance of having legal aid
available to those who need assistance to resolve often emotional and
sensitive issues that flowed from the breakdown of their relationships
and marriages, particularly where those relationships had produced
children and the breakdown affected them adversely. The fear was that
those who had been in receipt of help, advice and support would not be
able to obtain the assistance they needed, which would be deleterious
to their well-being, to the well-being of the children and to justice
as a whole. I remember well the Minister assuring us from the Dispatch
Box that our fears in this regard were unfounded and that the quality
of help and support that would still be available would be capable of
meeting the needs. However, your Lordships will also remember that no
impact assessment was produced to substantiate those assurances.
Indeed, the indications that we had available pointed in the opposite
direction. During this very short intervention, I will not reiterate
the concerns I raised during the passage of the LASPO Bill. However, we
were also assured that the Minister would keep a careful eye on the
impact of these provisions so that we could readdress them if
necessary, and that assurance gave us some comfort.</hs_para>

the Minister that the concerns that we had then have all, tragically,
proven to be true. Since the passing of the Bill into an Act, the
consequences that we feared seem to have come to the fore. In preparing
for this debate, I have had the benefit of reading innumerable
submissions from practitioners, individuals and organisations who, with
heart-breaking clarity, have set out the real consequences for the
people for whom they care of what now, regrettably, appear to be quite
pernicious changes in the legal aid provision rules. The speed of the
downturn has, however, shocked most of us. Many solicitors have
indicated that there has been a downturn in new clients of at least
50%. It has had an immediate impact on legal service provision and it
is affecting the staffing levels in many firms so that they are simply
no longer able to give the service that is
needed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:50:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000311" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0002.htm#13071154000311">Perhaps
I may quickly give a couple of examples. Williamsons, which has offices
in Hull, Driffield and Bridlington, has indicated that there has been a
dramatic reduction in the number of its private clients, and even those
clients are struggling to find the £50 or £100 that is
needed for legal referrals. The number of referrals for mediation is
down, and the reduction is commensurate with the volume of clients. The
downturn in work has 
<?notus-xml column=456?>been in the region of 50%. The Legal Help scheme is so draconian that
the clients are simply unable to show eligibility on the merits test,
and the firm is unable to meet its legal help quota for any of its
offices. That story is echoed across the
piece<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:51:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

instances of baby-snatching cases. In one, a grandmother had care of

case. There are all manner of private law children’s disputes
involving contact and residence, and hundreds of such cases are being
turned away en masse. The same applies even to domestic violence cases.

on winning the ballot for the Cross-Bench debate and on drawing our
attention to this issue. It is a situation that concerns lawyers, of
course, but only in relation to a much wider constituency of clients.
As a non-lawyer, I have rarely received so much material for a debate,
and most of this comes from individuals whom I trust to give a fair
picture of what is happening. As the noble and learned Baroness, Lady
Scotland, has already said, it has been quite moving to receive
briefings and advice from a range of organisations which have a genuine
concern for people in need. It is as simple as that. I have the highest
regard for the CAB, for example. My sister worked for it voluntarily 
<?notus-xml column=457?>and I know that its specialists are like personal counsellors. They are

distress.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000316" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0002.htm#13071154000316">The
Minister will know from his previous incarnations that organisations
such as BID and ILPA not only have a good track record in their field
but they are the only ones that will stand by the most vulnerable
groups in society, such as refugees and the homeless. I would go
further than that. In the absence of government, they are effectively
the government in their particular field in that they may be the only
service-providers available. Of course, one of these services is legal
aid.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000317" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0002.htm#13071154000317">As the
Minister is bound to point out, none of these non-governmental
organisations has the responsibility that government has in a

these organisations are linked by a common purpose and they are all
clear about what needs to  be done in forthcoming legislation.
They want the Government to understand that judicial review is the key
way in which people can challenge decisions by public bodies. They want
the Justice Minister to reconsider his refusal to fund the initial
stages of judicial review, including the critical preparation of the
evidence. They want the residency test modified to extend eligibility
to currently excluded groups, such as babies under 12 months
of age and asylum seekers. Asylum seekers will be allowed to access
legal aid while their application is pending but, once they are granted
asylum, they must wait a further 12 months, even if they have already
been here for more than 12 months, before they can receive civil legal
aid on any new matter. This can be discriminatory because refugees
fleeing persecution abroad may be denied equal access to justice for
longer than those whose residency arises from other causes. These
organisations also want a fairer tendering process. They want contracts
to be worded to ensure that appropriate adjustments are made to meet
specific cultural, geographical and financial needs. They would also
like the Government to undertake a review of quality assurance schemes
to help consumers of legal services to identify reputable
providers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000319" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0002.htm#13071154000319">Here,
the comments of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Neuberger, on 18 June

lawyers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000320" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0002.htm#13071154000320">All
the people giving evidence to the Justice Select Committee agreed with

ideas when he welcomed the model on client choice of solicitor.

issue, I emphasise, is not just some hysterical pay negotiation as it
has been caricatured. Governments wanting to cut legal aid always reach
for a base 
<?notus-xml column=459?>argument, which is to crack the cynical joke about fat cat lawyers
acting like a cartel to fix their fees. I hope we will not hear
comments about the large number of lawyers speaking in this debate. The
reason lawyers speak about these matters is because it is lawyers who
see at first hand the impact on ordinary people of savage cuts. They
also see the inevitable impact on the quality of work across the board,
and they foresee the desperate effect this will have on the system as a
whole, not just the risk of injustice but inhibitions on the
development of law. Politicians often see cost cutting as a form of
surgery, taking off some excess fat, but like the demand by Shylock for

debate is actually about an important constitutional issue, as others
have said. It is a constitutional issue because legal aid has an
important constitutional function. It is about access to justice, but
it is also about the integrity of our criminal and civil justice system
as a whole. Further, it is a constitutional issue because it is about
holding government and public bodies to account. It is not just legal
aid lawyers who are complaining, it is judges, commercial lawyers,
academic lawyers who study the effects of law on people’s lives,
and indeed most lawyers who see that the system is of a piece and that
taking the shears to parts of it has implications for the whole.

lack of rigour by the Government on this topic is not new. The Joint
Committee on Human Rights, on which I serve, regretted the failure of
the Government to grapple with the human rights implications of the
proposals in LASPO. I am afraid that we are seeing it again. It was
only after long and contentious arguments in both Houses that the
Government recognised that they would almost certainly face successful
human rights challenges if legal aid was not available to the victims
of domestic violence, human trafficking or other egregious wrongs. That
was when carefully crafted exemptions were created. Yet the proposals
in these reforms will substantially undermine those exemptions. It is
quite wrong that such important changes should come into being through
secondary legislation. As the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, said, they
should be subject to the proper scrutiny of Parliament, as was LASPO,
and there should be primary legislation. I urge the Government to slow
down and think carefully about this.</hs_para>

when a woman in Broadmoor on trial for arson looked at me and said,

message that in practice we send to the Government is that justice
cannot be produced on an assembly line or by bulk buying. What the
Government had in mind with their competitive tendering proposals was
to give a contract to the cheapest tender. Those ideas about going for
the cheapest are still afloat. The 
<?notus-xml column=460?>cost-cutting is about one lawyer doing a great number of cases and not
looking for the specialist. I want to emphasise that some cases require
specific expertise, an issue that has been raised. Some clients have a
relationship with a particular law firm and it saves time and money to
have that firm act for them. Sometimes the case may concern mental
health, and lawyers come to have rich knowledge about particular
subjects, especially in the interface of law and psychiatry. Sometimes
the expertise is in the field of domestic violence, child welfare or
counterterrorism, the area in which I have spent a lot of my life. Some
specialise in cases that involve abuse of the most terrible kind. A
massive reduction in legal aid will interfere with this

am still concerned about the flat fee, where people will receive the
same fee whether there is a guilty or a not guilty plea. It means that
solicitors, human as they are, will have more incentive to get their
clients to plead guilty since a not guilty plea entails considerably
more work. At the moment, 73% of people plead guilty, but they do so
because of the trust they have in the advice of their lawyers. Once
they think that a lawyer might be pushing them in a certain direction
for financial reasons, trust will be destroyed, and trust is at the
heart of good

the Government want to see the kind of chaos that price-competitive
tendering brings to justice, they need only look at the issue of
interpreters. Barristers wait for days in court for Serco, which now
deals with the interpreter system, to deliver an interpreter. I have
heard of young barristers storing multilingual phrases in their phones
so that they can explain to their clients that the interpreter has not
turned up. Also, the defendant is often not produced by Serco. The
waste in the criminal justice system is often about large companies
bidding for and securing a contract at prices on which they cannot

which must be sure that our legal institutions are properly implemented

Emlyn Hooson, a colleague of ours on these Benches and one of my
predecessors as Member of Parliament for Montgomeryshire. Emlyn Hooson
represented Ian Brady on legal aid at his celebrated trial—the

confident that what has happened to Ian Brady has been just is because

I specifically say a word about very high-cost cases? These are the
small number of extremely complex fraud cases that come before the

cases. They involve huge sums and massive complexity; they are every

aid system that is targeted by an entirely arbitrary cut of 30% which,
outrageously, is intended to be applied to cases that have already
started. People who are involved—I am involved in one such
case—will have to take, if they do not return their briefs in
outrage, a 30% cut as they continue that case if these proposals come
into force. Yet the Ministry of Justice has failed to engage with other
issues  about such cases. VHCCs are overadministered and,
outrageously, restrained assets—the assets, until they are
restrained, of defendants—cannot be used to pay

Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood:</Member></B> My Lords, if the Lord
Chancellor’s welcome concession last week on choice of
representation is anything to go by, it appears that these proposals
are not to be regarded as set in stone and are well worth debating. I
join with those who thank the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, for enabling
this to happen. It is much to be hoped that other of these proposals
too will similarly come to be recognised as ill-judged and will be
abandoned. It is on just one of these that I propose to
focus—one relating to judicial review not among those identified
by my noble and learned friend Lord Irvine of Lairg. It is the proposal
that lawyers should not be paid for their work in making application
for judicial review unless eventually permission comes to be granted.
It is crystallised as question 5 on the consultation

I want to digress just briefly to express a few heartfelt words of
regret at the radically changed role of the Lord Chancellor in public
life, following the Constitutional Reform Act 2005. How unfortunate it
is that we no longer have as Lord Chancellor someone in the tradition
of the great holders of that office which, quite recently, included the
noble and learned Lords, Lord Mackay of Clashfern and Lord Irvine of
Lairg. It is a great privilege to have heard him in this debate. He
chooses very fastidiously the occasions when he invites the attention
of this House. What huge benefits to the office they brought: not
merely were they highly experienced and distinguished lawyers in their
own right but, no less importantly, their voices were authoritative and
statesmanlike at the very heart of government. They were voices that
recognised the central importance in our democracy of the rule of law,
the independence of the judiciary and rights of access to justice. Such
Lord Chancellors had already, 
<?notus-xml column=463?>of course, achieved the summit of political life; they were not career
politicians with personal ambitions still to be
realised<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T15:18:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

plain that I have nothing whatever against the present Lord Chancellor.
He became such after I retired and I do not know him. Nor do I have
anything against career politicians. No doubt they are essential to any
healthy democracy. However, I cannot pretend to have the same
confidence in proposals of this sort that emanate from a career
politician with no background whatever in the law as I would have felt,
and indeed used to feel, towards proposals from Lord Chancellors past.
Grateful though one is for the recent concession as to choice of legal
representation, it does not fill one with confidence that these
proposals as a whole have been properly thought through by someone with
real knowledge of our legal processes, properly sensitive to the
imperative demands of access to

briefly, to the proposal that concerns me most, the proposal that,
unless permission comes to be granted for a full judicial review, no
costs at all—only non-legal disbursements—will be paid
for work carried out. It is opposed, perhaps unsurprisingly, by all
parts of the profession, including notably the Administrative Law Bar
Association, of which I am proud to say I was president for many years.
It is also strongly opposed by the Judicial Executive Board—that
is, the higher judiciary—the Civil Justice Council and Her

responses are cogently and convincingly argued, ALBA’s perhaps
above all. It is very difficult to suppose that anyone could fairly

challenges to administrative decision-making and there are
those—I am not among them—who would suggest that this
their central and cynical purpose: an attempt to insulate the
Government, as far as possible, from legal challenge. However, I regard
the proposal not as mischievous but merely as fundamentally misguided.
It is misguided because it stems from a basic misapprehension of the
place of permission in the process of judicial review and it would
result in consequences far removed from those intended and very
damaging to this critical part of the courts’
jurisdiction—the ability to supervise the proper exercise of
public power.</hs_para>

in mind that, as of just last week, 1 July, following the earlier
changes to legal aid, when the High Court refuses permission to proceed
on the documents, the judge now can certify an application as being
“totally without merit”. In itself, that prevents the
applicant requesting an oral hearing of the application; all he can do
is to make one further application on the documents. If more than that
is required, let the lawyers be deprived of costs in that very limited
category of cases on the certification of a judge but not in the
altogether larger category envisaged by this present
proposal.</hs_para>

discourage perhaps solicitors taking even the strongest cases. The
strongest cases are those where the defendants are most likely to
respond early by making the concessions that make

past nine months or so been chairing a commission established by the
Legal Action Group with funding from the Baring Foundation, the Barrow
Cadbury Trust, LankellyChase Foundation and the Trust for London on the
future of advice and legal support on social welfare law in England and
Wales. We are on course to have a draft report for consultation in
September and produce our final report by the end of the year. I have
been keeping a fairly low profile so as not to compromise the
independence of our report, but I have been prevailed upon to break

say straight away that I understand the Minister’s problem. On
my first day at university, we received a lecture from Lord Denning who
said that the difference between a judge and an academic was that
whereas judges had to find a solution for every difficulty, academics
took pleasure in finding a difficulty for every solution. In this, I
see Ministers as more akin to judges than academics. We shall certainly
be trying to come up with solutions rather than difficulties. We do not
think it is possible or even desirable simply to put things back as
they were and I hope we will be able to come up with some suggestions
for creating a more orderly landscape of advice services which will be
helpful to Ministers in getting the most out of reduced
resources.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000370" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0002.htm#13071154000370">The
recent proposals are mostly about criminal legal aid, of course, and
that is not our concern. But there are also some proposals affecting
civil legal aid which have been less remarked on, although they have
not been ignored today, perhaps because they save a comparatively small
amount of money—£6 million, I think. They may
nevertheless have some untoward consequences and I want to say a word
about two of them in a personal capacity, in the hope that the
Government might be willing to reconsider them, particularly when they
make such a trifling saving. They also concern me because of their
potential to impact on children with special educational needs trying
to secure the special educational provision they require.</hs_para>

that makes a local authority do what they know they ought to do is the
threat of judicial review. According to MoJ figures, about half the
cases in which legal aid is currently granted to bring judicial review
do not lead to a JR. My information is that the actual figure may
actually be considerably higher than that. That is not because the
claims are unmeritorious but because in many of them a local authority
caves in when they know a JR is coming. If, as under the new proposals,
lawyers do not get paid for the work they do before the permission
stage, many fewer JR claims would be brought, as has been said, and
local authorities would be let off the hook. Either that or, if lawyers
get paid only for cases which are issued and permission is granted, and
not for cases that settle, there will be a perverse incentive to
commence cases which would currently settle and more, not fewer, JRs
will be brought and the projected saving will soon
disappear.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000372" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0002.htm#13071154000372">Secondly,
stopping the funding of borderline cases will have a dramatic effect
for tiny savings on disability and SEN cases. Many such cases are
currently classified as borderline in terms of their legal aid merits,
either because they are factually complicated or are test cases,
raising new issues of law. Some very important test cases of strategic
significance are borderline and will not now be able to be brought.
Indeed, test cases are almost by their very nature
borderline.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000373" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0002.htm#13071154000373">In

in passing, I am advised that recent reforms to the costs regime in
civil litigation have had a deleterious impact on disabled litigants
trying to bring cases under the Equality Act. No longer having the
benefit of cost-shifting rules or the ability to recover insurance
premiums, it is much more difficult for them to bring proceedings under
a conditional fee agreement. They are thus unintended casualties of the
Jackson reforms. I wonder if the Minister would be prepared to meet me
to see if we can find a way through
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000375" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0002.htm#13071154000375">Finally,
young legal aid lawyers have written to me to express concern about the
impact of these latest proposals on junior lawyers. Some, such as the
cuts to civil advocacy fees, will have a direct impact. Others, like
price-competitive tendering, will have an indirect impact as firms cut
corners in order to stay afloat. This will impact on the future of the
profession. If junior lawyers are not paid, supervised and trained to
an adequate level, we will lose our next generation of legal aid

Lady Deech, for initiating this very important debate. It is with some
regret that, so recently having returned to the House after the lifting

It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T15:39:56"></hs_TimeCode> is a sad

ought not to have arisen at all. I find it hard to believe that a

me emphasise at the outset that I have no personal interest of any kind
in the outcome of these proposals. I left legal practice long ago and
have now reached the age when I am no longer allowed to sit as a judge.
I can claim, however, to be an informed observer. My experience as an
appellate judge during the past 24 years has been very wide.
Judicial review has been a significant part of my work, as has dealing
with cases supported by legal aid. I am also well aware of the pressure
on public funds and of the need to make savings, and to continue to
make savings year after year wherever possible. I had to face up to
that problem time and time again when I was the Senior Presiding Judge
in Edinburgh and, more recently, as the Minister will know, as the
Deputy President of the Supreme Court. I have done my best to promote
efficiency and the saving of costs wherever possible. I have supported
the Government and will continue to support them in their search for
further savings, including in the administration of legal aid. Of
course there is no bottomless
pit.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000386" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0002.htm#13071154000386">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T15:54:34"></hs_TimeCode>
Government are right to seek to target their limited resources on those
cases which really do justify legal aid and on those people who need
it, but that requires the exercise of judgment based on sound research
and open-minded consultation. There is one cardinal principle which
until now has always been respected. It is set out in Section 1 of the
Constitutional Reform Act 2005, to which the noble and learned Lord,
Lord Irvine of Lairg, referred: the constitutional principle of the
rule of law and the Lord Chancellor’s role in relation to that
principle. It is worth recalling that the clause was not in the Bill as
originally drafted. It did not appear until Third Reading in this House
following a recommendation by the Select Committee on the Bill. Perhaps
it was thought to be so obvious that it was not necessary to state it
at all, but that was not the view of the Select Committee, which
thought that it should be there and could not be dismissed as
unimportant. It is indeed fundamental to the continued existence of our
democracy, but the important point I would emphasise is that the rule
of law exists for the benefit of everyone and it is for everyone to
respect it. There can be no exceptions at whatever level of government.
What this means is that all persons and every public authority must

is very short and I have only a few points that I can make,
particularly in relation to judicial review and the tests—the
permission test, the borderline test and the residence test. I would
invite the Minister to 
<?notus-xml column=470?>have regard to a paper circulated on 25 June by Dr Nick
Armstrong of Matrix Chambers in which he analyses the costings of these
various proposals. For example, with prison law he draws attention to
the fact that of the overall savings in the proposals that the
Government have in mind, which are assessed to be  £6
million, £4 million of those are said to come from prison law.
Dr Armstrong, however, has indicated—his work has been seen and
approved by the Parole Board—that the additional costs that
result from these savings may come to as much as £10 million as
a result of the continued detention of people who have no access to
prison law. That is quite apart from the constitutional
implications.</hs_para>

regard to the consequences of these proposals and burrows underneath

face it, the most unpopular who are at risk of being unprotected. For
them, the rights that are at issue here are the most basic rights of

increased

proposed to bring these proposals into force, given that they raise
fundamental constitutional issues? I endorse what has been said by the

Hamwee:</Member></B> My Lords, it is entirely sensible that anyone who
feels in need of legal assistance will seek it and will seek the
best—the Government themselves do that. Many Members of this
House have said to me, “You’re a lawyer; you must
understand such and such”, which is not always true, but I say
that both to declare an interest as a non-practising solicitor and to
remind myself that we in this House are a very advantaged
group.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000392" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0002.htm#13071154000392">What is
“best” is different in different circumstances. I want to
deal with one type of best. First, I will mention something that I
heard earlier this week about refugees applying for family
reunification, which is a right, who are unable to tackle the
complicated application without legal help or who borrow from 
<?notus-xml column=471?>loan sharks in order to get that help. That is an example of the
“underclass” to which Treasury counsel have
referred.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000393" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0002.htm#13071154000393">The
authors of the many and substantial briefings that we have received
will be disappointed that it is not possible to include all their
material. However, we have read it—I put that on the

the 16,000 responses to the consultation. I welcome the fact that there
will be a re-consultation, which must itself give time to be
real.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000394" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0002.htm#13071154000394">We used
to be concerned about Tesco law; it may now be Stobart law. Although
the supermarkets have established small outlets, they are small
versions of the same; the specialist stores have disappeared. I want to
mention the specialist firms, which have a national reach—not
that they get paid for travelling. Niche providers need to be national
to generate sufficient volume to be sustainable; I know that the
Secretary of State is concerned about that. Many such firms have chosen
to remain small so that each solicitor has the ultimate responsibility
for the client and sees a case through. Being specialised gives you the
ability to deal efficiently with complicated issues, to recognise core
issues and to gain the client’s confidence—and it is
important to have their confidence in order to give difficult advice
such as whether to plead guilty. A single solicitor who supervises a
number of unqualified or less qualified paralegals will not inspire
that confidence. I know all this from my own experience of struggling
occasionally with unusual
cases.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000395" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0002.htm#13071154000395">The

anything from conditional fees, but there is no time for that today.

I would like to say more about conflicts of interests and the market. I
appreciate that both clients and lawyers must be disincentivised from
thinking that there is a sort of TARDIS of a piggy-bank available for
legal aid, but few think that. Most lawyers I know want to do their
best for the clients, even if they become fat along the way, although I
point out that my noble friend the Minister does not use that term.
They want their clients not to be subject to luck-of-the-draw
representation and justice and they want to train their successors and

debate about legal aid and proposed cuts is the rule of law and access
to justice. Everyone in this Chamber would accept the importance of the
rule of law in a civilised country. It depends on many features, one of
which, of course, is access to justice for people who need to go to the
courts. If they need to claim something they believe to be due to them,
the courts are there for them—self-help is frowned on and
criminalised in many cases. If they are defendants, the courts are
there for them to reject the claims that they believe to be
unjustified.</hs_para>

requires that there be access to justice, but it has to be a reality
and not just a constitutional theory. It used to be said that the Ritz
was open to everyone, but of course it was not, as not everyone could
afford to pay its charges. The courts theoretically at least are open
to everyone, but to get in front of the courts now, whether as a
claimant or as a defendant, you have to pay a fairly substantial sum up
front.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13071154000404" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0002.htm#13071154000404">I
cannot remember how long ago it was—I think that it was when the
noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, was Lord
Chancellor—that the then Government introduced the notion that
the civil justice system had to be self-financing, with substantial
charges for commencing or defending an action or putting in a reply;
practically any step you took in the action was subject to a fee. It
was a relatively expensive matter to embark on litigation or to defend
it. However, in those days, although the civil justice system had to be
self-financing, it was not proposed that the fees paid by litigants
should cover the cost of legal aid assistance. That was left alone. It
is being introduced now as a feature. The Government need to save money
to cut down on public expense, and the legal aid bill, 
<?notus-xml column=473?>whether for criminal or civil legal aid, is looked at as one of the
means of reducing government expenditure to balance the books. The
object is one with which one cannot possibly quarrel, but the
Government have to bear in mind what this process may do to the justice
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000405" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0002.htm#13071154000405">I want
to concentrate my remarks on the civil justice system, because, as all
my colleagues will know, I know precious little, or nothing, about the
criminal justice system. In the civil justice system, individuals need
to have access and, if they cannot have access to it to defend
themselves or prosecute their claims, their respect for the justice
system will be affected. Respect for the rule of law is a cultural
advantage, which this country shares with many others, but there are
many countries in the world where the rules and regulations that appear
to provide for the rule of law lack reality, because the laws in
question do not command
respect.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071154000406" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0002.htm#13071154000406">In
this country, individuals, of course, disapprove of some laws that they
may be required to obey, but, broadly speaking, one of the features of
living in this country is that the population and the public as a whole
respect the rule of law. That respect is cultural, however; it is not
to be found in every country and it is not necessarily immutable. Let
us think of what may happen if there is a substantial number of people
whose access to the courts to prosecute claims that they think they are
owed, or to defend themselves against claims that they think are
unjustified, is made impractical or impossible because of the
difficulties of financing the entry into litigation or paying for
lawyers to argue their case. Some may try to argue the case themselves,
with all the difficulties that they must know that will involve because
they are not lawyers—or at least in general circumstances they
are not lawyers, and the law is not always something that appears
simple to non-lawyers; sometimes it does not appear simple to lawyers,
either.</hs_para>

law, which is so important, is capable of being forfeited and lost if
excessive cuts are made affecting potential litigants. I wish that the
Government would bear that in mind in considering how far to take the
inroads into the legal aid bill for the purpose of cutting government
expenditure. I hope that it will not happen to a point that the rule of
law loses the respect that at present it commands. It cannot be taken
for granted by the Government that that will not happen and I hope that
they keep that in

case in the future like, for example, the Baba Mousa one, it should be

line that it is the costs that justify these proposals, though the Dr

is necessary, for all those who need it? As far as I am concerned,
these proposals are much more dog-whistle politics than they are
thought-out legal proposals. The Government sometimes give the

JustRights for its detailed assessment, which makes it clear that

examples. I shall not go into trafficking in detail because it has
already been dealt with by the noble Lord, Lord Touhig. However, the
Court of Appeal has recognised the importance of treating people who
have been trafficked as victims. The proposals would take away a
crucial route to protection for trafficked children and young people
who are extremely vulnerable to sexual exploitation, abuse and
violence. Extraordinarily, even British-born babies aged less than 12
months will be excluded by the residence test. Also, the removal of
prison law from scope will deny children and young people in detention
access to legal aid. These young people are in another exceptionally
vulnerable group, often with learning difficulties or mental health
problems. Many will have endured troubled childhoods and spent time in
care. It is simply inhumane to deny them a crucial route to challenging
and preventing bullying and abuse in prison or obtaining support to aid
their resettlement on

limiting the circumstances in which judicial review can be brought will
have a devastating impact on young people. For example, where a local
authority has not, as corporate parent, provided the correct package of
support to a young person in care or a care leaver, or has housed a
young person in unsuitable accommodation, the circumstances under which
its decisions can be challenged will become very limited.

imbalance inherent in the relationship between the individual and the

save. This is confirmed by rigorous research for Youth Access, which
shows that a young person with a legal advice problem typically costs
local public services as much as £13,000 before they manage to
obtain advice. Much of this cost falls on councils, social services,

Beecham:</Member></B> My Lords, in our many debates about legal aid,
the Minister has constantly justified government policy by referring to
the need to cut public expenditure. While making every allowance for 
<?notus-xml column=477?>the need to make savings, some of us have all along suspected an
ulterior motive. Those suspicions were explicitly confirmed, as we were
reminded by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Irvine, by the Lord
Chancellor in his recent evidence to the Justice Select Committee when
he affirmed that the proposal to reduce funding for legal aid to
prisoners was ideological, rather than driven by financial
considerations. Given the minimal amount that the proposals were
supposed to save, that is not surprising. When one takes into account
that the savings engendered by denying access to legal aid to prisoners
seeking redress is very likely to be outweighed more than fourfold by
the costs—for example, of delayed release or of Parole Board
hearings, matters referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, and the
noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope—the economic case falls away

is not the only area in which the Lord Chancellor’s ideological
proclivities are shaping policy. The residence test for legal
assistance, like its proposed equivalent in the health service, is, as
my noble friend Lord Bach has pointed out, another blast on the Tory
political dog whistle, which is likely to cost more than it saves,
apart from its malign consequences for a particularly vulnerable group
of people, including children, immigration detainees or even Gurkhas.

public-interest element. Here, the Government’s use of figures
would do credit to one of those bankers manipulating LIBOR. They rely
on the fact that over half of legal aid applications for judicial
review are ended prior to permission being granted. However, as the
respected Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law points out, a much higher
percentage of cases are abandoned or lost at the subsequent stages by
claimants who do not have legal aid. Moreover, as the noble Lord, Lord
Low, pointed out, many cases are withdrawn because a defendant body,

cost of legal aid is falling, not rising, even before taking into

the Treasury—assuming that HMRC collects it, which it is not
always capable of doing, as we have heard recently. From a peak of
£2.237 billion in 2009-10, the bill has fallen to
£1.917 billion; that is a significant reduction. In
cash terms, it now stands at marginally above the cost of legal aid in
2007-08. If one takes into account VAT and the impact of inflation on
those figures, it is clear that the cost is not out of control; indeed,
in real terms, it is falling and has fallen substantially.</hs_para>

other European jurisdictions, at 0.33% of government expenditure. That
is equal to the average. However, as the noble Baroness, Lady Deech,
pointed out—I join others in congratulating her on securing this
debate—you cannot really compare different legal aid systems
when they apply to different judicial systems. In
any event, overall, the expenditure on the courts
and the justice system is not greater here than
elsewhere. In any case, the Government are yet to explain

alongside the need to ensure access to justice and a healthy,

Government are entitled to seek the best possible value for money from

made a commitment to review the 
<?notus-xml column=481?>legal aid scheme with the aim of finding savings, culminating in the
Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012. This will
have removed around £320 million from the legal aid budget by

budget—as well as strengthening accountability and introducing a

the current financial climate means that it is necessary to look again
at everything that the Ministry of Justice is doing, including in
relation to legal aid, in order to make further savings, particularly
in respect of criminal legal aid. This was the focus of the

reduce the legal aid spend by around £220 million by

consultation, published in April, included a proposal to move to a
model of price competitive tendering in the criminal legal aid market.
Conscious of the professions’ objections to the principle of
“one case, one fee”, we proposed to exclude criminal
advocacy from the competition model, instead proposing to restructure
the Crown Court advocacy scheme. Being mindful of the great disparity
in the level of fee income received by advocates for Crown Court work,
our proposals would rebalance fee income so that those at the top end
took the greatest reduction and the lower earners the least. Indeed,
some lower earners may see a small increase in their fee
income.</hs_para>

sought to further increase efficiency by proposing a sensible reduction
in the use of multiple counsel. To ensure public confidence in the
level of expenditure on the longest and most expensive cases, as well
as delivering the necessary savings for the legal aid scheme, we
propose to reduce the rates paid for criminal very high-cost cases by
30%. We have also included some small but important reforms to civil
legal aid and expert fees to ensure that these, too, are fair and
proportionate, and consistent with those paid for similar work
elsewhere.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071180000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0002.htm#13071180000023">Our

prison law cases funded through legal aid, directing less serious
matters to the internal prisoner complaints process. The prisoner
complaints system was updated in 2012 and has recently been audited
with a review of the adequacy, effectiveness and reliability of
controls over prisoner complaints, with no significant concerns
identified. Criminal legal aid will remain for a significant number of

will settle or conclude at this point without issuing an application,
avoiding further costs to the legal aid scheme, the courts and public

treated as a resource to further pursue weak cases that have little

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for a

objection to the regulations is not so much about changing the scope of
charging as the underlying policies that drive this necessity. These
are, as we have heard, certain provisions in the Growth and
Infrastructure Act 2013 and the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act
2013, the first in particular enabling applications for major
developments for designated authorities to bypass the local planning
authority and go directly to the Secretary of State. We opposed this
during the passage of the primary legislation and continue to do so. It
is the ultimate denial of localism, which for planning has been
embedded in the system for more than half a
century.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071180000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0002.htm#13071180000058">However,
if applications are to be routed to the Secretary of State—in
practice, the Planning Inspectorate—then it is obviously right
that there should be a commensurate fee structure, otherwise the
incentive would be for major applications always to be made to the
Secretary of State. I understand, and I think that the Minister
confirmed it, that fees applicable to England were last uprated with
effect from November 2012; it is understood that the fees set out in
these regulations would apply
initially.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071180000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0002.htm#13071180000059">As
we have heard, the regulations cover other fee issues, and I shall come
on to those, but I have some questions for the Minister. What volume of
applications is it anticipated will be received and be subject to this
charging regime? During the passage of the primary legislation we had
various estimates of “vanishingly few” LPAs being
designated, although that was revised up to around 20 by the time we
finished our deliberations. The criteria for designation were published
in June in time for an October start to designation. While I accept
that the final data for the initial designation will not be available
until September 2013, the department must have some increasingly firm
indications of the likely number of planning authorities to be
designated. Can we know what that number is?</hs_para>

authority has been designated and major applications are made to the
Secretary of State, directions can nevertheless be given to the local
planning authority requiring it to undertake certain tasks in relation
to the application. We consider it unfair that the authority should
receive no part of the fee. Moreover, this is not the only circumstance
where the regulations require the local planning authority to undertake
activity for no fee. The changed arrangements 
<?notus-xml column=488?>whereby in future the demolition of unlisted buildings in conservation
areas will have to be dealt with by local planning authorities also
come without the right to a
fee.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071180000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0002.htm#13071180000061">These
regulations cover circumstances where the Secretary of State, via the
Planning Inspectorate, is able to charge a fee for pre-application
advice where the application is made to the
Secretary of State. That developers should pay for such advice is
entirely reasonable, although we would maintain that much of this work
will in fact be done by the local planning authority, which will get no
part of the fee. Notwithstanding that an application goes to the
Secretary of State, will the Minister encourage local planning
authorities to engage in the pre-application process, and how should
they be remunerated if they do so? The regulations set down that
charging should proceed by applying an hourly rate to the time spent by
the planning inspector or planning officer. This hourly rate is to be
set by the Secretary of State from time to time and must be set by
reference to the average cost of providing the services of the
individual. It is understood that this reflects the charging position
for local planning authorities. Can the Minister remind us of what
systems are in place to put this into effect? What is understood by
“average cost”? Which overheads are built into the
calculation? Is any differentiation made for the different levels of
experience of the staff, other than planning inspector or planning
officer, or indeed for the overheads of different regional locations?
As for fees payable under the general permitted development order, the
regulations require a fee of £80 where prior approval for change
of use is required. Approval might be required from the local planning
authority or the Secretary of State. Does the fee go to the person
required to give approval and what is the basis for the £80
figure?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071180000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0002.htm#13071180000062">Our
overall concern about these regulations is that they erode the
opportunity for local planning authorities to generate fee income and
therefore to sustain their planning capacity, and this at a time when
there has been considerable change in the planning system, where local
authority budgets have been squeezed to breaking point with further
cuts to come, and when the blame for poor economic performance is all
too often laid at the door of the planning system. I conclude by asking
the Minister this: what assessment has been made of the
capacity of local planning authorities to cope in the current

perhaps I should rephrase that: the applicant can decide where to go,

the Government, but I hope that the noble Earl has had the opportunity
to look at some of the previous debates we have had on the other two
orders. He will have noted that last year I queried why action had not
been taken against the Boko Haram sect, given that the organisation
that we were then taking action to proscribe, Ansaru, was in fact a
breakaway group from Boko Haram and had been in existence for a much
shorter time. I asked then that it be kept under review as we were
somewhat surprised not to be discussing this group then, given the

the Government content that they have acted quickly enough? It would be
helpful if he could give some explanation about why there has been a
time lag between these two orders, given that we previously knew about
the activities of Boko Haram when we discussed this issue last year.

on with its deadly mission. I appreciate all the issues we have
discussed about action having to be evidence-based, but I am
pretty sure that the security services must have some kind of

doing so. The Minister, rightly, has been very clear today that action
to proscribe a

difficult it is to get all that evidence and present it in an

Storey:</Member></B> My Lords, I was tempted—and have decided to
do so—to start this debate on music tourism by saying,
“Yeah, yeah, yeah”. As we know, in recent decades our
music industry has moved from strength to strength. Indeed, we can
hardly ignore the explosion of music events, be it classical, dance,
folk, jazz, metal, pop or rock; we are spoilt for choice. The
world-famous Glastonbury festival, which just hosted an astonishing
120,000 festival goers this year, is but one of hundreds that are now a
regular occurrence up and down the land, from the Isle of Wight
festival on the south coast to T in the Park in the Scottish Highlands.
Festivals undoubtedly play an essential role in local and regional
economies. I can speak for Liverpool and comment on the impact that
music has historically made upon her tourist economy, but, of course,
the same applies to exotic lands further afield, notably, the
flourishing St Lucia jazz
festival<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T17:19:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13071180000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0003.htm#13071180000109">As I mentioned, this
year’s Glastonbury festival was fantastically successful. It is
too soon to gauge the full economic impact, but the last detailed
economic assessment in 2007 reported direct spending of
£73 million, with 23% going directly into
Mendip’s local economy. As well as money pouring into local
economies, festivals 
<?notus-xml column=496?>are attracting unprecedented numbers of overseas visitors. It may
interest noble Lords to know that Brazilians are the most active in
this regard, followed by New Zealanders and
Norwegians<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T17:20:05"></hs_TimeCode>.
Research undertaken by UK Music shows that international music tourists
attending large-scale music events contribute at least £247
million to the UK economy. I look forward to reading its new report,
which is due to be published next month, as it will reveal how many
people attend live music concerts and festivals each year.
Specifically, we will learn what proportion of live music audiences are
comprised of music tourists as opposed to the local population, as well
as how much this spending benefits the regional and national economies
and
employment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071180000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0003.htm#13071180000110">It
is important to place music tourism in its international context so
that we can learn how further to bolster and improve this country as a
music destination. Is it any wonder that two of the top five
international music festivals take place in the UK? Music festivals
underpin our efforts and many places become synonymous with music
hotspots. Many cities are excellent at creating such imagery, keen to
harness the benefits as visitors descend on their musical events. For
example, Berlin’s annual Love Parade—a celebration of
club and techno culture—attracts more than 1 million visitors
every year. The New Orleans jazz festival draws in over 400,000 people,
and the Salzburg festival attracts over 200,000. The St Lucia jazz
festival, which I mentioned earlier, makes a profit of nearly $6

Salzburg has Mozart and Memphis has Elvis, but this has not stopped
other cities building upon lesser reputations or seeking to create
music tourism economies where little or no musical association
previously existed. Great Britain simply has too much potential for
musical tourism for the Government to stand idly by. I note from
VisitBritain’s survey of 20,000 overseas panellists that music

economic reports about the Games’ legacy and impact. However, I
would suggest that what is missing is an attempt to take a broader look
at the impact that music played during the Games. Many of us will have
watched the brilliant opening and closing ceremonies that celebrated
the success of British music throughout the ages. They showcased how
British music has been and is of world-class standard. By the time of
the closing ceremony, Chinese media were showering Britain with praise
as a “holy land for music”. Equally, the Germans believed
that the Games showcased the UK as the great power of pop music and
culture. Even Russian newspapers believed 
<?notus-xml column=497?>that British music made the Games truly unforgettable. Our worldwide
success propelled UK artists’ share of total global album

profile as a music destination even further and the Prime Minister
acknowledged as much at the British Recorded Music Industry’s
40th anniversary party. Now more than ever we must harness the
international goodwill that the Games have rekindled for British music.
The real impact will not come just from visitor footfall, but from
businesses keen to see the country at its zenith. Music tourism, if

mentioned earlier, my own city of Liverpool is steeped in musical
tradition. We are the city that gave the world The Beatles, but there
is still a host up of up-and-coming talented musicians including The
Wombats and, although yet to be recognised, The Stopouts. Most
importantly, Liverpool’s music scene has always been supported
by the community. This has been its key to success. Beat in the Mersey,
a tour that opened a few weeks ago, aims to tell the story of
Liverpool’s musical history through song, dance and music. It
concentrates on the period when Liverpool was the second city of the
then British Empire, drawing millions to her port, who brought with
them music from around the globe. It is easy to romanticise about the
period when Liverpool became a musical sponge, soaking up influences
from the many thousands who passed through its docks. As Beat in the

Liverpool’s shores were crucial to her musical and cultural
development.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071180000115" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0003.htm#13071180000115">Only

Liverpool International Music Festival will be boosted by the
EU’s commitment to inject more than £2 million into its

into the local economy by 2015. Liverpool as a community has been keen
to promote itself beyond a shrine to John, Paul, George and Ringo. It
is a city where musical talent is intrinsic to the very people who walk
her streets. Indeed, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra has
been organising events with schools and the community since the 1940s,
when Sir Malcolm Sargent introduced concerts for schools. By 2009, the
orchestra was reaching out to some 45,000 people, including 22,000
children, every year. The desire to bring out the best in
Liverpool’s musical community can also be seen in the Knotty Ash
Youth and Community Centre, which is used as a music rehearsal space
for 
<?notus-xml column=498?>future musical talent. It engages with young people in innovative ways,

the Live Music Act 2012, which was initiated by my noble
friend Lord Clement-Jones and shepherded through the other place by Don
Foster MP. The Act has removed a lot of unnecessary bureaucratic red
tape, and now community organisations and music venues can put on even
more events designed to bring local people together. Now that venues
have more freedom to host live events, British artists have more
opportunities to develop their talents. This will serve only to enrich
our local communities and the economy overall. UK Music estimates that
the Live Music Act could enable 13,000 more venues to start holding

consider how best to implement a well defined music strategy. Northern
Ireland is already engaged in such an activity. The strategy rests on
enabling the music industry to realise its full economic potential. It
has been informed by detailed consultation with more than 80
representatives from the industry, as well as with public agencies
interested in the sector’s development. The strategy aims to
develop a creative and vibrant music sector to achieve consistent and
sustainable economic growth. This will create jobs and contribute to
wealth. This, in turn, adds to a positive image of Northern Ireland on
the world stage. By devising and implementing a music strategy,
Northern Ireland is making the most of a tangible economic and cultural
opportunity. We as a nation must do the same to attract even greater

the noble Lord for securing this debate. I wholeheartedly endorse
everything he had to say about our extraordinary musical heritage. At a
time when so much attention is rightly being paid to reducing the
deficit, it is crucial that those of us who love the 
<?notus-xml column=499?>arts, and classical music in particular, trumpet—no pun
intended—the contribution that they make to our economy. This
debate affords us a perfect opportunity to highlight the role of music
in tourism, which is one of the engines of economic
growth<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T17:30:03"></hs_TimeCode>. I

we have heard from the noble Lord, Lord Storey, this country is blessed
with an energetic and colourful musical life, whether it be the grand
set pieces such as the BBC Proms, the constant supply of glorious music
at the Royal Festival Hall, Covent Garden, the ENO, the Barbican
Centre, Wigmore Hall and many other cultural centres, or programmes of
astonishing music-making most nights of the term at our conservatoires.
Moreover, this pattern, as the noble Lord also said, is mirrored
throughout the regions. On any day of the week, we are able to join in
any variety of musical experiences, from the “Ring Cycle”
at the Proms, to “Peter Grimes” on Aldeburgh Beach, to
Beethoven at the Barbican or to Schubert songs at Wigmore Hall. Indeed,
we can probably hear the great master works of the noble Lord, Lord
Berkeley of
Knighton<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T17:29:59"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T17:31:02"></hs_TimeCode>.
Our artistic repertoire is not limited to the great composers. Key to
our musical tapestry, I believe, is the way in which we blend together
household names with those who are not so well known, whether it be
string quartets by Dittersdorf or the remarkable six-handed piano works
of Gurlitt, both of which I have heard recently, as well as nurturing
new talent.</hs_para>

Survey<I>,</I> some 60% of overseas visitors said that theatre, music
and arts performances were either very important or important in their
decision to visit London. It is estimated that, of the 4.2 million
people attending classical concerts, opera or ballet in a year, 10% are
from overseas. That, of course, has a big economic impact in not just
around £10 million in ticket sales but in the spending on
hotels, restaurants and souvenirs. A trend has been assiduously tracked
over time by UK Music, which plays such an important and energetic role
in the advocacy of music’s economic
power<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T17:32:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071180000123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0003.htm#13071180000123">The
main point I want to make today is that great music-making by 50,000
performing musicians in the UK does not just happen by chance. There
has to be a steady supply of new, well-trained entrants to the
profession who can both perform and teach. If we want to will the
ends—in other words, increased tourism and revenue—then
we must will the means, which means keeping our music teaching the best
in the world, as I believe it is. That is why the UK's conservatoires
are of fundamental importance to this debate. As a report last year by

the conservatoires train musicians, who then take part in the
orchestras, choirs and chamber ensembles that make up our national
music tapestry. The three conservatoires which commissioned the LSE

figures from the Higher Education Statistics Agency show near full
employment for conservatoire graduates, at a time when 10% of graduates
from other universities are not in work or further education six months
after leaving. Moreover, as Unistats Key Information Set statistics
show, that work is overwhelmingly in the profession for which they
studied. For the Royal College of Music, for instance, that means that
80% are in the artistic category and a further 10% are in teaching.
Similarly, a study by the Musicians’ Union quoted in the LSE
report analysed the educational origins of players in four major London
orchestras in the early 2000s and found that two-thirds came from the
leading conservatoires, with the Royal College of Music topping that

£329 million. Musical theatre is of course also a

terms of the ratio of their economic worth to the funding which they

sector that is worth nearly £800 million to the economy in
ticket sales to visitors from overseas and the wider value added from

third, given that music-making is international in its scope and that

important for professional performers who wish to remain in the UK

The opening and closing ceremonies of the Olympic Games were a
wonderful marketing opportunity. Music tourists spend more than most
other tourists. Overseas music tourists account for 5% of music tourism
but 18% of music tourism spend. We need to encourage more people to
come here to benefit from what we have to offer in our musical

interesting that it is Brazilians, New Zealanders and Norwegians who
come here. I have come across many young people all over the world who
would love to be able to come to Britain. Some of the challenge is the

on tourism—about how we can take advantage of its huge potential
for economic growth—and on live music, especially in the context

as separate issues. However, I am delighted that, thanks to my noble

report relating to Scotland. Success in this field is the product of a

of the causes of our strength is surely our whole music education

me suggest a couple of things that might enable us to do better. First,
I am not aware of any mechanism—or at least I was not until the
noble Baroness, Lady Liddell, mentioned one—for taking an
overall look at how to maximise the UK tourism benefits of the music
sector across all the areas that I have mentioned. I gather that some
other countries and regions, such as Ontario, have been successful in
adopting a more strategic approach. Perhaps that might be
achieved by designating a Minister with specific cross-departmental
responsibility for promoting live music tourism, or even appointing a
live music
tsar.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071180000159" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0003.htm#13071180000159">Secondly,
music tourism is disproportionately concentrated, as is so often the
case, in London and the south-east, areas which attract almost half of
all music tourists, whereas Wales accounts for only 3%, and Scotland
for only 2%, just ahead of Northern Ireland. Could VisitBritain be
encouraged to give greater emphasis to promoting music tourism outside
London, working in a joined-up way with regional bodies such as Visit
Wales to ensure that the benefits of such tourism are more evenly and
widely
spread?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071180000160" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0003.htm#13071180000160">Another
question relates to removing barriers to success. There has been some
good progress in this area, not least as a result of the Live Music
Act, championed by the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones. I was going to
say that the issue of visas for musicians seems to be less vexed than
it has been, although two noble Lords have mentioned that as a
continuing concern.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T18:00:59"></hs_TimeCode>I would mention
two specific issues in the hope that the Minister will be able to
comment on them. The first relates to VAT. The UK is one of only four
EU countries that do not take advantage of the option to apply a
reduced rate of VAT on visitor accommodation and one of only nine to
apply the full rate on admissions to cultural attractions. So tourism,
our sixth largest export industry, is the only one subject to VAT.
Other countries, including competitors such as France and Germany, have
gained additional investment, employment, particularly of younger
people who are disproportionately represented in the tourism sector,
and growth through applying reduced VAT rates in this area. It has been
calculated that every pound invested by the Treasury in this way would
generate £18 of extra inbound tourism revenue and other
significant growth
benefits.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071180000161" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0003.htm#13071180000161">The
second issue relates to the carriage of musical instruments on
aeroplanes. Musicians need to travel to perform, quite often by air.
Yet there is no consistent policy about carrying even smaller
instruments on airlines, and the ISM has collected more than 1,350
individual reports of difficulties faced by musicians when travelling
with their instruments, including cases of valuable instruments being
damaged beyond repair. I appreciate the Government’s reluctance
to intervene in commercial matters, but even if they do not go as 
<?notus-xml column=508?>far as the US Government, which have now issued regulations to allow
small musical instruments as hand baggage, they could at least put
pressure on airlines to follow the welcome lead of easyJet in this
area.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071180000162" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0003.htm#13071180000162">This
debate focuses on the contribution of music tourism and the economic
benefits that that can bring, but let us not lose sight of the ultimate
value of music, as described in a quote attributed to Plato in the
<I>Times</I> last month. Sadly, I have not been able to track down
where he said, “Music is a moral law. It gives a soul to the
universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination, a charm to
sadness, and life to everything. It is the essence of order, and leads
to all that is good, just and beautiful, of which it is the invisible,
but nevertheless dazzling, passionate and eternal form”. We need
more of that in the UK, even if it does not bring such significant
tourism benefits with
it.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T18:03:18"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_11_PT_1/2F2AC87B30BDAE0281DD00F3054D1874C6CDE66A" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 11 July 2013">Thursday,

noble Lord, Lord Storey, on securing this debate. The noble Lord, Lord
Clement-Jones, mentioned the iconic Rolling Stones concert in Hyde Park

music is not only important but a much underrated offer that we make to
the rest of the world through tourism. When people come here for music
tourism, they engage in making community and in being joined with
others in a common culture through hearing a common language. Such
things are very important for us to offer across the world as well as
across the regions in this country. It is important that we do not just
measure its significance in terms of economic impact, although that is
important, but that we recognise a cultural, human hinterland that is
enriched from Plato onwards and we must be proud of it and contribute
to it.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13071180000165" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0003.htm#13071180000165">The
VisitBritain document, <I>Delivering a Golden Legacy</I>, identifies
four principles to encourage this kind of tourism. The first is to
recognise our international image, which is about heritage, arts and
music—as the noble Lord, Lord Black, mentioned. The second is to
develop an overall product so that performance, hotels, shopping and
local businesses are all connected. The third is to be ambitious in our
invitation and the variety that we offer. Fourthly, tourism needs to be
embedded in other strategies for other sectors. Many noble Lords have
spoken in this debate to illustrate some of those
principles<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T18:05:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071180000166" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0003.htm#13071180000166">The
UK Music report, <I>Destination: </I><I>Music</I>, starts, as did the
noble Lord, Lord Storey, in his speech, with Glastonbury. The research
is based on concerts and events of 5,000 people or more. That is very
important, but I want, in just a few brief words, to go to two other
areas which fall below the radar of that kind of scale but which show
the importance of music and culture for
tourism<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T18:05:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071180000167" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0003.htm#13071180000167">They
both come from the east Midlands, which is where I operate and which
has the exact national average proportion of music tourists—that
is, 5% of the tourist mix. We need to increase that of course. The
first area is the story of the Buxton Opera House and the Buxton
Festival. If any noble Lords are looking 
<?notus-xml column=509?>for some wonderful entertainment this weekend, I can tell them that the
Buxton Festival is still in operation—you can go to its website.
In 1976, a fairly decrepit building with “Opera House”
over its door was on the verge of being turned into a cinema. Three
years later, by 1979, local residents together with the Royal Northern
College of Music and the Welsh National Opera—contacts in those
places—opened the first Buxton Festival. It now has a turnover
of £1.4 million and receives only 10% of its income from grants.
I want to emphasise that, because many people look at the arts,
especially music, and think that it needs very heavy subsidy. In fact,
a mere 10% of the building’s running costs enable a turnover of
£2 million into the local economy. We are not asking a great
deal, but strategic investment can create such opportunities locally
for music tourism to
flourish<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T18:06:57"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Buxton Festival works through a partnership between local enterprise,
VisitEngland, Visit Peak District and local
businesses<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T18:07:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071180000168" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0003.htm#13071180000168">Of
course, the opera house has to be very nimble in what it offers because
it needs to run all year. It runs a programme that includes everything
from Abba tribute concerts to opera and all the things in between. It
has to be nimble and offer a very catholic range of
music<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T18:07:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071180000169" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0003.htm#13071180000169">I
have told this story because it has moved from 1979 to 2015, which is
the projected opening date for the Buxton Crescent and spa
hotel—a crescent that has been carefully restored and will
become a hotel destination for international tourists in that part of
England in 2015. It has taken all that time, from 1979 to 2015, to
establish a festival, to establish international links and for there to
be a demand to come and stay in that kind of quality of
accommodation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T18:08:01"></hs_TimeCode>. I
therefore urge the Government to take seriously not only the regions
and the small scale but the need for secure and sustained support for
such incremental growth that will be the backbone of a national policy
for music
tourism<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T18:08:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071180000170" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0003.htm#13071180000170">The
second area that I want to mention but which, again, does not feature
in the most recent report of UK Music is of course—and you would
expect me to say this from these Benches—church music and
especially cathedral music. We have recently launched in Derbyshire a
diocesan tourism website, because churches are a key part of the fabric
of the tourism offer and we need to be organised to present them
attractively. A key bit of that is music, because churches are among
the few places that you can go where there will be a guarantee of music
of some sort or other. Just this last weekend, in the parish of New
Mills, we have had a festival of choirs—five choirs making the
festival over the weekend. On the same weekend, in a parish called
Fairfield, there was a five-day music festival with blues, the vicar
getting together an impromptu jamming band and all kinds of music to
bring people in. Our cathedral, like others, has an extensive programme
of concerts, organ recitals and lunchtime
events.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071180000171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0003.htm#13071180000171">I go
to a lot of these things and I spent 10 years working in a cathedral.
Something that strikes me all the time is that when one goes to the
door after a concert, particularly of the English choral tradition, it
is people from overseas who want to say how amazing that kind of music
is. It is something they rarely experience live in other cultures. The
English choral 
<?notus-xml column=510?>tradition and English church music are a great jewel in our musical
armoury and we need to ensure, as part of a tourist offer, that we can
make them available and support them in small ways. That 10% investment
in the Buxton Festival is an example of how small support can create
stability, incremental growth and an attractive
offer.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071180000172" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0003.htm#13071180000172">I
invite the Minister to comment not just on the large-scale music offer
to tourists but on how the Government can encourage support for
smaller-scale events such as the Buxton Festival and for the English
choral tradition and English church music, something that is unique and
right at the heart of how we are perceived internationally in terms of
heritage, art and music culture. How can we make that a key part of
what we offer? I want to finish by reiterating that I think our musical
heritage is a key ingredient for encouraging international tourism. In
an age of terror and despair, we have a rich gift to offer and we must
do all we can to make it available and to secure its
sustainability.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13071180000260" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0003.htm#13071180000260"><I><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T18:11:06"></hs_TimeCode></I>6.11

Haskel:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, congratulate the noble Lord on
organising this music fest. The noble Lord, Lord Storey, told us that
now is the time when music tourism is at its busiest. I quote the words
of the Minister for Culture, Communications and Creative Industries, Ed
Vaizey, who said
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13071180000240" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0003.htm#13071180000240">“our

the noble Lord, Lord Storey, also reminded us, when responding to a
debate last month in your Lordships’ House, the Minister told us
that four in 10 leisure visitors to the UK cite heritage and culture as
the primary motivation for their visit. This means that in 2011 more
than 10 million inbound visitors to the UK engaged in some form of arts
and culture. How much is related to music? UK Music commissioned
research from Bournemouth University’s International Centre for
Tourism and Hospitality Research. It told us that music contributes
£864 million a year to the national economy with an amazing
19,700 full-time jobs. This, of course, includes all kinds of music. My
particular interest is in tourism and classical music, partly because I
have always felt that festivals of classical music are less disruptive
and classical music tourists seem to spend more and stay longer. Also,
like the noble Lord, Lord Aberdare, I just like classical
music.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13071180000175" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0003.htm#13071180000175">There
are classical music festivals all over the country. The Manchester
International Festival is on at the moment. The Proms start tomorrow.
Music festivals at Edinburgh and our other great cities certainly
attract people who would not normally come. The noble Lord, Lord
Storey, told us about Liverpool and there are a large number of smaller
music events at stately homes, churches and cathedrals, and other
buildings in towns and villages. My noble friend Lady Liddell told us
about such events in Scotland and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop
of Derby told us about the festival in Buxton, which I attended last
year. All of this illustrates the power of music to increase the number
of people who come to a tourist destination.</hs_para>

England is aware of this. It is investing £3 million in cultural
destinations to boost international and domestic tourism to
these special places, both to stimulate the local economies and to
provide visitors with world-class cultural experiences. Surely one such
destination is Aldeburgh, a place mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord
Aberdare. Of course, Aldeburgh would attract tourists without music
because it is a charming seaside town on the Suffolk coast in an area
of outstanding natural beauty, but music has transformed it into a
world-class cultural and learning centre that attracts tourists
throughout the year, contributing to the excellence of our musicians,
about which the noble Lord, Lord Black,
spoke<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T18:15:02"></hs_TimeCode>. Music
sustains a whole infrastructure of places to stay, eat, shop, play and
hear music, learn and improve musical skills and develop talent, as
well as all the other fringe activities—and all this with the
attraction of being in an area of outstanding natural
beauty<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T18:15:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

to make is that 66 years ago the festival was started by Benjamin
Britten and Peter Pears as a two-week event. Through hard work and
clever and innovative management, Aldeburgh now attracts tourists not
just for the two weeks of the festival but throughout the year. There
is a prom season during August for holidaymakers, with proms featuring
every kind of music. There are residences, masterclasses and orchestral
and vocal development courses, and all of these involve concerts and
are themselves a tourist attraction because of their
excellence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T18:16:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Clement-Jones, spoke of the need for hard facts. I shall give him some.
To give a measure of what happens at Aldeburgh, the number of tickets
sold during the two-week festival is 25,000. The number of tickets sold
through the year is 100,000, music bringing tourism all year round, and
not only from Britain. At this year’s festival alone, audiences
were from more than 20 countries. Some 117 journalists visited the
festival, with 43 from abroad representing 16 countries.</hs_para>

Minister will join me in welcoming this successful model and
congratulate the staff on turning a two-week festival into a year-round
attraction. However, that has not been easy. First, Aldeburgh is away
from the amenities of London and other major cities. Secondly,
overnight the Government removed its co-ordinating structure, the only
one available in this rural area, by abolishing the regional
development agency. It was abolished at a time when the year-long
Britten centenary celebrations, as well as all the other activities,
were being planned in association with various arts organisations, the
BBC, tourist organisations, schools, transport and the 101 other things
that you need to co-ordinate arts and tourism successfully—just
the kind of local co-ordination about which the noble Lord, Lord
Clement-Jones,
spoke<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T18:17:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13071180000180" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0003.htm#13071180000180">Therefore, in addition
to planning the music, a new organisation had to be set up—a
destination management organisation to promote tourism on the Suffolk
coast. Indeed, Aldeburgh Music must be one of the few arts
organisations, and perhaps the first, to become involved in setting up
such an organisation. Yes, the work is being endorsed by the Norfolk
and Suffolk local enterprise partnership, but it is new and still
pretty embryonic. 
<?notus-xml column=512?>Perhaps the regional development agency had its faults but, instead of
removing it on an ideological whim, the right thing to do was to
rectify the faults and maybe reinvent the RDA to build on what was
there. I hope that the Minister can assure me that in future more
thought will be put into these changes, and that the institution that
is now being built up will be sufficiently independent so as not to
become a political plaything with an uncertain lifespan but, hopefully,
can look forward to 10 or 20 years of life to develop arts, heritage,
culture and tourism on the Suffolk

Liddell said that we have to do better. That may mean money but, in the
overall scheme of thing the amounts of money are small. So I have two
suggestions. They have been made before. After taking money from the
lottery for the Olympics, I hope that the Government will review the
lottery distribution and be generous to music. There is also the
question of tourism and VAT, as mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord
Aberdare. The Government are looking for growth. As other noble Lords
have spoken, I have tried to show how music and tourism can deliver
this. I hope the Minister will tell us how the Government will enable
this. The right reverend Prelate reminded us that music raises our
quality of life. There is another advantage. Music has shown itself to

Berkeley of Knighton:</Member></B> My Lords, it has been extremely
pleasant to hear such endorsements of the profession of which I am
delighted to be a member. I started off with a score in mind, but this
concert, so ably conducted by the noble Lord, Lord Storey, has been
through virtually all the possible movements. I am reminded that music
is essentially a form of variation; everything is a variation of what
has gone before. So I have torn up my score and I will, like all good

Storey, mentioned the Proms, which are about to begin, so for my first
variation I would like to talk about the BBC, which I broadcast for and
on which I have had my music played. I would like to compliment Roger
Wright and his predecessor Nicholas Kenyon not only on building
incredibly successful seasons, but on taking music into different
spheres, whether they be film music, jazz, popular music or the
musical. It is important that we are an all-embracing

extraordinary work across various networks. However, I have always felt
that praise is more credible if it is balanced by criticism. On this
particular day, and on behalf of so many people who work for the BBC on
the shop floor, I must say how outraged I am to read that, when those
of us who work there are being cut back on the programme-making side,
absolutely staggering sums have been given as golden handshakes. It is
essential that the public have confidence in the BBC. They must know
that when people get it wrong, whether in the Civil Service, the
Government or the BBC, they are not simply moved sideways, but pay the
price that most people have to if they make a huge mistake. Margaret
Hodge has done a very fine job in focusing on this particular subject 
<?notus-xml column=513?>and holding people to account. My noble friend Lord Hall, with whom I
worked very closely at the Royal Opera House, is now the
Director-General. If anyone can turn that around, he will. The BBC is
worth saving because it is a marvellous ship. The world—I say

couple of specifics. I would like to look at some of the ways in which
music is allied to other arts, an example of which would be dancing. I
was very much involved with the Royal Ballet and in fact I still am.
One of the great problems we had at the Royal Ballet School was to do
with visas. It was so difficult to allow young students to dance on the
main stage. It is absolutely crazy that young people who are really
gifted come into your school, but you are prevented from letting them
get the experience they need on the main stage, either at the Royal
Opera House or the Royal Ballet, because of what are essentially visa
restrictions. I would ask the Minister to look at that. I know that
some progress has been made, so I feel that there is a conversation
carrying on.</hs_para>

particular tack of asking the Minister to follow up on a couple of
things, I will also mention the British Academy of Songwriters,
Composers and Authors, which represents everyone from Paul McCartney to
Harrison Birtwistle. When somebody wants to commission a
composer—I had a conversation about this with one of your
Lordships recently—they say, “I have no idea what it
costs to commission a piece of music”. The BBC is wonderful at
this, but we need to disseminate music—to Buxton, to small
groups, to churches and cathedrals, so that the new music being created
will be the music of tomorrow. When someone goes to the academy, which
is our representative, and asks, “Can you give us some idea of
how much money is involved?”, it has to answer,
“We’re not allowed to tell you”. That is because
the Office of Fair Trading has said, “Because you are not a
union, you cannot give guidelines”—and they are only
guidelines. I cannot believe that a Conservative Government feel that
this is right. However, because our representatives are not a union,
they are not allowed to give guidelines for fees. If that could be

talked earlier about the regions. It is very easy to talk about the
Proms and the Royal Opera House, so it was lovely to hear comments from
all over the country—from Scotland, for example—about how
important music is. We heard about Plato, and of course there is
Socrates, who towards the end of his life intimated that rather than be
a philosopher, perhaps he really should have been a composer. Music, in
its abstraction, can do something that takes us further inside

British Council has been mentioned. The work that is done overseas is
terribly important. I am sorry to reference this to myself, but it is
difficult not to. I was in Rome because the British Council had helped
to put on a performance of an opera I had done with Ian McEwan; the
British ambassador was incredibly helpful. That would not have happened
without these people holding hands. I loved something that happened 
<?notus-xml column=514?>to Ian McEwan and me—of course, he is a far more famous person.
We were walking through the streets of Rome and got lost while looking
for a restaurant. Here is an example of British success. A Vespa
screamed to a halt. “Ian McEwan!” said the driver. Ian
was very taken aback. “I love your books”, the man said.
“Is there is anything I can do for you?”
“Yes”, Ian said. “You can tell us how to get to a
particular restaurant that we’ve been looking for for three
hours<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T18:27:28"></hs_TimeCode>”.
The fact that the arts are recognised abroad is terribly important.
However, a recent UK survey shows that of London households, 36% had
been to an orchestral concert more than once, although that is over a
period of six years, it has to be said. I find that fantastic. The
equivalent figure for other ticketed arts events is 21%. That is an
amazing achievement which speaks volumes about what I feel that music

has to be protected, but it is an area where we speak to a huge
audience. I think of people like John Taverner or Arvo Pärt
whose music can hold people; it is a way of connecting to something
higher. You do not need to believe in God to feel that you are
experiencing something that transcends everyday life. I have had some
marvellous experiences in places like Durham and Ely, Westminster
Cathedral, Westminster Abbey and St Paul’s, where great
architecture and great music combine to lift the soul in a quite
staggering way. This surely is part of what tourists also find
marvellous about this country. Which other countries have quite the

Stevenson of Balmacara:</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate the noble
Lord, Lord Storey, on securing this debate and thank all noble Lords
for their contributions. I should declare an interest, I suppose: I am
a participant in the subject of this debate since I sing in the
Parliament Choir, which is well known for attracting tourists to come
and listen to us. I also sing in a festival choir, which gathers for a
week and sings in a glorious cathedral of the type mentioned by the
right reverend Prelate. I mention this only because it also has a
tourist dimension which I do not think has been widely noticed yet.
There seems to be a growth in choral tourism. When we sat down on the
first day to rehearse the Mozart “Requiem” we were about
to deliver we were joined by three substantial Russian contraltos who
told us that they spent their lives going round the globe singing in
such events. They popped up everywhere and after they had sung in our
event they were going to Salzburg to sing in the Mozart
“Requiem” that was being performed there. There is a
tourism aspect to all aspects of music.</hs_para>

debate and I have noticed that there is a tendency among those who
participate—not that I wish to decry it in any sense —to
indulge in a tour d’horizon of their favourite tourist spots or,
in this case, the events they have enjoyed on a trip around the UK.
This debate did not disappoint. We have a glorious range of
opportunities, starting in Liverpool, reaching far up to Scotland and
spending quite a lot of time in East Anglia. This is all to the good.
We learn a lot more about what we should be doing in this
House.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071180000193" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0003.htm#13071180000193">Tourism
is exceptionally important to the UK economy. It is the sixth largest
industry, third largest export earner, and accounts for around 9% of
employment if its indirect impacts are taken into account. It generates
more than £3 billion in tax for HM Treasury. It is a very
interesting industry because it has quite wide economic effects. It
employs a lot of non-full-time workers and more women than men. The
proportion of jobs in tourism is much higher in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland than it is in England and it encourages
entrepreneurship as there are some 200,000 SMEs in the tourism sector,
most with a very low turnover but still making a
contribution.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071180000194" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0003.htm#13071180000194">Of

between people. No less a person than the Chinese former leader Hu
Jintao regretted the fact that although Chinese economic power was huge
the soft cultural power still resides with Europe, in particular in
Britain. It is something we have to account of and it is distinctively
different from any other sector of the economy.</hs_parafo>

mentioned, particularly those sponsored by the noble Lord, Lord Lee of
Trafford, who has been a stalwart in this area, we have covered some of
the problems affecting the tourism sector. As the noble Lord, Lord
Clement-Jones, reminded us, there is a need for a joined-up approach in
government. Tourism is exceptional in the degree to which it cuts
across different policy areas, organisations, government departments
and geographic areas. The industry would like to see a cross-government
co-ordination group, particularly on regulation. I would be grateful if
the Minister might refer to that when she sums up.</hs_para>

brought up the problem of air passenger duty, which needs to be

about the way promotion of tourism is going. The current Great campaign

believed right across the industry, and we have heard it today, that
British music has the ability to help VisitBritain achieve its goal of
9 million more tourists by 2020, but the debate actually asks the

music on tourism. In other words, what is the structure under which

noble Lord, Lord Black, reminded us that if the Government are to will
the end they must also will the means. We have heard that we need a
strategy to maintain our advantage in music tourism and to support the
industry that drives it. That includes, I think, the points made by the
noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, about the Digital Economy Act and the
issue that has been raised more recently in relation to the
Intellectual Property Bill about the rather damaging split between the
approach being taken by the DCMS and that now being taken by BIS. Can
more be done with UKTI? That is an important issue, because that aspect
of support and underpinning of export potential is very
important.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071180000200" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-0003.htm#13071180000200">We
need a skills and training regime that ensures that a new generation of
the people who actually do the work in many music activities—the
riggers, the technicians and managers, as well as, of course,
musicians—are supported. What do the Government plan on that?
There is also a need to access specialist finance to ensure new
music-related businesses develop and flourish. We know that bank
lending is down, but what about the special additional problems posed
in the hit-based industries, such as music and

problem at the root of some of these issues is that it is very
difficult to get a proper measure for the success or otherwise of the
industry. Current SIC and SOC codes, which give us the national
economic picture, are totally inadequate for music, especially live
music. The millions of jobs supported by live music are coded in many
different ways. According to ONS data, of the 10,000 businesses
represented by PRS for Music and PPL, only 14% were accurately coded by
ONS in the national accounts. That is something that the Minister

Lords are right to emphasise the importance of both music and tourism.
This morning, I see that the new inbound tourism figures from
VisitBritain show that the tourism spend in Britain was 5% higher than
in May last year, which is very encouraging. The ONS tourism satellite
account shows that in 2009 tourism direct gross value added—and
I asked my son, who does economics, what that meant—was
£45 billion. Thus the tourism sector is approximately
five times larger than the agricultural sector and about half the size
of the construction sector. Further work 
<?notus-xml column=517?>by Deloitte suggests that, if the indirect economic effects of tourism
are also included, gross value added could be as high as £115
billion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T18:37:11"></hs_TimeCode>.

rich culture marks us apart in the world, as the noble Baroness, Lady
Liddell, and others have emphasised. Music from classical to rock is a

here. It forms a major theme of the GREAT campaign, which is the

report, <I>Destination Musi</I><I>c</I>, published in May
2011—the first study of its kind—highlighted the
important economic contribution of music festivals and major concerts
to tourism throughout the United Kingdom. The study revealed that they
attract nearly 8 million visits from those defined as music tourists
who spend £1.4 billion during the course of their trip. While
domestic tourists make up the majority of these audiences, the
contribution of overseas visitors, who spend up to four times as much
per capita during their visits, is also very important.</hs_para>

read that report with great interest and noted the regional differences
in the types of music that attract tourists in. It is not surprising
that in London, as my noble friend Lord Black emphasised, classical
music and musicals play a key part. Elsewhere, it may be festivals but
in the north-east, for example, it is concerts rather than festivals.
The noble Lord, Lord Aberdare, 
<?notus-xml column=518?>noted many across Wales and elsewhere and the need to study this
further. UK Music has contributed to our understanding of this. The
noble Lord, Lord Black, spoke of the need to support music teaching in

are supporting these sectors. According to UK Music, many festival
organisers credit the Government’s Licensing Act, which assisted
in streamlining the local authority licensing process for big events,
with helping to double numbers of music festivals over the past decade.
My noble friend Lord Clement-Jones’s Live Music Act extended the
range of live music performances that can take place without a licence
and we are committed to doing more. My noble friend Lord Clement-Jones
noted that we will extend the audience limit for some events at small

visas. We are of course continually seeking to improve our visa system
to balance the need to protect the UK with a strong desire to ensure
that requirements are as clear and straightforward as possible. I thank
the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, for recognising the efforts that we are
making. I should point out that we are looking at improving the
pre-entry visa experience as part of our tourism strategy. Our visa
applications are now translated for the first time into the local
languages of our key markets—namely, into Arabic, Chinese,
Hindi, Russian, Turkish and Thai. I am astonished that that was not the
case previously. We had a target of delivering 90% of online
applications by December 2012, which has been exceeded. At present,
more than 95% of applications are carried out online. I can assure

Clement-Jones and Lord Storey, and the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson,
asked about a national strategy for music. I can assure my noble

organisations that work closely together to further the interests of
our music sectors. The Arts Council’s strategy, set out in
<I>Achieving Great Art for Everyone</I>, includes music as an integral
part of our creative industries. It is also well represented on the
Creative Industries Council. We also have our national plan for music
education, which delivers £196 million for music education hubs.
In February this year, the Arts Council and VisitEngland announced a
strategic partnership outlining priority areas on which the two
organisations will work together. Music is integral to our GREAT

Lords, these government amendments propose a change to the Warm Homes
and Energy Conservation Act in order to put in place a new, rigorous
and flexible framework for measuring the Government’s progress
in tackling fuel poverty in England. As we move forward with ensuring a
safe, low-carbon future we must ensure that everybody is able to
benefit from our policies.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13071174000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000004">Last year, Professor
Hills completed his independent review of fuel poverty and concluded
that we had been measuring the problem in the wrong way. Our concern
about how we measure fuel poverty has been driven by wanting to address
the problem more
effectively.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071174000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000005">High
levels of fuel poverty a decade or so ago were masked by official
figures that suggested the problem had been solved. The sensitivity to
energy prices of the definition, creating an ever changing picture of
the households who are fuel poor, makes designing and implementing
effective policies extremely difficult. We want to learn the lessons of
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071174000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000006">We will
therefore be adopting the new definition of fuel poverty proposed by
Professor Hills. This finds a household to be fuel poor if it is below
the official poverty line and if it has higher than typical energy
costs. It is a more accurate measure of the problem. It brings the
major advantage of telling us not only how many fuel-poor households
there are but how badly affected each household is. This will help us
target policies much more effectively, as our recently published
<I>Fuel Poverty: A Framework for Future Action </I>attests. Although
this new definition is rightly at the centre of our proposals, it is
clear that a single indicator is not sufficient to give us an
understanding of this complex problem. We therefore intend to monitor
fuel poverty through a number of key indicators.</hs_para>

conclusions of the Hills review was that fuel poverty is a long-term
structural problem, requiring an ongoing effort to mitigate it. 
<?notus-xml column=131?>The current framework does not reflect this, focused as it is on
ensuring that no person lives in fuel poverty, as far as reasonably
practicable. We want to address this problem with the current framework
by adopting a new target focused on improving the energy efficiency of
the homes of the fuel poor. In this way we can ensure that our efforts
are directed towards a key cause of high energy bills and make a real
difference to people who are struggling to keep warm.</hs_para>

sets a duty for the Secretary of State to have an objective to address
fuel poverty and for the details of this new target to be specified in
regulations, rather than in primary legislation as it is currently. The
regulations must set out the form of that target, the level that will
be achieved and the date by which this will be done. The secondary
legislation must be brought forward within six months of the provisions
entering into force. The amendment also maintains the duty on the
Secretary of State to have in place a fuel poverty strategy but makes
this duty consistent with the new objective.</hs_para>

provisions to be clear on the territorial extent of the amendments,
where our proposals would apply to England only, and the commencement
date for the provisions, which will be two months after the Act
receives Royal
Assent.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071174000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000010">While
we want to give the new target statutory backing, it would not be wise
to set it in primary legislation. We need to be flexible in our
approach to fuel poverty as we reform the electricity market, seek to
drive the uptake of renewable heat in our homes, and bring about major
improvements in energy efficiency standards through the Green Deal and
ECO. We therefore think it appropriate for the details of the target to
be set in secondary legislation, subject to parliamentary debate and
the affirmative resolution of both
Houses.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071174000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000011">As
part of this change, we need to be realistic about how quickly we can
make progress. The current target is 2016. The interventions necessary
to address the problem as we understand it cannot be undertaken within
that timeframe. The needs of the fuel poor must continue to be
championed after that date. A sensible approach for the future is to
align our efforts on fuel poverty with the action we are taking more
widely in tackling climate change. As my noble friend Lord Deben knows,
the Committee on Climate Change already has a responsibility to monitor
the Government’s approach to fuel poverty. The two issues go
hand in
hand.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071174000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000012">Our
amendments will allow us to bring forward proposals for a new target,
including its precise form and level, and a date for its
accomplishment. We will ensure that the determination and insights of
those on the front line, working day in and day out to help alleviate
fuel poverty, are reflected in our
approach.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071174000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000013">We
want to make sure that the target bites. Our amendments therefore
retain the key primary duty to have a fuel poverty strategy that sets
out how we will meet our future target. Our amendments require us to
set interim targets that will ensure that we stay on 

<?notus-xml column=132?>track along the way. Our recently published <I>Fuel Poverty: a
</I><I>Framework for Future Action</I> already sets out a direction of
travel and underlines our commitment to tackling fuel poverty in a
meaningful
way.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071174000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000014">I welcome
the support that our announcements and proposed amendments received
from the chair of the Fuel Poverty Advisory Group and the chief
executive of National Energy Action, given their expertise on the
issue. I understand that there may be some who are concerned by a
significant change to the long-standing fuel poverty framework set out
in the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act. By fixing a framework
for the long term, the amendments ensure that, far from ceasing to be
of concern in 2016, fuel poverty will remain high on the
Government’s agenda throughout the delivery of our ambitious
programme for energy efficiency and the energy sector in the
UK.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071174000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000015">Our
amendments provide for an ongoing focus on helping low-income,
vulnerable households keep warm, and will help them stay ahead in the

Jenkin of Roding:</Member></B> My Lords, I will make a few comments on
what my noble friend said. The first is that we are extremely grateful
to her and to the officials working with her for the briefing that some
of us had fairly late last evening. All this was sprung on us at fairly
short notice. The White Paper, <I>Fuel Poverty: a Framework for Future
Action</I>, which is an immensely worthwhile document, contains a
wealth of material. It is not always easy in a debate of this kind to
do justice to it. It has been backed up by a paper produced in response
to the
consultation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071174000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000017">As
the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, said in our debate on Tuesday when we
discussed the problem of bills, not all of this is new. We have been
aware of the Hills report, to which my noble friend referred, and the
consultation paper. There were a good many responses to the
consultation, which were referred to in the Government’s
response. There is a wealth of material from which we can make an
assessment of what the measures are likely to
produce.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071174000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000018">The
first thing I will say on this is that the Government have been wise to
recognise that the methodology of the previous fuel poverty
target—how it was measured and what the appropriate responses
were—has now really been shown to be wanting. That has
inevitably meant that, in the light of Professor Hills’s report,
that target and the methodology that accompanied it must be changed. I
welcome very much what the Government now propose as the approach to
this. It is not just a question of energy prices and relative incomes.
There is far more to it than that. Without going into all the details,
because I am sure noble Lords will have made their own studies of this,
it is clear that there is much more to be done. Indeed, it is only if
you measure the problem in an appropriate way that you can really
devise and decide on the necessary measures to deal with it. That is an
approach which I warmly
welcome<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:10:58"></hs_TimeCode>. If it
continues to be measured in the wrong way, of course the authorities
and the industry would be tempted 
<?notus-xml column=133?>to continue to use what have turned out to be often very ineffective
policies to deal with this, and would give a false view of the size and
severity of the
problem<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:11:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

approach. I have read some of the documents which have been issued in
the past day or two by the interest groups which represent the fuel
poor. Although some of them wisely recognise the merits of the new
approach, there has been an almost instinctive reaction of,
“Well, you are abandoning the targets and not putting anything
in their place”. My noble friend has indicated that her
amendment will in fact lead to new targets. The other complaint is that
it is not now going to be in statute, it will be in regulations. The
fact is that you are going to advance this policy properly, it will
have to be dealt with over time. That can only be done by regulations.
My noble friend’s amendment would introduce the power to do so.
I have never read an amendment which includes the phrase “The
Secretary of State must” so many times. This will be a
considerable reassurance to those who have been anxious that the
Government are in some way weakening in their policy on this. They are
not. It is a very real social policy leading to considerable hardship.
Anyone who has represented constituents recently or in the past will be
aware of the problem. Of course, it has got so much more difficult with
rising

which stems from the Hills report is distinctly complicated. I found
myself on Tuesday night trying to understand some of the charts in the
White Paper. A particular chart on page 18 required having a fair
number of towels around one’s head to try to understand it; I
think that I fell asleep over it. The Minister’s officials were
able to describe the meaning of some of this in our meeting yesterday.
It illustrates the complexity of the problem that has been dealt with.
There are all sorts of reasons why some households suffer from acute
fuel poverty. They need to be examined in all their detail. This is
what the department has tried to do with the help of Professor
Hills’s report. We shall have to see how successful that
is<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:14:16"></hs_TimeCode>. I had not
realised what a difference it makes whether you are connected to the
gas grid or not. Yet the figures in the chart show clearly that that is
a major factor. If you do not have access to mains gas, you are far
more likely to be in serious fuel
poverty<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:27:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13071174000150" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000150">2.15

course, everybody knows that cavity wall insulation and loft insulation
are of very considerable help in reducing your fuel bills. That is the
basis for the whole of the Green Deal policy. Noble Lords may wish to
look at that and how far it is getting, but I have always had doubts
about whether the golden rule is ever going to be able to be
sufficiently identified; the golden rule being that you borrow the
money to make those improvements and you repay it back out of the
savings in fuel bills that you will have had. I should confess that I
have had cavity wall filling and loft filling. Recently I invested in a
new condensing boiler. The advantage for a couple of elderly people is
that we can keep our house rather warmer and the effect on the bills is
that they are perhaps not as high as they otherwise would have been.
However, there are some 
<?notus-xml column=134?>quite serious questions to be asked there. For some, it is a question of
whether you have central heating and so on. It is all spelled out in
this chart and at some stage it would be jolly nice to have a detailed
description of what that actually shows. However, it indicates the
complexity of the problem with which the Government have been
dealing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071174000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000022">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:19:35"></hs_TimeCode>
was impressed yesterday evening by the descriptions and information
given by the officials in charge of this. They really seem to
understand what they are talking about. However, there is no question
but that we will need to wait to see whether this is going to, one
might say, cut the mustard. Will defining the measures better and
tailoring them to it better help deal with the problem? When one is
changing things, as one has to here—I hope I have indicated my
view on that—it is impossible to stick to a target based on an
old and obviously unsatisfactory methodology. The amendment makes it
perfectly clear that the Government have to find new targets and do so
within a reasonable time. That is something that we can
support<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:17:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071174000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000023">Before
I sit down, I will mention one point that I raised yesterday evening.
The Minister will therefore be aware of this. I have had immediate
representations from the National Grid, which asked whether the change
in methodology, or the change in the definition, will affect its
investment policy, particularly in respect of extending the gas grid to
communities which do not yet have it. It has a policy on this and has
an investment programme broadly based on the old definition and the old
methodology. This is something that will need to be examined very
quickly. In responding to the ENA and its policy director, Tony Glover,
after our meeting last night, I said that I got the impression that the
department would be very willing to have probably not just one meeting
but several to really thrash this out so that the networks can know
exactly what they are going to be asked to do. It is clear, as I said
earlier, that whether you are connected to the gas main is a major
indicator of whether you are likely to suffer from fuel poverty. I
think that National Grid and the various gas networks will try to do
their very best to meet that requirement. However, they need to be
satisfied that they are, as it were, reflecting the new definition of
fuel poverty, the new target and the new methods that will be needed to
deal with it. That may be a detail, but on the basis of the chart I
referred to, it is quite an important
issue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071174000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000024">Finally<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:19:35"></hs_TimeCode>,
I very much welcome this new approach. The Government deserve support
for carrying it through and I hope that the Committee will fell able to
give that support. It will need to be sold and presentation is very
important. People need to be confident that the Government’s
intention on this issue is as firm as that of previous Governments.
However, I am sure that my noble friend and her honourable and right

case<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:19:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071174000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000025"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Liddell of Coatdyke" PimsId="5793" UID="13071174000159" xid="2063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000159">Baroness
Liddell of Coatdyke:</Member></B> My Lords, I will be brief. I welcome
the proposed new clause. Unfortunately, I did not have the opportunity
to attend the briefing yesterday evening but wish to make a couple of
points. I have had a lifetime’s involvement in fuel poverty,
having come from an area where the fuel poor are always with us.
Sometimes one of the key things you 
<?notus-xml column=135?>need when dealing with fuel poverty is not fancy targets or models but a
soupçon of common sense. This is one of the areas that troubles
me about the Green Deal. If you are expecting the fuel poor to
front-end facilitations to their house, for example, they are not going
to be able to do it because they cannot afford to do so. It is great
having a wonderful model that says, “If you up-front the
amendments to your accommodation, you will benefit in the
longer-term”. However, if you cannot afford to turn your heating
on, you are hardly going to be able to afford cavity wall
insulation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:22:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071174000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000026">I
make a plea for some basic common sense when dealing with this matter.
I heard the praise of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, for the fact that

the Secretary of State needs some enforcement powers to encourage the
industry to get involved actively in the campaign to move people out of
fuel poverty, unless he is going to go down to B&amp;Q and get a
hammer, nails and some insulating material. We need to have
enforcement. With this Bill, as always, a lot of the detail will be in
secondary legislation. Until we see the nuts and bolts of the secondary
legislation, we will not see whether my common-sense points will be
met. I welcome the proposed new clause and will read the secondary
legislation with interest when it comes along. However, I repeat that
common sense matters even more than targets in relation to this. I urge
officials to bear that common sense in mind when they craft the
secondary

O'Neill of Clackmannan:</Member></B> I am very happy to follow my noble
friend. The fight against fuel poverty in the past 10 to 15 years has
been bedevilled by loose definitions and arbitrary targets. The
amendment goes some way to mitigate concerns that have arisen about
that. It sticks in my craw to say this but the Government must be
praised for obtaining support for the measure from Derek Licorice, the
chair of the Fuel Poverty Advisory Group, and Jenny Saunders of the
NEA. The fact that people are giving understandably cautious support,
but none the less a blessing, for the measure is an indication that
Ministers have sought to build bridges on this issue. Known targets and
definitions have been taken away and a rather more complex Hills
approach has been adopted. That approach has its drawbacks but does
take account of the complexity of the situation. Therefore, it is
desirable to move forward not using the bludgeon of statutory change
but rather a regulatory approach, as that will enable subsequent
Ministers of whatever political complexion to adjust and calibrate the
policies.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071174000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000028">It
is also fair to say that for us in Opposition to try putting forward
amendments at this stage would be somewhat premature—although,
from what one can gather of the parliamentary timetable ahead of us, we
will have time, probably over the recess, to look at some of these
issues. Obviously, the statutory instrument and regulatory approach
will be the subject of consultation and discussion. One would hope that
that need not take an unduly long period. None the less, it will give
us some opportunity to look at the fine print of this.</hs_para>

happier about this if we were to see the colour of the
Government’s money, or indeed money at all from the Government.
Their approach to fuel poverty has been to withdraw state funding from
this and make it a tax on the consumer rather than on the country as a
whole. That is a flawed policy. It would not be difficult for the Green
Deal to become more successful than it is at present, but if it does
not become substantially better we will have to look again at the
Government providing funds for some of the major programmes that will
be required to address areas of fuel poverty. We are not talking about
individual households but street after street after street. If
approached on that basis, we could deal with an awful lot of the most
deep-seated areas which Hills recognises are the core of the
problem.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071174000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000030">As I
said, I do not wish to be grudging in my support for this approach.
There will obviously be difficulties and flaws but this is not the time
to identify them. The opportunity for that will come on Report and
beyond, when we have had time to digest some of the indigestible graphs
to which the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, referred. If we can do that, we
can perhaps make something of this. At the end of the day, somebody has
to pay for it. At the moment, that will fall in the main on the
shoulders of the consumer of gas and electricity. That is not a
satisfactory approach to social injustice on this scale. Even with the
Hills modification, the scale is intolerable for a society such as ours
to leave to some kind of slipshod market mechanism, the like of which
we have seen in the Green Deal. The Green Deal might work. It is the
only show in town but it will have to start working very quickly or
some of us will not be confident that the great ideas and reasoned
approach in this White Paper, these documents and expressed in this
amendment will be enough, without proper financial support, to tackle
the major social problem we have

of the climate change committee, which has a specific responsibility to
consider and concern itself with fuel poverty. It would be suitable for
me to say a few words about this. I am very pleased that the Government
have brought forward this amendment, not least because one of the
difficulties of advising on fuel poverty has been the very peculiar
mechanisms that we have used to measure it. To be able to measure it
more effectively, to have a proper and accepted basis, will help us
very much in giving advice. As noble Lords know, if you are a
scientifically based committee, it is quite hard to move from making
decisions on science, which is of course what we do, to making
decisions on measurements that would not stand up to any kind of
consideration from outside. This is a very good first step. All of us
acknowledge the fact that there is widespread support for the principle
but there is a lot to be worked through. I think most of us would agree
with what the noble Lord who just spoke
said.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071174000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000032">It is

want to emphasise
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:31:51"></hs_TimeCode> point he
raised about the national grid, not because I want to avoid the issue
of fuel poverty, but to remind the Government of the absolute necessity
of certainty when it comes to investment. When the Government
change—or appear to change—the basis upon which investors
have invested, it has a knock-on effect on all other investment. I
would say that, wouldn’t I? It is a very important issue,
however, because we know that if we are to have the long-term
investment, supply-chain investment and all the rest of it, certainty
is crucial. I hope the Government will take very seriously the issue
raised by my noble friend Lord Jenkin, because its knock-on effects are

second concern is that whatever happens here has a much wider effect,
not just on the investment basis, but because of the argumentation that
we have elsewhere. The climate change committee has welcomed the
possibility of our being able to frack for gas; we have made it clear
in our prognostications, targets and budgets, that there is a proper
place for gas in the portfolio of energy sources, not least for those
who are off-line and will need gas delivered to them. That is another
area. What the Government do in this part will therefore have an
important influence. I am always concerned about those who think that
there is a silver bullet; when I hear people talk about fracking, I
want to say to them that I am in favour of it but, for goodness’
sake, we should not assume the best and that everything will be
wonderful. There will be a place for it, but we need to look at how far
it will help us as regards fuel

Jenkin said how pleased he was that in this amendment the Government
keep saying that the “Secretary of State must”. I cannot
help reminding the Minister that there is another area where it says
the “Secretary of State may”, which is as important, if
not more so, than some of the areas that we have here. We would be
happier if “must” were more widely used and not
restricted to these particular amendments. I have to say to the
Minister that this is not an issue that I will allow to fall. It is
made more important by this proposal because it shows that, when the
Government want to ensure that certain things happen, they phrase a
proposal one way and, when they are less sure that they want certain
things to happen, they phrase it another. I hope that my noble friend
will understand that this is another piece of evidence in favour of the

it is important to apply our knowledge and understanding of connection
to the national grid to the rural areas of Britain. One of my worries
about the discussion of fuel poverty is that, because of the numbers,
it is concentrated in our urban areas. The noble Baroness, Lady
Liddell, referred to her own background in Coatdyke, which I
understand, but I remind the Committee that some of the worst fuel 
<?notus-xml column=138?>poverty in Britain comes thatched. That is why it is ignored—it

from a very rural area. I represented it for a very long time, during
which there was little improvement in fuel poverty. People lived in
sub-standard housing bought by their parents before the war at
practically no cost. Such housing is hugely valuable for incoming
Londoners to turn into a country cottage, but as a place to
live—at the end of a track with no possibility of getting

hope my noble friend will understand that I shall be taking a great
deal of interest in such people. Just because they are fewer in number,
and outside the mainstream, does not mean they should be ignored.
Thatch is no substitute for warmth when it comes to the winters you get
in the east of England, when the wind blows directly from Siberia.
Quite a few people living in that area come from Scotland, and they
remind us that it is a darn sight colder in the east of England than in
a lot of Scotland. However people do not remember that. So I hope my
noble friend will take the rural issue into account. I finish by saying
that I believe in common sense too, and we have to get our minds more

quickly to our pleas last week about fuel poverty. I welcome what we
have before us today. I think it is quite clear, as my noble friend
Lord Jenkin said, that unless we understand the problem properly we
cannot design effective solutions for it. I am particularly grateful to
my right honourable friend the Secretary of State, Ed Davey, for
pushing this within the coalition, and I am grateful that he has
managed to move it forward. My noble friend Lord Deben talked about
“may” and “must”: I think the answer is
that my right honourable friend managed to persuade them on one issue,
but not on the
other.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071174000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000040"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Deben" PimsId="5754" UID="13071174000163" xid="2031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000163">Lord

will try not to be repetitive, because I agree with many of the things
already said. I particularly welcome the fact that we are going to be
monitoring things as they go along, that there will not just be an end
target but targets in between, and we will see what is going on. The
Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act 2000, and the Home
Energy Conservation Act before it, were both Private Members’
Bills. One of the problems with Private Members’ Bills is that
they are not actually owned by the Government, and so they were not
part of a big department getting together and putting legislation
forward. Both those Bills suffered from that, because in many ways they
were allowed to just drift along. That is a slight exaggeration, but
the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act 2000, my own Act, drifted so
much so that at the end the 
<?notus-xml column=139?>previous Government wanted to get rid of it completely. When the
coalition Government came in—it was one in, one out—they
thought it was ripe for the picking. We pointed out that you need that
Bill if you are really into localism and are going to use local
authorities—another thing I welcome in this regard. Maybe we
will do a little better this time, because this has been an important
piece of work done by a government
department.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071174000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000043">I
commend to noble Lords the White Paper, <I>Fuel Poverty: a Framework

us because they were worried about one or two items that the noble
Lord, Lord O’Neill, pointed out. It will answer some of their
questions. This is not the final document and strategy. A more detailed

will highlight one or two things. Everybody has talked about properties
that are difficult to deal with for various technical reasons, but
something that has always bothered me is that a large number of the
fuel poor live in the private rented sector. Many things that we are
trying to do are much harder to do in the private rented sector. I hope
that, when the final strategy comes out, we can do something about
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071174000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000045">Some
concerns that people have raised include the fact that we are changing
the definition, and that it will be in secondary legislation. However,
my experience of definitions being in primary legislation, in
particular in the two Private Members’ Bills that became Acts
that I talked about, was that it did not make any difference. Even
though the target was in primary legislation, it seems that we are not
going to hit it, so we have had to do something else. Therefore,
history shows that that is not the total
answer.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071174000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000046">Many
people who contacted us were worried about what the priorities and
target dates will be. I hope that, as the noble Lord, Lord
O’Neill, said, we will be able to look into that before Report.
Clearly, a lot of detail will be in the final strategy, and we will be
able to make our
suggestions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071174000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000047">Another
area that has been mentioned is how we will pay for this and how we can
stop putting extra burdens on the fuel poor when we are trying to deal
with climate change and decarbonisation. The document indicates that
the Government are acutely aware of the issue, and that we need to look
at how to deal with it. Perhaps my noble friend will be able to
indicate some of the forward thinking on the issues that I have
raised.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071174000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000048">The
other area that I particularly welcome is the commitment to much more
cross-departmental working. That may be something we will touch on when
we debate the next amendment about something else. We hear this phrase
time and time again, but it does not always happen. Somewhere in the
document it says that the Government will set up a body to work across
departments. That has been tried in the past and has not been terribly
successful.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071174000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000049">I
will touch on one issue mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord
O’Neill, who talked about dealing with streets. One thing that
has been discovered by those 
<?notus-xml column=140?>looking at who is fuel poor is that quite often they are peppered around
streets. If you are trying to target your money at the fuel poor,
sometimes you do not succeed if you take whole streets. This is not a
worry with decarbonising, but trying to make money go around for the
fuel poor is complicated. This is slightly disappointing, because it
was talked about in the context of the Home Energy Conservation
Act.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071174000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000050">I will

tailor all the programmes to do something to these properties, and in

Whitty:</Member></B> I, too, thank the Minister for getting fuel
poverty into the Bill. Throughout the Commons proceedings, and the
earlier stages of the proceedings in this House, there was considerable
criticism that one of the major areas of concern in energy
policy—fuel poverty—was not reflected in the Bill. We now
have a clear indication of the way the Government are going on this. I
also join the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, and others in thanking the
Minister and her officials for trying to explain this somewhat complex
position to us last night. The penny may have dropped but I am not sure
the shillings have yet on all of
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071174000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000057">Indeed,
some of it is not clear and cannot be clear until the Government, in
six or eight months’ time, come up with a strategy and the
secondary regulations. I understand that. On the other hand, there are
some problems with the approach as so-far revealed. The Minister said
she wants to display a rigorous and flexible strategy under these
provisions. There is a slight danger of being too rigorous and complex
on definition and target issues and too flexible and unclear on what
the actual strategy will deliver. I will come back to some of those
points.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13071174000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000058">I
thank the Government for getting us here. However, we should not ignore
the fact that this is, for those of us who have been engaged in fuel
poverty and those who suffer from it, quite a sad point. Although most
of us have recognised that this has been the situation for some
considerable time, we have now explicitly recognised that the statutory
ambitions set, with all-party support, in the legislation originated by
the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, and the follow-through of 
<?notus-xml column=141?>that, have failed. That has implications for other targets that we set
in this area. There is a necessity to be rigorous in not only setting
targets but also checking, enforcing, reporting and adapting to any
failure to meet those targets, however difficult that might
seem.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071174000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000059">This is
also the point where we have accepted that achieving those statutory
targets is not easy. Previous statutory targets talked about the
eradication of fuel poverty. We have now abandoned that ambition and
substituted reduction, and a reduction that will be made in order of
priority. I understand why that is the Government’s position,
but in terms of the campaign on fuel poverty it is quite a serious
retreat. It might be inevitable. From now, we need to treat it as
inevitable and ensure that the new policy, strategy and less ambitious
targets are achieved but we should not let this pass without
recognising that it is a quite a profound change in our
approach.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071174000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000060">It
is also more of a technologically significant change in the
measurement. We debated this and others have commented on it. Some of
us had the suspicion when the Treasury, when obliging DECC to look at
this area, hoped that the redefinition would define the problem away.
Whatever else one may say about Professor Hills, he has definitely
reinforced and underlined that fuel poverty is an important and
distinct area of policy, one that requires rigorous and effective
measures to tackle it. Even with his measurement, which excluded a
number of things, we have 2.5 million households in England alone
suffering from it. We owe Professor Hills a debt for his report. We are
now trying to turn that into some measure of
reality.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071174000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000061">The
first complication it presents is that we now have an English target
which measured differently from that in Scotland, Northern Ireland and,
probably, Wales. That makes a UK approach to it difficult. Indeed,
there was some advance on the basis of the old measurement, which was
relatively easily understood, even though it was itself quite complex.
It was relatively well established and we were about to adopt it on a
pan-European basis. Europe will also have to think again about any
co-ordinated approach on
this<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:50:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071174000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000062">Let
us accept that the Hills definition will be one of the main
measurements. I cannot remember the exact reference, but quite near the
beginning of the report that I received yesterday, it says that from
now on the Government will establish the figures only on the basis of
one of the Hills measurements—namely, the low-income/high-cost
measurement. At least for a few years, we need not only to take in the
other Hills amendment, relating to the depth of fuel
poverty—which in some ways is a useful and more understandable
measurement—but to continue to measure it on the old scale. That
is the normal approach in a lot of statistical series. Eventually, we
may not need that, but for the next five years the credibility of this
strategy requires us to look at what we previously defined as fuel
poverty, and what our colleagues in devolved Administrations are
probably going to go on using as the definition, in order to see how
well we are doing. On a purely statistical basis, we ought to retain
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:51:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071174000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000063">It
is of course also true that many points in Professor Hills’s
strategy are not yet fully reflected in the Government’s
actions. We will come back to that as 
<?notus-xml column=142?>we go on over the next few months. As expressed in the documentation now
before us, there is clearly a triangle of effects on fuel poverty:
household income, the energy efficiency of the home and the appliances
within it, and the price of energy. All three are open to government
intervention. The strategy shown by the Government so far focuses very
much on intervention on the energy efficiency of homes. I am strongly
in favour of such intervention but there is a danger of ignoring the
other two sides of the triangle and the forces that define whether fuel
poverty is going up or
down.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071174000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000064">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:52:53"></hs_TimeCode>
is important that we find a way of conveying the narrative on all three
fronts to the population. Fuel poverty itself, the measurements
involved and the nomenclature of the various intervention schemes are
complicated enough, and we must find a clear narrative to explain what
we are doing on all those fronts. At the moment, as the Commons Select
Committee said only a few weeks ago, the Government are unable to
convey what they are trying to do and why they are trying to do it when
it comes to fuel poverty and energy efficiency
interventions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:53:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071174000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000065">The
new definition, as I say, has some advantages. It probably excludes a
number of Members of the House of Lords who are on a reasonable income
but live in rather draughty castles. I commend it from that point of
view. However, although the Minister may contest this, it does not
obviously take us hugely further forward in terms of operationally
identifying precisely who those people are. It is pretty sound
statistically but, operationally, we have no further clue as to whether
such and such a house in such and such a town or village is actually
suffering from fuel poverty or not. At one point, as mentioned last
night at the briefing, the document refers to assessing the condition
of housing at a local level. However, we do not actually have a
register of the condition of every house—we only have a broad
idea of what the SAP rating of certain kinds of housing is—nor
do we have the identification of the household structure and the
household income within it. I am not sure that we ever can have that.
However, to make this provision work most cost-effectively, we need to
see whether local authorities, or other local bodies taking the lead on
this, can pin down the priority areas more precisely in terms of
streets, houses or type of
persons<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:54:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071174000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000066"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Maddock" PimsId="1636" UID="13071174000168" xid="1335" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000168">Baroness
Maddock:</Member></B> I thank the noble Lord for giving way. When I
introduced the Home Energy Conservation Act, that was one of the things
we were trying to get local authorities to do. In the early days, they
were quite innovative. For example, Sutton had infra red photographs in
its local library which showed where the relevant houses were. I agree
entirely with the noble Lord that we need to be able to do that but
there are other things that we can do and there is legislation to
enable people to do
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:55:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071174000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000067"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Whitty" PimsId="4591" UID="13071174000169" xid="1139" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000169">Lord
Whitty:</Member></B> Yes, but this has not been a priority for local
authorities and in the present period of austerity is unlikely to
become so unless the strategy that the Minister comes up with in a few
months’ time places that obligation on them and provides
resources 
<?notus-xml column=143?>to enable them to carry it out. At the other end, the income end, the
data-sharing arrangements which were introduced in
legislation—two Energy Bills ago, I think—have not fully
worked in enabling suppliers to identify which of their customers are
likely to be on benefits, which, itself, is only a very rough proxy of
the fuel

document and the Minister have indicated that we need to be more
targeted in our approach. Indeed, there is a significant element of
prioritisation, so if we need to identify, first, those who are in
deepest fuel poverty and take action with them initially, we need to
have more detailed information, at least in broad terms. If we are to
have an area approach, there is a bit of a conflict between that and a
prioritisation on grounds of deepest fuel poverty or, indeed, the other
priority identified in the document of serious health problems, which
poses even more difficulties and is subject to data protection

the Government’s emphasis on intervention in regard to energy
efficiency, it is important to obtain clarity about the resources being
put in by the Government or being diverted from consumers’ bills
to deal with this. I asked the Minister whether the Government could
indicate the total amount to be spent on fuel poverty determined energy
efficiency interventions over, say, the next five years. The figures
that NEA has come up with, comparing 2010-11 to this year, show a
significant drop in intervention because not only did Warm Front, which
was taxpayer-funded, end completely at the end of last year, although
some schemes are still being completed, SERT and CESP were dropped and
we all moved onto the ECO. We have another group of amendments dealing
with the ECO and I do not want to go into those in detail now, but even
assuming that the ECO works, in aggregate more than £200 million
less is being diverted via taxpayers’ money or cross-subsidy
from the consumer into fuel poverty and energy efficiency schemes. I
will discuss later whether, even within that, the ECO is working most
efficiently<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T14:58:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071174000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000070">It
is important to move forward on this issue and the government
amendments are a significant step in that direction. Some of the
documentation is still not adequate and we are unlikely to see any more
before the Bill completes its passage. It could be another six to eight
months before the secondary legislation appears, which takes us well
into the second half of next year. By that time, according to most
prognostications, energy prices will have risen, low-income households
will not have seen an increase in their income and the tariffs that are
likely to be offered under Ofgem’s new arrangements will not
have been geared to attacking the problem of fuel poverty. That is the
other area that is not covered in the Government’s policy
statement, which I spoke of at probably excessive length in our
previous Committee session—namely, that you can use the tariff
structure as well as energy-efficiency interventions in order to
improve.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13071174000153" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000153">3

need to ensure that the Government live up to the intentions that that
implies. But we should not forget that in addition to a strategy, you
need a delivery programme and enforcement powers, as my noble friend
Lady Liddell said. You also need clarity about how to prioritise the
different groups of the fuel poor—those in hard-to-heat houses,
which cost more; those off the gas grid; those in rural areas, as the
noble Lord, Lord Deben, said; and those in the private rented
sector—for which the area approach is not necessarily the most
effective in reducing fuel poverty
numbers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071174000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000072">The
Government will develop this strategy. We now have a new definition and
we will have new targets based on that definition. But we should not
forget that we have had one serious failure in this area of delivering
a policy that all parties in this House and another place supported. We
are reducing our ambitions and there are still 2.5 million people in
England alone who are fuel poor. There are arguments for and against
having the actual target in primary legislation. We will see how it is
expressed. The Government are clearly determined on their

parallel with the targets, we need a consistent and defensible
strategy, which convinces not only those of us in Westminster who take
an interest in fuel poverty but explains how it works to the rest of

friend Lord Deben’s point that there is now an element of
uncertainty. It is that which needs now to be resolved as quickly as
possible. I am sure that they will respond firmly to the invitation
which has been issued for discussions to take place. Certainly, I do
not know and have not been told whether this means investment in

Baroness, Lady Liddell, asked about ECO and what was contained within
it. Within ECO, energy suppliers will provide fully subsidised measures
under the affordable warmth obligation to low-income, vulnerable
households. We estimate that around 230,000 low-income households can
be supported each year through ECO, so there will be no up-front cost

grateful for the support of the noble Lord, Lord O’Neill,
although I would say that, rather than sticking in his throat, it was a
gentle hiccup. Through the Green Deal and ECO we are endeavouring to
reach out and get to those households that would benefit the most.
Again, I point the noble 
<?notus-xml column=146?>Lord to the £540 million that is being made available though the
affordable warmth obligation and the carbon-saving communities
obligation. We also have the warm home discount, with the overall
effect that all consumer bills will be lower than they otherwise would

asked about the reduction in government funding for fuel poverty.
Funding for fuel poverty has not been reduced over the spending review.
Total spending on fuel poverty is being increased and by 2014-15 we
expect to see spending on the warm home discount at £310 million
and spending on ECO will be at least the £540 million that I
said—up around 10% on
2009-10.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071174000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000085">My
noble friend Lord Deben rightly recognised fuel poverty in poor rural
parts of the country. I completely agree with him that we need to make
sure that the measurements we take help us to respond to those in rural
households facing fuel poverty so that they are also able to benefit
from our measures. The average fuel poverty gap in poor rural areas is
£558 compared with £361 in other areas. In underpinning
the new target, we need to reflect in other strategy how we will
approach the fuel poor in rural areas. When it comes to consultation, I
hope my noble friend will be able to assist us in
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071174000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000086">My noble
friend Lady Maddock asked about the private rented sector and fuel
poverty. Again, I recognise as she does the importance of ensuring that
we work closely on regulations so that the private landlord sector is
not omitted. From April 2018, landlords will not be able to rent out
any property that does not meet the minimum efficiency ratings, subject
to the provisions already present in the Energy Act
2011.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071174000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000087">The
noble Lord, Lord Whitty, said that while he sort of welcomed the
measures instead of shillings pennies were being dropped. I will try to
convince him that rather than shillings we need to talk about pounds
being dropped. We recognise that we have to eradicate any kind of
poverty but current methods—targets—are not working.
Realistically, we need to see how we can reduce it to get to the point
of seeing poverty eradicated. I need to make it clear that we are not
abandoning fuel poverty targets. We are improving them and enhancing
our delivery of meeting them. Our amendments increase certainty that
successive Governments will keep this issue at the top of their
agendas. This is a cross-party issue. I think all those sat in the
Committee today recognise that successive Government have failed. We
need to make progress.</hs_para>

noble Lord also asked about the operational aspect of our definition.
Targeting is always difficult but we hope that the new definition will
open up new improvements. We currently use a number of proxies for fuel
poverty, such as receipt of certain means-tested benefits. That will
need to continue for some time but we know, on the ground, that local
authorities and others are using a range of technologies and techniques

<?notus-xml column=147?>to identify fuel-poor households. We are currently evaluating the

monoxide is a colourless, odourless gas emitted when carbon, however
produced—whichever fuel it is in—is incompletely burned.
Domestic sources are usually faulty or improperly installed cooking and
heating devices. At concentrations of 12,800 parts per million, death
occurs in one to three minutes. At lower levels, ongoing damage may
persist for years. The problem is that because you cannot see or smell
it people often have no idea that they are being killed by it. Hospital
episode statistics for England and Wales show that at least 40 people a
year die from carbon monoxide poisoning, and about 4,000 people attend
A&amp;E departments with carbon monoxide toxicity. The inquiry that I
chaired on behalf of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Carbon
Monoxide found that, based on the Government’s approximate
figures, these incidents together are probably costing the nation well

this is only the tip of the iceberg. The most authoritative estimates
suggest that carbon monoxide poisoning is much more prevalent than
previously thought. The majority of those who have discovered that they
have been poisoned have never attended A&amp;E and are thus excluded
from official figures. Indeed the overwhelming majority of people
poisoned by fossil fuel combustion are completely unaware that they are
being or have been poisoned. They present with non-specific symptoms,
which makes it difficult to diagnose; these include headache, chronic
fatigue, mood disorders, poor memory, dizziness, poor or disturbed
sleep, poor concentration, tummy ache, diarrhoea, pins and needles and
recurrent infections. I should think every Member of your
Lordships’ House has had some of those symptoms at one time or
another. The effect on the brain is particularly marked: in chronic low
level exposure the cognitive changes result in disordered chaotic

boiler; and 25% to a defective fire of some sort. In 10.6% of cases
there was misuse of a cooker or cooking methods. Some families seemed
to put tinfoil over the top of the heating area, which decreases the
airflow and raises carbon monoxide levels. In 38.5% of cases the alarm
had gone off because the battery was defective and needed to be
replaced—so the battery detection was
working.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071174000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000099">Public
Health England concluded that carbon monoxide exposure in local

are cheap. I will not ask for a show of hands of how many of your

battery life costs less than £20; in other words, protection for
one year is cheaper than one cup of coffee on the high street. It is

should we tackle carbon monoxide in the Energy Bill? We have already
debated how people will struggle to pay their bills. Poverty puts
energy safety at risk because servicing appliances is less likely to be
a priority than paying the bill for running that appliance, whatever it

more dangerous in terms of carbon monoxide exposure than gas. It is
classically thought that it is related to gas but actually the bigger

second part relates to energy-efficiency measures and indoor air
pollution. Energy-efficiency measures such as the Green Deal aim to
make properties better insulated. But an unintended consequence of this

ventilation that is required to safely operate many appliances. Of all

most
dangerous.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071174000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000104">The

carbon monoxide when their engineers have visited customers’
properties while wearing these personal alarms. Fortunately, most gas

would suggest that the amendment as it is currently worded should not
be accepted. The wording should change to allow for new detection

landlords. We have heard already about landlords and how those renting
property from private landlords are at higher risk—they have a
fivefold higher risk of carbon monoxide incidents than members of the
population in other dwellings. The <I>Downstream Incident Data

are now required when a new or replacement appliance burning solid fuel
is installed and, in Northern Ireland, this extends to all newly
installed appliances, irrespective of the fossil fuel. This amendment
gives specific protection to those people who are at risk because they
rent where they live and are often in a poorer group of the population.

of the problems that we have come across over the years—and I
have proposed amendments to other Bills about this—is that the

“It’s not appropriate in this Bill”. I have a
feeling that this may be what the Minister will say today.
Interestingly, I notice that there are some people who know about it,
because the civil servants behind her changed between the first and
second amendments that we are discussing. Somebody in her department
clearly knows something about this. It is time that we took this
seriously—we have that opportunity now, as we have so many
programmes where people go into other people’s houses and
install equipment that might have faults in it of the kind we are
discussing, when they could easily fit something else or easily detect
where carbon monoxide is. Not only should we be doing this, but we
should keep much better records; as the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay,
said, one of the problems is trying to get records of how many people
there are. The worst thing is that sometimes even doctors do not
recognise the symptoms. There have been cases where someone has turned
up at a surgery but the symptoms have not been diagnosed and they have
gone home and died. We need to take this more seriously and to stop
making excuses about why we cannot do some of the things that

the wallpaper that stopped the damage. The Government did not change
the law until 1974. Therefore, there is a history of Governments not
doing what they ought to do at the time they ought to do it. I was
fascinated to read some of the evidence that the Government gave about
why they were not doing it. Noble Lords will not be surprised that the
argument was, first, that there is no need for regulation in this area;
secondly, that it will be expensive; thirdly, that there is no call for
it; fourthly, that people ought to be able to make these decisions

suggest to my noble friend that this is a genuinely serious issue that
could be solved. Lives can be saved at a cost that is significantly
lower than it used to be, because government is enabling people to go
into these premises for all sorts of other reasons. If the Minister has
been advised that it is inappropriate to have legislation in this
area—of course, I do not know whether she has been—I
would pick up on the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt. Anyone who
has a gas fire installed is always forced to install further
ventilation, even if it is utterly unnecessary. We already have
legislation of a very detailed kind. If you wanted to put a gas fire in
this Room, even though it may be very draughty, you would have to put a
ventilating spot at the top there because that is what the law
says.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071174000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071174000114">I am not
suggesting that we should be in any way as prescriptive as that. We
should not say what kind of alarm there should be, except to say that
it should be effective, and we should certainly be willing to allow
alterations to the text of the amendment, because I am not expert
enough to know whether it would do the job. I hope my noble friend will
understand that this is one of those issues in which everybody involved
has to say to themselves, “Am I prepared to allow people to die
when I could stop it?”. That must be of great importance. We
have to ask ourselves, individually, as Members of the House of Lords,
officers of the department and Ministers, “Am I prepared not to
act when action will save lives?”. That is not acting in some
extreme way, or some awful health and safety nonsense. The very simple
fact is that modern equipment needs this. It ought to be part of the

such necessary legislation might come forward, if not included in the

entirely agree that greater public awareness about the dangers of gas
and of carbon monoxide poisoning is extremely important. After rising
incident rates, it is encouraging that last year the number of such
incidents fell. I understand that last year there were 46 incidents
with casualties and one death. That still highlights that the problem
persists. The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, was correct to point out
that there is severe underreporting going on and that incidents can
affect health in many small, unnoticeable

also striking that evidence suggests that those renting from private
landlords are more at risk than those in other occupancy types. This
deserves very careful consideration by the Government today. Like
others, we understand that detectors cost only about £30, so
this does not represent a huge cost to the household. The charge might
also be absorbed by the plumber or fitter because it would seem to be
him that would be liable under this clause. However, could the Minister
clarify, as is it not entirely clear from the wording under

is clear that the complaints systems of several of the large energy
companies are not really up to scratch. The ombudsman and Ofgem remark
on this from time to time. Tens of thousands of consumers suffer from
the effects of mis-selling, misleading information and misleading
advice on choice of tariff and other conditions relating to tariffs;
for example, on the cost determination. If you switch tariff, you have
to pay a significant cost but that is rarely conveyed to you up front
in an understandable form when you sign up for the tariff. It is a
significant inhibition to many consumers switching and therefore to
there being a proper consumer-led market in this

the other areas of complaint is contested bills, particularly the
estimated bills. As we were saying the other day, these are by
definition wrong but are often insisted upon by the companies. On many
occasions, eventually a settlement is reached, but it is on an
individual basis. It may involve an ombudsman case but it reflects the
general approach of the company to its consumers. In the impact
assessment of the Bill, the provisions to improve Ofgem’s powers
in this area are not given an accurate assessment. However, it is
implied that the effect will be positive, and certainly I think that it
will be. However, the size of detriment in the energy sector is
potentially very large, and the inhibition on taking individual cases
is also substantial. You have to go through a complaints process, and
if you are not satisfied, you have to go to the ombudsman, take a case
to court or get help from the various consumer and interest group
organisations. That ends up costing a lot of time and often a lot of
money, with not necessarily a coherent outcome to each

situation is not confined to energy but, because of the high level of
problems within energy, there are general aspects of provider behaviour
from which a large number of consumers suffer. It is difficult to prove
on an individual basis, but it is important that we recognise that
there ought to be better systems for getting redress for consumers. By
and large, consumer law in this country does not include collective
provision, unlike in the United States, where there are significant
class action provisions. Successive Governments have gone part of the
way down the road towards greater collective provision, recognising
that, for example, the PPI scandal in financial services would have
been much better dealt with had there been a collective redress system
rather than often quite aggressive complaints-handling companies taking
up cases of varying degrees of authenticity, which led to differential
outcomes case by case.</hs_para>

breakthrough. It comes in paragraph 7 of Schedule 14 to the Bill and is
the beginning of a provision for general collective redress in this
area. It is on an opt-in basis, which is still somewhat narrower than
the provision in the Financial Services and Markets Act of the previous
Government, which unfortunately had to be dropped in its original form.
It had a whole section on collective redress in the financial sector,
which could have been taken out and generalised into other sectors and

myself the slightly less ambitious target of requiring the Secretary of
State to come forward 12 months after the Act is passed with
some provision for collective redress in this area. I am encouraged by
the fact that the Government have provided for at least one form of
collective redress through the consumer rights Bill. Therefore, I hope
that in 12 months’ time, the attitude of the House of Commons to
that Bill and the Government’s reflection on it will give some

amendment in this group to which I should refer. Amendment 51ZE seeks
to delete the limit of the redress to detriment that occurred more than
five years ago. The reality is that some of the mis-selling in energy,
just like some of the mis-selling in the financial sector, started a
long time ago, and the decision to apply a five-year limit is
completely arbitrary. Indeed, that does not apply in the financial
services sector. If a practice started seven years ago and was still
happening within the last five years, there is no reason why the
earlier detriment should not be taken into account. I am being quite
modest in suggesting a 15-year limitation. I would be delighted if the
Minister accepted my substitution of 15 for five; I would be even more
delighted if he said that on reflection the Government would prefer to
delete the limit altogether, because there are some long-standing
wrongs in this area and the five-year limit does not seem sensible. I

<?notus-xml column=158?>to emerge from the customers of energy suppliers. The last time I
checked, there was something like 27 cases still pending with Ofgem,

the mis-selling of PPI and some of the financial services mis-selling.
This would be useful for the Government to have in the armoury should
that situation emerge. It is not radical; it is actually quite a simple
measure. If we take into account that the most recent instances of
mis-selling had been in the pipeline at Ofgem for around four years, my
noble friend’s proposal to extend the time period from five to
15 years is measured and logical. I do not see this as greatly
controversial but as a way of dealing with a problem that may be coming
over the horizon and that would save recourse to additional legislation

utility as the provider of electricity or gas. Mis-selling results in
fines and punishments, which seem to be absorbed, and the public end up
paying the fines through higher prices. We do not normally see a
reduction in dividends as a consequence of this, but we might see a
reduction in investment, which is one of the difficulties that we have
if we clobber the utilities that want to invest. We require them to
invest in order to sustain our supplies of power, gas and the like and,
if we fine them very heavily, however understandable that is, we
perhaps endanger some of that much needed investment. On the other
hand, we are talking about the legitimate concern customers have in
getting some kind of redress that they have not had in the past. That
should also act as a deterrent to the companies so that they do not go
about setting tariffs in the misleading and cavalier fashion that they
have in the
past.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071182000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071182000027">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T16:05:14"></hs_TimeCode>

punished, we might begin to develop a deterrent culture, under which
they would be a lot more reluctant to jump headlong into fiddling
tariffs in the way that they have done recently—usually at the
expense of not just the vulnerable but the whole spectrum of society.
As we do not always know the full character or nature of the abuse, it
is about time that we tried to introduce some more blanket form of
deterrence. To my mind, a blanket form of deterrence in the form of

51ZA would require the Secretary of State to bring forward regulations
to allow collective redress for energy consumers. We agree that
consumers should be able to get the compensation that they are due when
things go wrong. The consumer redress order powers we have put forward
in the Bill will provide energy consumers with what we believe is the
most appropriate and cost-effective way of obtaining this. In
principle, collective redress can provide benefits in some sectors, but
I am concerned about the potential impact such powers may have on the
time and cost involved for energy consumers seeking redress through
this route, and the impact of any additional costs on all
consumers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071182000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071182000030">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T16:03:16"></hs_TimeCode>
most effective redress mechanism ensures that consumers receive timely

what the noble Lord, Lord O’Neill, said about balance in these
matters. Under existing arrangements, energy consumers can already
obtain redress through the courts, but the legal process does not
typically offer a quick or cheap remedy for consumers who have suffered
a detriment. In part, the concern that I have about the proposals from
the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, on collective redress is that it would not
speed up the process; indeed, it may, perversely, lengthen it, although
I am sure that is not his intention. Consumers will also be required to
identify themselves as potential claimants and join an action. Consumer
redress order powers overcome these barriers by allowing Ofgem to take
action on consumers’ behalf, without them needing to initiate
action or incur
costs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071182000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071182000031">Allowing
collective redress via these amendments would benefit intermediaries
involved in bringing such cases, who will seek awards that allow them
to recover their costs—which would be borne by claimants or,
where costs are awarded, by all consumers as energy companies seek to
recover these sums. Collective redress could also encourage litigation
on fine points of law, creating higher costs for energy companies,
which would again risk increasing prices for consumers as a whole. In
contrast, the consumer redress order powers contained in the Bill offer
a speedier resolution to consumer detriment, which does not require
consumers to come forward and take action, is proportionate to the sums
at stake and minimises the potential costs for all energy
consumers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071182000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071182000032">The

intention is certainly not for these time limits to be arbitrary. The
time limit is consistent with the existing time limit for Ofgem
imposing penalties on energy companies. In some cases, both penalty and
redress may be appropriate, and so it is important that the enforcement

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, I find the explanation on the five-year
period extraordinary. I think it was my noble friend Lady Liddell who
mentioned that the notorious recent Scottish and Southern case had gone
on for four years. It would not have needed to go on for more than
another six months for it to fall foul of this restriction. There may
be something in the argument of the noble Lord, Lord Deben, that you
need some restriction. Indeed, that is why I proposed a 15-year period
rather than delete the provision entirely. I do not accept that there
should be a shorter jurisdiction for energy than there is for financial
services, nor do I accept the argument put forward by the noble Lord,
Lord Deben, that it is a bad thing for people to be entitled to redress
for the mis-selling of, for example, PPI and pensions in the financial
services sector which happened a long time ago, albeit that continued
until relatively recently. As for confidence, there is no consumer
confidence in the energy sector. It is all very well saying there will
be no business confidence if companies think they are going to be fined
for something which happened 15 years ago, but at the moment there is
almost nil consumer confidence. The energy sector has the worst record
among the allegedly competitive markets in terms of consumer
confidence. That is partly because over time consumers have had
difficulty understanding whether or not they have been misled or
mis-sold products and have faced grave hurdles in trying to remedy
that. Sometimes they

Deben:</Member></B> For the correction of the record, the problem is
that the further you extend something, the less you can prove the case,
the greater the chance that the people who are now involved had nothing
to do with it and the less the chance that the circumstances in which
it took place can reasonably be identified. You have to have a balance;
that is all. There are many examples of cases where the conditions that
obtained 15 and 20 years ago are unprovable and very different from the
conditions obtaining now. In the end, you have an unfair circumstance.
Therefore, some way or other, you have to have a decent
balance—otherwise, you find that people’s confidence and
willingness to invest in industry reduces. That is the experience and
that is why so many fewer people now provide services to the public
than used to be the case. We have destroyed confidence. You have to
have confidence on both sides; that is

Liddell of Coatdyke:</Member></B> I am very grateful to my noble friend
for giving way but the noble Lord, Lord Deben, referred to the
financial services industry. The whole issue around the mis-selling of
personal pensions covered a period of between 15 to 20 years. One of
the reasons why there had to be redress there was because the entire
financial services industry had been damaged. Our energy suppliers are
being damaged at the moment. I remind noble Lords of the statement by
Warren Buffett that it takes 20 years to build a reputation but five
minutes to lose it. We owe a debt to the industry to make sure that it
operates with the 
<?notus-xml column=162?>highest possible standards. One way of doing that is to support the

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, my noble friend has expressed the
position far more precisely than me. I underline her comments. I will
not pursue the point today but I ask the department to reflect on it
and on how it will justify to the public that there should be a lower
level of potential redress in the energy sector than there is in the
financial services sector. I just ask that

relation to collective redress, I believe that the Government, the
Minister for Consumer Affairs and the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, who
is replying for her department, have moved some way to recognise the
need for consumer redress to be dealt with on a collective basis on
occasion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T16:14:10"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
particularly important that that is provided for in the regulated
sectors. The amendment that I am proposing would allow the Minister to
come forward with a whole range of potential forms of collective
redress. Most of those would be less expensive than individuals taking
cases themselves and would take less time. They could, indeed, be
pursued by intermediaries, but the aggregate cost to consumers and the
industry would be significantly less than if every single consumer, or
even 10% of consumers, started to take individual cases through the
courts, with each one taking time to reach a conclusion.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T16:14:21"></hs_TimeCode>I cannot see
that collective redress is ever going to be more time-consuming and
costly than having a range of thousands of individual redress cases,

the Government will consider further the issue of collective redress.
Perhaps they will not do so until the draft Bill in the Commons, to
which I referred, has come to fruition. At that point at least, I hope
that there will be reconsideration of the benefits of collective
redress. Probably this week I should not be talking about opt in and
opt out, but the opt-out situation is even clearer. It would be even
cheaper than what is provided for in the draft of the consumer rights
Bill. Whatever the form of collective redress, it is very important
that this sector looks at the option and that, in the light of general
progress on consumer rights, we come back to this at a later stage. For

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, we have touched on this. The ECO is
central to the Government’s strategy for delivering on their
fuel poverty targets. We have had a lengthy debate on the context in
which they will do so, and the targets and strategies that they will
adopt. Clearly, their main attack on fuel poverty will be through the
measures they bring to improve the energy efficiency of the homes of
the fuel poor. The ECO is intended to be the main weapon for them to do
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071182000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071182000047">I have
had some exchanges with the noble Baroness about how we are going on
the ECO at the moment. I have received information from various sources
that there are serious problems. This follows quite a good
year—the last year of the old scheme, if I may put it that
way—when a significant increase was recorded by the climate
change committee in many types of interventions, including cavity wall
insulation, solid wall treatments and loft insulation. All those
schemes have now come to an end. They are all being replaced by the
ECO, which in aggregate terms is less than the aggregate of the
others—although the Minister pointed out that you also have to
take into account the warm homes discount. That is on the other side of
the equation—the income side—whereas in aggregate under
the ECO, the number of schemes that will be delivered, and the
aggregate cost and resources devoted to the schemes, will be less than
under the pre-existing three
schemes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071182000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071182000048">That
would be a problem in itself, but it will be a greater problem if the
way in which the ECO is being delivered is inefficient. Several sources
appear to suggest that there is a serious problem with measures being
brought forward under the ECO. On the climate change committee’s
figures, the number of cavity wall insulation interventions declined by
60% in the first few months of the ECO regime. That is a serious
teething problem. It may be a teething problem but it needs to be
addressed seriously. The new structure under the various regulations
introducing the ECO seems to create a problem for the cost of each
individual measure as well.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13071182000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071182000049">I am probably not the
only noble Lord who has received a letter from Scottish and Southern on
this point. The supply companies have to buy from the market the
interventions that they require to make up their ECO contribution. They
have said, and this is quite startling, that the cost of some of those
interventions under the ECO provisions is more than twice than under
the old schemes. That reflects the volume but it also reflects the new
system.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13071182000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071182000050">Scottish and Southern
claims that the average cost at which it is buying cavity wall
insulation, solid wall insulation and loft insulation has more than
doubled under the new regime. That is also reflected in the views
expressed by the insulation industry and the installers. They say that
because the volume of work has gone down substantially, they can no
longer send their workforce to an area where they can do four or five
jobs in two or three days. They now have to go to an area where they
can do only one job and then move on to the other side of the country,
or the region, and carry out the other jobs. Therefore, the average
cost to them is increasing. That is reflected in the prices they are
offering through the brokerage system, which is 
<?notus-xml column=164?>therefore affecting the charge that Scottish and Southern and other
electricity suppliers pay in the ECO
context.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071182000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071182000051">That
is not a good situation. It is also having a knock-on effect in that
those firms are also laying off workers. My own union, the GMB, which
is the main organiser of insulation and installation workers, has seen
significant layoffs already and sees more in the pipeline as
the old schemes end. I have asked the Minister to give me some details
about how the department sees the situation, but that is how it is seen
from the point of view of the energy suppliers, the industry and the
workers within the industry. If this goes on, the effectiveness of the
ECO intervention is going to be substantially less than the equivalent
level of resources that were provided under the pre-existing
schemes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071182000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071182000052">Part
of the problem, according to both the suppliers and the installation
industry, is that the period over which the ECO is supposed to be
operating is relatively short. Under present provisions, it runs to
only 2015. That can be extended but at the moment there is certainty
only over it existing until 2015. My amendments are an attempt to
address this issue by, first, extending the period of the ECO in
principle to 2019, giving time for this to be smoothed over; and
secondly, providing for a review of how the ECO is operating. I am
suggesting that we should put that in statute. If the Government are
not prepared to put it in statute, they should make a commitment, in
view of these assertions, that they need to look within the next six to
12 months at how the ECO is really working
out.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071182000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071182000053">The last
stages of the old scheme are now going through their finishing stages.
Everything that is starts from now on will, therefore, be under the ECO
provision. Unless ECO rapidly builds to the same volume—and I
hope at the same or better price—it will not deliver as great an
impact on energy efficiency of homes, and thus on fuel poverty, as the
previous system, even pound for pound and intervention by intervention.
I want a review, which should be in the context of the ECO system
lasting for a longer period because, theoretically, it is simpler than
the multiple systems we had before. We need to know, however, what is
really going on and whether the system and the market that has been
established are operating properly. If they are, in the sense that real
costs are being charged, what is wrong? Are the volume, incentives, or
relations down the supply chain not right, or is there a basic flaw in
the system itself? The sooner we have the answer, the sooner we can put
the ECO system on a better basis, and one in which the industry,
suppliers and consumers can have confidence. I beg to

Verma:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord
Whitty, for his amendments dealing with the future of the energy
company obligations and the approach to replacement boilers adopted
within the scheme. By way of background, ECO is worth
£1.3 billion per year and is split into three
obligations: affordable warmth; carbon savings communities; and carbon
saving. ECO has been specifically designed to help us fight the battle
against fuel poverty and to reduce carbon emissions by requiring
obligated energy suppliers to invest in heating and energy-efficiency
measures. Importantly, ECO is expected to be more cost effective than
the Warm Front Scheme, with the 
<?notus-xml column=165?>delivery cost of 120,000 major measures estimated at around £350
million each year under the affordable warmth obligation. Under Warm
Front, this amount of funding might have supported only 80,000 major
measures, on which basis ECO is likely to be 50% more cost effective
than the previous government-funded scheme. I recognise how important
it is for vulnerable consumers to know how to access the support. That
is why, in recognition of some of the reported difficulties, as the
noble Lord, Lord Whitty, stated in his opening remarks, in identifying
vulnerable customers who are eligible for help, we have provided a
data-matching and referral service for ECO affordable warmth, operated
by the government-funded energy saving advice service. Working in
partnership with the Department for Work and Pensions, this service
confirms whether a consumer meets the qualifying benefit criteria.
Already, nearly 12,000 customers have been referred to an obligated
energy supplier through this route. As we work on a new fuel poverty
strategy to support the proposed new fuel poverty target, we will also
be considering the scope for making more extensive use of data matching
in
future<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T16:28:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

amendments in more detail. Amendments 51ZB and 51ZC propose that ECO be
extended to 2019, subject to a review. At the time that ECO was
introduced, we indicated the intention that ECO would run until at
least 2022 and the Government will, in due course, bring forward
proposals for consultation on what the next phase of ECO, from 2015,
should look like. In designing these proposals, it is important that we
have flexibility to take account of experience under the current phase
of ECO and new issues that may arise. It would therefore be wrong to
restrict the future design of ECO to its current provisions. As part of
our consultations on its future, we would, in any event, also consult
all the organisations specified in the noble Lord’s amendment.
Given the Government’s plans for the future of ECO, we believe
that setting this requirement in law would be damagingly
restrictive.</hs_para>

51ZD would change the arrangements for the replacement of boilers under
ECO. I would argue that this amendment is also not unnecessary. As was
shown in the first Green Deal and ECO statistical release on 27 June,
ECO is already delivering, with over 80,000 measures installed at the
end of April and £155 million-worth of measures traded on the
ECO brokerage platform to date for delivery over the coming months. We
expect tens of thousands of boilers to be replaced each year under
current arrangements. We will continue to report on progress, with both
monthly and more comprehensive quarterly statistical
releases.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071182000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071182000057">There
are other difficulties with the noble Lord’s amendments. For
example, the text proposed would effectively mean that there would be
no limit to the number of free boilers that might be offered to
eligible customers. This would have a serious impact on the costs of
the policy. Such costs fall on all bill payers, including those least
able to pay, which risks undermining confidence in the overall policy.
It would also dramatically skew the balance of the measures installed.
At present, obligated suppliers have the freedom to meet their targets
in the most cost-effective way, including by 
<?notus-xml column=166?>installing basic insulation measures, which are very cost effective and
help to minimise costs. Among the affordable warmth eligible group, we
estimated in the final Green Deal and ECO impact assessment that around
1 million households could benefit from further insulation. It is
therefore important that affordable warmth delivery is not simply
focused on boiler
measures.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071182000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071182000058">I am
grateful to the noble Lord for the opportunity to discuss ECO, which is
a key instrument to help us tackle fuel poverty, the subject of an
earlier debate. Both the noble Lord and I share a concern for ensuring
that the needs of vulnerable households continue to be addressed in the
long term through ECO. However, I do not believe it is helpful for
detailed eligibility criteria to be specified in primary legislation.
As we have seen in relation to the legislative framework for fuel
poverty, we need the flexibility to be able to respond when our
understanding of a problem changes. That is why we have proposed, while
maintaining a duty on the Secretary of State to address fuel poverty in
primary legislation, that the same holds true here and why we consider
that detailed eligibility criteria should be set out in secondary
legislation, allowing us to keep those criteria under review while
maintaining parliamentary oversight of any changes. In addition, this
enables us to amend criteria over time to reflect developments in the
Government’s benefits

noble Lord asked what ECO had delivered so far. I think I have already
alluded to that. More than 80,000 measures have been installed under
ECO, benefiting more than 70,000 properties. More than 55,000 of these
measures were installed under the affordable warmth or carbon saving
community elements of the obligation, thereby benefiting the most
vulnerable customers. The noble Lord also suggested that ECO was not
going to deliver or have a large impact. ECO is a new obligation and
has required some changes across the energy efficiency sector. However,
the obligated suppliers have been set challenging targets, to be met by
March 2015, and 80,000 measures have already been installed. This is a
new measure and one planned to work over many decades. I think that the
noble Lord must recognise we are taking a long-term view here and not
instituting short-term fixes. On that note, I hope that the noble Lord

that we intend to run it to 2022, but all the industry sees is that it
is going to run to 2015. I would certainly ask the Government at least
to look at that. If the system is going to run to 2022, subject maybe
to some tweaking, it would be useful for both the energy suppliers and
the installation and insulation industry to know that that is indeed
going to be the case. I can pass the noble Baroness the exact costs
that Scottish and Southern claims it now has to pay, as against the
figures in the DECC initial assessment of the cost of the ECO. Those
costs are quite startling. For loft insulation, it goes from about
£280 per installation to the brokerage outcome of £1,080.
There is a similar escalation for cavity wall insulations. These are
not consumer figures or even the insulation industry’s figures.
They are ones 
<?notus-xml column=167?>that the insulation industry has charged to a supplier. Scottish and
Southern draw the conclusion that we should put a cap on ECO. I do not
go along with suggesting we should do that. Nor do I suggest that we
should cut back on the ECO and change course. I suggest that the
Government look at these figures and see how they have arisen. If it is
a teething problem I accept that we need to give it a little time to
settle down but I would like to be convinced that it will, otherwise
the scheme will not be cost
effective.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071182000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071182000061">I
did not speak very much about Amendment 51ZD, on boilers, in my opening
remarks because I thought it was self-evident that probably the biggest
contribution to household energy efficiency achieved in the last
10 years was when we required all replacement boilers to be
A or B-rated. That was a dramatic change and it has brought dividends
to thousands of households. The amendment suggests that we try to
extend that into the area of identified fuel poverty. Where the
suppliers know that there is an old, inefficient boiler still
operating, and that is matched with data identifying a household as
within the definition of fuel poverty, there should be a possibility of
using the ECO allowance to replace it. The amendment is not saying that
it is mandatory to do so or that you use up the whole of your ECO
figures in so doing. It simply says that that ought to be one measure
recognised under the ECO portfolio. It matches one set of figures to
another and tackles fuel poverty and energy efficiency at its very
heart. If we could replace the F, G and worse-rated boilers that are
still in a lot of poor homes, particularly in the private rented
sector, with A and B-rated boilers, it would make a huge difference to
people’s bills and the energy efficiency of those
buildings.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071182000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071182000062">I
am disappointed that the Minister is not prepared to take this up. She
has to recognise that there is a perceived problem with the ECO at the
moment that the Government and the department need to put right. I am
not saying we should abandon the policy or even drastically change it
but we need to get it right. If we do not get it right within a few
months it will begin to fall into disrepute. At the moment there is
that danger. I hope that in not accepting the amendments the Minister
will at least accept that there is a bit of a problem. People need to
be talked to as a matter or urgency and, if necessary, a formal review
by the department needs to take place. With that, I beg leave to
withdraw the

Teverson:</Member></B> My Lords, one important but largely forgotten
area of energy policy is the smart meter rollout which has been
recently, rightly, postponed to make sure we get it right. To put it
into context, nearly 50 million meters altogether will be rolled out to
some 30 million homes and businesses at a cost, over about a decade, of
£11 billion. That is a major national investment. Sometimes I
feel that we do not give this enough attention—I am sure
Government do but maybe Parliament does not—to make sure that
that investment delivers what should be a real change to the way that
the electricity market, distribution and usage, work in this country as
the future foundation of a truly smart
grid.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071182000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071182000064">One
important area is data. I apologise to the Minister for tabling this
amendment very late; it is a probing amendment and she might tell me
that I have nothing to worry about. If that is so, I will welcome it. I
have felt a concern both on the consumer side and from within the
industry that this area is not fully clear. If you look up smart meters
on the DECC website, it says that both these areas are satisfactory.
Clearly, there is no great detail there. The amendment would ensure
that the considerable data that come out from smart meters and are
transmitted to energy suppliers will remain the property of the
consumer who used the meter, and that they will be able to use the
information in whatever way they want, primarily to help use their
energy more efficiently but also to get quotations from other energy
companies. This will ensure that the data are used properly and to the
benefit of consumers as well as to the electricity supply industry,
which will have reduced collection
charges.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071182000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071182000065">Those
two areas are fundamentally important. I would be very pleased to hear
from the Minister that I have nothing to worry about and that this is
already enshrined in a reasonable degree of law. If it is not, it is
important that we make sure that it is enshrined in some legislative
form. I beg to

O'Neill of Clackmannan:</Member></B> I should perhaps start by
declaring an interest. I am chairman of SmartGrid GB. In some respects
we will have an information overload as a consequence of the rollout of
smart meters. On the other hand, it would be desirable for the rights
of the consumer to be taken properly into account. It is quite likely
that there will be a lot of information, and it would be a reassurance
to the consumer if they had access to what was out there. Some of the
enthusiasts for the new technologies, which have yet to be fully
realised, find their eyes glowing at the prospect of smart metering. We
have to be a wee bit cautious. There could be civil liberties concerns,
although not about the time when you put on a kettle or whether you run
the washing machine in the middle of the night. These issues are
trivial.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071182000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071182000067">It is
a bit like another problem that we have at the moment. If we use our
passes on the Underground, we could be tracked over the course of a day

same when we get these new meters in households. I see the noble Lord,
Lord Deben, looking at me, but I am sure that, in his experience of
constituency surgeries, he had, as I had

consequence of a Labour Government’s legislation, the haulage

That is now regarded as a very important health and safety measure. At
the time it was not very well presented. If we can get an understanding
and an appreciation by government of the dangers of the overload of
information that could emerge, the public could be educated on the
beneficial uses of it and made aware of the dangers—of which the
civil liberties lobby could take account—the anxiety that parts

how are people going to understand it? There seems to be a feeling we

suggestion, therefore, is that we should have energy showrooms up and
down the UK’s high streets, where empty shops give organisations
such as councils, the Government and energy companies the opportunity
to provide places offering this sort of information. As I have

all good ideas this idea builds on the wide variety of existing

available<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T16:49:12"></hs_TimeCode>. The
idea is that in such a place you could not only see technology but make

true that, under the Green Deal, there are approved operatives who can
come and visit you, but that is a second stage. You would really like
to see a rather broad overview of all the possibilities as well as
having somewhere where you could find out about the bills coming
through to you. We have been talking about fuel poverty, which is a
complex issue and will be dealt with in many different ways. Again, you
need a real person to do it. I know people who work in the CAB, and I
fear that the CAB will be overloaded with people trying to ask
questions about their energy bills. The effect will be such a big ramp,

is who would do this. Well, there are lots of people out there seeking
jobs. This would be a rather interesting, useful and perhaps
economical, way for people who have technical skills, abilities and
inclinations to provide this kind of information. Anybody working in
such an energy showroom would of course develop skills that they could
quite quickly apply elsewhere, so it might be a practical way of

of privatisation has been the demise of the old electricity and gas
showrooms, in which various pieces of equipment, from washing machines
to cookers to refrigerators, were on sale. Unfortunately, of course,
they have now been superseded by the likes of Currys and tend to be in
shopping areas outside the high street. With regard to the level of
public concern about electricity and gas prices, and the confusion over
the effectiveness of one piece of equipment against another, it is fair
to say that if you go to some of the high street shops you will get
very 
<?notus-xml column=172?>good, helpful assistance but that tends to be in the minority. Due to
the churn of staff in the retail trade, people are there for relatively
short periods and do not have the experience that was built up in the
old showrooms.</hs_para>

and the makers of telecoms equipment seem to be able to provide a
service for the public which the big six energy companies seem
incapable of doing. They have retreated from the high street. The cost
of property on the high street is not very high these days and one
would imagine that it would not cost an awful lot to get people in
there, but of course they would say that that was too much and that if
people were better informed they would probably be looking for better
tariffs than the ones that they get and we would be back talking about
mis-selling and the like.</hs_para>

Worthington:</Member></B> My Lords, the amendment in the names of the
noble Lord, Lord Hunt, and the noble Viscount, Lord Hanworth, raises a
really interesting issue, and I commend them for tabling it. It brings
this Bill into contact with people, consumers and
citizens.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071182000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071182000089">When
I read about the amendment, I thought back to my childhood, where in a
medium-sized town in south Wales, there was the South Wales Electricity
Board showroom, right in the centre among all the shops. You could get
advice about your bills and you could speak to people, but it also had
a showroom for the sale of electrical goods. Of course, in those
days—and I am sure this started a long time before—the
energy companies had a great interest in making sure that every family
had a washing machine, a fridge-freezer and an electric cooker because
it would boost the sale of their product. They were ensuring that we
were all making the most of all the labour-saving devices that were
coming forward in order to boost the sale of the units of electricity
that they generated. It probably made very good business sense.
However, times have changed and over the years energy companies have
receded into the background. Now they are engaged mainly in a massive
database management exercise, in which they try to keep interaction
with the consumer to a bare minimum. I have been told that, from a
supply company’s point of view, every time someone rings up it
is money off the bottom line and it does not like it. Companies invest
in call centres, which have become a modern job-creation exercise here
and overseas. We can talk to people only on the phone. There is very
little interaction on the high
street.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13071182000204" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071182000204">5

grateful to my noble friend Lord O’Neill for his comparison with
the mobile phone industry. It is an interesting parallel. You could
just interact with your mobile phone company through the internet, a
database or a call centre. However, we choose not to. We go into a shop
and ask for advice on different 
<?notus-xml column=173?>tariffs. Carphone Warehouse and many others have an aggregation service.
We want to pick up the phones, try them out and see which ones suit us.
Telecommunications is a much simpler proposition. Energy is much more
fundamental—telecommunications is a subset of energy—but
it does not have that interface, which is curious. Whether it is
government’s role to make this happen is a harder question. It
is an interesting, probing
idea.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071182000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071182000091">I am
grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Lane-Fox. We had a conversation
about the digital world and what the high street of the future will
look like. I said that it might seem very empty because things are
moving to the internet. She said that, on the contrary, when we move
more and more to digital services we will also need the high street.
The services provided may be different, but people will still want to
go to and use a town centre for all the convenience and ease that it
provides. The noble Baroness said that when you order something on the
internet and it turns up at your door, it is often quite inconvenient.
It will come at the wrong time and you will get a horrible slip saying,
“We called but you were out”—or you have to sit
around for 12 hours waiting for your thing to arrive. She said that in
future there would be sites in the high street where there would be
deposit and collection services, and that the high street would be much
more
dynamic.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071182000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071182000092">We do
not need our energy companies to sell us fridges any more, but we might
need them to take delivery of our fridge and then install it, or

need?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071182000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071182000093">I will
say a word on technologies. As noble Lords on both sides of the
Committee said, we are in a period of great change. The days when you
simply plug in your kettle and do not think about it are slowly
starting to change. Not everyone needs to think about it, but
increasingly people are thinking about it. We have seen a quite rapid
uptake of solar panels. Obviously, it speaks to some people in some
way. The idea that you can make your own energy is attractive and
appealing. The fact that you can even make money from it speaks to
something human in us. Therefore, there is a need for proper
information about these different technologies. They will continue to
grow in number. Solar panels are perhaps the most visible example at
the moment, but there are other technologies such as smart meters,
which we discussed when we debated the previous amendment. There is
also voltage optimisation. People who know me know that I have a
particular interest in this. It is an interesting bit of kit that can
take 10% off your electricity bill and that elongates the life of your
electrical appliances. It is a win-win, but hardly anybody knows how
voltage optimisers work, perhaps including many energy
experts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071182000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071182000094">I
have probably said enough. There is an issue here. I am not sure about
the Government’s role, but perhaps they could provide the
impetus for a public/private partnership, although I am not sure about
the formulation. Having said that government should not provide it, I
will just ask a question about the Energy Saving Trust, 
<?notus-xml column=174?>which was part of the Government’s architecture and did, I
believe, provide local outlets or offices. Does the Energy Saving Trust
still have these local centres? If so, how many of them are there, what
kind of visitors do they get and are they successful? If they do still
exist, perhaps they could be built on. The fact that I do not know
whether they exist is perhaps a bit of a sad indictment—I am not
sure whether of me or of the trust. Perhaps I should know.</hs_para>

that the private sector will do everything super-efficiently, but it
will do it efficiently from its perspective. None the less, with a bit

Some of them have a trailer that they take round. I think that the

51ZDA relates to the ownership of, and access to, the energy
consumption data that will be stored by smart meters. I am grateful to
my noble friend for the opportunity to explain the important regulatory
changes on smart metering data access and privacy that have came into
effect since last month. The smart meter data access framework is based
on the principle that consumers should have a choice about how their
data are used and by whom. The first step is that energy consumption
data will be stored by smart meters themselves, in people’s
homes. The meters will be capable of storing at least 24 months-worth
of historic data. The second step is that consumers will have control
and choice over who can access the data held on those smart
meters.</hs_para>

to access their data directly from the meter in their home. Energy
suppliers are required to ensure that consumers are able to do this. As
part of their smart meter installation, all domestic consumers will be
offered an in-home display. This will connect them directly to their
smart meter and show them how much energy they are using, in real time
and historically, and what it is costing them. We expect other
innovative products to be developed that will connect directly to the
smart meter, which consumers will be able to purchase on the high
street.</hs_para>

choose to give their energy supplier, or anyone else offering them an
attractive product or service, remote access to their data. This
enables companies to offer services to consumers such as regular home
energy reports. The only exception, where consumers do not have a
choice, is that the meters will provide energy suppliers with the data
required for billing or other regulated duties. One of the key benefits
of smart metering for consumers is the end of estimated billing. This
data access framework, embedding the principles of consumer choice and
control, has been implemented through changes to energy
suppliers’ licences and will be enforced by
Ofgem.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_11_PT_1/66F93BBCA40833A4C66A869CE33F848D00FC86AB" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 11 July 2013">Thursday,

I turn to the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, I will respond to
two points. Both noble Lords asked about data control and engagement.
While I have given noble Lords a broad overview, we also have in place
a central consumer delivery body that would be able to reach out and
reassure consumers with an independent voice on how their data is being
kept. We have come to create the mechanism through which the data is
stored with advice from the National Technical Authority for
Information Assurance, which is linked to the Government’s GCHQ;
I hate acronyms. We therefore know that we have worked with a huge
amount of expertise on national data security. The noble Lord, Lord
O’Neill, will welcome the appointment of his colleague the noble
Baroness, Lady McDonagh, as the chairman of the central delivery
body.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071182000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071182000102">The
other mechanism, which I have just mentioned, is the data and
communications company. This will effectively be the mechanism through
which all information will go. It has security on the front and back
ends. The information that will be utilised from consumers’
homes cannot be accessed unless it has been accredited to the suppliers
who have signed up through their licence conditions to the utilisation
of smart meters. There is a huge amount of information out there that I
urge noble Lords to access. If noble Lords would like me to, I am more
than happy to ensure that they receive the updated frameworks and codes
of practice that we are putting out there to ensure that there is
absolute privacy for and security on data for consumers. We have worked
hard to ensure that we satisfy the sort of concerns and fears that
noble Lords are
raising.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071182000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071182000103">I now
turn to Amendment 51AA of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt. I, like the noble
Baroness, Lady Worthington, support the sentiment behind the amendment
concerning the provision of energy information to consumers. The first
step to saving energy is to receive reliable, quality advice about
energy efficiency. Generic advice from a high street shop will only get
you to a certain stage of information availability. The best approach
is to get personalised advice that is tailored to your own home. This
is the only way to ensure that recommendations and savings estimates
are truly meaningful for the consumer. The Green Deal assessment does
exactly
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071182000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071182000104">The
Green Deal assessment provides detailed advice about the range of
options which might be suitable for a particular property, including
insulation and other efficiency measures, renewable heating systems and
options for generating low-carbon electricity, like solar 
<?notus-xml column=176?>panels. Householders also receive advice on how they use energy through
an occupancy assessment. It is still early days, but awareness of the
scheme has grown rapidly. I am pleased to say that nearly 40,000 Green
Deal assessments had been completed by mid-June, with thousands
happening every month. Physical demonstrations are always a highly
effective way to raise consumer awareness of the measures available.
That is why we are supporting the development of a national
“open homes” network to make it easy for people to see
how homes can be improved by energy-saving
retrofits.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071182000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071182000105"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Worthington" PimsId="5934" UID="13071182000239" xid="2144" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071182000239">Baroness
Worthington:</Member></B> We have seen the statistics on the Green

Verma:</Member></B> My Lords, first, we have to recognise that the
Green Deal is still in its early stages. Given that, the numbers of
assessments received and accepted are quite high. The noble Baroness
does not get the point that the Green Deal assesses the
individual’s needs and tailors advice to that
individual’s home, whereas getting generic advice would be
exactly that: generic. Everybody’s homes and requirements are
different. The way the assessments are carried out is tailored to those
individual needs and engages on a one-to-one basis—if the noble
Baroness would allow me to finish—the needs of those consumers
and their households. You cannot get that from going to a one-stop shop
for that advice. This is tailored advice and it is too early to say
whether the Green Deal measures are reaching out and people are
engaging with them. Given the number of assessments that we have
delivered, people are engaging with them. We must not be pessimistic
about the numbers. I welcome the fact that there has been quite a surge
in people wanting to access
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071182000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071182000108"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Worthington" PimsId="5934" UID="13071182000241" xid="2144" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071182000241">Baroness

point. Obviously, everybody’s body and lifestyle are different

up-front payment fewer people will receive advice? Is there not a role
for very low-level but expert advice that can be tailored? Of course,

Verma:</Member></B> It is up to suppliers whether they charge: they may

a cashback scheme to consumers as further encouragement to install
energy efficiency measures. The steps we are taking in the area of
energy efficiency form part of a whole coherent strategy. As noble
Lords mentioned, alongside the Green Deal we are also rolling out smart
meters. The introduction of smart meters will provide consumers with
real-time information on their energy consumption to help them control
their energy use. As part of the smart meter installation visit,

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 51ZE deals again with the
redress powers. The issue here is that the Government have rightly
given Ofgem the ability to require compensation as well as to fine for
breach of licence conditions or consumer law, but it is not clear
whether this could apply to the cases that are currently under
investigation by Ofgem, to which my noble friend Lady Liddell, who is
no longer in her place, referred earlier.</hs_para>

investigations include one that started in September 2010, looking at
doorstep selling for Scottish and Southern, ScottishPower and npower; 
<?notus-xml column=178?>a separate one into doorstep selling for E.ON; one into customer

ScottishPower. In total, there are eight or nine ongoing

has therefore already started a number of such investigations and, as I
understand it, will start some more in the months between now and Royal
Assent. At present it does not appear that the powers to award
compensation would be allowable under that welcome provision in this
Bill. However, if Ofgem finds against the companies it seems likely
that a significant number of consumers will have suffered detriment and
that the consideration of potential damage to the companies has
outweighed the Government’s determination to ensure justice for
those consumers.</hs_para>

was put in the Commons by my honourable friend Tom Greatrex, the
Minister replied that this would be retrospective legislation. It is
not retrospective legislation. Ofgem would have to find that there had
been breach of consumer law or a licence that already existed.
Previously, consumers would have to go to court to get compensation but
the provisions in this Bill would allow Ofgem to award that
compensation. This is not inventing a law in retrospect; it is ensuring
that the compensation comes through an easier
channel.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071182000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0001.htm#13071182000117">It is
important that those consumers whose complaints are currently being
investigated by Ofgem benefit in the same way as future consumers will
from what is a sensible improvement to the situation by the Government.

is simply improving delivery of the penalty and the rightful
compensation that is due to these consumers. I beg to

his amendments. Amendments 51ZEA and 51ZFA are designed to amend

powers through the Energy Bill, our objective has been to put consumers
first and we will consider any amendments from that perspective. It may

aware of the presumption that powers should not generally be applied
retrospectively. This is an important principle, but we are also
concerned by the effect this will have on consumers. It is likely that
the introduction of the regulatory uncertainty that these amendments
will create will lead to increases in the cost of capital for energy
companies, pushing up bills for everyone. We want to avoid creating
investor uncertainty, particularly when we are trying to encourage the
private sector investment that is required to move 
<?notus-xml column=179?>to a low-carbon economy. Increasing costs will hit most heavily the
small energy companies that we want to come into the sector. We want

addition, smaller energy companies would be most likely to shoulder the
burden of the increased costs of insurance premiums that could arise
from these amendments, as companies seek to cover their liability for
events prior to the enactment of the Bill. My noble friend Lord Deben
touched on some of these concerns more generally when we debated an
earlier group of amendments. The combination of these factors may push
up costs for energy consumers, impacting the very people we seek to
protect. The potential unintended consequences of these measures mean
that, while I am entirely sympathetic to the intentions behind the
amendments, it could be counterproductive to accept them. For those
reasons, I hope that at this stage the noble Lord will feel able to
withdraw his

arguments at all. New entrants will not be affected. If they are not
operating in the market at the moment, they will be operating under the
very process that is prescribed in the Bill. There is therefore no
uncertainty for them. Furthermore, the only retrospection will be in
how compensation is delivered. Any breach will have been under a
contract or licence that already existed at the time that the breach
occurred. Any breach of consumer law would have been a breach of the
law at the time, and therefore susceptible to a court case brought by
one or more consumers at that point. This is not retrospective

Lord Deben, talked about earlier. He perhaps had a point. This simply
concerns consumers who are currently under investigation. We also have

some of them might have started a court case had it not been for the

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, this is a straightforward question. The
size of any compensation is limited to 10% of the company’s
turnover, which is a fair amount. For some of these companies, it would
be about £1 billion, which is a fair whack of
compensation. Therefore, the possibility of awarding that compensation
to an individual consumer would arise very rarely. However, it is of
course possible that a serious breach of an industrial contract could
lead to a loss to an operator of that order. My principal point here is
that, in most sector regulations, a 10% limit applies to the fine that
the regulator can impose. It is a reasonable limit on the enforcement
and sanctioning powers of a public body. If Ofwat, Ofcom and Ofgem have
the ability to impose fines of this order, the 10% limit is not
unreasonable, but it is irrelevant to any potential compensation. The
Minister may say this will never arise, and he may well be right, but
in principle, if you have suffered detriment, should there be a limit
on the degree to which you can seek redress for that detriment? That is
the principle I am trying to establish. I beg to
move.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13071182000206" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0002.htm#13071182000206">5.30

Gardiner of Kimble:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendments 51ZEB and 51ZEC,
51ZFB and 51ZFC are designed to amend Schedule 14 and permit unlimited
liability for energy companies by seeking to ensure that the amount of
compensation that can be required through a consumer redress order is

in drafting the powers in the Bill has been to ensure that the overall
interests of the consumer are put first. With this in mind, we have
sought to achieve a balance between the need for consumers to get
speedy access to the redress they are due and an appeal process which
is proportionate to the potential liability faced by energy companies
and which does not present a barrier to entry for the small suppliers
that we need to ensure a healthy competitive
market.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071182000128" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0002.htm#13071182000128">In
response to previous amendments, I mentioned that consumers can obtain
redress through the courts under existing arrangements. However, the
legal process is lengthy and does not offer a typically quick remedy
for consumers who have lost out. This is largely because the legal
process is necessarily equal to the potential sums at stake, where
compensation is unlimited. Schedule 14 sets out powers which contain
appeal mechanisms that are proportionate to the potential penalty.
These are also limited to 10% of an energy company’s annual
turnover and offer a relatively straightforward resolution of
cases.</hs_para>

remove the cap could deny consumers timely compensation, as they would
require us to make changes to the appeal mechanism, which could result
in a more lengthy resolution of cases. Given how unlikely it is that
consumers would lose out on a scale that went beyond the level of the
10% cap, we do not consider such a change is justifiable. As the noble
Lord, Lord Whitty, has mentioned, for the very largest domestic energy
suppliers to exceed a cap of 10% of annual turnover would mean
penalties and compensation of over £1 billion. This contrasts 
<?notus-xml column=181?>with the largest penalty imposed by Ofgem to date of £15 million.
We therefore believe that the proposed cap on redress is unlikely to
hamper Ofgem’s ability to impose appropriate redress
orders.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071182000130" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0002.htm#13071182000130">As I
have mentioned in relation to previous amendments, removing the cap on
liability could also have adverse impacts on smaller energy companies
and, in turn, on consumer bills, due to the increased cost of capital
and insurance premiums for energy companies. I assure your Lordships
that the approach set out in the Bill does not let companies off the
hook. The combined 10% cap on penalties and redress will apply to each
separate regulatory breach, so that any company breaking the rules on a
number of occasions will face correspondingly larger payouts. For the
reasons I have set out, I hope the noble Lord feels able to withdraw
his
amendment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071182000131" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0002.htm#13071182000131"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Whitty" PimsId="4591" UID="13071182000251" xid="1139" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0002.htm#13071182000251">Lord

that last point, because it indicates that it would not apply to a

for his explanation but I still think there is a difference between a
limit on the ability of the regulator to impose a fine and a limit on

carefully the secondary legislation which will define what is a
“community activity”. Quite clearly, if it were to move

Grantchester:</Member></B> My Lords, this is an important government
amendment and we welcome the group, which replicates amendments tabled
by Labour in Committee in the other place to increase the feed-in
tariffs to at least 10 megawatts. This comes as a welcome
acknowledgment of the gap that exists in the Bill on community energy.
I also pay tribute to the personal enthusiasm of the
Minister of State in the other place, Mr Greg Barker, both for these
schemes and for the 
<?notus-xml column=183?>work that he has done since the debate in order to secure the amendment.
We welcome the progress the Government have made in this
respect.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071182000139" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0002.htm#13071182000139">On
Report in the other place, we pushed the Government to introduce a
minimum threshold for the fixed feed-in tariff of 10 megawatts. The
Community Energy Coalition of NGOs, including the Centre for
Sustainable Energy, the Forum for the Future, the National Trust, the
Low Carbon Communities Network, Co-operatives UK and many more have
called for the threshold to be raised even higher to 20 megawatts to
allow community energy schemes a guaranteed income and enable them to
participate effectively in the energy market in the
future.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071182000140" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0002.htm#13071182000140">Already
in the UK a number of community energy schemes exceed 5 megawatts, such
as Westmill Wind Farm Co-operative in Oxfordshire of 6.5 megawatts, the
Lochcarnan Community Wind Farm on South Uist of 7 megawatts and the
Neilston Community Wind Farm near Glasgow of 10 megawatts. Community
schemes are not necessarily small. The mid-size market can attract the
participation of the wider population in renewable energy and the
attainment of our 2020 targets. These schemes should also be given the
signal that there is support to develop
further.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071182000141" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0002.htm#13071182000141">The
Energy and Climate Change Committee has argued that medium-sized
projects of up to 50 megawatts are disadvantaged because they cannot
access the feed-in tariff, yet often lack the financial capability to
deal with the complexities of the renewables obligation and, in the
future, contracts for difference. In the interim, until contracts for
difference come into play, the gap remains. They may also struggle to
obtain the reference price under the CFD regime, meaning that they
would lose out financially. Why is the threshold fixed at 10 megawatts?
What will the Government do to support mid-sized community energy
schemes which are not eligible for the FITs but have difficulty
accessing the contracts for difference? Community and co-operative
energy schemes can be hugely beneficial in helping to meet our
renewables targets that must be met by
2020.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071182000142" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0002.htm#13071182000142">Research
reported by Co-operatives UK estimates that there is the potential for
at least 3.5 gigawatts in UK community energy schemes by
2020—the equivalent of four conventional coal-fired power
stations. Looking overseas, Germany, where 15% of renewables are
community owned, is a good example of how community energy generation
helps to diversify the market and increase its resilience. Locally
owned and locally targeted strategies for energy generation and saving
can be better tailored to local needs, such as helping to tackle fuel
poverty, and can increase community awareness and engagement in a way
that leads to lower bills and greater sustainability. We welcome the

mechanism to encourage easy investment and engagement from people and
organisations for whom energy is not their core business and who do not
want the complexity of the renewables obligation. So far the mid-size
market has failed due to excessively low FIT tariffs and unfair
capacity constraints. However, the constraints on many applications of
non-domestic solar are unfair. First, the FIT tariffs were set too low
for many of the non-domestic FIT bands. Secondly, the degression
mechanisms under budgetary constraint measures that come into play at
relatively early stages are having the effect of leading to an
imbalance between technologies.</hs_para>

especially feels that it is subject to unnecessarily harsh measures.
The consequences of these low capacity triggers is that any significant
national deployment of solar power in schemes over 50 kilowatts in

cuts to the tariff that will make developing further schemes
uneconomical. The solar industry contends that between 50 kilowatts and
5 megawatts it is cheaper than other renewables supported under the
renewables obligation. I ask the Minister: why does it feel that it is
subject to constraints beyond those that utility-scale renewables are
subject to under the renewables obligation? Can the Minister clarify
whether this Energy Bill could be used to correct the situation or
could this be achieved through secondary legislation? Would there be
any repercussions to correcting her department’s imbalance in
the energy mix between technologies? Would there be an increase in the
total budget before degression or would it result in reducing payments
to some other
technologies?</hs_para><hs_time UID="13071182000207" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0002.htm#13071182000207">5.45

debated with the Minister yesterday when we were discussing the RHI

which can choke off investment from coming forward to help the UK get
near to the 2020 targets, which are still a long way from being
attained. No doubt in future we will debate at greater length the
barriers faced by smaller generators to participating in the market and
taking advantage of the new CFDs in terms of the technical knowledge
required. Access for smaller participants is vital to extend the energy

think I sensed a warm welcome from the noble Lord, Lord Grantchester,
as well. He said it was an afterthought. It was actually because we
considered really hard what people had been saying and took that advice
on board so I hope that the noble Lord has welcomed it with open arms.
I agree with my noble friend Lord Roper that we must ensure that we
have in place robust legislation, which will provide confidence that
these subsidies will be delivered only to the intended

always, the noble Lord, Lord Grantchester, raised a number of searching
questions. Although I tried very hard to keep up with him, I suspect
that I will end up having to write to him in response to one or two.
The noble Lord asked why we should stop at 10 megawatts.
Supporting generation through the FIT scheme is more expensive than
market-based mechanisms such as the renewables obligation. We value
community energy and are willing to extend the FIT scheme to support
the ambition of the sector. Community developments larger than 10
megawatts will still get support but at that scale they will need to
apply for the renewables
obligation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071182000148" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0002.htm#13071182000148">The
noble Lord also mentioned that we had a call for evidence around the
benefits of and barriers to community energy access. The community
energy strategy will be published in the autumn and will identify the
potential of community energy projects in the UK to bring benefits to
communities while, very importantly, still helping tackle climate
change and maintain energy security. The strategy will go further than
renewable electricity generation projects. It will also include
community energy-efficiency schemes, community renewable heat projects,
smart grids and collective energy-purchasing and switching
schemes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071182000149" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0002.htm#13071182000149">On
degression, the non-domestic solar PV sector is supported by the
renewables obligation and the FIT scheme, so some schemes are receiving
both. But degression is a necessary tool. As we discussed yesterday, we
do not want to put an unfair balance in favour of one technology over
another while technologies are developing. The mechanism of degression
assists us in ensuring that some technologies do not get an
overexposure to subsidies while other technologies try to reach up and
compete on an equal basis. On that note, I commend these
amendments.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="13071182000292" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0002.htm#13071182000292">Amendment

to the Explanatory Notes as they would help explain what it is all
about. However, the Explanatory Notes simply repeated what was written

that was absolutely hopeless. I then turned to the debate in the

give some explanation as to what these fees for energy resilience might
be. My colleagues in the other place did press him quite hard, because
one reading could see it as a way to discourage strike action in those
sectors that deliver fuel or are connected with the energy sector. We
were pleased to receive quite emphatic reassurances that these fees
would not be applied to unions that sought to take strike
action.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071182000157" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0002.htm#13071182000157">What<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-11T17:54:24"></hs_TimeCode>
seemed to emerge was that the fees are going to be levied on business
in response to extreme events that it was almost impossible to predict.
That could be anything but some examples were given. The Government 
<?notus-xml column=187?>might need to step in and provide personnel to companies in the event of
an outbreak of a flu pandemic and would want to recover the cost in
fees. Then there was the potential for equipment or vehicles that the
Government own to be deployed in the event of extreme weather or of a
clean-up. Then there are the unspecified assets that might need to be
provided in the short term to business. Really, this is the Treasury
seeking a power to regain costs for that. What have we come to? Is the
government budget so tight that we are introducing powers to claw back
money for disaster situations? In reality, if a disaster strikes you
want the Government to be able to respond. You do not want there to be
any quibbling about costs being passed on or who will pay for what. Why
do we—and companies—pay taxes? The Government are there
to provide a service in the event of national security
issues.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071182000158" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0002.htm#13071182000158">Maybe
I am wrong and there are plenty of precedents for the Treasury
introducing specific powers to recover money for specific unintended
events. If there are, I stand corrected. However, my reading of this is
that it is an extraordinarily broad power with almost no definition and
very little accountability. For that reason, it does not have a place
in this Bill. Obviously, as we go forward we know that there will be an
increase in natural disasters that could potentially interrupt energy
supply. In fact, we have quite a resilient system for dealing with
that. The power companies and national grid are on the front line.
Their licence requirements mean that they have to reconnect customers
as soon as they can. When the large storms hit the Isle of Arran, SSE
men in vans were out there fixing that problem. The Government were not
involved. I suspect that the Government do not have the skills to
address these issues.</hs_para>

must be about military personnel. It can only be about military
deployment because the department certainly does not have skilled
engineers who can go and fix transmission lines. That is all done in
the private sector. If it is about concerns about the military and the
budget, this is quite a strange precedent to set, that there will
somehow be fees applied to businesses. Are those fees voluntary or
mandatory? How will they work? Does a company have to pay? As I said,
when will all this be negotiated? If there is a natural disaster I
would hope that we got on with fixing the problem and that the
Government would be sufficiently robust and well resourced to do that,
not that we would be quibbling about collecting these
fees.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071182000160" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0002.htm#13071182000160">As I

Jenkin of Roding:</Member></B> I apologise for appearing to interrupt
the noble Baroness in mid-flow. I just have one question. I had the
same problem as the noble Baroness did. I thought, “Why has this
clause stand 
<?notus-xml column=188?>part question been put down and what does the clause say?”. I
turned up the Ofgem consultation letter published on the same day as
its recent capacity assessment report, which has of course shown that
the margins will, by the middle of this decade, become very much
smaller. It goes on making hopeful remarks that perhaps there will not
be interruptions but an increasing number of people think that there
might be. The letter consults on additional balancing measures for the
grid. It proposes two of them. I will not go into this in great detail
at this hour of the night—we are due to rise in two
minutes—but does that have anything to do with this clause?

point, but one related to that raised by the noble Baroness, Lady
Worthington. The report of the Delegated Powers Committee raised very
clearly a point about subsection (3)(b), where money can be specified
or determined by the Secretary of State without any reference to
Parliament. Your Lordships’ Delegated Powers Committee is very
clear, and
concludes:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13071182000198" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0002.htm#13071182000198">“We

clause does not set the rate of any fees or charges. It will enable the
Secretary of State to set fees either through secondary legislation or
through administrative means and, as such, to recoup some or all of the
costs of providing the service. It cannot and will not be used as a
revenue-raising measure; that is not the purpose of this provision. The

widespread impacts on workers due to flu or industrial action;
equipment or vehicles which have greater flexibility in extreme weather

Government have set up a military fuel school to train military
personnel to drive commercial fuel tankers. Drivers could be deployed

well be situations where it would be appropriate and feasible to set
out the level of fees to be charged for a particular service in
secondary legislation, and the Government would aim to do so in those
circumstances. However, it is likely that there may also be
circumstances where it is not feasible to work within the timetable
required for secondary legislation, and the flexibility afforded by
ministerial direction would be required for those sorts of situations.
Lack of this flexibility may make the services difficult to deliver

Worthington:</Member></B> It seems to me that we have got to the bottom
of this. It is a very narrow thing that is needed, yet the Government
have created an incredibly enabling piece of legislation with no
scrutiny. It is poor legislative drafting to have taken such a
wide-ranging power. The Minister says that it will not apply to
electricity, or will be used only in certain circumstances—which
boils down to the Army learning how to drive fuel tankers. That is very
narrow, but this is not a narrow provision. It almost sounds as if one
could interpret this as the Government going into the energy supply
business. It is that broad. I am glad and encouraged that we are not. I
am also reassured to hear that this is discretionary, although how that
would play out I am not sure. Either you deploy or you do not
deploy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071182000178" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0002.htm#13071182000178">Is the
Minister saying that we would not deploy unless the company agreed to
pay? That would be a reduction in the security of the country. The
company might say, “No, we’re not paying for
that”. Who in their right mind would say yes? If you are an oil 
<?notus-xml column=191?>company, you will not have factored into your bottom line unexpected
payments to the Government for people to drive your tankers. The money
has to be recouped from somewhere, and a company would be perfectly
within its rights to refuse to pay. In that case, the Government will
have to deploy their personnel anyway, or risk an interruption in our
fuel supply. This needs to be narrowed in its application. It needs
more definition in
law.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071182000179" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-gc0002.htm#13071182000179">I

social mobility and widen participation, and to create a more
responsive higher education sector in which funding follows the
decisions of learners and where successful institutions will thrive.
The funding reforms, that rebalanced funding from grants to tuition

first reform is placing the funding council in  an Oversight
and Coordination role. This is a  complex, but highly necessary
function that will ensure proportionate regulation across all higher
education providers and co-ordinate the regulatory activity of a number
of bodies that are variously constituted as Government agencies and
independent bodies. It will involve the funding council:</hs_para>
<hs_WAIndent>Acting as registrar;</hs_WAIndent>
<hs_WAIndent>Working with higher education providers,
agencies, representative bodies and the NUS, to monitor systematically
observance of the conditions associated with operating in the system,
with a focus on protecting the collective student
interest;</hs_WAIndent><hs_WAIndent>Taking a lead in
working with partners to identify and address issues within higher

I have asked the funding council to establish a Register of Higher
Education Provision. Good, high-quality, timely and reliable
information is key to enabling students to make the right decisions on
their education. It is also important that those institutions that
fulfil requirements that provide confidence to students and the public
are appropriately recognised.</hs_para>

Education Provision will therefore act as a consumer safeguard. The
Register will give information on:</hs_para><hs_WAIndent>The
constitutional/organisational status of each higher education
provider;</hs_WAIndent><hs_WAIndent>How the higher education provider
is funded; and,</hs_WAIndent><hs_WAIndent>What the
provider is committed to do—this might include, but
not be limited to, provision of information, quality requirements,
financial management, governance, complaints handling, and fair
access.</hs_WAIndent><hs_para UID="13071163000424" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-wms0001.htm#13071163000424">The
third reform is introducing a Statement of  HEI Designation
Conditions. Regulatory requirements on higher education institutions
are currently primarily applied through the funding council’s
Financial Memorandum which applies conditions to grant funding and
establishes clear accountability for such funding. This arrangement
will continue. From academic year 2014/15 onwards it is my intention
that similar conditions will also apply to HEI automatic course
designation for student support. This ensures that the rebalancing of
funding from grants to tuition fees does not diminish the effectiveness
of the current regulatory regime and the confidence this provides to
students and the public. 
<?notus-xml column=36?>It also means the regulatory burden is minimised as no further
requirements are placed on institutions than currently exist.</hs_para>

will be updating the Education (Student Support) Regulations. BIS will
discuss the details of the amendment and its implementation in practice
with representatives of the higher education sector. Importantly, once
the regulations have been made, BIS intends to delegate to the funding
council the function of designation of courses at higher education
institutions for student support purposes. This continues the existing
protections that institutions enjoy through the funding council being
at arms length from Government.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13071163000426" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-wms0001.htm#13071163000426">Over the next academic
year the funding council will be consulting on an updated version of
the Financial Memorandum, informed by extensive discussions
the council has already held with higher education
representatives and other interested bodies. I understand that the
proposed changes are limited, with the most significant issue for
consultation being new arrangements to manage the risks around
financial commitments. These arrangements are important for sustaining
confidence in universities in the capital markets.</hs_para>

continuing to exercise prudent control of  the overall higher
education budget, student choice  is being increased through
our tariff policy and the consultation on a flexibility margin for
2014/15. The tariff threshold has been reduced to ABB or equivalent
from 2013/14 which frees around one-third of places from number
controls. These policies will allow more students to study at their
first choice institution.</hs_para>

are an important part of increasing choice for students. The sixth
reform is to the designation system for alternative providers. Specific
course designation at alternative providers allows eligible
English-domiciled students on designated courses to access loans and
grants from the Student Loan Company (with the maximum fee loan being
£6,000 per annum). This widens student choice and strengthens
the forces that drive innovation.</hs_para>

Government are committed to ensuring that there are robust processes in
place to protect the interest of students, the reputation of UK higher
education, and the public investment. Following a Government
consultation existing and new alternative providers will now have to
meet stronger requirements on quality assurance, financial
sustainability and good governance. We will also expect that the
collective student interest is served through this
process.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071163000431" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-wms0001.htm#13071163000431">To
accompany the strengthening of specific course designation for
alternative providers we are also planning to introduce a system of
Student Number Controls for alternative providers. This will be

2014/15.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071163000432" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-wms0001.htm#13071163000432">Finally
in the highly unlikely event that a higher education institution or
alternative provider does not meet the conditions of course designation
in respect of student support funding there is a risk that the course
will no longer remain designated. To protect the students at an
institution where this occurs I have asked the 
<?notus-xml column=37?>funding council working with Government and the wider sector to look at
options for developing a Designation Resolution Process. This should
place the interests of students at the centre of the
process.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071163000433" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130711-wms0001.htm#13071163000433">Taken
as a whole these eight higher education regulatory reforms constitute a
package of measures, alongside the previous rebalancing of funding, to

have written to Sir David Calvert-Smith, Chairman of the Parole Board

withdraw the Secretary of State’s Directions to the Parole Board

Parole Board has the important responsibility of determining whether
some of the most dangerous prisoners in the criminal justice system can
be safely released back into the community. We have recently enacted
legislation in the form of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of
Offenders (LASPO) Act 2012 which contains a clear and consistent
statutory release test that the Board must apply in making those
decisions—that is, the Board must not direct a prisoner’s
release unless their detention is no longer necessary for the
protection of the public. The LASPO Act applies this “public
protection” test to all cases which come before the Board and
also provides a power for the Secretary of State to amend the test by
Order. In view of this, I consider that it is no longer necessary or
appropriate for the Directions to remain in place.</hs_para>

incarnation, the Board was an advisory body which made recommendations
to the Secretary of State who was responsible for the final decisions
on release. It was in this context that the power for the Secretary of
State to issue Directions to the Board was established. Since then,
however, the Board has evolved into an independent decision-making
body. I believe that it is more appropriate, therefore, for the Board

withdrawing the existing Directions in favour of the Parole Board
applying its own guidance. The Board issued guidance for its members in
November 2012 which sets out how the statutory release test in 
<?notus-xml column=45?>the LASPO Act is to be applied. In addition, the Board has produced
guidance which lists the factors to be taken into account by panels
when considering whether to release different categories of prisoner.
This list largely reflects the same factors set out in the Secretary of
State’s Directions, so in practical terms the withdrawal of the
Directions will not materially change how the Board approaches its
release decisions. I should like to emphasise that the protection of
the public will remain at the heart of every release decision made by
the Board.</hs_para>

unconventional gas and oil is carried out by the Environment Agency.
Currently, the Agency works with hydraulic fracturing companies and
their well services providers to ensure that they fully disclose the
chemicals they intend to use in hydraulic fracturing operations. It
assesses the hazards presented by fracking fluid additives on a case by
case basis. Operators must disclose chemicals they intend to use as
part of the permitting process. This information is then published by
the Environment Agency on its website. The Agency has powers to require
full disclosure of those chemicals, both under the Water Resources Act
1991 and the Environmental Permitting Regulations 2010. Technical
guidance, which will also cover disclosure of chemicals, is due to be
published for consultation by the end of
