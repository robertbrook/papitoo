greater economic and political co-operation between Georgia and the
European Union, particularly through regular and intensive high-level
contact. Three senior Georgian Ministers have visited London in recent
months and three UK Ministers and several senior officials have visited
Tbilisi. We are pleased that Euro-Atlantic integration has remained a
priority for the new Georgian Government, and, through involvement in
the Eastern Partnership, Georgia is finalising an association agreement
and a deep and comprehensive free trade area with the
EU<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T15:06:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070363000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0001.htm#13070363000003"><B><Member ContinuationText="The Lord Bishop of Wakefield" PimsId="4481" UID="13070363000164" xid="2005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0001.htm#13070363000164">The

Minister for his response and for setting out the range of co-operation
between Georgia and the EU. I remain concerned that, for most
Georgians, this assistance remains invisible. Do the Government accept
that to avoid similar mistakes to those made with the Ukraine, the EU
should take steps to explain to the wider Georgian public the benefits
of the association agreement and other such co-operation measures with
the EU, rather than after they have been

ago and saw that the EU is quite visible there. The EU monitoring
mission is the largest external monitoring mission in Georgia,
monitoring the borders with the disputed territories of Abkhazia and
South Ossetia. The EU heads of mission meet regularly, and comment
regularly and openly, on developments in Georgian politics. The Council
of Europe and the OSCE are also active in assisting with judicial

the noble Lord knows well, the Russians are not always the easiest
negotiating partners. As he will also know, a fence is being erected
along the boundary of the breakaway regions and, in some cases, several
hundred metres into Georgian territory beyond the breakaway regions. We
continue to talk to the Russians about this. The new Georgian
Government have made a number of deliberate unilateral moves to
demonstrate their willingness to talk to the Russians. There have been

Bucharest some years ago NATO agreed to accept Georgia as a candidate

moment is two Georgian battalions. We support Georgia’s
aspiration to join NATO but it will necessarily, unavoidably be a long

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, it is entirely fair to say
that Ukraine is considerably behind Georgia in many ways. There was a
free and fair election in Georgia last spring which resulted in a
change of Government. The Georgian Government have just announced that
on 31 October this year there will be a presidential election. Of
course, that is not to say that it is a perfect democracy. There are a
number of issues, including cases against members of the previous
Administration, about which we are concerned. However, when I was in
Tbilisi I had lunch at the British embassy with MPs both from the
governing party and from the opposition. There are many countries in
what was formerly the Soviet Union in which one could not do

sentiments behind the noble Lord’s question. As he knows well,
the process of admission to the European Union is long and arduous.
Georgia is at a very early stage in that process. Georgia’s
administrative capability 
<?notus-xml column=1205?>and economic changes and the judicial, rule of law
issues that it will have to go through mean that any approach to the

less than 100 miles from the Georgian border, will my noble friend urge
the UK mission to the UN to encourage Georgian and Russian
reconciliation when the Olympic Truce is presented to the United

faithfulness with which he wishes to ensure that we think about the
Olympic Truce. We are very conscious that the Sochi Winter Olympics are
taking place extremely close to the border with Abkhazia and that that
may potentially raise some security issues. There is instability in the
north Caucasus as well as in the south Caucasus and we have, of course,
spoken to the Russians about
that.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-03?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_03_PT_1/D47196F99C9915289A8745145565590B84420385" __version__="1.14"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 3 July 2013">Wednesday,

past two years, and recent government measures do not help. For
example, on the BBC’s “Look North” last night, it
was reported that rent arrears had shot up in Sunderland, Newcastle and
north Tyneside as a result of the bedroom tax, raising fears of further
evictions and homelessness. Will the Government recognise that
misleading national figures about overcrowding and underoccupancy fail
to appreciate the huge mismatch between these two things across the
country, and that the Government should now, on an area-by-area basis,
work urgently with local authorities and housing associations to stop
the acute crisis in housing and homelessness getting even

that many of these homeless people are dealt with by charities, rather
than by local authorities? They are very difficult for anyone to
manage. When I was a chairman of social services, we had homeless
shelters where people used to smoke so often that you had a permanent
fire hazard in the building. People who elect to sleep on the street
often do not wish to be under any authority that would regulate them.

half an hour on the financial situation and why we are in a position
where we have to reduce funding across both government and local
authorities. As I said before and will reiterate, local authorities
need to manage the budgets that they have, and need to make the
necessary adjustments to how they administer themselves and allocate
their funding. The noble Baroness is right that budgets are not
ring-fenced, but local authorities are given specific allocations to
help with particular areas, including homelessness. However, we are
where we are and in the financial situation that we are, which did not
start with this Government. Therefore, we all have to play our part in
trying to ensure that that is
improved.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-03?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_03_PT_1/102DFDE906F25821D4E3EE858D74A724FAEB8B29" __version__="1.14"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 3 July 2013">Wednesday,

Attlee:</Member></B> My Lords, as I said on Monday, we take cycle
safety very seriously. Earlier this year, we announced £40
million, including local contributions, for 78 junction safety schemes.
In addition, the majority of schemes in the £600 million local
sustainable transport fund include cycling. We have made it easier for
councils to introduce 20 mph speed limits and install Trixi mirrors. We
are considering the recommendations of the All-Party Parliamentary
Cycling Group inquiry and will respond
shortly.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T15:29:16"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para><hs_para UID="13070363000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0001.htm#13070363000044"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Greaves" PimsId="3545" UID="13070363000204" xid="1111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0001.htm#13070363000204">Lord
Greaves:</Member></B> My Lords, over the past two years, the number of
cyclists killed on the roads has gone up from 111 to 118 per annum and
the number seriously injured, perhaps more worryingly, from 2,660 to
3,222. One of the main problems that cyclists have is their interaction
with heavy vehicles. It is welcome that the Minister for Road Safety
announced, I think last week, the setting up of the cycle-lorry safety
working group, jointly between the Transport Department and Transport
for London. Can the Minister say when this working group will start
work; who will be involved and particularly whether cycling
organisations will be able to give evidence to it; and which specific
aspects of cycle lorry safety will it look

I agree that HGVs are a disproportionate problem. HGVs do not have any
more accidents with cycles than do cars. However, when they do have an
accident, the result is generally much more serious. It is quite right

March continues to have the support of the three main political
parties. The Press Standards Board of Finance has petitioned with an
alternative charter and this is being given proper, legally robust
consideration in line with the Privy Council process. That will need to
include consideration of the merits of the petition in the light of all

Fowler:</Member></B> In thanking my noble friend for that response,
perhaps I may ask him two questions. First, am I right in saying that
the effective decision on the press’s proposal for its royal
charter will be taken by a group of Ministers who happen to be privy
counsellors? It is four months since the beginning of this royal
charter process. Why has it taken so long? Given that the Government
and Parliament have already rejected the press’s proposals, why
do they need until October to give even further consideration to them?
Secondly, is the Minister aware that press proprietors are now in the
process of setting up their own body in any event and that one story is
that they are to begin recruiting staff? Can the Minister therefore
tell me just when we will get round to deciding the royal charter which
was overwhelmingly approved by Parliament in March? Surely it is that
charter, the charter approved by Parliament, which is pre-eminent and
the one that we want to see considered and
implemented<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T15:38:49"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T15:38:45"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070363000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0001.htm#13070363000066"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Gardiner of Kimble" PimsId="5760" UID="13070363000226" xid="2035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0001.htm#13070363000226">Lord
Gardiner of Kimble:</Member></B> A number of questions were asked, my
Lords. We have to undertake due processes as regards the PressBoF
charter application. One reason for the timing of that is that none of
the detailed preliminary work with the relevant government departments
and other interested parties that normally precedes a formal petition
of the Privy Council has been undertaken. Indeed, that period of
openness has resulted in 19,000 responses. Due processes have to be
undertaken. That is the legal advice to which it is important to
adhere. As for the Government’s charter, work is continuing on
the outstanding points. I will perhaps go into them in further detail
later, but work is being undertaken on the Government’s
proposals. As for the press proprietors’ considerations, this is
a matter for the Privy Council, not a matter for the press proprietors.

collaborative relationship with employers, it is essential that the
interests of reservists are protected. Dismissal of reservists on the

broadly similar to now, although increased in size and capability. The
Army, however, has had substantially to redesign its reserve component

restructuring will require changes to the current basing laydown of the
Army Reserve. The TA currently operates from 334 individual sites
around the United Kingdom, including a number of locations with small
detachments of fewer than 30 personnel. Some of these sites are
seriously under-recruited. To maximise the potential for future
recruitment, the Army is determined that, as it translates its revised
structure into a basing laydown, it should take the opportunity to
rationalise its presence by merging small, poorly recruited sub-units
into larger sites in the same conurbation or in neighbouring
communities. As part of this exercise, the Army Reserve will open or
reopen nine additional reserve sites.</hs_para>

therefore retain a significant number of small and under-recruited

recruiting. The units on those sites will be challenged to recruit up
to strength in the years ahead. Over the next couple of years, we will

State. The Minister will be aware that the information on the hardly
insignificant issue of the net reduction of 26 sites that will be lost
was not available when the Secretary of State made his Statement. The
Speaker in the Commons described that as “woefully
inadequate” and reminded the Secretary of State that he was
responsible for his department. The information on the sites is now
available but will the Minister confirm that, in future, when the
Secretary of State makes a Statement, he—the Secretary
of State —will provide both it and the supporting
documentation at the normally accepted time?</hs_para>

Strategic Defence and Security Review in 2010 addressed the issue of
the commitments and planning assumptions that our future Armed Forces
could be expected to carry out and the maximum level, extent
and nature of operations they could be expected to undertake at any one

there were 102,000 regulars in the Army, still be carried out with a
Regular Army of 82,000 and an Army Reserve force of 30,000? Is the
reduction in the size of our Regular Army to 82,000 dependent on our
having increased the size of our trained Army Reserve to 30,000? If we
need a Regular Army of 82,000 and an Army Reserve force of 30,000 to
fulfil the maximum level, extent and nature of operations that we would
expect our future Armed Forces to undertake at any one time, as set out
in the 2010 SDSR, how can the Government allow the size of our Regular
Army to fall to 82,000 unless there is, by then, a trained Army Reserve
force of 30,000? If the reduction in the size of our Regular Army to
82,000 is not dependent on having first achieved an increase in the
size of our trained Army Reserve to 30,000, that must surely mean that
we will not have the manpower available that was assumed in the
2010 SDSR. Could the Minister confirm that this would mean
less capability as a result and, if so, which capabilities would go or

easy or otherwise it proves to increase the size of our reserve forces
remains to be seen. A recent Federation of Small Businesses survey
found that one in three employers believed that nothing would encourage
them to employ a reservist, despite the fact that service experience
provides people with organisational, team-building and leadership
skills. It is of course possible that the financial incentives for SMEs

the opportunity to help to ensure that we can maximise niche civilian

serve their country are protected in the workplace and do not suffer
discrimination. That may not always be easy to achieve, since
discrimination against someone who is not there the whole time can

The Secretary of State said that he would investigate and write to the

I am confident that we can deliver on that, and I will come to that in
a short while when I address another of his questions. His second
question concerned whether the reductions in the Regular Forces made
them more dependent on the reserves and the commitment that I was not
able to give the noble Lord the other day. I still cannot give that
commitment. We are aware that there are risks in this, but we are
confident. Recruiting is going well and the historical figures are on
our side. When I was in the Army—a long time ago,
admittedly—the reserves numbered 100,000, with a much smaller
population, and we had half the strength of the present reserves in
1990. Other countries, such as the United States, Australia and Canada,
have a much higher percentage of reserves. We are investing £1.8
billion over 10 years and, as the Statement said, we are investing
£40 million this year. We are confident that the reinvigorated
reserves will deliver the quality and number of reservists that we will
require in future, both in training and on
operations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070363000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0001.htm#13070363000118">Employers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T16:13:32"></hs_TimeCode>
play a key role in enabling the reserves to deliver their essential

noble Lord asked about how the £1.8 billion will be divided. We
review our allocation on a continuous basis, to maximise value for
money from the available resources to meet the needs of the Reserve
Forces. He also asked if a trained reservist would have the same level
of skills as a regular. When reservists deploy to operations, they will
be equally as skilled in their specialist roles as a regular they serve
alongside. The noble Lord asked how recruitment was going. All the
indications that I have heard indicate that it is going very well and

always attracted highly motivated individuals, and the assurance that

asked about the commitment that a reservist must give and whether there
is a minimum time. Every service person enlists for an agreed period of
service. As we are a voluntary force, we recognise that individuals can
exercise choice to remain or leave. Measures announced in the White

for turnover, I can confirm that retention of reservists, particularly
in the Army, is on average much better than that of their regular

Defence is committed to working with employers to understand their
views on its use of reservists and the impact of legislation, to
understand better what an employer can realistically sustain in future.
The Ministry of Defence understands the importance of engaging with
employers and potential employers and, in addition of engaging with

the noble Lord asked about the legal situation relating to employment
tribunals. An individual cannot generally bring a claim for unfair
dismissal at an employment tribunal until he or she has completed two
years of continuous service with an employer. Periods of mobilisation

reservists longer than two years to gain this protection. I think that

ourselves with saluting the sacrifice made by our reservists. To meet
the challenge of significantly increasing the numbers in our Reserve
Forces we need to foster the belief that employers, employees and the
nation all benefit from reserve service. Will the Minister say whether
medically trained reservists will be able to bring skills to the
military and develop additional skills to bring back to their UK
employers? Will he also tell the House how employers and employees are
to be convinced that there are benefits to the employer and the
employee from improved skills and experience while serving, which might
outweigh the temporary loss of civilian work time? Finally, will he say
whether consultation with employers—which he mentioned
previously—have uncovered signs of corporate social
responsibility by allowing or even encouraging participation in the
reserves?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070363000124" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0001.htm#13070363000124"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T16:14:39"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Astor of Hever" PimsId="3811" UID="13070363000247" xid="1721" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0001.htm#13070363000247">Lord
Astor of Hever:</Member></B> My Lords, in answer to the first part of
the noble Lord’s question, medical reservists develop additional
valuable specialist skills when they are deployed, which they then
bring back to the National Health Service. The Defence Medical Services
is uniquely placed to share the development of operationally specific
medical science and clinical excellence with the NHS. The National
Institute for Health Research centre has brought together military and
civilian trauma surgeons and scientists to share innovation in medical
research, to advance clinical practice on the battlefield and to
benefit all trauma patients in the National Health Service at an early

the benefits to an employer who recruits an employee who is a
reservist, I would say that reserve service will benefit different
employers in different ways. For some, the improved skills, experience
and training of the individual reservist will be beneficial. For
others, where the reservist’s military role is close to their
civilian one, there will be more benefit from transferable skills. For
some companies and sectors, reserve service suits and supports their
business models. 
<?notus-xml column=1223?>For many, reserve service may support corporate
social responsibility objectives and may be part of their social action
plans, alongside wider volunteering policies. We encourage employers to

for the full range of tasks that our Armed Forces may be asked to
undertake. Current mobilisation arrangements are something of a
historical anachronism. Invariably they require ministerial authority.

would be grateful if the Minister would confirm two key principles.
First, we should maintain the footprint of the Reserve
Forces—and the Armed Forces—around the country. I am very
pleased that there are no dramatic plans to reduce their number.
Secondly, will the Minister confirm that the support of employers, and
in particular of small employers, is crucial to maintaining support for

consider the footprint absolutely vital. Where we have had to close
places it is because there has been a very small uptake in recruitment.
We have managed to close fewer than we planned. I agree with my noble
friend’s point about employers, and in particular small
companies. In finishing, I pay tribute to my noble friend for the

Davies of Stamford:</Member></B> The noble Lord was characteristically
thorough and conscientious in informing the House and in answering my
noble friend’s questions. However, I think that he left out one
point. Will the £5,000 joining-up bonus be repayable if the
officer does not do a minimum amount of service? I would be interested
in the answer to that. I think that it will be quite a challenge to get
to 35,000 but an ever greater challenge to get to a point where the
reservists are on the same footing as the regulars and do not suffer a
higher rate of casualties on active deployment. In that context, it is
very important that we should put everything behind them in terms of
equipment and training, and the noble Lord gave us some assurances on
that point. Equally valuable is the promise by the Government to
strengthen the defence of reservists against dismissal. However, would
it not be a good idea for the Government to go further and to protect
reservists not just against the danger of unfair dismissal but against
discrimination in terms of remuneration or promotion? The American
national guard has that kind of protection. Surely it is 
<?notus-xml column=1224?>very important that reservists, or those who are
planning to join the reserves, are confident that they will not suffer
discrimination of that kind in the job

Lord’s first question about the £5,000, I do not change
my answer. The reservists who join up are free to leave whenever they
want. We are very confident that those regulars who become reservists
will stay and will not leave the minute they get their money. We are
also very confident that by 2018 we will get up to the figures that we
need. I have spent a lot of time being briefed and our recruiting
figures are going better than we expected. Noble Lords will see in the
White Paper all the inducements that we are giving to the reservists
and their families, and the encouragement that we are giving to
employers. We realise that we have to work much more closely

Reserve units are closing as a result of FR20. As part of a wider
betterment programme, three units will relocate to new accommodation,
often in more populated areas. In some instances, the final decision on
where the new locations will be is yet to be made, but the distance

friend’s question about regular redundees joining the reserves,
the reserves have always benefited from the experience brought by
ex-regulars, and some capabilities have relied heavily on their skills
owing to the time that it takes to train on advanced equipment. Those
who leave the Army through redundancy are being encouraged to consider
a part-time military career in the reserves. For the Army, ex-regulars
who enlist in the Army Reserve within three years of leaving regular
service can enjoy a number of incentives and benefits, such as the
reduced Army Reserve commitment and training requirement or,
alternatively, a commitment bonus worth £5,000 paid over four

a slightly slippery word and does not quite imply the same as

right. Army Reserve units will be paired with regular units in
peacetime for training and force generation, enabling combined training
and helping to build links with the local community, including
employers, to aid recruitment and resettlement of service leavers.
Reserve units in all three services may be integrated 
<?notus-xml column=1226?>with regular units for mission rehearsals and for operations. We will
ensure that our use of reserves is as predictable as possible to help
reservists, their families and particularly employers to plan ahead.

It is certainly extremely comprehensive. From what one can see from a

which those of us who commented on the Green Paper felt were necessary.
However, I should like to ask my noble friend about the national
relationship management scheme. I suggest that, in any adaptation of
the current relationships that exist, the process should be
evolutionary rather than revolutionary. Having been involved in it for
several years as chairman of the National Employer Advisory Board, the
mechanisms that have existed for the past 12 to 15 years have proved to
be extraordinarily effective. For example, the branding of SaBRE is
such that it is understood throughout the country. I hope that my noble

that the business community has culled and fined its companies in the

reward is essential for those companies which are taking part. I will
say a little more bluntly that perhaps some tax benefit or some
exemption from certain company taxes should be given to companies which
fulfil the deal. Giving away one chap today in a company, particularly
in a small to medium-sized company, is a considerable sacrifice, and I

Amendments 74A, 76ZA and 76ZB and my opposition to Clause 80 stand part
go to the core of the purpose of CQC and its approach to performance
assessment in health and social care. Inevitably, recent events at that
regulator in relation to Morecambe Bay and before that at Mid
Staffordshire will readily come to mind. There can be no doubt that the
current leadership of CQC faces a major challenge in changing the
culture of the organisation and its approach to inspections. It has
much to do to restore both public confidence and confidence within the
NHS about the way in which it operates. That is why this clause is so
important<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T16:38:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070368000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0001.htm#13070368000022">Clause
80 substitutes Section 46 of the 2008 Act and provides that the
CQC’s duty to conduct periodic reviews, assess performance and
publish reports of such assessments, which are henceforth to be known
as “ratings”, is to apply in respect of any regulated
activities and any registered service providers as may be prescribed in
regulations. In addition, where regulations so provide, the CQC must
also review and assess the performance of the provision and
commissioning of adult social services by English local authorities.
CQC is to be given responsibility for determining the quality
indicators against which services and providers will be assessed. This
may include measures of financial performance and governance in its
assessment if the CQC deems this appropriate. Different quality
indicators, methods and frequency in periods may be used for different
types of cases. The CQC may also review the indicators of quality and

me say at once that I support the broad intention of these clauses to
make the CQC responsible for rating providers and local authorities. I
say again that one should not underestimate the task. It is important 
<?notus-xml column=1229?>that the CQC is not put under undue pressure to rush to change the way
that it operates and to introduce new ratings without proper pilots
being done and without having enough time to do
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070368000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0001.htm#13070368000024">I refer
the noble Earl to the Nuffield Trust’s work. As he knows, the
Nuffield Trust was commissioned to carry out a review for the Secretary
of State into the possibility of rating providers of health and social
care. It argued that the new ratings must be given adequate time to
work together with a range of stakeholders in developing a system which
enables both patient choice and professional leadership to drive up
standards of quality. That is vital. Yet I am concerned by the document
issued by the CQC recently that indicates that it is to start
inspecting and regulating NHS acute hospitals, in the ways that it set
out in that document, from October 2013. Indeed, from December 2013, it
will begin to rate NHS acute trusts and NHS foundation acute trusts,
aiming to complete them before the end of
2015.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070368000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0001.htm#13070368000025">Have
Ministers put pressure on the CQC around the timing of those ratings?
Secondly, does the noble Earl not think that there is a risk that the
CQC will be forced to rush into a new system without proper
consideration? I remind him that the chairman of the CQC has recently
made a number of statements. First, he has said that the approach to
inspections by the previous leadership was wrong; it was wrong to go
for generalist inspections. He also says that the culture of the
organisation was wrong. Given that there are about 1,000 people
employed by the CQC, although I am not absolutely certain, how on earth
is the culture going to change in a short period of three or four
months? I just do not think it is going to
happen.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070368000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0001.htm#13070368000026">I have
great admiration for the current leadership of CQC, but the risk is
that it is going to be forced into a new system too quickly and it
could fall over. As a result, its credibility will be very much
damaged. Let us face it; it is almost starting from a negative
position. I must confess that I am surprised that such an ambitious
timetable has been
set.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070368000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0001.htm#13070368000027">Who will
be assessed? As I have already intimated, the clause provides for the
Secretary of State to draw up regulations laying out exactly which
services the CQC will rate. They are likely to be hospitals. GP
practices, care homes, domiciliary care services across both the public
and privates sectors and local authorities. Will the noble Earl confirm
that? Will he say why this is not specified in the Bill? Does he not
consider it important enough for Parliament to decide which bodies
should be assessed, and to do so in primary legislation rather than
through
regulations?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070368000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0001.htm#13070368000028">I
asked at Second Reading whether clinical commissioning groups are to be
assessed. If not, why not? The Bill allows for local authorities to be
assessed for their performance in the commissioning of adult social
services, so I cannot really see why NHS commissioners—the
CCGs—should not be similarly covered. The same logic then
applies to NHS England which, after all, has been given a massive
commissioning budget in relation to specialist services. If it is
appropriate for local authorities to be assessed for their
commissioning responsibility, surely all health commissioners should 
<?notus-xml column=1230?>be similarly assessed. That must apply to NHS
England because otherwise I do not see who will hold it to account for
the mammoth amount of resources it will spend on commissioning
specialist
services.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070368000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0001.htm#13070368000029">I am
particularly interested in local authority assessment, particularly in
the way that services are commissioned. Can the noble Earl tell me
whether this is intended to be a priority for the CQC? He will know
that there is real concern about the practices of many private sector
providers in social care in using zero-hour contracts and allocating
only 15 minutes with each client. It is vital for the CQC to be able to
investigate the way in which local authorities commission those
services. We will come to this in Clause 5 but it would be very useful
if the noble Earl could confirm that the commissioning responsibilities
of local authorities will be a priority for the
CQC.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13070368000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0001.htm#13070368000087">4.45

care. In the vast majority of cases, inspections will be longer and

then come on to the rating of services, which I have raised with the
noble Earl. As far as I can see, the intention is to follow the Ofsted
approach of rating from 1 to 4, with 1 being outstanding, 4

but needing to improve. That is an approach. But the noble

is very important because the CQC is going to follow the Ofsted
example. Outstanding hospitals will be inspected only every three to
five years and good hospitals every two to three years. So a hospital
could be rated as outstanding and then not inspected for five years.
The problem with that is that we all know that services can go up and
down and that changes in leadership can have an impact on the quality
of an organisation. We know there are examples in education where
schools or colleges have been rated 1, have not been inspected for five
or six years, and some of them have gone down to 3 or 4.</hs_parafo>

about the public’s confidence in such a system. Where a hospital
has been rated 1, within 1 there will probably be some inadequate

<?notus-xml column=1231?>if something goes drastically wrong, the whole
rating system will come into serious question. What I am asking for is
a much more sophisticated, balanced approach to rating these

I come to my Amendment 76ZA. My understanding is that part of the
criteria which will form the ratings judgment by CQC will be whether
staff would recommend their organisation to patients. I am sure that
that would be a very valuable component of the ratings. I have been
contacted by the Chartered Society of Physiotherapists which says that,
perhaps, we should go even further and actually consider staff health
and well-being. That seems to make a great deal of sense. Sickness
absence in the NHS is a major problem. The sickness absence rate for
the winter among healthcare assistants has been very problematic. I do
not expect the noble Earl to agree to my amendment, but I hope he will
give some comfort that CQC, in looking at the way staff feel about
their organisation, might be able to develop some kind of indicator of
the way staff are dealt with. Health and well-being might be a very
good way to do this.</hs_para>

support he expressed earlier. On Amendment 76ZZA, we know that one of
the major problems identified in the Francis report was the inadequate
handling of complaints and concerns. This issue has not been addressed
in the Care Bill. My amendment would enable the Care Quality Commission

76ZAA is about continence care. I declare an interest as chair of the
all-party parliamentary group on this subject. It is hardly spoken
about, but it is terribly important; people just do not recognise how
many people have some problem with continence. The NHS services should
have continence care as an essential indicator of service quality. It
therefore needs to be established as an essential indicator of
high-quality services across the NHS and care settings within the
periodic assessments of care standards undertaken by the
CQC<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T16:53:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070368000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0001.htm#13070368000038">A
number of recent assessments have demonstrated that continence care is
still a low priority across NHS settings, with poor treatment resulting
in escalated and more costly care needs and poorer patient outcomes.
This is in spite of the fact that good bladder and bowel control are
fundamental to people’s dignity and independence and that NICE
has published a wealth of best practice recommendations to effectively
assess and treat the condition. The Francis report included 
<?notus-xml column=1232?>an entire chapter outlining the scale of failures in
continence care. Given the expected rise in prevalence of incontinence
and the impact that poor care can have on patients and the NHS,
continence care must be seen as a key indicator of high-quality
provision across care settings. An explicit requirement within the Care
Bill for the CQC to assess providers for the quality of their
continence care would directly respond to the failings in this field
which the Francis report identified—the stated purpose behind
Part 2 of the Bill. That would encourage providers actively to address
how they manage incontinence by assessing their local protocols and
policies about the condition, taking steps to improve awareness among
staff about incontinence and undertaking internal audits in order

very rough patch, and to some extent, responsibility lies as much here
as elsewhere. I remember the debates a number of years ago, when we
changed the structure of the regulation that should be provided in this
area three or four times within four or five years and always handed
the ball on to a new organisation that we thought would solve all the
problems. We failed consistently to answer the question: what are the

given to it? We now see that there have been
difficulties<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T16:56:45"></hs_TimeCode>.

different beast, and these comparisons do not help. For example, the
chief inspector is independent of the control of the department, which
seems not to be the case in the plans for the future. That means that
the relationships with the Minister and Secretary of State will have to
be very carefully managed. I am not sure that sufficient thought has
been given to that. That is part of the case for asking whether Clause

has just said because I am firmly of the belief that it will take time
to find all the appropriate people for the move which the CQC has
clearly said it would make, from generic to specialist inspectors. I am
sure that this will make a huge difference to the 
<?notus-xml column=1237?>outcomes of inspections. I, too, think that we
should give this organisation time. From what I have seen, it has the

no straightforward way for members of the public to get a clear view of
performance in hospitals and care homes, nor is there a measure to help
drive up performance, so we believe that a new system is needed to give
patients and the public a fair, balanced and easy to understand
assessment of the quality of care provided. Clear ratings on
performance will help to incentivise providers to improve their
services, as they will be able to see how well they are doing. One of
the central principles behind this clause is that it will enable the
CQC to develop the new performance assessment system—informed by
the views of stakeholders, of course, but nevertheless independent of
government. In its report into ratings, the Nuffield Trust

that we did not debate this group of amendments on the previous
Committee day because the CQC has, in the mean time, published a
consultation on changes to the way in which it regulates, inspects and
monitors care. I draw that to the attention in particular of the noble
Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, whose points I will address in a moment.
This consultation, <I>A New Start</I>, sets out the commission’s
initial thinking on the timetable for implementing ratings. The
consultation document also sets out some detailed thoughts on how the
CQC will rate NHS acute hospitals. I take the point made by the noble
Lord, Lord Sutherland: this rating process will have to have some
fundamental differences from that followed by Ofsted. However, the
ratings will be based primarily on inspection judgments. They will be
informed by a series of indicators, using data already available and
the findings of other bodies such as those from accreditation schemes,
clinical peer review and the judgments of other regulators. The CQC
will be consulting on this model more fully later this year.</hs_para>

concerns about the ability of a rating system to reflect the complexity
of NHS acute hospitals. I assure the Committee that both the CQC and
the Government are fully alive to this risk. The CQC is committed to
producing ratings at a level which recognises the complexity of NHS
services and is useful to people who use them, as well as those who
commission NHS care. It is therefore proposing to provide ratings for
certain individual services, such as emergency and maternity services,
as well as for each hospital.</hs_para>

provided against each of the CQC’s key questions. They are: is
the service safe? Is it effective? Is it caring? Is it responsive to
people’s needs, and is it well led? This will mean that where
the 
<?notus-xml column=1238?>evidence is available, a trust would have five ratings at three
different levels—for the individual service level, for the
hospital site and for the whole trust. I am sure that noble Lords will
agree that this is an ambitious aim, and one that seeks to reflect the
complexity of the organisations that provide
care.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070375000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0001.htm#13070375000008">The

am sure we can all agree that they are useful ideas. However, I hope
that they will equally accept the importance of the central principle

74A would require the CQC to undertake performance assessments of
commissioners of healthcare services, specifically clinical
commissioning groups and NHS England. The wording of Clause 80 could
enable the CQC to undertake reviews of local authority commissioning of
adult social care services. The absence of a similar requirement for
healthcare commissioning therefore requires an explanation. The
requirement for 
<?notus-xml column=1239?>the CQC to review healthcare commissioning was removed by the Health and
Social Care Act 2012 on 1 April 2013 when primary care
trusts were abolished. This is because the function of supporting the
development of the commissioning system for healthcare in England has
become the responsibility of NHS England. NHS
England’s role is to determine how the
performance of healthcare commissioners, including clinical
commissioning groups, is assessed and managed. There is therefore no
need for the CQC to carry out a virtually identical role. I trust that
noble Lords will be content to withdraw their amendment, but I would

that architecture was built into the 2012 Act very deliberately. I do
not accept the noble Lord’s point about clinical commissioning
groups, because it is for NHS England to assure itself that the
commissioning system for healthcare in England is working properly.

that the CQC is already very much a changed organisation. It has a new
leadership team in which I have full confidence. It has a new

organisations such as local Healthwatch, and indeed local authorities
themselves, are able to alert the necessary authorities through
Healthwatch England, which, as noble Lords know, is an integral part of
the CQC, to any problems that may be flagged up. The CQC will be
consulting in future on its proposals for care home inspections, and I
do not doubt that a difference of view will emerge about the frequency
of those inspections. I am the first to say how important it is that
the inspections take place, and I totally take the point that those
assessments should not be allowed to drift in any way. However, for
better or worse we have an independent body known as the CQC, which
should be allowed to act
accordingly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T17:30:54"></hs_TimeCode>. The

agree with the point raised by several noble Lords that the CQC under
new leadership should be given the time that it needs, both to improve
the performance of its current functions, such as registration, and to
embed the new functions, such as ratings. The noble Lord, Lord Hunt,
asked whether Ministers had put pressure on the CQC. No, absolutely
not. We are clear—I am looking at the noble Lord,
Lord Sutherland —that the chief inspector should be
an independent post in itself. The chief inspectors are appointed by
the CQC, not by the Government or the Department of Health, and we

Campbell-Savours, asked why the CQC does not have a complaints remit.
Again, going back to earlier debates under the previous Government, all
organisations in healthcare were aware that the Healthcare
Commission—as it then was—provided independent review of
individual complaints cases. This seemed to act as a perverse incentive
not to investigate thoroughly at a local level. In other words, it is
arguable that providing an independent stage through a separate
organisation had actually worked against effective local resolution of
complaints, because NHS organisations were aware that the Healthcare
Commission would ultimately undertake the work. 
<?notus-xml column=1241?>So there was less willingness to take ownership of the
problem at the source of that problem. A lot of duplication also
emerged from that, with the Healthcare Commission tending to carry out
investigations even where the work had been done at local level. That
was not a good use of public money. I remember that the Parliamentary
and Health Service Ombudsman and the Local Government Ombudsman fully
supported the decision to remove handling individual complaints from
the regulatory
body.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070375000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0001.htm#13070375000023">As for
the evolution of these ratings, the Government do not expect the CQC to
have fully developed ratings for hospitals by the end of this year.
That would be unrealistic. The initial ratings will not be a final
product. They will instead represent the first stage in an ongoing
development process. The Government expect that CQC will improve its
methodology over time, and one of the most robust ways to do that is to
continually test the methodology in the field. The new Chief Inspector
of Hospitals will spearhead the new approach to assessing hospitals,
using his clinical expertise to develop an effective approach for
rating. I direct noble Lords to the CQC’s consultation document
<I>A New Start</I>, which sets out all these plans in some
detail.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13070375000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0001.htm#13070375000024">CQC

ambulance trusts, during 2015-16. Why do we not specify in the Bill who
will be assessed? The answer in the first instance is that this Bill
consolidates the existing regulation power in Section 49 of the Health
and Social Care Act 2008, to allow the CQC to have the flexibility to
focus on providers of most interest to the public. That is important in
defining the scope of the new performance-assessment system
through regulations. We are giving the CQC increased flexibility to
focus its assessment on those providers and services that are of most
interest and concern. We must avoid overloading it with the task of
assessing the entire system. We wanted to focus, first, on services

authority commissioning, but the policy position agreed with the
Department of Health is that, for the time being, local authority
commissioning performance and assessment will be led by councils as
part of wider moves to devolve responsibility for improvement in the
sector, underpinned by strengthened transparency and accountability to
local people. The policy position is still under consideration.
Therefore, the clause gives the Secretary of State the power to define
in regulations the scope of the performance-assessment system. Until it

well informed debate. It has focused on anxieties about the role and
competence of the CQC. The anxieties seem to focus on questions about
whether the job of the CQC is doable at all, doable in the very short
timescale, or doable with current resources. Suggestions about how to
address the anxieties and concerns have included piloting new
structures, but there has been much support for the CQC being given
time to improve its strategy and performance—although with
strong reservations from my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours. I am
grateful for the support for my amendments on integration, and sorry
that the Minister was unable to accept them. Given the concern and

Following<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T17:43:28"></hs_TimeCode>
productive dialogue between central government and the LGA, the plans
set out in the spending review make it clear that significant extra
funds will be available from the NHS to assist with the costs of local
care services. As well as needing reassurance that all extra costs for
local authorities resulting from 
<?notus-xml column=1244?>the Bill really will be covered, there remains the greater underlying
concern that the financial foundation on which the new position is to
be built is not secure. Over the past three years, adult social care
budgets have reduced by 20%. In a number of areas, to cope with the
funding cuts it has already been necessary for councils to raise the
bar before regarding older people as eligible for help from the
council. Accordingly, despite growing numbers of older people, fewer
people are now being helped because their needs are assessed as
moderate, not substantial, even though earlier support can prevent the
need for higher costs
later<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T17:44:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Directors of Adult Social Services notes that the bulk of this
reduction has been made up by efficiency gains. Many adult services
directors believe that they can go a bit further; for example, through
better procurement, shifting activity to cheaper settings,

government funding from central government has taken a huge hit with a

additional 2% cut made in the Autumn Statement for 2014-15 and now the
further 10% reduction in funding for 2015-16 announced in the spending
review. Many of your Lordships will be aware of the frightening
prediction that, unless the funding arrangements can be sorted out,
local authorities face the so-called Barnet graph of doom. This shows
how social care costs could absorb almost all local authority resources
by 2019-20, leading to massive reductions in a whole range of existing
local authority services. Already increasing costs, alongside a growing
ageing population, are stretching adult social services to the limit.

The £3.8 billion pooled budget for health and social
care services, with a continuation of the existing transfer from the
NHS to social care that emerged from the 2010 spending review, is
enormously important. Some of that transfer includes additional funds
for the measures in this Bill. The new costs to be covered include
resources to accelerate the transformation of services, provision of
support for carers, capital funding for projects to improve
integration locally and help for councils to organise themselves to
implement this legislation. Costs are also coming down the line to
support the scheme of local authority assistance for equity release by

the increasing number of self-funders coming forward as a result of the
reforms; monitoring each individual’s care accounts and progress
towards spending up to the cap; assessing carers’ needs for
support and making extra carers grants; setting up new safeguarding
boards for adult services like those for children safeguarding boards;

its new analysis released this week, London Councils has found
potential total additional cost pressure of £1.3 billion for
London local authorities by 2019 as a result of introducing the new
measures. Approximately £877 million of this will be as a direct
result of implementing the capped cost model for care and raising the
eligibility threshold over the first four years. If these figures are
right, the Government’s estimates of providing £1 billion
per year to fund the cost of the reforms for the whole country will
clearly be inadequate. London Councils’ analysis has found that
the reforms nationally over the four years will be in the region of

think we all appreciate the hazards of going boldly forward without

Have the Government fully assessed the likely costs of the
nation’s adult social care for the years
ahead<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T17:50:34"></hs_TimeCode>? If so, do
they accept that there is an alarming growing gap between resources and
demands? Do the Government consider that their new funding plans are
adequate both to cover the extra costs of implementing the Care
Bill’s measures and to fill the funding gap already looming so
dangerously, and, indeed, that funding allocations will reflect
different costs and population pressures in different parts of the
country? In relation to the existing funding gap and to any
inadequacies discovered in the financing of the extra spending in this
Bill, what contingency plans are in place if actual costs prove more
than expected to prevent the already hazardous position becoming quite
untenable? Until these questions are answered satisfactorily, it seems
wise to hold back on implementation of Part 1 of the Bill. Accordingly,

Very few Members of this 
<?notus-xml column=1246?>House were here a week or so ago when the noble
Lord, Lord Bates, sponsored a debate on the increasing complexity of
legislation and, indeed, the increasing volume of legislation. It is a
shame that more noble Lords were not there. In that debate, the noble
Lord referred to a recent report from the Office of the Parliamentary
Counsel, which pointed out that when the Queen came to the Throne in
1952, after 740 years of legislation we had 26 volumes of
<I>Halsbury’s Statutes</I><I>; </I>we now have 74 volumes. In
1952, the average Bill was 22 pages long; it is now 122 pages long. In
1952, there were 29 statutory instruments; last year there were 3,328.
This is an astonishing increase even on 2008, when there were just
1,325. On that last statistic, I can bear witness as a member of the
Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee. Indeed, my postman
particularly asked me if I could do something about the volume of
secondary
legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T17:53:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

where we need to think seriously about the volume of legislation and
its complexity, and whether we can carry on imposing new burdens and

all this additional legislation was actually removing some of the red
tape and bureaucracy that previous legislation had provided, but we
know that it is not doing so and that it does not do so. We need to do
one of two things. Either we genuinely reduce the volume of legislation
and the additional responsibilities that it places on all sorts of
bodies, or, as the noble Lord, Lord Best, suggests, we have realistic
costing of what these new responsibilities entail and ensure that
resources are available. If we do not, we remain in a cycle of despair
and decline where we expect others to deliver new responsibilities,
which they are just not able to do. We also raise the expectations of

another mere vice-president of the Local Government Association to
bring a slightly different dimension to this debate. The noble Lord,
Lord Best, pointed out that local authorities are finding a variety of
different ways of delivering services. I have been looking at some of
those and listening to messages about them. One issue is
that they are delivering cheaper services, which often means
commissioning them from providers which will then deliver them at a
different level of quality. I declare an interest as a
provider in the charity Livability, which delivers services to the
disabled, the elderly and some children from residential

The noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, raised the issue of the numbers
of inspections. When I was involved in inspections, one issue was that
you could deliver as many inspections as you had funding for. Now you
can use that funding in a variety of different ways to get better
options but, at the end of the day, resources count and, unless we know

declare an interest as the president of Mencap. There is no doubt that
the services that we are able to provide are being severely cut back
because local authorities simply do not have the money to support those
services. Where we used to get, say, £15 an hour, we
get £12 an hour. The implication is that we can lower the
standard of our services, but we are not prepared to do that.
Therefore, we will end up reducing our services and, as a result,
people with learning disabilities, their families and their carers will
suffer. This is exactly the situation at the moment. Local authorities
will try to provide the services, but they are making it much more

when direct payments were successfully introduced and allowed disabled
people to live independently in this country, we were proud to be
employers. We were able to employ RPAs at a good rate, with holiday
pay, and we were able to advertise. We were equal to those who employed
individuals in their own companies. Ten years on, many cannot even give
holiday pay and cannot advertise. They fall back on costly social care

years ago, as the newly-appointed chairman of the social services
committee in Newcastle, I had to come to terms with the impact of Sir
Keith Joseph’s reorganisation of the health service which came
into force that year. Among much else, that involved the transfer of
responsibility for public health from local government, where it had
largely resided for over a century, to the NHS, taking with it
paramedical services such as chiropody and bath attendants. The area
health authority, as it turned out, was so limited in its resources
that, for a period, we as a council felt it necessary to fund the
continued provision of those services by the health authority. At the
same time, we hugely increased social care provision, doubled the home
help service and trebled the number of meals on wheels. I am sad to say
that now those services are roughly back to where they were in 1973 as
a result of the pressure on the authority’s budget. Now, in a
step on which the Government are to be congratulated in principle,
public health largely returns to its local government home and the
concept of a holistic approach to social care, involving both local
government and the NHS, is enshrined in the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070387000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0002.htm#13070387000012">It is
unfortunate that the previous Secretary of State, in his shadow

had initiated to 
<?notus-xml column=1250?>address the issue of care and its cost, and that it has taken three
years to produce the proposals that we are debating. However, it is
even more unfortunate that during that time not only has demand risen
inexorably, but local authority funding has been severely and
deliberately reduced by a greater extent than any other area of
government expenditure. It is sad, but not untypical, that the
Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government should not only
have acquiesced in, but actively promoted, this perverse order of

we have heard, the Local Government Association avers that adult social
care budgets have been reduced by £2.6 billion, or 20%, over the
past three years, with additional dire impacts on other services, such
as leisure and housing, which should contribute to health and
well-being and which are threatened with virtual extinction as local
authority services by the end of the decade. The noble Lord, Lord Best,
reminded us of the London Councils report and its estimate that the
cost of the reforms—which, I repeat, we welcome in
principle—will amount nationally to an average of £1.5
billion a year over the next four years. Apparently, the greater
amounts will be spent in the first and last years of those four. London
itself will be facing a bill of at least £877 million as a

course, this, in part, reflects the increasing demand from different
client groups. We largely talk of the elderly, but there are other
significant groups. The noble Lord, Lord Rix, has reminded us about
people with learning disabilities, and there are also people with
physical disabilities. These two groups are growing as medical advances
have enabled them to live longer. The quality of their life, of course,
is the subject of much concern and that imposes additional strains on
the budget. It is another example of incremental demand that needs to
be met. In addition to that, there are people suffering from mental
health problems. The increasing demand so far has manifested itself as
between something like 10% and 14% in these different categories. It is
clear that inflation and demographic trends alone will push up the
cost, as the noble Lord, Lord Best, has indicated, by some £421

just the bed space, it is much cheaper for an individual to be in a
care home bed than in a hospital bed. If we cannot resolve it between
ourselves, and we cannot do it on our own as providers, local
authorities cannot do it on their own, and neither can the care sector
generally, then I wonder if we are ever going to get there. People

Beecham:</Member></B> My noble friend is right to draw attention, as
many of your Lordships already have, to the need to integrate the
provision and to avoid the sort of cost-shunting that can arise if
organisations are kept separate. That is the point of the pooled
budget: you look not just at the straightforward provision of care by
one or other partner, or both partners, but at what will perhaps reduce
the need for care in other ways. As I say, other local services such as
leisure and adequate housing, in conjunction with the public
health agenda, may very well reduce the demand for particularly
expensive forms of care, as I am sure we all
agree.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070387000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0002.htm#13070387000026">Of
course, local government’s track record is not uniform, but it
is right to say that local government has proved over the years to be
the most efficient part of the public sector. There has been a huge
improvement programme in local government, recognised by the shortly to
be lamented Audit Commission, and others, over the years. The LGA in
particular has sought, through a whole series of policies, including
the very extensive and successful use of peer review, to engender new
approaches and more cost-effective ways of dealing with a range of
problems, including those in the social care arena.</hs_para>

Government are putting into the new arrangements. Just as local
government needs, together with its partners, to engender the utmost
efficiency in the mechanisms that it develops to provide services and
make them cost-effective, as my noble friend suggests, so on the
revenue-raising side central government has a massive obligation to
ensure that it collects the taxes—instead of cutting the
resources going into HMRC, which is responsible for
collecting VAT, by a further 5% in the spending

only way to secure the long-term sustainability of services, both for

those could be found from the underspend in the NHS or the uncollected
VAT or some other source. However, he did not want the amendment to
delay the good things that the measures bring with them. The noble
Earl, Lord Howe, agreed that we need fully to fund the
measures—did I say Bentham?</hs_para>

78 takes us to the very important well-being principle. In its
consultation paper which led to the consolidation of the social care
legislation that we see in this Bill, the Law Commission proposed that
there should be tightly defined processes for determining the scope of
adult social care. That follows on from the debate that we have just
had. Replies to that consultation persuaded the Law Commission to
define the purpose of adult social care as promoting or contributing to
the well-being of the individual. That recommendation was
accepted by the Government and is central to their new approach to
adult social
care<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T18:46:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070390000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0002.htm#13070390000003">Clause
1 provides for a set of legal principles which govern how local
authorities are to carry out their care and support functions for
adults under the Bill. Subsection (1) establishes the
overarching principle that local authorities must promote the
well-being of the adult when carrying out functions under the Bill in
relation to that adult. This duty applies both in relation to adults
who use services and to carers. The well-being principle applies to
local authorities when they exercise a function in the case of an
adult. My understanding is that it is not intended to be directly
enforceable as an individual right, but to carry legal weight where a
local authority’s failure to follow the principle may be

think there is an element of Ministers almost washing their hands of
what actually goes on at ground level in health and social care. We
have already seen that in the Health and Social Care Act 2012, and we
are seeing some elements of that here. Of course, the Bill places a
responsibility on local authorities to promote well-being in the way
they implement the provisions of the Bill locally. However, if the
Secretary of State were to issue regulations without having regard to
the promotion of well-being, there is a risk that those regulations or
guidance will conflict with the well-being principle. That would place
local authorities in an impossible
situation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T18:50:26"></hs_TimeCode>. For
instance, if the eligibility criteria issued in regulations by the
Secretary of State do not take full account of all aspects of
well-being in Clause 1, local authorities may find that people who need
support to promote well-being as defined in Clause 1 fall outside the
eligibility criteria. I will come on to debating the eligibility
criteria, but there are some aspects of the eligibility criteria which
would suggest that they do not meet the well-being principles in Clause
1. I hope the noble Earl will think very carefully about this. There is
a broad consensus in your Lordships’ House and within the Select
Committee dealing with the draft Bill that the Secretary of State, when
issuing regulations and giving guidance to local authorities, ought to
be operating under the same principle of well-being as those local
authorities are. It seems to go straight back to the debate instituted
by the noble Lord, Lord Best, in relation to the Government legislating
but not giving the wherewithal to local authorities to actually carry
out that legislation
effectively<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T18:51:43"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T18:51:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070390000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0002.htm#13070390000008">I
turn to Amendments 78D and 88L, which are concerned with ensuring that
health needs are taken fully into account in decisions taken by the
local authority. I fully acknowledge that I have been inspired to do
this by the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell. The starting point here is
that it is essential to look at this through the prism of
person-centred integration. As a starting point, we need to look at
ways to put the individual’s and carer’s need for
integrated working in the Bill and outline a statutory framework for
person-centred integration that will support and incentivise local
moves towards more integrated working. There are clearly points of
contact here with the scheme which the Minister’s honourable
friend Mr Norman Lamb announced recently for local pilots on health and
social care

course, that is welcome as far as it goes, but there is a risk that it
depends on an ill-defined concept of better integration and may well
fall short of a holistic approach to well-being, assessment, care and
support planning, carer support and review. We will come to the draft
regulations later. This has a significant bearing on assessments for
health and social care integration. The intention is to scrap the
present assessment system, based on judgments about degrees of risk to
areas of individual capability and exclusion from participation in
various aspects of ordinary living. The new model proposes to examine
people’s ability to carry out various personal care tasks and
undertake a selections of household tasks. The rationale offered is
that the new system will be more objective and fairer in its
application, but there are some concerns here. First, this is
explicitly a deficit-model of assessment, requiring individuals, their
carers, relatives and social workers to almost play up or exaggerate
the things that they are unable to do in order to qualify for support.
In many ways, that replicates the very bad approaches that we have seen
in some welfare assessments. It is certainly bad for morale and
distorts the overall framework for making decisions. In one sense, one
can argue that it reverses efforts over the past 20 years to maximise
independence, choice and control and build on the strengths,
contributions and aspirations that people can have. I must say to the
noble Earl that is has some very uncomfortable reminiscence of the new
approach to disability benefits, whereby people are required to prove
limitations under the inexpert and unsympathetic eye of ATOL
assessors<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T18:57:03"></hs_TimeCode>. I
hope that is not the approach that is going to be taken in relation to
the eligibility criteria. There will be very great concern if that is
to be the
case.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070390000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0002.htm#13070390000012">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T18:57:26"></hs_TimeCode>

ensure that when we debate and take forward the well-being concept,

Secretary of State is subject to those principles as well, but the
health service plays its part in ensuring a wholly integrated approach.

had stripped people of their dignity. The fact that someone in a caring

basic humanity—whatever the pressures, and we know that those

place where people look for definitions of good care.
They will look for a clear statement
of what users and professionals should expect and should be expected to
provide. That is why I think that it is so important that we
ensure that the Bill captures and articulates boldly what we
expect. As it stands, Clause 1 says much that is important,
as it is intended to exemplify what is meant by providing
well-being. In Clause 1(2), there is even a cross-reference to personal
dignity. I suspect that the Minister may well suggest that
that deals with the thrust of my amendment, but for me, it
is lost in a series of other references. It just does not
stand out boldly enough and its impact is

is a phrase well used now in the world of health and certainly within

it just does not quite capture the essence of good care. It is also not
a phrase in common usage. It does not encapsulate the fundamentals of
good care in the way that “dignity and respect” do. My
amendment would state boldly at the outset of the Bill that dignity and
respect is what we are all about. They encapsulate the cornerstones of
good care. They are the foundations on which everything else should be
built. Even in an age of austerity and cost-reduction, they cannot ever
be compromised, because they are, in many ways, our most basic human

Barker:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall speak to Amendments 78A and 78B,
which stand in my name and that of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings
Heath. These and other amendments which will crop up throughout our
discussions have been inspired by the Christian Science movement. I
wish to say that I am not a Christian Scientist, but Christian
Scientists hold to some very firm beliefs which are of great importance
to them. Part of their belief system is that they do not wish to
receive medical treatment in circumstances where other people would
make a different decision. Therefore, in health Bills such as this,
where we are setting out the principles that underlie what we define to
be good care, it is not uncommon for me and the noble Lord, Lord Hunt,
to put on record again that there is a spiritual dimension to health
and well-being and that the way in which that spiritual belief is
manifested can be different for minority
groups<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T19:06:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070390000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0002.htm#13070390000022">One
great strength of the Bill is that it takes a principled
approach to what we define as well-being rather than attempting to
define well-being in a descriptive sense. One reason why I think that
that is increasingly important is that we have an increasingly diverse
population. Therefore, the meaning of well-being for individuals is
becoming distinct and diverse throughout society. The amendments place
a duty on local authorities and relevant health bodies to respect the
increasing diversity of our
population<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T19:07:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

reasons why I am very pleased to support the amendments. Like everyone
else in the 
<?notus-xml column=1264?>House, I am greatly in favour of the integration
of health and social care. I see the undoubted benefits of
that, but as someone who has worked in the field
of social care, as opposed to health, all my life, I still
carry with me the fear of the medicalisation of disability or of
old age. When push comes to shove, when budgets
are tight, some of the certainties which surround physical health, in
particular, can overtake social goods which are less easy to define.
Therefore, it is important that we ensure that we do not
allow that to happen. One way to prevent that is by taking the approach
of the
amendments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T19:08:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070390000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0002.htm#13070390000024">The
final reason why I raise the amendments now is that I think that
setting that out as they do right at the top of the Bill is a strong
reminder to everyone who will refer to the Bill in years to come that
the autonomy of individuals is an important part of health and
well-being. You cannot have good health and be a fully functioning
member of society if you do not have that autonomy, an autonomy which
means that, in some cases, you have the right to make decisions which
other people would regard to be unwise. It is a point of principle, but
one which I think has a great deal of practical application not just
for those who are receiving care but for those who are in charge of
making decisions about
it.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-03?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_03_PT_1/C7B9661FF3D226394B0A253814E8258CFFD70E1E" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 3 July 2013">Wednesday,

Warner, is not in his seat. He tabled Amendment 79 to express the
strength of feeling of Members of this House who were sitting on the
scrutiny committee about the Secretary of State’s the duty to
have regard to well-being. Were there room for more than four names to

put this in context—and the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, has taken us
through quite a lot of this—this Bill was widely consulted. It
was probably the coalition’s most widely consulted Bill;
somebody might be able to tell me to the contrary. At each stage,
people welcomed the well-being principle. Perhaps I may remind the
House that in the majority report on the Bill, one of the
recommendations was that the Secretary of State should have due regard.
When the final Bill was produced, many in the sector approached me, and
I suspect many others, to express their disappointment that that was
not included in it. When the Secretary of State came to give evidence
with the Minister for Care and Support, the right honourable Norman
Lamb, he was very positive about it. According to the transcript of the
session, Norman Lamb
said:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13070399000122" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0002.htm#13070399000122">“We

well-being principle is around the change of culture and it puts the
person at the centre. It is absolutely critical that that happens, and

regard to the same principle as local authorities, there is an
opportunity for future Secretaries of State when making regulation to
disregard well-being and just make regulation in the old way. One thing

can bring cannot be overstated. Academic research over many years has
documented this. One study by Brooks, Rogers and others, published just
last year, highlighted the emotional and practical impact that
companion animals offer. Noting that they provide unconditional support
and love, as we all know, the study concluded
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13070399000129" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0002.htm#13070399000129">“the
policy implications of this study suggest that pets might usefully
feature alongside consideration of the usual support systems associated
with the management of long-term conditions and in planning how needs
might be ... creatively met”.</hs_quotefo>

precisely what this Bill is designed for and what these amendments are
crafted to deliver.</hs_parafo>

help those who are vulnerable, through age or health, in three ways.
First, there is a powerful body of evidence about the contribution of
cats to physical health. According to one study published recently in
the <I>Journal of Vascular </I><I>&amp;</I><I> Interventional
Neurology</I>—not a magazine I look at frequently, but it is
there—they contribute to a reduction of fatal cardiovascular
disease by around 30%.</hs_para>

of a cat brings positive benefits to an individual’s mental
health. Research conducted in 2011 for Cats Protection and the Mental 
<?notus-xml column=1268?>Health Foundation among people with a mental health problem found that
76% of people who owned a cat felt they could cope with everyday life
much better as a result, and that 87% said it had a positive impact on
their well-being. Cats can be especially helpful for depression during
the winter period—a particularly important point since, as we
now know, this goes on for about nine months of the year. As the
Cinnamon Trust, which works tirelessly to support the elderly and their
pets, summarises it:</hs_para>

ability to bring happiness and laughter and lift depression.

for
reassurance”.</hs_quote><hs_para UID="13070399000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0002.htm#13070399000027">Thirdly,
cats make particularly suitable companion animals for those with
chronic health problems, including those who are immobile or disabled.
I know that this is a charge always made against cat lovers, so I am
not forgetting our canine friends. I highlight, for instance, the
excellent work of the innovative Dementia Dog Project, which helps to
keep people in the early stages of dementia active and engaged with
their local community, as well as providing a constant companion to
reassure those suffering from dementia in new or unusual situations.
This project in particular shows that a dog may aid a sufferer to stay
on longer in his or her home—an important ambition that many
noble Lords have highlighted in this debate—and may even slow
the onset of this terrible disease.</hs_para>

how cats promote well-being and play a vital role in an
individual’s care appear regularly in the excellent magazine,
<I>The Cat</I>, which is a publication I do look at regularly and is
published by Cats Protection. In recent months, there have been stories
about how their cats helped am owner to cope with epileptic seizures,
helped a seven year-old boy to deal with the debilitating problem of
selective mutism, and comforted a 17 year-old girl confined to bed with
the life-long incurable condition of Behçet’s syndrome.
One particularly moving story related to how a visit from a cat to an
elderly lady who was in a hospital ward and suffering from severe
dementia got her to speak for the first time in three months.</hs_para>

examples. Indeed, I think of the experience of my own mother. In the
last year of her life, she was widowed, immobile and more or less
housebound. Her faithful cat, Toby, was her constant companion. She
talked to him, laughed with him and moaned and shouted at him; he cared
for her in return. Indeed, he lay on her bed as she died. That
companionship is a priceless gift, which this legislation should
protect. Let me explain briefly how these amendments might help, as I
ask my noble friend the Minister to consider these three
issues.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13070399000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0002.htm#13070399000030">First, one of the many
problems that those who are elderly with a pet can face is how to care
for it when they go into a care home. There are some amazing care and
retirement homes which welcome pets but others do not have a policy on
them, which can cause anxiety and distress to those who need to enter
one. For a person to have to give up what might be their sole companion
is a tragedy for an owner and for the pet. It also adds to the growing
burden on many animal charities, which are having to take increasing
numbers of abandoned pets as economic problems have bitten hard in so
many families.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=1269?><hs_para UID="13070399000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0002.htm#13070399000031">Secondly,
it would encourage those at the front line of care—GPs, in other
words—to become aware of the role of a pet in an
individual’s life. Many GP surgeries include in their
information about the over-75s whether a companion animal forms part of
the client’s household. The signal sent from amending the Bill
would encourage many more GPs and clinical commissioning groups to
ensure that this important information is routinely collected for all
age groups, including the
elderly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070399000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0002.htm#13070399000032">Finally,
the Bill needs to be drafted widely enough in its definitions of
well-being and needs assessments to allow for money, whether budgets or
direct payments, to be used where necessary to support an individual
who perhaps wishes to retain a pet but is having problems
due to health. Professional pet-sitting or feeding may be needed when
an individual is hospitalised and where there are no friends or family
to help. Knowing that a pet is being cared for can help encourage
otherwise reluctant individuals to go into hospital for treatment and
relieve anxiety. Equally, in cases where a care assessment shows that a
companion animal would bring individual health benefits, money may be
needed to help an individual obtain a companion animal. There are many
examples of such budget programmes in other countries—most
notably, I think, in Australia—where health and local authority
budgets are pooled to provide companion animal support programmes. This
principle should be embedded in regulation and statutory guidance for
all relevant implementing bodies.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13070399000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0002.htm#13070399000033">Most importantly of
all, these amendments would ensure that the role of companion animals
is given proper recognition and protection through an
individual’s care journey. Some may be too vulnerable or frail
to request that their beloved pet is taken into account when their care
is planned. Others may need help or assistance in retaining their
companion. Others still may not be aware of how a cat or a dog could
improve their quality of life, ease their loneliness or help tackle a
chronic disease. The amendments I have tabled would ensure that this
happens as a matter of routine and is not left to chance in the way
that, tragically, too often happens
now.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-03?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_03_PT_1/E568F1787697A559655D81D62612B89FCDC0E390" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 3 July 2013">Wednesday,

Tyler of Enfield:</Member></B> My Lords, I add my support to Amendment
78ZA, to which my name is also attached. The noble Lord, Lord Bichard,
has already spoken very eloquently of the reasons behind the amendment.
Dignity and respect are absolutely fundamental pillars of well-being,
which is why I would like to see these words spelt out in the Bill.
Well-being is unattainable without dignity and respect as central
components. In saying this, I am conscious 
<?notus-xml column=1270?>that the public’s opinion on this matter is
one of pessimism and distrust of the current social care system. In a
recent survey, only 26% of the public felt confident that older people
receiving social care are being treated with dignity. If the public do
not trust their loved ones in the hands of the social care sector, what
hope is there that well-being is being promoted?</hs_para>

have recently seen and heard of shocking failures in the care of older
people in both the health and social care sectors. These very harrowing
examples serve to illustrate the importance of enshrining dignity and
respect as a critical part of well-being in order to try to change the
culture among care workers in the health and care sectors, to ensure
the transformation of services that this Bill is intended to bring
about and to have the sort of compassionate care that we all like to
see. Dignity will also be very important when it comes to secondary
legislation and specifically to the eligibility criteria. It is vital
that these criteria have regard to the well-being principle. I am happy
to be corrected about this if I am mistaken, but the draft feels very
health-and-safety-oriented and does not mention dignity at
all.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070394000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0002.htm#13070394000004">I
would have liked to add my name to Amendment 79 about
including well-being as part of the Secretary of State’s duty,
the reasons for which have already been set out very clearly. The very
wide-ranging definition of well-being, set out in <I>The Care Bill
</I><I>E</I><I>xplained</I>, makes it absolutely clear that for the
well-being principle to be made a reality it would need to be the joint
responsibility of a wide range of partner agencies, nationally and

transport and housing are likely to have a very distinct
impact on well-being at an individual level.</hs_para>

Six years of serving on the Equality and Human Rights Commission taught
me that if we embedded dignity and respect into the training of staff
we would avoid many of the tragedies we have read about. This applies,
right across the board, to staff in health, social care and housing. It

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, the well-being principle in Clause 1 was
devised on the basis of the Law Commission’s report on adult
social care which this part implements. The report recommended that the
new statute should set out a single, overarching principle that adult
care and support must promote or contribute to the well-being of the
individual. Not least in the light of our debate at Second Reading, I
can therefore understand the noble Lords’ intention in tabling
Amendments 78 and 79. It is to ensure that any 
<?notus-xml column=1271?>functions that the Secretary of State exercises under this part take
into consideration how such provisions will impact upon people’s
well-being. I can give the Committee what I hope will be a welcome
reassurance on that issue and, in the process, a rather better and
fuller answer than I gave at Second Reading.</hs_para>

already the case that the Secretary of State must have regard to the
general duty of local authorities to promote an individual’s
well-being when making guidance or issuing regulations. This is
because, when making regulations or issuing guidance, the Secretary of
State must consider how local authorities can fulfil their statutory
obligations. He cannot ignore those obligations and I believe this
addresses the central concern of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, and others
who have spoken to the amendment. The question is whether the Bill
should go further. The Government do not believe that it is appropriate
to apply the well-being principle directly to the Secretary of State.
The well-being principle is intended to apply at a very real,
individual level. It has been designed to frame the relationship that
exists between the local authority and the individual adult, in effect
setting out how it is expected the local authority will behave when
making a decision, or doing anything else, in relation to a person
needing care and support or to a carer. The Secretary of State does not
act at this individual level, and I am still reluctant to make any
amendment which might be seen to detract from this important
legal
reform.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070394000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0002.htm#13070394000009">Having
said that, I have listened with care to the strength of feeling in this
debate, not least to the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady
Pitkeathley, about the Secretary of State’s duty to have regard
to the NHS constitution and whether there was something comparable that
we could devise in this context. That is an interesting comparison and,
while I am not yet convinced that it is fully comparable, I am happy to
take the points that have been made away with me and give this matter

78A seeks to bring in to the well-being principle the idea of spiritual
well-being and I listened with care to my noble friend Lady Barker who
spoke to this amendment. The Government believe that the clause, as it

sets out that well-being means an individual’s well-being in
relation to emotional well-being. The Government believe that emotional
well-being incorporates the concept of spiritual

dignity into the well-being principle, following pre-legislative

turn to Amendments 78E, 87K and 88J, tabled by my noble friend Lord
Black of Brentwood. These amendments focus on the very important topic
of pets. The Government have considered this issue carefully since the
amendment was tabled, and we believe that the Care Bill already allows
for the consideration of pets. First, Clause 1, the well-being clause,
provides that local authorities, when exercising any function under
Part 1 of the Bill, have a duty to promote the well-being of an
individual. Well-being is composed of many aspects, including emotional
well-being. A pet might be so important to an individual that their
emotional well-being would depend in some way on their pet. If that is
the case, a local authority will have to take it into
consideration<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T19:41:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Clause 1(3)(b) sets out that in exercising any function under Part 1 of
the Care Bill a local authority must have regard to an
individual’s “views, wishes, and feelings”. This
could include how an individual feels about a pet, and their wishes for
the pet. Clause 9, which covers the assessment of needs for
care and support, also allows scope for pets to be taken into
consideration in the assessment process. As Clause 9(4)(a)
sets out, a needs assessment must take into consideration a
person’s well-being. This could certainly include an
individual’s pet, from which they derive a lot of emotional
well-being<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T19:42:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070394000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0002.htm#13070394000016">I
turn to Amendments 78D and 88L. The Government believe that it is more
important than ever that care and support services operate in tandem
with health services. The Government have committed to breaking down
barriers between health, care and support, as well as encouraging
co-operation, integration and joined-up working between local partners.
The Government believe that the Care Bill already allows for such
co-operation to occur, and I shall explain how. First, Clause 1(2)(a)
makes it clear that the well-being principle incorporates physical and
mental health. Local authorities must therefore already consider a
person’s health when exercising any functions under Part 1.
Secondly, Clause 3 details how local authorities must exercise their
functions under Part 1 with a view to ensuring the integration of care
and support with health provision, where they consider that this would
promote the well-being of an individual.</hs_para>

on assessments for care and support are also relevant. As Clause
12(1)(f) sets out, regulations may set out when a local authority must

Amendments 78 and 79, the Minister has essentially said that he still
sticks to the general principle that the well-being clause applies to
local authorities and individuals. The point here, though, and the
reason why I am glad he is taking it away, is a point raised by a
number of noble Lords: this legislation, which is a wholesale recasting
in the light of the Law Commission’s 
<?notus-xml column=1274?>work, is likely to endure for many years to come. That is why it is so
important that the link between the Secretary of State’s duties,

that in fact the legislation is okay; the problem is that these public

Lords who have put down their names to speak in this short debate. As
somebody who has lived in London all my life, I should explain that my
starting point is that London is the greatest city in the world. I
would find it difficult for anyone to argue against that. I spent 26
years as an elected politician in London: as a councillor, council
leader, chair of the Association of London Government, and member of
the London Assembly. I believe that the London Finance Commission
should be congratulated on the report that it has
produced.</hs_para>

the London Finance Commission was established by the Mayor of London
and London Councils, which in my time was called the Association of
London Government. It was an independent group, chaired by Professor
Tony Travers, who is probably the country’s pre-eminent expert
on local government finance, and it contained cross-party
representation and senior representatives from elsewhere in the United
Kingdom, including Stephen Hughes, the chief executive of Birmingham
City Council. It published its final report in May, and its
recommendations have been accepted by the Mayor of London and by Mayor
Jules Pipe, on behalf of London Councils, with both Conservatives and
Labour accepting. It has been supported by all four parties on the
London Assembly.</hs_para>

context for this report is that London is the engine that drives growth
in the rest of the UK economy. I will give just one example. Forty-one
thousand jobs were supported outside London last year simply by
Transport for London’s supply chain—24,000 of them in the
North and Midlands. That is more than the number directly employed by
Transport for London—London Underground, buses and so
on—in London itself. In addition, 62% of Transport for
London’s procurement spend went to suppliers outside London,
with the bulk outside the south-east. That is one example of
the extent to which London drives the rest of the UK economy. London
also makes a net contribution of over £5 billion in tax to the
rest of the country each year.</hs_para>

is difficult to envisage a scenario in which London’s economic

most markets, London is competing as much, if not more so,
internationally than against other UK cities. Many foreign direct
investment projects that London wins in competition with other
international cities provide benefits for other regions, and many
tourists who visit London go on to other parts of the UK. Other
international cities vie for investment, visitors, students and talent,

London’s international status and its continued ability to help
drive the rest of the UK economy cannot be taken for granted. Historic
population growth in London has already placed considerable pressure on
the full range of public services and local infrastructure and this is
set to increase from a growing population 
<?notus-xml column=1276?>with increasingly complex demography. London's population is growing at
a faster rate than any other region in the country. By 2020, its
population will exceed 9 million. London’s school-age population
grew by 107,000, at a rate of 8.2%, in the past decade—the
fastest regional
rate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070397000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0002.htm#13070397000008">London
has an inherently mobile and changing population. In 2011, it had
approximately 70,000 short-term residents, over a third of all
short-term residents in England and Wales. It is estimated that 240,000
households live in overcrowded conditions, with 90% of London’s
housing stock built before 1991, and new housing supply meeting housing
need in only six of the past 20 years. This means that London has the
most overcrowded households in the UK, living in the oldest homes,
where the market is not delivering sufficient new homes to match
current and future demand.</hs_para>

if London’s infrastructure crumbles and the quality of life
deteriorates, its ability to attract and retain international business
will decline, and that cannot be good for the rest of the United
Kingdom. It is economic growth that the commission sees as the
potential prize of a further shift of financial and fiscal control to
London. As the city population grows to 9 million, then
perhaps 10 million by 2030, there will need to be massive investment in
enabling infrastructure simply to accommodate these new residents and,
indeed, commuters. Beyond this investment to keep pace with the
population, the commission is convinced that London would be better
able to prioritise decisions about that investment. After all,
Londoners know they need new railways, schools, homes, waste facilities
and streets. Because of their day-to-day dependence on physical
infrastructure, London voters are much more likely than voters
elsewhere in Britain to prioritise spending on longer-term
investments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070397000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0002.htm#13070397000010">If
London had enhanced fiscal capacity to back such investment, there
could be an enhanced level of capital spending which would, in turn,
produce additional growth and tax yield. London government could then
re-invest higher tax revenues in more infrastructure and a virtuous

acknowledges:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13070397000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0002.htm#13070397000011">“London

terms of fiscal autonomy, London is an outlier compared to the other
cities that the commission studied. By comparison, it relies
heavily on transfers from central government, with 74% per cent of its
income received through grant, compared to 37% in Madrid, 31% in New
York, 25% per cent in Berlin, 17% in Paris and only 7% in Tokyo.

It has the support of all four parties on the London Assembly, all
three parties in London Councils, the Corporation of London and
significant, leading sections of the London business community,

Patten:</Member></B> The first-order question to ask is
whether there is a problem in London, and, if so, whether this report
answers it. I do not think that London itself is a problem. In the
1940s, the French scholar over the Channel, Jean-François
Gravier, wrote a great book, <I>Paris and the French Desert</I>, in
which he reflected on the absolute dominance of the capital in French
national life, sucking energy from the rest of the country. It is an
odd reflection, which he would certainly not have predicted, that
London is the city with the fifth or sixth largest French population,
because of the large
number<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T17:35:38"></hs_TimeCode> of
extremely welcome financial and professional people who have come here
en masse to escape the Hollande
terror.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070399000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0002.htm#13070399000035">London
has dominated English life for a very long time—certainly since
Cobbett’s day. Now it is the most dominant city in Europe, and
one of only two or three true global megalopolises. I agree entirely
with the noble Lord, Lord Harris of Haringey, who in his tip-top speech
said that London was probably the greatest city in the world, among the
two or three other megalopolises—the term was coined by another
great French geographer, Jean
Gottmann.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070399000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0002.htm#13070399000036">This

happened of its own volition and vigour, always—at least until
recently—more less 
<?notus-xml column=1278?>free from, and often despite, the actions and policies of national and
local government of all colours. Truly, Mr Livingstone and his
successor, Mr Johnson, inherited a going concern. This has not happened
overnight. I do not think that this is clearly recognised in the
report, which in many ways seems to think that London will run into
problems caused by its own success, and that those perceived problems
will be sorted out only by more government and more power going to
London government. So much for lack of
concentration.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070399000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0002.htm#13070399000037">All
this is not surprising, because the commission, with its solemn,
grand-sounding title, is a creature of the present London government,
and so generally starts from the point, “Please give us more
government and more powers as quickly as possible”. Yet already
the United Kingdom is one of the most overgoverned countries on earth.

is a constitutional change industry that promotes constitutional change

constitutional change, more power and more government is a cure-all for
London is a delusive and tinsel
thing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070399000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0002.htm#13070399000039">In my
experience, most Londoners are much more concerned with the present
system of governance and whether it is delivering the goods. I will
give one very rapid example: namely, the growing number of rough
sleepers in London. The number is indisputably rising, not going down,
at the moment. This is a tragedy. I walk along Victoria Street to our
flat down the road by the cathedral every night. Since late May, just
opposite New Scotland Yard, where Strutton Ground meets Victoria
Street, there has been a growing number of rough sleepers, tragically,
right under the window of the commissioner for the metropolis. I walked
past them tonight at about 6.30 pm and counted seven. They were all
clearly British. Two, possibly three, were extremely jolly Scotsmen.
That is not a xenophobic remark. They deserve help and not criticism
for being there. It is extraordinary, in the middle of what the noble
Lord, Lord Harris of Haringey, called one of the greatest cities, if
not the greatest city, in the world, that for the past six or seven
weeks we have had a growing city of people sleeping rough on the

commission recommends, in essence, that London government takes
ownership of a suite of property taxes raised in London—council
tax, business rates and stamp duty land tax—and uses them to
create a stable funding stream to support a long-term infrastructure
investment programme. This does indeed have the potential to create a
virtuous spiral for both the city and the Treasury. New infrastructure
will support private sector investment, which creates jobs, adds to
private consumption and leads to greater tax revenues for City Hall and
Whitehall. This, in turn, supports further, future investment.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T20:15:24"></hs_TimeCode> is, in my

is also important to emphasise that this is not a bid for more cash for
London. The commission’s modest proposal is that the property
taxes I referred to earlier simply substitute, pound for pound,
existing government grant. However, this simple change has two merits.
The first is that it gives much greater certainty to London government
that it will have the revenue, over time, to fund investment. This
means that it can plan into the long term and, potentially, borrow
against that funding. This is substantially more efficient than annual,
or even five-yearly, spending settlements.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T20:16:17"></hs_TimeCode> second is
that London government then has a share in growth. If its investments
generate prosperity, it has an automatic share in that prosperity. It
does not have to go back to the Treasury to haggle.</hs_para>

changes would be good, too, for central government in at least three
ways. First, it could focus on driving the big policies such
as—dare I say?—high-speed rail, which only national
government can do, rather than fiddling around with local matters that
can best be done elsewhere. Secondly, local government would have a
real incentive to support growth. This goes with the grain of the
Government’s localism agenda—and puts it on steroids.
While London would keep the growth in London’s property taxes,
the Exchequer would get the growth on the really big-ticket items such
as income tax, national insurance and VAT. Thirdly, local politicians
would no longer be able to blame all their ills on the Treasury. If
they want more cash, they can make the case for taxing their voters
more, or not.</hs_para>

ever, some details require further analysis—for example, the
mechanism to align business rates with council tax and the need to
review the levels and banding of the latter. We cannot rationally or
credibly 
<?notus-xml column=1282?>base our property taxes on 1990 house prices. There also needs to be a
more effective and formal mechanism through which London government
consults and listens to business over its budget plans. This is

those<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T20:17:59"></hs_TimeCode> important
points do not detract from the fundamental strengths of the

needs greater freedom from central government if it is to generate the
growth, jobs and prosperity that we all wish to see. The Government
have recognised this in their localism agenda; the noble Lord, Lord
Heseltine, confirmed it in his growth analysis; and the London Finance
Commission brings yet greater depth to the arguments. It is time to

London means a greater incentive to promote growth and, as the

put that in very polite terms but the lack of affordable housing in
London presents a massive, ongoing crisis. London workers need

those on modest incomes which do not allow for the cost of the commute.
If we do not have that investment in bricks and mortar, only the very

I am on housing, I cannot help but comment on what the noble Lord, Lord

reducing rough sleeping. Although she is one of the most innovative
civil servants you will ever come across, even she would admit that a
lot of her success was down to the fact that investment was quadrupled.
A laissez-faire approach is the last thing that will reduce the number

Even after the financial crisis, the City of London is still the number
one financial centre in the world and we are proud of it. But are the
Government really clear about the relationship between the City of
London and London? Is that a fair relationship? The report does not
address that and I would be very interested in the Minister’s

regards devolution, the future of London and its success is a prize for
the whole country. However, in the latest results on productivity, when
London was compared with other countries in Europe for example, its
productivity was average at £58,000 per worker. Cities such as
Paris, Frankfurt and Brussels were higher. Stockholm was
number one on the list. Yet London’s productivity is 44% above
the UK average. That is a serious issue. We really need to get the
productivity of this country up in a big way and London’s

other point is that cities are the engines of growth for an economy.

they are looking upon London as a gateway to Europe. Again, that would
help London in its competitiveness. We must remember that outside
London there are other great cities in Britain. Recently, I was in
Liverpool where I spoke at the Accelerate Conference. Next year, the
International Festival for Business will take place in Liverpool,

understand, therefore, if I forgo the opportunity of making new policy
announcements this evening—however tempting—but say that
we view this report as a serious piece of work that requires proper
consideration and analysis. We recognise that it has strong cross-party

central proposition of the report is that London can grow faster and
create more jobs if it has greater autonomy in managing its own
affairs, particularly when it comes to planning infrastructure. That
autonomy would come from relaxing some of the borrowing rules
applicable to local authorities and from devolving certain tax revenue
streams. The report’s recommendations are underpinned by
research that demonstrated that, compared to other major cities, London
has very little fiscal autonomy, although the report recognises that
academic research is inconclusive on whether increased fiscal autonomy
has a measurable effect on
growth<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T20:32:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070399000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0002.htm#13070399000084">We
recognise, as does the report, that London is an economic powerhouse,
one of the strongest growing regions in the UK and one of the

city, as my noble friend said. That success must be sustained not just
in the interests of Londoners but in the interests of us all. It is,
after all, our capital city. We should look to it for help to drive our

also recognise the case that has been made for investment, which is
needed as a direct consequence of population growth to provide housing,
schools and primary healthcare. It is also needed to sustain economic

question is whether the scale and complexity of London's economy and
communities mean that they can be addressed only by London government
rather than by—as it has been put—23 Whitehall
departments. We support a localist approach but, of course, London
government is not a homogeneous entity. The 32 boroughs, the GLA and
the mayor collectively comprise a vast range of different communities,
economic and social circumstances and political make-up. The report
recognises that the different interests that the formula funding system
exposed in local government could re-emerge at London level should
there be greater financial devolution. There is a clear risk that this
may be
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T20:33:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070399000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0002.htm#13070399000087">There
is an acceptance that, should there be greater financial devolution to
London, existing governance arrangements would have to change. The
proposition is advanced that it would require new governance systems

possible situations but sufficiently simple to be efficient. That is a
goal worth having, but one more easily stated than achieved, we
suggest.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070399000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0002.htm#13070399000088">The

underlying all of this is what it means for the rest of England.
Promoting and facilitating growth in London

on fairness, it is proposed that the devolution of tax streams to

remembering that as a result of the Localism Act London has gained
responsibility for housing. The noble Baroness, Lady King, raised the

supplement that has been raised so far, but it has been
done—infrastructure levy and tax increment financing. I know the

trying to strengthen the provisions to ensure that we have an
integrated approach to care planning. This would happen if we could
ensure that local authorities consider how to prevent or delay
healthcare needs, as well as care and support needs, when providing or
arranging the provision of services, facilities or resources for care.
We have talked about this previously but I think that the Bill should
require local authorities to have regard to the potential to prevent,
delay or reduce health needs as well as care needs when providing or
arranging care and support services. This duty would have wider
benefits because it would strengthen the requirements on local
authorities to prioritise integrated care services in line with
Clause 3 of the Bill. It should also improve cost
efficiencies for local authority budgets at a time when social care
budgets are being squeezed, as we have heard, by reducing the need for
more intensive and costly forms of
care.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130703103000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0002.htm#130703103000003">Similarly,
Amendment 79K tries to enshrine the duty of prevention. We
know, and have heard from other noble Lords, that many people reach a
crisis point 
<?notus-xml column=1291?>when the person for whom they are caring is
critically ill, or has a fall, or the partner dies, or something else
happens. There is a panic and the wrong sort of care or very expensive
acute care is provided. If appropriate identification, awareness and
assessment of needs could be made before people reach this point, it
would be absolutely brilliant at avoiding some of these acute costs of
care<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T20:55:38"></hs_TimeCode>. Enshrining
prevention in the Bill is very important. Accordingly, it is imperative
to ensure that the prevention duty focuses on what a local authority
must do to prevent deterioration in well-being, to underpin the
imperative to prevent, delay and reduce the need for care and
support<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T20:56:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130703103000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0002.htm#130703103000004">In
order to make sure that happens, Amendment 80B ensures that local
authorities have regard to NICE clinical guidelines and equality
standards. This came to me through chairing a committee which produced
a report on autism as it now affects a lot of older people. This is a
fairly new phenomenon, because fortunately people live
longer—not just healthy people, not just sick people, not just
frail people, but people who have conditions such as autism. We know
that NICE’s remit will be extended—in fact it has been
extended since April of this year—to include social care
services. It has the potential for a new focus on evidence-based
decision-making. For example, the NICE guidelines on adults with autism
states that investing in employment support is cost
effective<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T20:57:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130703103000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0002.htm#130703103000005">This,
and similar findings should be taken into account by local
authorities when they are providing services, including preventive
services. All of these together would help to provide a range of
preventive care. In order to make that happen, I hope we can encourage
local authorities to look at more than one-year budgeting, because
preventive services need longer than that. Local authorities need to be
encouraged to take a longer view. If you are running a business and
invest in something, you do not expect a return immediately. If you
invest in preventive services, you will not necessarily get a return in
one year, you have to give things a longer time span to reap the
benefits. That also applies in these
cases<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T20:58:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130703103000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0002.htm#130703103000006">Amendment

look to reduce these needs as an integral part of their duties in

Lady Greengross, who did an excellent job in chairing the commission on
ageing and autism. We look forward to the publication of the report
very shortly. It was certainly an eye-opener for a great many of us,
and the many who thought they knew a lot about support and social care

care must no longer be the service of last resort. Under the current
system, too many people become eligible for support only when their

crisis management. Here, I declare an interest as a vice-president of
the National Autistic Society, 
<?notus-xml column=1292?>whose recent research shows that only 10% of people
with autism said that they receive social skills training, yet 55%
would like to receive it; that only 10% people with autism said that
they receive employment support, but 53% would like it; and that just
17% of people with autism said that they have access to social groups,

adults with autism would benefit greatly from low-level services such
as befriending or social skills training. These would help them to
avoid isolation and allow them to participate fully in society. A lack
of access to these services can have a devastating impact. A third of
adults responding to a previous National Autistic Society survey said
that they developed serious mental health problems as a result of a
lack of support. Crucially, evidence from the National Audit Office
shows that providing low-level services is cost effective and prevents
people developing more complex problems—a point just made by the
noble Baroness, Lady Greengross. Its report
stated:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="130703103000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0002.htm#130703103000096">“Beside
the negative impact of such crises on a person’s life, acute
services are also expensive, with inpatient mental health care costing

economic modelling by Deloitte, published earlier this month, shows
that every £1 invested in support for people with
autism—and any other difficulty—who have moderate needs
can generate a return of £1.30. The benefit is spread across
central government, local government and disabled people and their
families. Services such as the National Autistic Society’s
Horizons day centre, which is based in Surrey, support adults with
autism to develop social and communication skills, to access
the job market, to improve health outcomes and to prevent the
development of further
needs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T21:01:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="130703103000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0002.htm#130703103000010">Enshrining
prevention in the Bill is important also where older people are
concerned—that will certainly show up when the report of the
commission of the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, is published. Many
middle-aged or older people reach a “crisis point” when
their parents or carers pass away. Appropriate identification,
awareness and assessment of needs before this point is reached are
vital. I welcome the emphasis on the principle of prevention that is
already in the Bill, but for it to have a real impact on the provision
of services, it must be further entrenched. I hope that the Minister
will see the wisdom of the amendments proposed by the noble Baroness,
Lady
Greengross.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130703103000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0002.htm#130703103000011"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Rix" PimsId="386" UID="130703103000113" xid="1411" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0002.htm#130703103000113">Lord

the breadth of that definition, which includes protecting people from
abuse and neglect. In addition, Clause 2 sets out an important duty
whereby a local authority must take steps and provide services which
contribute to preventing needs for care and support. However, this
crucial clause on prevention makes no reference to abuse and neglect,
and my amendment seeks to make this

example. Decisions were taken to send people with a learning disability

is recognised also in terms of disability-related harassment, and
indeed the Equality and Human Rights Commission highlighted this in its
report, <I>Hidden in Plain Sight</I>. It recommended that local
authorities and housing providers work from the outset to reduce
disability-related harassment by including safety and security measures
in the design of social housing estates and facilities. In addition to
good decision making at the top, it is also important to consider how
we can empower individuals to understand what abuse is and how they can
protect themselves from it. This might be through providing
information, advice and advocacy. Safeguarding procedures are vital in
order to protect people suspected of abuse and I have tabled a number
of amendments on this area under Clause 41.
However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T21:05:14"></hs_TimeCode> before

authorities will at a minimum need to meet through the national
eligibility criteria. We know the <I>Ending the Other Care Crisis
</I>report produced by Scope with four other charities estimates that
105,000 working-aged disabled adults will in fact continue to rely on
universal services. This places greater responsibility on local

they can make the best use of community facilities to prevent, delay
and reduce needs for care and support. That is very welcome indeed but
the question is: to what extent are local authorities geared to put
that into practice? Hence I have tabled this amendment. I think we need
give a push to local authorities to take this seriously. I hope the

that, I shall say a few words on Amendments 79A, 79K and
80A. Clause 2 would be stronger if local authorities were also placed
under a general duty to take prevention into account in exercising any
of their functions under Part 1, not just those relating to direct
provision of care. Amendment 79A would ensure that local authorities
act to “prevent, delay or reduce” individual care needs
across every one of their functions. Amendment 79K would ensure that
the prevention duty focuses on what a local authority must do to
prevent a deterioration in well-being, in addition to preventing,
delaying or reducing the need for care and support. Amendment 80A would
oblige authorities to have regard not just to the importance of
identifying adults and carers with needs for care and support and the
services available to meet those needs, but,</hs_para>

Bill currently stops short of that, which is bad news for the hundreds
of thousands of older and disabled people who are not deemed eligible
for adult care and support. It is also bad news for the
Government’s aspiration to rebalance the system away from crisis
interventions in a more preventive direction. The amendments suggest a
more strategic approach which, by putting in place services at the
community level, not just directed at individual care, could ensure
that those who did not reach the eligibility threshold were,
nevertheless, not bereft of support entirely. In other words, they
provide a means of enabling available resources to go further by
deploying them strategically in aid of
prevention<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T21:13:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130703103000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0002.htm#130703103000027">The
kind of preventive services I am thinking of might be of six types.
First, there are enabling services, preventing harm before it
occurs—as you might say, working well away from the cliff edge.
Secondly, there are services that prevent care needs from developing:
for example, reablement or specialist rehabilitation to help an adult
with sensory loss or a falls prevention service for older people
discharged from hospital. Thirdly, there are prompt interventions,
detecting and responding to early signs of difficulty, forestalling
problems which could lead to more serious consequences —as you
might say, working just over the edge of the cliff. Fourthly, there are
services that help to delay care needs once they have started to
emerge, for example, home adaptations for those no longer independently
mobile or befriending services for the recently bereaved, perhaps
funded by the local authority but delivered by a local Age UK. Fifthly,
there are services that reduce care needs once they have started to
intensify, for example, a stroke rehabilitation service provided
alongside the NHS to help adults to regain control over key activities
of daily living.</hs_para>

and finally, there are acute interventions reducing the impact of a
situation spiralling down—working well done the cliff, you might
say. Wales furnishes an example in the Social Services and Well-being
(Wales) Bill, which is currently before the Welsh Assembly. I hope the
Minister might be willing to take a look at that. The corresponding
section of that Bill, Section 6(4), explicitly states that a
local authority must, in the exercise of its other functions, have
regard to this preventive services clause in the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T21:15:29"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T21:15:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="130703103000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0002.htm#130703103000107">9.15

to the amendments in my name only. Amendment 80C is a probing amendment
aimed at drawing out the Government’s thinking about creating an
accountability mechanism for the prevention duty. The suggestion is to
use the legal framework contained in the Local Government Public
Involvement in Health Act 2007. I remember it well. Local authorities
have responsibilities under that Act to produce joint needs assessments
and joint health and well-being strategies under Section 116 of that
Act. This amendment would lay on them, in partnership with clinical
commissioning groups, a duty to have regard to their duty to prevent
care needs as part of discharging those
responsibilities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T21:16:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

have produced ambitious plans to rebalance our care and support system
away from crisis interventions in favour of preventive support. Some of
these have succeeded to a degree, but what all these strategies have
had in common is a desire to prevent individual care needs

sense for the individual adult, their carer or family, but also makes
more efficient use of public
resources<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T21:17:09"></hs_TimeCode>.

CCGs prepare an assessment for a health and well-being strategy under
Section 116 of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health

duty in this Bill. This will strengthen accountability for fulfilling
the duty under Clause 2, and there will be greater clarity about
whether local authorities need to do this as part of their wider role
within the health and well-being board. This is not a reporting
requirement or an additional burden on local authorities. Rather, it
ensures that there are proper mechanisms and fora through which local
authorities can discharge these responsibilities for preventing care
needs: namely, joint strategic needs assessments and joint health and

87F. Clause 9(1) gives local authorities responsibility for assessing
needs for care and support. This amendment would give them additional
responsibility for assessing whether needs can be prevented 
<?notus-xml column=1297?>from getting worse and how they may be reduced. The aim is to ensure
that local authorities assess preventing needs and look to reducing
them as an integral part of their duties on assessment. In the

one box, placing a responsibility on local authorities to consider the
other support that might be available to an adult from friends or
family. However, it is not clear where Clause 9 actively enables a
local authority to assess the ways in which adults’ needs for
care and support could be prevented from getting worse or, indeed, how
assessed needs might be reduced.</hs_parafo>

to refocus care and support on promoting individual well-being and
preventive health, Clause 9(1) is a major gap that needs plugging. It
needs amending to ensure that local authorities actively assess the
needs that could be prevented from getting worse, or which could be
reduced. Clause 9 is the critical section governing an assessment of an
adult’s needs, but it would be a major omission if it did not
provide some means by which a local authority is required to assess
which needs are in fact capable of being reduced. In practice, not
including this requirement would mean authorities inevitably
concentrating on needs that have already emerged and the degree to
which they could be categorised as eligible needs. Of course, a local
authority must fulfil that duty but in doing so it should also consider
which needs, if any, can be prevented from getting worse. Not doing so
surely puts in question the Government’s ambition to refocus the
system on postponing, preventing and minimising the need for care and
support.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="130703103000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0003.htm#130703103000039">In
assessing whether needs can be prevented from getting worse and how
they could be reduced, an authority would in effect be making a
determination on the existing impact of a need, the risk that it will
deteriorate and develop into an eligible need and, crucially, what an
authority and the adult themselves can do to proactively prevent a
deterioration in their well-being. The idea would be to assess whether
an individual’s needs could be prevented from getting worse
through the provision of a structured programme of intermediate care or
reablement, or some other form of preventive support—for
example, a communicator guide, some intensive therapy at home, advice
on suitable housing options or adaptations, mobility training or even
access to a local befriending scheme. This would not only be in the
interests of the individual adults, their carer or family; clearly, it
would be in the authority’s interests too.</hs_para>

Jolly:</Member></B> I will be brief. I support the amendment in the
name of the noble Lord, Lord Rix, on preventing needs for care and
support for those with learning disability. We need to remember that
those for whom the Bill is written are all vulnerable adults: whether
they are vulnerable by virtue of their age; their learning disability;
mental state; physical condition, whether that is disability or
frailty; whether they are living at home or in other accommodation. A
local authority should take all steps it considers will contribute
towards adults experiencing, or being put at risk of, abuse or neglect.
We have just heard about preventive measures: these are preventive
measures linking in with needs. The outcome of the amendment would be a
reduction 
<?notus-xml column=1299?>in incidents of neglect or abuse. It might mean
local authority employees raising concerns about individuals or
organisations providing care; making it a regular agenda item at a team
meeting and not turning a blind eye; whistle-blowing where appropriate
and making it part of the well-being
culture.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130703103000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0003.htm#130703103000047">Before

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, I apologise to my noble friend
for intervening before she had a chance to speak. As the Committee will
have gathered, I was observing that it is always good when there is an
outbreak of consensus across the Chamber, and I think this is a case in
point. It is critical that care and support work actively to promote
people’s well-being and independence, rather than just waiting
for people to reach crisis point. We want a system that promotes
independence and reduces dependency as well as supporting those who
already need care and
support<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T21:30:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130703103000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0003.htm#130703103000049">Preventing
and delaying needs from arising, or reducing them where they exist, is
a central part of local authorities’ modern responsibilities for
care and support. Adopting preventive approaches can reduce needs in
the longer term, saving public money and improving outcomes. There has
never before been a clear legal duty that reflects this priority and
establishes prevention as part of the core local authority
responsibility. Clause 2 fills that gap, requiring local authorities to
provide or arrange services to prevent, delay or reduce needs for care
and support and carer’s support. This will create a legal basis
for a wide range of preventive services that can help people maintain
their independence for longer. The noble Lord, Lord Low, mentioned some
good examples but they might also include exercise classes, which can
help people maintain and increase their mobility, befriending services
and hobby clubs, which can reduce loneliness and social isolation, and
installing grab rails in a frail person’s home, which can
prevent falls, broken bones and unnecessary stays in hospital. However,
those are not the only examples. We want local authorities to be truly
innovative in the services offered in their area, which is why we have
not been prescriptive in the way that local authorities carry out the
duties conferred by the clause. I agree with the noble Lord that these
things can bring direct financial savings, and I quoted some good
examples, I hope, in speaking on an earlier group of
amendments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T21:32:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130703103000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0003.htm#130703103000050">Amendments
79A and 79K make the point that prevention should be an overarching
principle of a local authority’s care and support functions, and
that this should be framed in the context of well-being. This is surely
right. To that end, Clause 1 sets out that in exercising care and
support functions, local authorities must promote an
individual’s well-being. This includes, among other things,
having regard to preventing, delaying and reducing needs, as expressly
stated in Clause
1(3)(c<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T21:32:41"></hs_TimeCode>).</hs_para>

Rix, makes clear in tabling Amendment 79D the need for local
authorities to be proactive in preventing, delaying and reducing needs 
<?notus-xml column=1300?>for care and support, but also in safeguarding adults with needs for
care and support from abuse or neglect. As he mentioned, Clause 41 does
just that by requiring local authorities to ensure that inquiries are
made when an adult with needs for care and support is at risk of abuse
or neglect. Clause 42 and Schedule 2 create the
legal framework for local authorities to establish safeguarding adult
boards, which must devise, publish and implement annual strategic plans
for adult safeguarding in their area. There will of course be the
opportunity to discuss safeguarding in greater detail at a later
date<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T21:33:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Low, raises the issue of prevention as
part of the joint strategic needs assessment and joint health and
well-being strategy under the Local Government and Public Involvement
in Health Act 2007. I listened to him with care and hope that I can
reassure him. The existing legislation in relation to these joint
assessments and strategies is clear that where any needs can be met by
the local authority exercising its functions under the prevention duty
in Clause 2, these would be included as part of the joint assessments
and
strategies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T21:34:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130703103000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0003.htm#130703103000053">In
Amendments 78C, 79C and 79G, the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross,
highlights the importance of preventing, delaying and reducing health
needs as well as needs for care and support. Again, I find myself in
complete agreement with her and, as I said, I believe that the Bill
achieves this laudable aim. This is where the importance of integration
and co-operation can clearly be seen, a matter also raised by the noble
Lord, Lord Hunt, in Amendment 79B. Clause 3 requires local authorities
to promote the integration of care and support with health and
health-related provision, including where this would contribute to
preventing, delaying and reducing
needs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130703103000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0003.htm#130703103000054">Clauses
6 and 7 require local authorities and their relevant partners to
co-operate in the exercise of their care and support and carer’s
support functions. Such co-operation is to be performed for the
purposes of, among other things, promoting an individual’s
well-being, which in turn includes having regard to the importance of
prevention through Clause 1(3). Accordingly, there is a clear duty on
local authorities and their relevant partners to co-operate with one
another in preventing, delaying and reducing needs for care and support
and carer’s support.</hs_para>

with the return of public health responsibilities to local authorities
as a result of the 2012 Act and the new prevention duty, present a
unique opportunity for aligning prevention services across health and
care and support. That is why local authorities will be required to
ensure the co-operation of their director of public health, where
relevant to care and support
functions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130703103000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0003.htm#130703103000056">I
turn briefly to Amendments 87F and 87G, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord
Low, and the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross. The Government believe
that the Care Bill allows for the assessment process fully to take
account of prevention. As the well-being principle requires the local
authority to have regard to the importance of preventing, reducing or
delaying needs for care and support, it must also consider this when
conducting an assessment.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=1301?><hs_para UID="130703103000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0003.htm#130703103000057">Amendment 80A
highlights that, to be able to prevent delay and reduce needs for care
and support and thus promote independence and well-being, we need to
improve the quality and diversity of preventive services, facilities
and resources. To achieve this, Clause 5(7) makes explicit
provision for local authorities to promote the diversity of services,
resources and facilities which can prevent delay or reduce needs for
care and support. As the noble Baroness also points out with Amendment
80B, commissioning decisions, including for preventive services, should
be made on the best evidence available. In the case of preventive
interventions, we know through engagement with the care and support
sector that this is not yet as strong as we would like. The Government
have committed to developing a library of evidence on
prevention. That will enable commissioners to make decisions knowing
what is proven to work and what is not. However, to be able to build
this evidence base and to find the solutions to the care and support
needs of the 21st century, we need to allow room for innovation in
developing and testing new models of preventive interventions. Without
breaking the mould of traditional care packages, pioneering solutions
such as shared lives schemes, which offer an alternative model to home
care or residential care using community networks, would not have been
able to flourish.</hs_para>

Lady Greengross, observed that local authorities need more than a year
to plan in terms of the budget cycle. Local authorities already have
multiyear financial settlements and that gives them scope to plan
services in the longer term The noble Lord, Lord Touhig, returned us to
the important subject of autism. He remarked that adults with autism
rely on low-level preventive services and he felt that the Bill does
not do enough in this area. The reforms to care and support set out in
the Bill will benefit people with disabilities, including people with
autism. The provisions around prevention, personal budgets and
transition between children and adult services are just some examples
of new laws which will benefit many people with
autism.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130703103000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0003.htm#130703103000059">As
local areas gain a better understanding of autism needs locally and
develop autism commissioning plans, we expect them to look more at the
cost benefits of more low-level and preventive services, such as
befriending services or social skills training. Preventive services can
be provided to prevent, delay or reduce needs for care and support,
regardless of the level of need involved. I hope that I have reassured
noble Lords that prevention is suitably reflected within the Bill and
that the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, will feel able to withdraw
the amendment.</hs_para>

Greengross:</Member></B> My Lords, I was very encouraged by the words
of the Minister, but I am still rather worried. It was great to hear
the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Touhig, who is so knowledgeable
about autism. I am also very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, for
his comments, and to the noble Lord, Lord Low, who made some very
apposite points about prevention. If I were a director of adult social
services and had very limited funds, I would have to concentrate on the
people in the greatest need, and it would be likely that prevention
would slip to a lower 
<?notus-xml column=1302?>level of my attention. This is the danger of
preventive services not getting the attention that they need. I have
yet to be totally convinced that prevention will prevail in the way
that the noble Earl suggested. I hope that he is
right.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130703103000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0003.htm#130703103000061">We
need a longer timeframe. It is difficult for local authorities to
budget in that way, but it is essential if we are to focus on
preventive services in the long run. I hope that, as we go through the
remaining parts of the Bill, we can be clearer about how to ensure that
prevention is at the top of our list. That will apply to eligibility
criteria, which we will look at later. In the mean time, I thank all
noble Lords who supported what I said and also my colleagues for their
support. I beg leave to withdraw the

Care Bill is drafted to apply to adult carers of adults. This means
that parents of disabled children are not included in the important new

the Care Bill, a carer is an adult who provides or intends to provide
care for another adult. It is therefore clear that parent carers of
disabled children aged under 18 are excluded from the new entitlements.
Parent carers are left with the existing statutory scheme and previous
carers Acts, which are mostly Private Members’ Bills. While

recent report on the Children and Families Bill, published on 27 June,
the Joint Committee on Human Rights acknowledged the concerns about the
future of parent carers’ rights, but argued that it was a matter
for the Care Bill. As these rights currently sit within
children’s legislation, amendments to the Children and Families
Bill are therefore needed to put the rights of parents of disabled
children on the same level as those of other carers. I know that
discussions are going on, and that Ministers have said that amendments
will be introduced to the Children and Families Bill. However, it is
important that parents caring for disabled children do not fall through
the cracks, and that the Government acknowledge the need to give them
parity with other carers. How will the Government ensure parity of
rights for parents of disabled children, and how will they resolve the
issue of whether this matter sits best within this Bill or the Children

78F includes parent carers in the well-being clause. The intention of
the amendment is to include the parents of disabled children in the

of the adult who is carrying out functions under the Bill in relation
to another adult. If anyone doubts whether this is necessary, they
should remember that 72% of parent carers experience mental ill health,
such as anxiety, depression or breakdown; 57% say that lack
of support from statutory services means that they are
isolated and not able to work as they would like; and one in five says

parent carers for support. My apologies if any confusion has been
caused by the use of the words “child carers”. We often

are brought forward for parents of disabled children, they will still
need to request a carer’s assessment from their local authority
and they will not have a right to an assessment unless they provide
regular and substantial care. Therefore, this amendment seeks to

<?notus-xml column=1304?>There is confusion over who is responsible for
carers who provide care for somebody receiving NHS continuing care
services in the community, and this can lead to carers being refused an
assessment and support services from their local authority. Therefore,
this amendment seeks to clarify that local authorities still have a

this group is Amendment 88F, which is about the health
promotion of carers. Carers often take a long time to identify
themselves as carers. They say that they are not a carer but a wife,
a husband, a brother, a sister or a son. Carers UK found
that 25% of carers took five years or more to recognise
themselves as carers. Research from Carers UK shows that the
high turnover of people taking on caring responsibilities means that as
many as 2.3 million people start caring and a similar proportion
cease caring. This combination of high turnover and the
“hidden carer” effect may go some
way to explain why an estimated £840 million
in carers’ benefits alone go unclaimed every year.
Once identified as carers, practical and financial support
can be made available, and that can help carers to cope. Information
strategies therefore need to be carefully targeted to ensure that
carers do not miss out on their
entitlements<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T21:49:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Royall of Blaisdon:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall speak to Amendment
79L tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Patel, who unfortunately cannot be
in his place this evening. The purpose of the amendment to which I have
added my name is to ensure that carers are identified and signposted to
the enhanced support outlined in the Bill as early as possible and
before they reach crisis point. I put my name to this amendment
following a discussion with Macmillan, to which I am very grateful for
its excellent briefing, about the situation of approximately 905,000
cancer carers in England, half of whom are not receiving any support
despite the fact that cancer has a real impact on their lives. Of
course, the impact is nowhere near as big as that on the person with
cancer but nearly half of carers say that it affects their mental
health and well-being; one in five says that it affects their
relationships and working life; and 15% say that it affects their
household finances. Almost half of cancer carers identify at least one
type of support they are not currently receiving that would assist them
with their caring duties. They are in real need of help but are not
aware of who or where to turn for
support.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130703103000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0003.htm#130703103000076">As
many noble Lords will know from personal experience, the real problem
is that many cancer carers do not think of themselves as carers but
they might 
<?notus-xml column=1305?>well need information, advice or support. Indeed, my noble friend Lady
Pitkeathley has just made the same point in general about all carers.
They have no idea about things such as the local authority
carers’ assessment, which is the gateway to statutory support.
Consequently, the number of cancer carers who have had such an
assessment is far lower than for those caring for people with other
conditions and disabilities. Evidence shows that health
professionals simply do not identify cancer carers as carers
and do not signpost them to help or
support.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130703103000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0003.htm#130703103000077">Therefore,
while<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T21:51:38"></hs_TimeCode> I welcome
the fact that the Care Bill enhances rights for carers, including
placing a new duty on local authorities to undertake a carers’
assessment for all carers and to meet the eligible needs of carers,
there is a gap which this amendment is designed to fill. Cancer carers
have a lot of contact with the NHS but they seldom come into contact
with local authorities. This amendment would help to ensure that all
NHS bodies work with local authorities to improve the identification of
all carers so that in turn they can be assessed and access appropriate
support.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130703103000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0003.htm#130703103000078">In

amendment would provide a vehicle for ensuring that this optimal
practice of joint identification and partnership became a reality
throughout England where, at the moment, the identification is at best
patchy and at worst non-existent. Local authorities should take the

health bodies such as NHS England, CCGs, and primary care and hospital

amendment would not lead to additional expenditure. In fact, if carers
were identified as early as possible, when in most cases they just need

Amendments 79F, 79J and 79M in Clause 2 concern the position of young
carers. They aim essentially to ensure that local authorities provide
or arrange services to prevent young carers from developing needs for
care and support, as well as preventing and reducing needs for adults
and adult
carers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T21:55:27"></hs_TimeCode>. The 2011
census identified 178,000 young carers who have to care for a relative
in England and Wales alone. It is good that the Government have now
acknowledged that, given the changes being introduced by the Care Bill
for adult carers, the law must also be reviewed for young carers.
However, we need a much clearer indication of what these changes will
look like and particularly of how the Care Bill will ensure that adults
receive sufficient care and support so that children are protected from
excessive and inappropriate caring roles. We cannot have a situation
where people have unmet care and support needs, which results in
children and young people having to meet these
needs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130703103000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0003.htm#130703103000085">I
recently met a young man who had been caring for someone in his family
for most of his life. He told me that it would have made a huge
difference to him if his family had received support earlier. If this
had happened, his caring responsibilities might not have had such a
clear and serious impact on his education. He is doing well now and
hopes to go to university, but it has clearly been extremely
challenging for him to stay in education, and there are many thousands
of other young people who have been similarly affected. That is why my
amendments to Clause 2 are so important. They make clear that local
authorities must take steps to prevent children from carrying out
caring duties that have a detrimental effect on their health and
well-being<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T21:57:07"></hs_TimeCode>. Can
the noble Earl assure me that the Care Bill will be amended to ensure
that this is the case? If he can, I would welcome an indication of

other amendments on this issue are to Clause 12, which
provides for regulations on whole-family assessment. Again, the
Government have indicated that they will look at how the law might be
changed for young carers in the Bill, but it is not clear how that
might be done. We know that currently adult social care services and
health services routinely fail to identify children who may be caring
for an adult, even where the adult is assessed. That also applies to
educational establishments. That means that often children can continue
to undertake harmful caring roles and end up developing needs for care
and support themselves.</hs_para>

is very important that adult needs assessments relate to any child in
the household, so that inappropriate caring by children is prevented
and children's needs for support are prevented or reduced. The law must
be 
<?notus-xml column=1307?>clear that adult services need to help to identify
young carers. The presence of a young carer should always constitute an
appearance of need for the family and should automatically trigger an
assessment of the person for whom they care. Can the noble Earl confirm
that this is indeed the Government’s view? Will it be made
clear, through primary care or regulations, that there should be
consideration of whether a joint child and adult assessment would be
appropriate and that children’s services should work together;
consideration of whether any child should be assessed for support in
their own right under children’s law; and consideration of

carers and helping them to access support, it is also critical to align
assessments undertaken by other bodies, including NHS continuing
healthcare assessments undertaken by clinical commissioning groups. If
a carer is identified in the course of an NHS continuing healthcare
assessment, the national framework for NHS continuing healthcare and
NHS-funded nursing care makes clear that the clinical commissioning
group should inform them about their entitlement to have their needs as
a carer assessed and, where appropriate, either advise the carer to
contact the local authority or, with the carer’s permission,
refer them to the local authority for an
assessment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307044000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-0003.htm#1307044000016">The
provisions in the Care Bill provide a lower threshold for a
carer’s assessment than exists now. A situation where the person
whom the carer supports is being assessed for NHS continuing healthcare
is highly likely to be regarded by a local authority as one where it
appears the carer may have a need for support. A carer’s
assessment would then be triggered. Clause 10(5) already
requires a carer’s assessment to include an assessment of
whether the carer is able and willing, and is likely to continue to be
able, to provide care for the person needing care. Moreover,
regulations under Clause 12 may make provisions for joint assessments.
We will consider such particular circumstances further as we develop
these

there is already sufficient provision under Section 17 of the Children

tough decisions that we have taken to be able to make economies
elsewhere, we have been able to invest in education and accelerate
school reform, so the Department for Education’s overall budget
will increase to £53 billion and school spending will be
protected in real terms. We have increased the health budget from
£99 billion when we came into office to £110 billion in
2015-16. Capital spending in health will rise to £4.7 billion.
We are proud to be able to fulfil our commitment to spend 0.7% of our

£2 billion comes from the departmental administration budgets in
the year in question. That means that since 2010 there has been an
overall reduction of around 40% in the cost of running Whitehall

system as a whole to keep our entire budget within what we can control.

infrastructure and bring it up to date. We are talking here about
transport, energy, communications systems and flood protection. The

schools. We are getting the right long-term approach to that. I do not
think that there is any political contention about whether this is a
good thing or not; it is all about how well and how effectively we do
it. We will, I am sure, have a discussion about how well and
effectively we are doing it and who had the good ideas first, but

make a programme happen you need three things: a really good plan, the

we will refresh the so-called construction and infrastructure pipeline,

<I>Investing in Britain’s Future</I> is in effect a supporting
strategy document that lays out in each of the sectors what we are
doing, why we are doing it, and what we think it takes to make this

step in any plan. I have already referred to how parts of the
infrastructure which the Government fund from taxpayer resources will
be handled, and of course the majority of the focus in this document is
on our roads and our rail system. I will not go through the numbers or
the detail of the particular projects because they are all laid out in
the document, but the road investment is more 
<?notus-xml column=422?>significant than anything we have seen since we put the major national
structure of roads in place in the 1970s. The rail investment, which
has already begun with Network Rail, marks a period of greater
investment than anything since the Victorian times, and of course we
have also put a comprehensive budget in place for HS2. Similarly, we
have put long-term budgets in place for science, infrastructure and
affordable housing, and to ensure that we finish off our digital
communications programme so that we have very fast broadband coverage
in the maximum number of locations as soon as possible. We are working
closely with the private sector to accomplish

final point concerns our own capability, which is an exercise that I
have been very much involved in myself: making sure that Government
know how to be a good client when they are building infrastructure. We
have reviewed the four major departments with infrastructure
responsibility, which of course are the Department for Transport, the
Department for Energy and Climate Change, Broadband Delivery UK, which
sits within DCMS, and the Environment Agency, which sits within the
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. We have looked at
the commercial resources that they need to deliver the project
portfolio in front of them, and we will work with them to supplement
their own resources to make sure that they have people in place.
Structurally, from an organisational point of view, the presumption is
that we will manage these projects within organisations that are
dedicated to project delivery. We will get them done urgently, with
focus and for great value. An example would be that we are going to
corporatise the Highways Agency so that it has the flexibility it needs
to hire the staff it needs to do the job and has flexibility with its
funding so that it can get on and be the most effective deliverer of
roads that it can
be.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-03?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_03_PT_1/FAE4135CA03C3A6970B395FF170EC92EFC941111" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 3 July 2013">Wednesday,

Kramer:</Member></B> My Lords, I want to thank my noble friend Lord
Deighton, who has done the heavy lifting in this debate by providing us
with the details of the spending review and summarising them for us, so
I will not try to repeat that. However, I want to confirm that I find
myself very much in support of the general thrust of the two
Statements, first on the spending round and then on infrastructure,
because what lies beneath them is essentially a strategy of reducing
revenue spending in order to allow a shift into infrastructure
investment. That surely is what we need to achieve the growth that we
require for this
country<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T15:58:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070376000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070376000018">I
know that the Labour Party now buys into austerity, so I will be very
interested to hear its comments, but I am still not clear whether
Labour understands why austerity has been so necessary. We have seen
the build-up of debt over more than a generation, but during those
years Labour spent and borrowed as if we were at the bottom of an
economic cycle when we were in fact at the top of one. When the
inevitable bust came—it is always caused by one event or
another, but cycles happen—the economy found itself so heavily
overborrowed that many of the tools that would have been available in
more rational circumstances were not available, leaving the Government
with no choice but to cut sharply into structural revenue
spending.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=423?><hs_para UID="13070376000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070376000019">However, the coalition
is also having to rebuild an economy that, in the view of many now, had
been neglected for more than generation. It is hard to believe that
manufacturing fell from 26% of GDP in 1979 to a low of 10.5% in 2009.
The service industry grew but manufacturing did not grow alongside it
as it should have done. However, that is only part of the imbalance
that was allowed to develop. We became a largely public sector-driven
economy, and it has to be excellent news that for every job that has
been lost in the public sector, three have been gained in the private
sector. Those are now sustainable jobs, which is what we need in order
to build. How did we lose so many apprenticeships in the Labour years?
How did we take so many young people through education but find that
when they finished they lacked the skills needed to get a job? This
spending round, again, has supported apprenticeships and protected, in
real terms, spending on schools and the pupil premium, which surely is
an investment in the future of our most disadvantaged
youngsters.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070376000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070376000020">How
did we end up with a Government, although this concerns more than one
Government, with a procurement process that simply is not fit for
purpose? I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Deighton, for bringing
sense, skill and proper planning into government purchasing. I now
understand that the infrastructure programme that he has laid out
represents a steady rollout, year by year, which is exactly what we
need in order to deliver infrastructure. Perhaps he could tell me
whether I am correct in my understanding that the order of play of this
rollout of infrastructure is to have an early focus on opportunities
for fairly quick wins, such as broadband, school places and affordable
housing, with the longer-term projects that need much more planning and
preparatory work, particularly in transport, coming out over the longer
term. We now have a path for
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070376000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070376000021">We are
holding this debate just as increasingly positive news is creeping out;
we are moving, as the Chancellor said, from rescue to recovery. Both
the manufacturing and service sectors are growing, according to the PMI
and the Bank of England. Very encouragingly, the headline small
business index rose to 15.9 in the second quarter, up from 6.3 in the
first quarter. Mortgage approvals are up and confidence is improving.
The position with the silver pound, which is rarely talked about, is
interesting. Projections show that spending by the over-50s—a
group of people who have been far less hit than others in the
population, especially younger people—is increasing steadily. We
know that it is a group of people with the capacity to spend. Their
spending was up from £250 billion in 2007 to
£317 billion in 2012. The forecast according to Age
UK is for a bigger number to be delivered this year. That seems to be
an affordable place to go to see that kind of consumer
stimulus.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070376000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070376000022">I am
particularly encouraged that exports are rising markedly.
The BCC—the British Chambers of Commerce—reports that the
growth in exports is at its fastest since 1989. The Government have
taken on a really tough target of doubling exports to £1
trillion by 2020. Much of that will have to come from SMEs, which
provide over half our exports today. I give credit to the noble Lord,
Lord Green, but also very 
<?notus-xml column=424?>much to Vince Cable, for turning UKTI into an effective tool after a
generation of neglect. This spending round provides more money for our
embassies to work with UKTI and for increased export finance,
especially to small businesses, which is surely vital. This is an area
where scaling up has to continue. It must surely be one of the primary
focuses now of economic
policy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070376000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070376000023">The
welfare changes in this spending review are, frankly, modest. That must
be right, as we have to manage austerity in a fair way. I want us to
monitor the impact of the delay in paying jobseeker’s allowance
to see whether that has an untoward impact, albeit one that is
unintended. As I say, the changes on the welfare side have been very
modest. However, I have a point of clarification for the noble Lord,
Lord Deighton, on the so-called welfare cap, which strikes me as less a
cap and more a sensible management tool to capture key parts of
annually managed expenditure: programmes such as incapacity benefit,
which spiralled completely out of control under Labour even though
there  seemed to be no particular increase in either disabled
or injured people. Will the Minister confirm my understanding that the
cap is the OBR forecast of the cash cost of the included programmes?
Does breaking the cap trigger a report to Parliament but not
necessarily an automatic curtailment, unless there turns out to be an
important need for underlying
change<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T16:05:34"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070376000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070376000024">I
will talk briefly about infrastructure because the noble Lord, Lord
Shipley, will focus his remarks on that issue, especially on housing.
However, I take this opportunity to repeat a plea to the noble Lord,
Lord Deighton, for increased flexibility for tax increment financing to
allow local authorities to pick up the pace of investment in
small-scale infrastructure. The very case that he makes for large
infrastructure, involving the orderly rollout of schemes, certainty of
funding and tapping into external financing applies just as much to the
small and local. We have accepted that small is crucial in business and
commerce; we now need to accept that small as well as big is vital in
infrastructure<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T16:06:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070376000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070376000025">All
this has consequences for our financing system. The business bank is an
important beginning, but long-term patient capital is still hard to
find in the UK. I hope we will try to develop the capital markets to
provide that capital. The noble Lord, Lord Davies, the noble Baroness,
Lady Noakes, and I all attended a talk given by Robert Peston not long
ago in which he pointed out that in the US, 80% of small business
funding comes from the capital markets rather than the banks. The
opposite is the case here. Therefore, when a bank is compromised, we
are in a very difficult position. The major banks are going to be
seriously challenged to meet lending demand, despite Funding for
Lending, as growth picks up and firms chew through their cash
reserves<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T16:09:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070376000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070376000026">It
is good news that RBS has asked Sir Andrew Large, former Bank of
England deputy governor, to look at its lending practices, because when
it says that it has £20 billion that it would love to push out
of the door tomorrow morning but cannot, we all find that a fairly
extraordinary statement. However, something is holding our banks back.
I suspect that it is not the usual argument about capital but is much
more about 
<?notus-xml column=425?>capability, and it would be interesting to find out more. The Government
have done much to enable recovery, and this spending round is an
illustration of that. However, we cannot let a weakened banking system
derail these early beginnings for which the public have waited and
worked.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13070376000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070376000069"><I><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T16:07:53"></hs_TimeCode></I>4.08

Risby:</Member></B> My Lords, it is a great pleasure to follow my noble
friend Lady Kramer, who makes the very important point that
unemployment has fallen and that we have seen growth in the private
sector and the emphasis on infrastructure that has characterised the
Government’s policy. I congratulate my noble friend Lord
Deighton, who brings such enormous private sector expertise to the role
that he is fulfilling, which adds huge value to what the Government are
doing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070376000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070376000028">I think
it is fair to say that all European countries are trying to restrain
expenditure and look at how to generate economic growth. We are in the
fortunate position whereby there are now signs of some economic growth.
Indeed, most organisations believe that in the coming year we will have
the highest rate of growth in Europe of all the major economies, albeit
that there is still room to go much further. However, the truth of the
matter is that we remain vulnerable. We are not tied to major
currencies such as the euro and the dollar. We need to continue our
policy of restraint to keep mortgage rates and borrowing costs low, as
we still have to borrow an enormous amount. While the point of
today’s debate is to look to the future, it is worth remembering
that key element of the review, as we know that the markets can be
fierce in their judgments, as we saw when they made a judgment some
years ago about the competence of policy in this area and promptly
devalued our currency by 25%. That has meant that inflation has
continued at a high level, which we must never see
again<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T16:09:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070376000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070376000029">However,
I should very much like to consider how we can stimulate growth from
external activity and foreign investment, which were alluded to in the
spending review. All Governments are of course trying to do this, but
last week an interesting statistic from UNCTAD revealed that foreign
direct investment into the United Kingdom rose by 22% in 2012 to the
highest in Europe, £41 billion, compared with a drop of 18% in
the world, 42% in Europe and, extraordinarily enough, 85% in Germany.
It is clear that much of this investment arises from the fact that we
have an open economy and are very welcoming, but it is also important
to note the high level of re-investment that has been made by
foreign-owned corporations in this country, which suggests that they
have a high level of confidence. China, with which we have had some
political difficulties, has continued to make major investments, and I
hope that after the resolution of a recent difficulty this investment
will increase
further<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T16:10:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070376000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070376000030">Nevertheless,
our trade and export activities have been inadequate. For example,
there was hardly any improvement in 2012 in our manufacturing and
service exports when compared with the previous year. Of course, our
European markets have been weak and we have tried and been successful
in expanding our exports 
<?notus-xml column=426?>to countries such as Russia, China and India. Nevertheless, we could
have done much better. This is now simply a necessity for
us<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T16:11:17"></hs_TimeCode>. Household
budgets are of course being squeezed and European markets look to
remain anaemic. Over the next two years, 90% of world demand will be
generated outside the

the spending review, the Government have set a national challenge to
double UK exports and to get 100,000 more companies exporting by 2020.
In consequence, £140 million was announced in the Autumn
Statement last year to help SMEs to export. I am pleased to see in the
spending review that despite the pressures, funding certainty has been
given to UKTI to continue with this policy, thereby maintaining the
support for the next few years. Some £70 million was announced
to package overseas export promotion more professionally, and a new
unit has been formed—noble Lords will agree that this is
important—to look at the attractions of investment in our

is fair to say that all Prime Ministers have been for years trying to
advance the promotion of exports from this country, but I should like
to talk about an initiative that was brought into being in November
last year, the creation of prime ministerial trade envoys. There are
eight of us, six of whom are in your Lordships’ House and two of
whom are Members of the other place. We were appointed on a cross-party
basis. The whole idea is to assist UKTI, our embassies abroad, our
export effort and, with the appellation of being called a prime
ministerial trade envoy, get the highest possible access. As it
happens, I am the trade envoy to Algeria. Perhaps I may touch on this
for a few minutes. The role of the trade envoy is to enhance and
develop commercial partnerships through the following: identifying
commercial opportunities both for trade and investment, bringing
together UK and target market business leaders to develop opportunities
to secure the high-level access that I mentioned, and working with the
export promotion activities of our embassies and UKTI. It is good that
this is done entirely on a cross-party
basis<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T16:13:56"></hs_TimeCode>. Yesterday
morning, we had a very good meeting in which we were trying to exchange
best practice and to see how we can work together to really drive this

little about Algeria because it summarises exactly what I am talking
about. We have had no historical links to that country, but it has $190
billion dollars of reserves and a $300 billion infrastructure
programme. We start from a very low base, but in the past 18 months
there have been an enormous number of ministerial visits, which were
very welcome, including that of the Prime Minister in January. We now
have a clear partnership with Algeria. So many of the countries that we
are talking to and to which we want to export feel, particularly after
a post-colonial experience, that there should be a partnership in the
fullest sense of  the word. We now have, for obvious reasons, a
security 
<?notus-xml column=427?>relationship and a defence relationship with Algeria, which is
important. Every week, English-language schools are springing up all
over the country, and we hope that during the course of the next month
or two, hopefully in September, we will sign some major contracts. This
has come about because of a concerted effort led by the Prime Minister
and other Ministers. I pay tribute to a very dynamic ambassador in this
regard.</hs_para>

colleagues who are prime ministerial trade envoys. It is happening
everywhere. It is part of  a process, on which I hope everybody
will agree,  of reorienting our exports to more dynamic
markets. It will not solve all our problems, but in the past we have
seen erratic and feeble export promotion, and that is changing. This is
happening at the highest level of government and is reinforced by the
commitments made in this spending review. We have so much to offer. I
talked about our open economy and the English language. We make a
virtue of not paying bribes and not getting involved in anything like
that. We have attempted to reinvigorate UKTI and there are trade envoys

matters from a wider perspective. In a debate such as this, we can
sometimes focus too much on our own issues. With my tongue only
slightly in cheek, as a Bishop who represents Cornwall, I wonder
whether the noble Lord might represent to the Prime Minister the fact
that we need a trade envoy from England to Cornwall. Having heard from
the noble Lord, Lord Deighton, that infrastructure is an important part
of the comprehensive spending review, I mention the dualing of the A30

optimistically, I was looking for some good news this time around, and
there is some. I welcome the Government’s continued commitment
to free early education for all 3 and 4 year-olds and to extending this
to around 40% of 2 year-olds in more deprived areas. The protection of
the pupil premium in real terms is also welcome when so many areas of
public spending are being cut. I am concerned about how much of this is
actually reaching the most disadvantaged children whom it is designed
to benefit. We will know more about this, I hope, when the
Government’s evaluation of the pupil premium scheme is published
shortly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070376000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070376000038">However,
there are some worrying aspects of the spending round. I apologise to
my noble friend Lady Kramer, but I want to use the word
“cap”. The first is the overall cap on large parts of the
welfare budget, covering housing benefit, disability benefits and tax
credits, including universal credit. I am not here to defend social
security spending for its own sake. Contrary to much political and
media rhetoric, very few people want to be reliant on benefits to make
ends meet. Nearly every family aspires to having a job that pays a
decent wage and a home they can afford, but the reality is that many
millions of people are unemployed or underemployed, wages have been
stagnating in real terms for the last decade, and housing costs have
soared beyond the means of many working families. Forcing Ministers to
choose between the political embarrassment of breaching the welfare cap
or meeting vulnerable people’s living costs could mean that many
more people will be pushed towards doorstep lenders and food banks
because the level of benefits is inadequate to meet their
family’s basic needs.</hs_para>

I shall expand a little on a question about food banks that I put
yesterday to the noble Lord, Lord Freud. From my perspective, while
applauding the wonderful work of volunteers in setting up food banks,
many of whom are Christians, I have to say that it is a complete
scandal that we have any food banks at all in this country in the 21st
century. There are over 20 food banks in Cornwall alone. What on earth
is happening in our country? I ask the Government again whether we
ought not to spend a tiny amount of money on some research. Certainly
the anecdotal experience that I have and the stories that I hear make
it clear that there are some real benefit issues, which is why many
people are driven to go—they do not choose to go; they have to
go—to food banks.</hs_para>

serious about cutting the welfare bill, they need to address the
underlying drivers of social security spending that lie outside the
benefits system: a lack of jobs, low pay and a chronic housing
shortage. Imposing an artificial cap on the budget risks shifting the
blame and the burden on to the poorest families, who have done nothing
wrong but who are being penalised for our failure to tackle the root
causes of the problem.</hs_para>

point, which concerns the low level of public sector net investment.
Anyone listening to the Chancellor’s speech could be forgiven
for thinking that we were about to embark on a massive infrastructure
investment spree, suggested again by the noble Lord, Lord Deighton,
this afternoon. But analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows
that public sector net investment is not in fact set to rise, and will
actually fall as a share of GDP in 2016-17 and 2017-18. This feels like
a huge missed opportunity to make up for years of underinvestment in
affordable housing, creating badly needed jobs in the short term and
helping to bring down house prices and rents in the longer term, so
that fewer people are dependent on government subsidies.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T16:22:20"></hs_TimeCode> £3
billion capital investment in affordable housing announced by the
Chancellor is a small step in the right direction, but it does not go
nearly far enough to address Britain’s chronic housing shortage.
Housing is arguably the UK’s biggest long-term policy failure.
In the past year, there were 102,000 housing starts, less than half the
240,000 a year needed to meet estimated demand. It seems ludicrous to
me that only 5% of public expenditure on housing goes on capital
investment in new houses while 95% goes on demand-side housing
subsidies.</hs_para>

uneasy about the language used by the Chancellor in speaking about
welfare, a concern that is shared by many of my fellow Bishops. This

such a clear distinction between taxpayers and claimants creates the
misleading impression that the welfare system involves a large one-way
transfer of money from one group to the other. Far from stimulating
compassion, it encourages resentment towards those who are seen to be
living off the good will of others. It also ignores the reality that
the vast majority of us have and will both contribute to and benefit
from the support provided by the benefits system at different points in
our lives. For example, around half of all children will be in families
that are entitled to universal credit when it is fully
implemented.</hs_para>

course, about the church community. I believe the same principles apply
to the way we support one another through our social security system.
We are in danger of dishonouring the less presentable parts of our
society and as a nation we will become less healthy as a result. The
Government’s spending plans should have the well-being and
development of all our children at the heart of them. When millions of
British children are left to grow up in poverty, everyone’s

by congratulating the Government on sticking to their resolve to keep
downward pressure on spending in order to eliminate the deficit. The
update on GDP from the Office for National Statistics last week
underscored the scale of the problems the Government inherited in 2010.
The peak-to-trough deficit in 2008-09 is now calculated at an
astonishing 7.2%. That alone vindicates the stern action taken by the
Government when we came into power. The Benches opposite could barely
conceal their gleeful anticipation of a triple-dip recession earlier
this year. However, as last week’s figures confirmed, we avoided
that. In addition, we now know that we did not even have a double-dip
recession. The Government inherited an extremely poor hand of cards,
but my right honourable friend the Chancellor has played them
skilfully.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070376000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070376000047">I
fully support the Government’s approach on public sector pay.
Continuing to limit pay rises to 1% is thoroughly sensible, especially
as public sector pay has continued to run ahead of private sector pay
in recent years. I also support the move to remove automatic pay
progression. I understand that several central government departments
have already done this and so I am unclear as to the savings that this
move will generate. I could not find any figures on this in the Green
Book and I echo the criticisms by the Institute for Fiscal Studies
about the paucity of analysis in the Green Book. I hope my noble friend
can give some analysis today. Will this apply to local government? What
will be the impact on the NHS’s budget? What precisely are the
Government’s plans and how much do they expect to
save?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070376000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070376000048">I have
some concerns about the cost of public sector pensions that have not
been dealt with. Public sector workers account for less than 20% of the
workforce but are more than three times more likely to have current
access to a defined benefit pension scheme than those in the private
sector. This would not matter much if public sector pay scales fully
reflected the value of the pension promise, but the plain fact is that
they do not. The current Government, like the last one, have talked a
good story about bearing down on the cost of public sector pensions. In
2011, they claimed that they had done such a good deal that it would
last for 25 years and would save billions. That is fine if you 
<?notus-xml column=431?>have faith in 50-year projections based on heroic assumptions. Meanwhile
the real problem, which the Government continue to ignore, is that
public sector pension cash flows are now negative: pension payments
exceed contributions received. In 2005, this cash cost was only
£200 million, but it is now around £11 billion a year.
According to the Office for Budget Responsibility, it is forecast to
rise to more than £16 billion over the next few years, and this
figure is likely to be even higher once the latest proposals for a
flat-rate state pension and the related contracting-out changes are
implemented. The spending round scraped together £11.5 billion
of savings but failed to defuse the cash time bomb of public sector
pension
costs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070376000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070376000049">While I
fully support the Government’s efforts to control spending, we
must not lose sight of the facts that we are still borrowing money each
year and that debt will not start to reduce until 2017-18. Furthermore,
there are no overall cash cuts; we are spending more every year. In
2009-10, we spent £669 billion. In 2015-16 we are planning for

for money. I have particular concerns about the Green Investment Bank,

congratulate my right honourable friend the Chancellor for ignoring the
Keynsian siren voices calling for more money to be thrown at
infrastructure at the expense of even more debt. The announcements last
week about infrastructure spending were, I believe, predicated on no
new money. I do not criticise that. I am sceptical about the economic
benefits claimed for

leads me naturally to the High Speed 2 project, on which I find myself
surprisingly in agreement with the noble Lord, Lord Mandelson. Last
week, the Chief Secretary announced a funding envelope of £42.6
billion for the construction costs of HS2. What he did not say was that
the £42.6 billion was one-third higher than the previous budget,
as Transport Ministers had to admit the previous day. Two days ago,
transport officials as good as admitted to the Public Accounts
Committee in the other place that the benefits have been overstated.
The benefit/cost ratio for the HS2 project was already low by transport
standards and now looks to be completely bust. Even the CBI, usually a
cheerleader for infrastructure projects, has called for a rethink.
Today is not the day to debate HS2 itself, but these developments
remind us that public sector infrastructure is not the panacea that
some would claim for it and it does not unambiguously benefit the
economy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070376000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070376000056">I am

controlling expenditure is important, the supply side of the economy
still feels neglected. We need much more tax reform, lower rates all

on deregulation. We need to liberate and incentivise the private sector
to create wealth. We need to keep Britain as an attractive place in
which overseas companies can invest. In sum, we need a lot more than

quite hard things in the context of what my noble friend said, let me
stress that I would not for one moment underestimate the difficulty of
reducing a deficit. I began that a very long time ago as a new Treasury
Minister. We were an incoming Government determined to cut the deficit
and, indeed, public expenditure and the size of the public sector. I
was sent to see the new Secretary of State for Education, one Margaret
Thatcher, who was basically in favour of cutting back the size of the
public sector but not her department. I arrived with a long list of
cuts, including eliminating the Open University. In the end, after a
lot of haggling, I said, “Margaret, we’ll give you a
deal. You can keep the Open University and make all the other cuts, or
you can make all the other cuts and keep the Open University”.
To my astonishment, she said, “I’ll keep the Open
University”, so I got my cuts and we and the country got the
Open University, which was probably the right decision. The reason I
stress this point is because we have to be a great deal tougher than we
are being.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13070392000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070392000003">I
am worried by the constant repetition—it is once again in the
Chancellor’s speech—that we have cut the deficit by one
third. That means that we are continuing to borrow at two-thirds of the
appalling rate at which 
<?notus-xml column=433?>the previous Government were borrowing. I hope that we can get rid of
that expression. It is interesting that it has not

the light of that statement we can be complacent. We simply must not be
complacent. There is nothing more important for the future of this
country than getting the deficit down. I am a little worried about some
of the presentational side of things. The public sector finance
statistics have the heading, “Public sector net
borrowing”. It ought to be, “Net extra borrowing”.
We constantly hear figures from the Government that overlook the word
“extra” when it ought to be there. There is also a very
curious quirk in the figures. In the column for public sector debt, the
figure is £1,103.6 billion in 2011, but in 2012 there appears to
be a miraculous reduction. The statisticians evidently felt that they
could not forecast the figure to the last decimal place so they moved
the whole figure one place to the right. If you look down the column
there suddenly appears to be an enormous reduction. Clearly they could
not forecast it, but it is 10:1 that they would have got the last
decimal point right if they tried. I hope that we can improve the
statistics and that the Minister will bear that in mind.</hs_para>

the Post Office pension fund. We have the assets but do not make

am also concerned about debt interest. The Chancellor laid great stress
on the fact that we are paying £6 billion a year less
to finance the debt. That is obviously a great advantage, but it rests
on the proposition that interest rates will stay where they are. They
might stay where they are for longer than we would like. We have only
to look at the American experience to see that trying to unwind
quantitative easing produces very emotional reactions in the markets.
Therefore, low interest rates might be maintained, perhaps wrongly, for
longer than we expect, but sooner or later they will have to go up. As
for the public sector finance statistics, what assumption is made about
interest rates when calculating the debt interest payments, which
fluctuate widely? It would be helpful to know
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T16:43:05"></hs_TimeCode>. As I say,
I do not underestimate for one minute how difficult this exercise is,

start with the Scottish referendum on independence. In last
week’s debate on the Select Committee on Economic Affairs report
on the economic impact of independence on the United Kingdom, it was
explained that while we know the public expenditure level on Scotland,
we do not know the amount of tax raised in Scotland; the data are not
collected other than on a UK-wide basis. There have been some private
estimates, notably by Oxford Economics, as to the tax raised. In the
context of all that the Government are now doing on devolution,
decentralisation and the single local growth fund, the tax raised for
the constituent parts of the UK needs to be known. Part of this is
about how you measure success. We will certainly have a single local
growth fund between 2015 and 2020 and the Government will have to
measure success, and one measure will inevitably be the tax generated
from growth. You have to have a base and work has been done with
Greater Manchester on its city deal and the earn-back model, which I
understand has now been agreed. Hopefully, that will be an exemplar of
how tax can be
measured<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T16:46:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

been difficult and we all understand the reasons for that. If there is
a headline cut of 10% in local government, for authorities that have
social care responsibilities—notably the counties and
unitaries—the real reduction is 2.3% because of the extra
£2 billion allocated to local authorities. I make the point to
the Minister that if you ring-fence the National Health Service and are
content with that, you have to ring-fence health more broadly. If you
do not prevent ill health through the social care system, you end up
with a cost landing on the National Health Service. I am pleased that
the £3.8 billion in total in the spending review that has come
to the health service and local authorities is extremely helpful. I

care will be ring-fenced as

will be a council tax freeze for five years; of course, that depends on
local authorities deciding to freeze their council tax, which will be
up to them. I observe, however, that when central government permits a
freeze of council tax, certainly over a period as long as five years,
it makes local government more dependent in the long term on central
government. I am not sure, given the Government’s direction of
travel towards raising more tax locally and people being more
responsible for their spending decisions locally, that there should be
such central control of the allocation of

localisation. I also believe strongly, for the avoidance of doubt, in
the equalisation of funding on the basis of need. It is difficult to do
either properly without knowing more about the tax base of an area to
which power is being devolved. In England it is difficult to localise
without knowing the current level of public spending in each area,
either of local government—a council—or of a local
enterprise partnership. Data are not being collected on that basis.
They are collected on a regional basis, but they will have to be

local government area are simply not available at all. I hope that as
part of public service transformation, the Minister will take on board
the need to improve the tax income and public spending data which the
Government produce. This is caused not least by the fact that community
budgets—the tri-borough pilots in London, Essex, Greater
Manchester and Cheshire West—have shown significant signs of
savings being generated if public services can be planned together. The
numbers are actually very large indeed. I am much encouraged by that.
However, while this is partly about integrating health and social care

Pensions with the work of local authorities and local enterprise

a crucial step, I ask the Minister to look into the concept
of total place accounting, which is not the same thing as total place
spending. However, at the moment, departments, local authorities and
those spending public money in a given locality are not accounting for
their expenditure on a local basis. It is going to be important for all
service providers in a local area to account formally for what is spent
by them in that area and then to produce accounts that 
<?notus-xml column=436?>demonstrate that. It is two years before we get into the single local

takes me to the concept of the local treasury, because community
budgeting is about all the funds available in an area for public
investment to be jointly spent as a community budget. For a local
treasury to succeed, we need to know what tax is raised and what public
money is spent in an area, and then consider the gap so that a

Government Association, which revised its figures yesterday on the
basis of the spending review announcement, the position for 2015-16 is
that some 56 councils in England will have only 86% of the money they
need to meet existing commitments in 2015-16. One of the consequences
will be a lowering of investment in prevention. You will see that
happen despite the extra money going into social care. As I have said,
if you do not prevent, you end up with a higher cost later. I have
therefore concluded that community budgeting is the answer. There are
other possibilities, and I fully understand why the Government do not
go down the route of unitary councils in all parts of England. It is
nevertheless my view that there are significant savings to be made by
local government in the creation of unitary councils. I come from the
north-east of England where we have only unitary councils. Some of the
savings are
demonstrable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T16:52:24"></hs_TimeCode>.

read a report called <I>Rewiring Public Services</I>, launched
yesterday at the Local Government Association conference. It is a
hugely important read that extends the debate about how matters could
be progressed. Here is a fact that is telling. By 2018-19, on current
projections, council tax and business rates will total more than local
government spending on services, excluding schools. We are close to
making the central government grant obsolete and we could plan now to
move away from local taxes being controlled in Whitehall towards
financial independence of the sector, which itself is responsible for
redistribution to meet needs. That whole issue could benefit from
further work<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T16:53:44"></hs_TimeCode>. I

my noble friend Lady Kramer talked about housing. It is right to
increase the housing borrowing cap for local authorities. The average
debt on a council house is £17,000. There is significant
headroom. We could build many more social homes by permitting local
authorities to borrow more. Since April last year, the housing revenue
account has been a trading account and we are the only EU country that
treats borrowing in the housing revenue account as public borrowing.
That need not be the case and we could build 20,000 or
30,000 houses, maybe more, if that borrowing cap were to be increased.

that.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-03?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_03_PT_1/0AA13A15993EF311488ABC48990A6436D1A9F1F8" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 3 July 2013">Wednesday,

Flight:</Member></B> My Lords, I hope it will be the privilege of all
of us to live long enough to see the judgment of economic historians on
the times in which we are living. The Chancellor is following blatant
neo-Keynesian policies, with an ongoing deficit of £120
billion-plus per annum and printing some £370 billion of money.
If I wanted a definition of neo-Keynesian, that would be it. No wonder
the Opposition is flummoxed, because to recommend even larger Keynesian
policies on top of that is patently
unrealistic<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T16:55:30"></hs_TimeCode>.
Will that approach be vindicated or will the Hayekian school be right
that the problem with such policies is that they make returning to
normality in due course even worse than it would be if you took hold of
the situation much
sooner<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T16:55:46"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070392000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070392000023">In
the 1930s when Chamberlain as Chancellor took Hayekian measures and
slashed public sector pay, spending and taxation, and unleashed a
housing boom because there were no planning restraints, we had growth
of 4% a year from 1935 to the start of the Second World War. It was the
highest period of growth in the 20th century. Today, although growth
and recovery have been disappointing, there are positives and we have
heard quite a few of them this afternoon. Thankfully, we are not in the
euro. The economy is doing markedly better. Indeed, there was 0.6%
growth in the latest quarter. I would expect growth of at least 1.5%
this year against falls in the eurozone of 0.6%. Certainly there is no
double dip. Foreign investment in the UK is up substantially. As I
think the noble Baroness, Lady Kramer, pointed out, there is really
good news on the apprenticeship scheme. Exports are rising. In my
little territory, EIS venture capital investment has doubled in the
past year, as has equity money for new small businesses, and as well as
congratulating the noble Lord, Lord Risby, for what he is doing in
Algeria, a little bird told me that Algeria was going to apply to join
the Commonwealth, so the noble Lord seems to have done extremely
well<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T16:57:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

micro-points as well, which I certainly approve of. The ending of
automatic progression in the public sector should at least reduce
average nominal pay in the state sector, which keeps rising in a
blatant breach of supposed pay freezes. Tougher eligibility rules for
jobseeker’s allowance are necessary. Having to learn English
makes good sense. Ending winter fuel payments in hot countries is
surely a no-brainer. The welfare cap on housing benefit, tax credits,
disability benefits and pensioner benefits, and bringing it all
together to assess people’s needs, is sensible. Limiting to
£2 million the funds to be made available annually for
investment by local enterprise partnerships, as suggested by the noble
Lord, Lord Heseltine, is a fairly sensible economy. I am particularly
keen on the extra 180 free schools and the extra technical colleges.
The technical colleges go hand in hand with the apprenticeships and are
going to make a big difference to this economy and to the people who
attend
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T16:58:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

going on behind the question of how to judge the macro-stance. Even on
the macro-stance it is amazing to have achieved a near political
consensus on the need to reduce welfare spending, which is really what
the situation amounts to. The 
<?notus-xml column=438?>state is slimming down modestly. Between 2010 and 2017 it is, I think, a
2.7% reduction in real terms. No one has achieved that in living
memory. There is a modest shift from current to capital expenditure,
and I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Deighton, will make the very
most of that in the rational management of the infrastructure scenario,
which of course is still crucial. However, what about the future? Debt
is piling up—it will be 80% of GDP by the end of the
year—interest bills are rising, and as QE has to come to an end
they are likely to rise dramatically further. We are stuck with a
deficit compounding of £120 billion per annum.</hs_para>

there was little net new. Cash spending continues to rise; it will be
£720 billion this year, £730 billion next year and
£745 billion in 2015-16. Most of the figures have already been
announced. There are major changes within spending divisions, but not
in the aggregates. For the poor spending divisions affected, out of
public spending of £720 billion only £204
billion was really up for cuts. Six of them had cuts of at least 10% of
their expenditure. It has become obvious that to have a health budget
of £127 billion, a education budget of £97
billion, and a welfare budget of £220 billion in effect not up
for cuts is a mistake. I am afraid that the NHS has not been vindicated
by all that has come to
light.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070392000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070392000027">There
are two quite separate points. First, will running a deficit of this
size prove the right thing to do economically? For me, the great
disappointment is the missed opportunity for sorting out the public
sector and shrinking the size of the state. Over 10 years ago, I spent
nearly two years of my life organising the James review. A team of
consultants looked at each area of the public sector, and the level of
potential waste and cuts was then approximately £100 billion.
That does not seem to have changed that much. The issue is the will to
sort it out and to get the state right out of areas where it should not
be involved. Those are the key areas that matter. The cost of health
and welfare together is nearly £360 billion, which is more than
half of total public expenditure. I think even Prime Minister Attlee
would have been shocked if it had been more than half of public
expenditure in his
time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070392000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070392000028">The
leakage is not allowed for. The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, referred
to the growing public sector cash deficit on public sector pensions. I
have banged on about it before, but the real figure is likely to be
about £25 billion per annum, and there is no provision for it.
There was a quiet study of the student loan book, which is worth
£83 billion in total. Some 40% will have to be written off,
which is another £30 billion, and there is no
provision for that. Is there any review of the whole area as to why
that is the outturn? I am afraid
not.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070392000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070392000029">Astonishingly,
welfare, health and education together account for £516 billion
of £720 billion, which is why only £200 billion-odd is
eligible for cuts. The harsh truth is that much of the public sector
remains bloated and poorly managed and has falling productivity. Many
noble Lords may have seen the latest Taxpayers’ Alliance report,
which pointed to £120 billion of waste, much of it gravy-train
expenditure. It is a drag on the 50%  
<?notus-xml column=439?>private sector. In fact, it is a huge tribute to the private sector that
it managed to create 1.3 million jobs when its opportunity is thus
limited.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13070392000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070392000030">One
thing remains. It is always the case that public sector pay layer by
layer should be about 15% below private sector pay, allowing for
shorter hours, lower productivity, better pensions and better security
of employment, but it remains about 15% above private sector pay layer
by layer. There is a gap of 30% in aggregate, which is the result of
the strength of public sector unions under the previous Government. In
the area of health, we have the highest paid doctors, the worst
provision of health, some £20 billion of claims for negligence
and the legal costs going with them. It is a great pity that there has
not been anything like an adequate resolve to get to grips and sort out
the public
sector.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070392000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070392000031">I
shall end by commenting on the elephant  in the
room, which is QE. It was very clear that money printing was
needed in 2008-09 because the money stock was contracting dramatically
and the money supply with it, partly the result of the wrong government
policies, because just when we needed to support the money supply,
moves against banks led to it contracting. However, this has been
allowed to go on and on. Inflation has remained higher than planned.
When interest rates return to real levels, they will increase
government interest costs substantially and probably hit the housing

reality is that there is no way in which the Bank of England will
suddenly be able to sell off £370 billion of gilts
into a falling gilt market with rising interest rates. We will have the
extra money stock there, and all that it will need is higher velocity
of circulation to produce a massive increase in the money supply. One
can see what is likely to happen: as and when the economy recovers
sufficiently there will be strong pressure for wages to be increased.
People have had real-wage cuts for quite a long time. I am afraid that
the overall money stock will be there to finance that uncontrollably.
No one knows when, but there is clearly a substantial risk of a period
of high inflation at some stage in the next 10 years. The idea that new
Governor Carney could pursue a more expansionary monetary QE is simply
unrealistic. He will need all his wisdom and experience to steer the

will focus first on the departmental spending figures. These show that
there is a wide range of outcomes for different departments. There are
no cuts overall in 2015-16 for international development, transport and
health. Particularly with health, is there not a case for what I

other extreme is a near 30% cut in the CLG communities budget. Overall,
the IFS estimates that there is an average DEL cut of 2.1% in real
terms across departments in 2015-16, on top of an 8.3% average cut
between 2011 and 2014. However, capital spending has been increased
while current spending has been cut, unlike in the 2010 spending
review. Departmental priorities have been the same since 2010. Some
departments are set to be cut by more than a third over five years. One
issue confuses me, not being an economist. Can the Minister explain, if
he agrees, 
<?notus-xml column=441?>why the IFS claims that public sector net investment is going to be
broadly flat in the next four years when so many capital projects have
been
mentioned?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070392000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070392000041">I
now move on to annually managed expenditure, although I query the word
“managed”. According to the IFS, this will increase by no
less than 18% from 2013-14 to 2017-18. On the positive front, I welcome
some major attempts to control this. The social rent uprating policy
will save £1 billion by 2017-18. The seven-day waiting period
for unemployment claims will save £765 million by the same date.
I also welcome limits to public sector pay increases. Capping social
security is a positive idea, but why do we have to wait until after the
election to put these measures in place? If welfare spending has been
allowed to rise undesirably, forcing an active decision could lead to
better policy-making. Surely it is better to review all spending
frequently, regardless of whether it is higher or lower than forecast,
or at least to cap individual components. In addition, which areas
exactly are being
capped?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070392000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070392000042">On the
negative side, as my noble friends Lady Noakes and Lord Flight have
already mentioned, public sector pensions will continue to be a huge
burden on the state. They mentioned the figures. In a recent CPS
publication in 2011, Michael Johnson stated that the shortfall between
contributions and payments for public sector pensions was £8
billion. This figure, as my noble friend Lady Noakes mentioned, was
fairly insignificant in 2005—about £200
million—but will rocket to £15.4 billion in 2016-17. Even
that £15.4 billion figure is net, with the amount
being paid by the employer—the state—deducted. The true
figure, according to Michael Johnson, will have increased by
£17.2 billion to £32.6
billion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T17:13:13"></hs_TimeCode> by
2016-17. My noble friend Lord Newby, I think, was asked during the
passage of the Public Sector Pensions Bill what the government figure
for this was and said he would look into it. As I understand it, we
have not had any reply to that and I wonder whether we could have one
from the Minister either today or in
writing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070392000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070392000043">Mr<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T17:13:38"></hs_TimeCode>
Johnson believes that OBR figures do not take account of the
DWP’s White Paper on the single-tier pension last January. This
will add another £9 billion, due to some very technical but
highly credible unforeseen changes in connection with NIC rebate
circularity, single-tier pension transition costs and increased life
expectancy. I will not burden the Committee with those details. Mr
Johnson calculates the extra costs, within a decade, as being at least
£41 billion, an increase of £1,600 a year for every
household in the UK. Hence, if you strip out the benefit of
transferring the Post Office pensions, where the Government have banked
the assets of the scheme but, I understand, not the liabilities, the
impact on actual public sector net borrowing position is such that the

IFS concludes that further cuts are expected beyond 2016. Total
spending is approximately frozen in real terms, but annual managed
expenditure is increasing. In the absence of further policy action,
this implies that there will have to be further departmental cuts. To
avoid these would mean tax rises of £25 billion. If
tax increases are not made and certain departmental

Empey:</Member></B> My Lords, I should like to make a few comments in
the gap. Like many people in this country, I am disappointed and to a
certain degree angry that the United Kingdom finds itself in its
current economic powerlessness around the world. This has major
implications for our foreign policy, our defence policy, and for a
number of other matters. While a number of noble Lords have pointed at
former Prime Minister Gordon Brown and others, this situation has been
developing over a substantial period of time. It did not happen
overnight. I think that the rock we perished on really goes back to the
1960s and 1970s when we turned our back on manufacturing, thinking it
was old hat. It was about dirty, smelly factories, and the new way to
do things was in the service sector, with finance and so on. We moved
away from a broad-based and balanced economy with a portfolio spread
across a range of areas. Indeed, our outward-looking expertise and our
contacts throughout the world were not exploited to the extent that
they might have
been<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T17:16:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

about the rhetoric that we are currently using, which other noble Lords
have referred to in the debate. We have been talking about
“savage cuts” of this, that and the other. The arithmetic
disproves that. Spending and borrowing are going up. I did a brief
calculation and worked out that as a country we have borrowed around
another £80 million since the debate this afternoon began.
Anyone who suggests that we are in the throes of brutal cutbacks is
simply not being realistic. There are many things that we would like to
spend money on and there are many groups in our communities that we
would wish to help, but unless we as a nation can make the money to pay
for those benefits, clearly they are not possible. Everyone will suffer

particular for the Minister on pension funds. I asked his colleague,
the noble Lord, Lord Freud, about this and received a Written Answer
the other day. Pension funds in other parts of the world can buy into
our electricity and water sectors, transport, airports, all sorts of
things. Why are our own pension funds not doing the same thing? The
answer is that there are too many of them and they are too small, so
they do not have the capability to do so. An example of this is the
Ontario public sector workers’ fund. It has 400,000 members and
a huge balance sheet. We now describe a large fund as one with over
1,000 members. That is just not competitive. I know that the Government
are looking at this, but there needs to be a radical step change so
that the pension funds in this country have enough firepower to make 
<?notus-xml column=443?>the purchases that will bring revenue into this country instead of being
broken up into tiny funds that are of no significance
whatever.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-03?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_03_PT_1/84A5716CFD5E6F724EB2995A3812ABD933670D89" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 3 July 2013">Wednesday,

rates. China has been doing it for years, and Japan is doing it at the
moment. Its exchange rate with the dollar has dropped by 15% since the
new Prime Minister was elected a few months ago. There is no point in
playing by the Queensberry rules while someone is taking the very bread
out of your mouth, and that is what is happening. Will the Minister

point is this. If we are trying to stimulate the economy and achieve
some of our objectives in  an atmosphere of reduced spending,
will the Minister consider how VAT is applied to things such as the
retrofitting of buildings? Such activity achieves the

to LEPs, and it is clear that there is not very much money. I do not
think that that should come as a great surprise to anyone, but some of
my colleagues in the LEPs were getting a bit hot under the collar about
it. However, anyone who thinks about it will realise that we are not in
a situation where money is going to be dished out in a big way, and nor

representative of the Humber LEP, I talk to many would-be investors in
renewable energy in the North Sea. It is hoped that some very big
external investments will be coming in. Of course money comes into it,
but there are some real issues that we have to deal with. The
environment for people investing in this

points come up all the time. One that applies right across the country
is the skills issue. I do not think it is so much about spending more
money but about using the money that is presently available more
effectively and efficiently. Last week I was talking to the head of a
college in Leeds who pointed out that the college has to manage 39
different funding streams. That is just crazy. The college spends more
time trying to understand where the money comes from than spending it.
Successive Governments have looked at this but they have always baulked
at tackling it. The reason they do not tackle it is twofold. First,
Ministers come in with their own pet schemes that they put into the
system and no one can cancel and, secondly, the Civil
Service—the Whitehall engine—does not like to have its
arrangements upset. These  39 schemes really should be whittled
down to nine or 10.</hs_para>

that of our major projects, which the Cabinet Office Efficiency and
Reform Board has been looking at for the past few years. It is scary
how badly these projects have been mishandled over the
years—going back 20, 30 and even 40 years. We have to get a grip
on that and make sure that we do not do it again. Once again it comes
from the Whitehall silo mentality where one department finds it
difficult to talk to another department. I contrast that with what I
see when I go to Scotland to look at how they are doing things there.
Whitehall could learn a lot from Scotland. In Scotland, Northern

an example. The noble Lord, Lord Heseltine, is taking a great interest
in what we are doing in the Humber. We are looking at regulation.
Regulation is another issue which constantly comes up, not because
there is too much of it—that is not the issue—but because
of the way in which existing regulation is mismanaged. I have a big
investor at the moment who is having to go through one regulator and
then start again with another, very often duplicating what the first
one had done. We are setting up a pilot group to get all the state
regulatory agencies together so that when a major project comes along,
we all sit down around a table, agree what the issues are and apportion
the regulatory problems. That does not sound very exciting, but it

business leadership we need to bring all that together, as in the 19th

to achieve some balance in the arguments before the country at present.
I have only just got my breath back from the Minister’s
very  first statement, in which he said that this
economy  has been well managed by the Chancellor from the
beginning. So why is the Chancellor back with a second comprehensive
spending review Statement? Why is he back with a second round of cuts?
I accept that, as the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, indicated, the
economy may not be in a double-dip recession, but why is he here in

is nothing in the Chancellor’s proposals, which the Minister has
been defending with his usual elan today, that suggests growth for the
future. The noble Lord of course has particular expertise on
infrastructure. We all appreciate that and welcome his appointment to
give the Government a boost in that respect. However, let us recognise
that there has been no expenditure on infrastructure since 2010. In
fact, all those issues which were planned at that time, which I think
the Minister referred to as the 2010 pipeline, have been effectively
blocked. There is virtually no progress on any of the 2010 schemes.
Now, of course, infrastructure spending is being suggested—in
the distant future. The things being boasted about are HS2 and
north-south Crossrail. Both projects are 10 to 15 years away from
significant expenditure; perhaps it is a little earlier with HS2, but
certainly not prior to the next general election. If it is being
suggested that there will be a boost to the economy through
infrastructure spending over the next couple of years,

positions adopted by the Conservative Party in the 1980s. As regards
manufacturing—the noble Lord, Lord Haskins, also made an
important point on that—we should have put much greater emphasis
upon the development of skills in our society. We have not equipped any
of the next generation for the kind of economy that we seek to

foreign investment. Of course we would all welcome that but does he

potential investors? The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, indicated the
areas in which she welcomed what was happening but even she will
recognise that the IMF has said that some £10 billion ought to
be invested in infrastructure in “shovel-ready”
industries, particularly construction. It ought to be put into
housebuilding because that is the fastest way in which you could
inculcate some element of demand into the economy. However, are the
Government pursuing that strategy? If the noble Lord, Lord Deighton,

surprised. I give way to the noble Lord.</hs_para>

shock we all felt in the Chamber yesterday when it was suggested by a
Conservative Minister that food banks are supply-driven and nothing to
do with people’s needs. People’s needs have occasioned
the development of food banks, which are necessary, but our great
shame. Nor is there any understanding on the Conservative side about
what it is to lose one’s job at present. It is quite okay to
say, “We will cut public expenditure by making sure that there
is a week in which one cannot claim jobseeker’s
allowance”, but what do noble Lords think the morale of a family
will be when someone loses his job against a background where the

the Labour years, job centres were not permitted to refer clients to
food banks. As noble Lords know, you can go to a food bank only with a
reference from an appropriate person: a job centre, a doctor or a
limited number of other people. You cannot just turn up and make a

ask the Minister to take on board the very important points that have
been made by his noble friends today in supporting the coalition. Will
he also, at some point in his remarks, address the question of
morality? Why is it, for example, that his supporters are concerned to
promote a bedroom tax that ensures that there is a desperate issue for
impoverished people as to whether they will be forced to move but that
when a mansion tax is proposed by the Liberal Party, there are all
sorts of anxieties that people who are reasonably well off might be
obliged to move and about what an affront to fairness that would
represent? The mansion tax would be aimed at properties of very
considerable value and at people who know they well might come under
attack rather than the very large numbers of people who, under the
bedroom tax, are being forced to move from their homes, the schools
which their children attend and even the localities in which they have
lived for very many years. I hope the Minister will address some of

Deighton:</Member></B> My Lords, first, I thank all noble Lords for
their insights, ideas and challenge. It has been a most fascinating
exchange and I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Davies, on holding up
the Opposition’s end there. I will address his question about
morality straightaway. To me, this is a very simple issue: unless we
are able to create a state that can actually afford to sustain itself,
those who are most vulnerable will be the most exposed victims of the
fall-out from that kind of financial crash. We have to get our ability
to afford a welfare state in the right state so that we can sustain it.
That is the way that we protect the vulnerable in the long
run.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070392000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070392000075">The
Chancellor<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T17:41:15"></hs_TimeCode> was
back with another spending round because we had not defined the
spending plans for 2015-16. We took the opportunity to lay out the
investment programme through to 2021 because, as I explained in my
earlier remarks, we think that it is the right way to provide an
environment in which people can plan investment correctly. On the
general question of whether anything is really being done about growth
for the future, the point is precisely to begin to deliver a programme
from which future Governments will benefit. They can quibble over who
was responsible for the earlier decisions. These kinds of investments
have very long lead times and our planning is trying to break the link
between the political and economic cycles. There was some
misunderstanding there, in that I do not think anybody was trying to
claim more; we were just trying to claim that there is a long-term
plan. Public sector gross investment in this decade, 2010 through to
2020, is slightly higher on average than in the previous decade, if you
smooth out the peaks and the troughs and take the
average.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070392000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070392000076">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T17:43:02"></hs_TimeCode>
terms of delivery today, the noble Lord, Lord Davies, is correct that
projects from 2021 and onwards, or in five years’ time, have an
impact later. However, the projects we are undertaking now are having
an impact. Crossrail is being delivered now—the money in the
spending round is for the feasibility study for 
<?notus-xml column=449?>Crossrail 2. Crossrail will be open in 2018-19 and we are spending
something like £15 billion on it. It is the biggest urban
infrastructure project in Europe and is going on now, right under our
feet. That a very good example of delivery. Similarly, we have upgraded
150 stations, completed more than 30 road projects, opened
more than 80 new free schools, delivered more than 84,000 affordable
homes and done an enormous amount in rolling out 4G mobile services.
There is a significant amount of delivery going on now and we are
trying to plan for future delivery. We are trying to accelerate it and
make it better value all the way through. I accept the point of my
noble friend Lady Noakes that it is not necessarily a good thing just
because it is an infrastructure project. We have to evaluate them all,
which is what we did in the plan through to 2020. We re-evaluated them
all on a zero-budget basis and approved the ones that we thought were

the Government will have to explain what action has been taken. We will
put a buffer in place to ensure that any policy actions are not
triggered by small changes. That is how that one works. For the
information of the noble Lord, Lord Northbrook, the areas being capped
are all in social security: housing benefit, disability benefits,

the quick wins in infrastructure and leaving the longer-term strategic

moment and we are trying to put a consistent long-term plan in place.

have set aside. We have also set up a £200 million pot to
accelerate joint working among local authorities. Whether we can
release the borrowing cap on HRAs is another matter. If we were to do
that it would add another £7 billion to public sector borrowing
every year. Most of the schemes which creatively try to allow more
borrowing at the local level are captured and increase public sector
borrowing. That is always the constraint that we are trying to

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord Taylor of

commitment to table a report each year on the operation of the JHA
opt-in protocol. The Government agreed to maintain that pledge and have
ensured that such reports cover not only decisions taken under the JHA
opt-in but also those taken under the Schengen opt-out protocol. The
Government have since published three such reports. The most recent of
these, which is the subject of this debate, was published on 25 April
this year. It covers opt-in decisions taken between 1 December 2011 and
30 November
2012.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070392000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070392000093">I
apologise that the annual report was later than usual this year. We aim
for publication in January, but opt-in decisions included in the annual
report fall to a wide range of government departments. The late
publication of this year’s report was due to a delay in
finalising data from across Whitehall. We regret this delay and will
aim to ensure that the next annual report is published
promptly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070392000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070392000094">During
the period of the latest annual report, the Government took 35
decisions on UK participation in EU justice and home affairs proposals.
Under the JHA opt-in protocol we opted in to 24 proposals and did not
opt in to eight. The Government took three decisions under the Schengen
protocol, choosing to remain bound in each
case.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070392000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070392000095">As the
Committee will be aware, the Government have stated that we will take
opt-in decisions on a case-by-case basis. We consider factors such as
the impact of the measure on our security, civil liberties, the
integrity of our criminal justice and common law  
<?notus-xml column=452?>systems and on the control of immigration. At the heart of it is a
commitment to focus on the national interest. As such, we will only opt
in where we believe it is in the UK’s interests to do so.
Examples of proposals where we judged UK participation was in the
national interest were the EU-US passenger name records agreement and a
directive on data protection. Both of these agreements promise to
assist law enforcement authorities in combating serious crime, while
including all the necessary data protection
safeguards.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070392000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070392000096">Conversely<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T17:57:01"></hs_TimeCode>,
the Government decided not to opt in to a proposed directive on the
freezing and confiscation of proceeds of crime. While we were
sympathetic with the aims of this proposal, we had concerns that the
published text posed risks to the UK’s domestic
non-conviction-based confiscation regime, and therefore felt that it
was too risky to opt in prior to negotiations, given that we would then
be bound by the final text, once adopted. The Government also decided
not to participate in the internal security fund regulation due to
concerns over value for money.
Despite<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-03T17:57:43"></hs_TimeCode> our
decisions in these latter cases, I note that the Government have taken
an active role in both of these negotiations and will consider
participation post-adoption should our negotiating objectives be
met.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070392000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070392000097">The
Government have been clear that we want Parliament to play an important
role. For this reason, we have further strengthened the role of
Parliament in scrutinising opt-in decisions. My noble friend Lord
Howell of Guildford’s Written Ministerial Statement of 21
January 2011 pledged to give Parliament as much opportunity as possible
to comment on and influence future opt-in decisions. Under these new
arrangements, we have committed to the setting aside of government time
for a debate on opt-in decisions where there is a particularly strong
parliamentary interest. The Government must also now report each opt-in
decision to Parliament by a Written or, where appropriate, an oral
Ministerial Statement. This procedure is now well
practised.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070392000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070392000098">The
commitments included in that Statement, to give Parliament more of a
say in opt-in decisions, are something which the Government take very
seriously. I emphasise to the Grand Committee that we are keenly aware
of the essential need to make these new arrangements work on a
practical level. To this end, noble Lords will be aware that following
extensive consultation with interested parties, including our own
European Union Committee, the Government have recently finalised an
internal code of practice. Through the code we hope to reach and

Corston:</Member></B> My Lords, it is a pleasure to follow the
Minister. I welcome this third report on the application of the
arrangements concerning the United Kingdom’s participation in
European Union legislation in the field of justice and home affairs,
the so-called opt-in arrangements. I am pleased that the report fulfils
the present Government’s commitment in the interests of
transparency and accountability introduced by the noble Baroness, Lady
Ashton of Upholland,  in the previous Government. As the
Minister has acknowledged, it was something of a pity that it was
published late, and I am sure that we all accept his apologies. I
understand that there were difficulties this year in finalising the
annexe, but that is likely to be a recurring problem for which the
departments must plan ahead. My committee hopes very much that next
year’s report will be published early in 2014.</hs_para>

the chair of the European Union’s Sub-committee on Justice,
Institutions and Consumer Protection, I have followed closely the
Government’s approach to European Union proposals. The
sub-committee has scrutinised a range of proposals in the justice field
since the UK’s opt-in arrangements have applied to the area of
justice and home affairs, and I think that the Government’s
case-by-case approach is the right one. In the civil justice area, like
the Government, we have been cautious and particularly mindful of the
principle of subsidiarity because of the potential effects of the
proposed measures on UK legal systems, particularly on our law of
property and the implications for the laws of inheritance in other
jurisdictions. For example, we recommended that the UK should not opt
in to a proposal which would lay down common rules on the choice of
national court and law to apply where a deceased person had property in
more than one member state.</hs_para>

unable to support, at any rate in its current form, the proposal for a
common European sales law, despite its laudable objective of improving
the operation of the single market. This would introduce an additional,
albeit optional, law of contract for consumer transactions. Our concern
is that its potential to introduce legal uncertainty and confusion
among consumers would outweigh the expected benefits. We have suggested
that the Commission would be wise to adopt generally, in the civil
justice area, a cautious step-by-step
approach.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070392000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070392000104">In
the field of criminal justice, the EU has taken that kind of approach,
implementing two so-called road maps which set out specific measures
agreed by the Council of Ministers. We have recommended that the
Government should opt in to all these measures apart from one on the
right of access to a lawyer in criminal proceedings. We agree that the
right of a suspect or defendant to legal advice is a vital part of the
legal process, but we consider that the original proposal did not
strike the right balance between the 
<?notus-xml column=454?>rights of suspects and defendants on the one hand and the ability of law
enforcement authorities to investigate and prosecute offences on the
other. For the future, we have suggested that before the EU embarks on
further measures in the criminal justice field, it first completes the
road maps and then leaves time for a proper evaluation of the effects
of the legislation. Any exceptions should require particularly strong
justification.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070392000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070392000105">Relatively
few proposals subject to the opt-in fell within the remit of my
sub-committee during the period covered by the report we are
discussing. On the whole, the committee agreed with the
Government’s approach to the proposals that have come before us.
The single exception this year concerns the justice programme, where we
differed on whether it offered good value for
money.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070392000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070392000106">Finally,
I, too, welcome the code of practice for the guidance of government
departments on handling proposals which are subject to the opt-in
procedure, which should ensure that the scrutiny committees can
undertake their work within the strict time limits imposed by the
treaties because committees deserve and need the time properly to
fulfil that
obligation.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13070392000181" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070392000181">6.05

Taverne:</Member></B> My Lords, my main concern so far  is on
the block opt-out. I could never see any real justification for this,
and my feelings were strongly confirmed by the report of the House of
Lords committee. Therefore, I thought I would look at the way in which
the Government have approached the pre-2013 opt-outs and opt-ins and
the ones now up for consideration. Like other speakers, I very much
welcome the report as the proposals appear to be extremely pragmatic
and the relevant cases are judged on their
merits.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070392000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070392000108">I wish
to cite a few examples on which I have concerns. The proposal at page
14 of the report for a directive on criminal sanctions for insider
dealing and market manipulation is welcome in principle. However, the
Government very sensibly say that they want to see how it works out and
will participate fully in the negotiations to enable the proposal to be
better progressed. That seems to me a very sensible, practical
proposal, and I am surprised that that attitude was not taken on the
European arrest warrant, the merits of which appear to be extremely
plain. The obvious way in which to influence these proceedings is to
take part in the negotiations and see how they can be
improved.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070392000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070392000109">I

seems that the Government’s attitude has changed during the
course of the negotiations between the coalition partners whereby a
much more pragmatic mood has been created, but it would be absurd if we
were not to remain members of Europol. We have the president of Europol
and the college here in Britain, which brings in a considerable income.
Obviously, the proposals depend on us remaining part of
Europol.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13070392000113" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070392000113">I am

them entirely on their merits. I end by saying that I hope that this
new mood of pragmatism, a mood that has always been there in particular
areas, will prevail and that in the end we will find that we are full,

issues.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13070392000115" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070392000115">Be it
far from me to suggest that the issues are easy to grasp at first
instance and, to be frank, I would not recommend them to a novice
member of my committee who had never been to one of these debates
because it is not the easiest territory on which to start. However, we
should remember as a committee that this subject reflects the real
interests, welfare and, in certain cases, security of our citizens. It
is important that we get it right. I am heartened by the way in which
the Minister presented his case in terms of looking at the issues and
making decisions on their merits. I say, with respect, that that is the
way in which our sub-committees have tended to produce their reports,
even on occasions when their conclusions have differed from those of
the Government—or perhaps have not been confirmed by government
until a later
stage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070392000116" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070392000116">Inevitably
because of those comments, my emphasis will be on aspects of the
process. I have to offer some praise to the Government and some blame,
too—alternatively, as it were. We certainly all welcome the fact
that this report is being debated approximately two months after its
publication. That is in line with the request made by the committee
during the debate on the first annual report in 2011. I am delighted to
see the noble Lord, Lord Roper, attending this debate, and he will
remember that request. So far, so good but, as the Minister wisely
confessed to the Committee, it is regrettable that this, the third
annual report, was published 
<?notus-xml column=456?>nearly four months late, although its two predecessors were bang on time
and both came out in January. The importance of timeliness should be
emphasised by the Minister in rallying the outlying departments that
have to be consulted on these matters. I hope that he can give an
assurance that unless some great disaster intervenes, the fourth annual
report will be published on time in January next year. There is a
related issue to this and it would be helpful if the Minister could
clarify how the report’s delayed publication will impact on the

the subject of complaint, we also note that two of the opt-in decisions
listed in Annexe 1, which is a very helpful annexe, cited incorrect
legal bases. These have been subsequently corrected in correspondence
with the European Scrutiny Committee in another place. Mistakes happen,
of course, but we trust the Government will ensure that such errors are
not repeated in the next annual
report.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070392000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070392000118">To
turn to the positive, we, too, welcome the recent publication of the
Government’s code of practice on scrutiny of opt-in and Schengen
opt-out decisions. This is for the attention of all government
departments to ensure that the views of Parliament are taken into
account. I thank our officials in the Select Committee for their input
to that process which has been mutually beneficial.</hs_para>

suppose, the most important legal crux, but, again, not a particularly
immediately obvious one, there is a consistent implication from the
Government that the UK opt-in will apply to proposals which include
justice and home affairs elements, despite not citing a Title 5 legal
base, which is the normal legal basis for a justice and home affairs
proposal. The Select Committee of this House and the European Union
Scrutiny Committee in the other place have had little sympathy for this
approach in the past. We suggest that it tends to fall on deaf ears in
the Commission and Council. Perhaps the Minister will indicate to this
Committee whether the legal base of a new European Union committee has
ever been amended as a result of the Government’s approach in
this regard and what the current Commission and Council position is on
this
matter.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070392000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070392000120">Turning
to slightly more substantial matters, the report notes that
negotiations continue on a number of proposals where although the
United Kingdom Government did not opt in during the initial three-month
period, it remains their objective to seek to amend the text in a way
that will allow the United Kingdom to exercise its right to opt in to
the proposal after it has been adopted across the board. This situation
applies to the directive on the freezing and confiscation of the
proceeds of crime and the directive on the right of access to a lawyer.
I think we all have some sympathy with doing this; the question is
whether an acceptable outcome can be achieved. I would be grateful if
the Minister could provide an update regarding what progress has been
made in relation to both these proposals, including the likelihood of
post-adoption opt-ins by the Government.</hs_para>

Minister’s report refers to the proposed Europol regulation as a
“forthcoming dossier”. Owing to the delay, the proposal
was published very shortly afterwards. We acted fairly quickly in our
Sub-Committee F report regarding the measure, which recommended that
the United Kingdom should opt in. It was debated and endorsed by this
House on 1 July. We note that the Government must reach a decision in
response to that by 30 July, which will take the views of both Houses
into account. We look forward to receiving notification of that
decision, presumably before the other place goes into recess on 18
July. There is not much time for that, but it is important to know
where we are.</hs_para>

might call the elephant in the room, which is the United
Kingdom’s opt-out decision to be taken on the existing or
pre-existing measures in 2014. The report correctly notes that this is
a separate issue as it concerns the pre-Lisbon measures, but it is
relevant in the context of this debate. All the post-Lisbon measures
that the United Kingdom has chosen to participate in are listed in the
report. It is worth recording that the average participation by the
United Kingdom Government in these post-Lisbon measures varies, but is
somewhere between 70% and 80%, so the significant majority are
acceptable to the Government on consideration, although in certain
cases, including the two I have referred to, it may take time, and it
may take more than the three months to reach an acceptable decision. We
would feel better late than never, if I may put it like that in
shorthand.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070392000123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070392000123">Granted
that all the post-Lisbon measures involve the jurisdiction of the Court
of Justice of the European Union, we wonder about the Government citing
concerns about this jurisdiction as one of the reasons for exercising
their opt-out in relation to the pre-Lisbon measures that I have
mentioned, which they suggest were not drafted with the court’s
jurisdiction in mind. In the report that our joint sub-committees have
issued on the opt-out report in relation to Protocol 36, this
suggestion was considered and rejected. We therefore look forward to a
further announcement on the opt-out, which we understand is now
imminent.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070392000124" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070392000124">It
would be fair to say, in summary, that although we are not in any sense
ideologically in favour of always acceding to justice and home affairs
measures, and have aligned ourselves on a number of occasions with the
Government in not doing so, we are broadly sympathetic to the approach
where we can do so. We hope that the Government will wish to consider
the Protocol 36 decisions sympathetically and provide a good portfolio
of responses in due
course.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-03?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_03_PT_1/81A4E8F1EE27790D0EB60C5DCB522F4DBB2093C0" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 3 July 2013">Wednesday,

introducing this debate and express my thanks to all who have
participated with their considerable experience and
knowledge—which I do not mind admitting is somewhat greater than
mine—and not least my noble friend Lady Corston, who explained
the work and views of her committee on certain key issues and referred
to the code of practice. From current personal experience, I certainly
share the view of the noble Lord, Lord Boswell of Aynho, on the
difficulty of getting to grips with the detail of this

this is the third annual report to Parliament on the application of
Protocols 19 and 21 on the Schengen opt-out and justice and home
affairs opt-in respectively. Once again, the reports arise from the
previous Government’s commitment in 2008 to strengthen
parliamentary scrutiny of the justice and home affairs opt-in, part of
which was an undertaking to provide Parliament with and make available
for debate an annual report that both looked ahead to the
Government’s approach to EU justice and home affairs policy and
forthcoming dossiers, including in relation to the opt-in, and provided
a retrospective annual report on the UK’s application of the
opt-in protocol. Annex 1 of the report in front of us sets out all the
JHA opt-in decisions and Schengen opt-out decisions taken from December
2011 until the end of November 2012. Annex 2 outlines legislative
proposals which are expected to be brought forward in the current year
and will require a decision on UK participation under the justice and
home affairs opt-in
protocol.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070392000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070392000127">One
of the legislative proposals mentioned in Annex 2 is the
proposal for a regulation on the European Union Agency for Law
Enforcement Co-operation and Training—Europol—about
which, as has already been noted, we had a debate on Monday in the
context of the European Union Committee’s report on the UK
opt-in to the Europol regulation. At the end of the debate, the House
agreed with the committee’s recommendation that the Government
should exercise their right to take part in the adoption and
application of the proposed regulation. Whether that will have any
impact on the Government’s decision remains to be seen, since it
is not unknown for internal party considerations to play a part in
determining this Government’s approach to any matters European.
The Minister told us on Monday that the decision on whether to opt in
to the Europol regulation was “finely balanced”. Can he
say which of our law enforcement agencies feel that we should not opt
in to the regulation?</hs_para>

2 sets out a number of other proposed measures. Any specific update
from the Minister on the situation in respect of some or all of those
proposals would be helpful, in particular on whether any decisions have
actually been taken. My noble friend Lady Smith of Basildon asked him,
in the debate on the Europol regulation on Monday, how many measures
were awaiting an opt-in decision by the Government and whether any have
been delayed because of the decisions regarding the opt-out, to which
reference has already been
made.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070392000129" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070392000129">There is
one other issue I would like to raise from what was said on Monday. If
memory serves me right, it was the noble Lord, Lord Hannay of Chiswick,
who referred to a European surveillance order in which the Government
do not have an opt-in or opt-out. They have simply failed to implement
a piece of European legislation that they agreed to and which came into
force throughout the European Union in December last year. What is the
Government’s position on that order, which provides the
possibility for someone who is subject to a European arrest warrant to
be bailed in their own
country?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070392000130" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070392000130">The
Government have sought to argue in this  report that decisions
taken in relation to the JHA opt-in and Schengen opt-out protocols are
separate 
<?notus-xml column=459?>from the 2014 opt-out decision under Protocol 36 to the European Union
treaties. However, that argument does not really hold water. As was
pointed out in Monday’s debate, if the measure is a police and
criminal justice measure that was adopted before the Lisbon treaty
entered into force in 2009, deciding to opt in to that measure or a
variation of it, or deciding not to opt in to a variation of it but to
seek to influence it from the outside, would be completely nullified if
we then decided to opt out of all those measures under Protocol 36.
Perhaps the Minister will tell us which of the measures on which
decisions were made to opt in between 1 December 2011 and 30 November
2012 as set out in Annexe 1 of the annual report would cease to apply
to the UK if we made an opt-out decision under Protocol 36. Likewise,
if we decided to opt in to all the proposals in Annex 2, or not opt in
but seek to influence them from the outside, which of those measures
would cease to apply to the UK if we made an opt-out decision under
Protocol 36? If the Government decided to opt out under Protocol 36, no
one knows which measures, including the European arrest warrant, we
could subsequently get agreement to opt back in to or, if we could, on
what basis or terms. All 130 measures were agreed by unanimity under a
system where the UK had the veto, and not a single one of them was
foisted on the UK against our
will.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070392000131" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070392000131">The
noble Lord, Lord Boswell of Aynho, referred to the Europol regulation.
I know it is only two days after the Minister was asked about it on
Monday, but can he now clarify the Government’s position,
including when the debate on the government Motion on the decision on
the Europol regulation, postponed from today, will take
place?</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13070392000132" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070392000132">I
shall conclude with a few specific questions on the report. On page 26,
the Government have not opted out of parts of Schengen, such as the
Schengen information system second generation. I understand that we
will be connected in the fourth quarter of 2014. If we exercise the
block opt-out, we will be leaving all pre-Lisbon parts of the Schengen
acquis. What does that mean as far as the decision not to opt out of
the Schengen information system second generation is concerned? On page
6, reference is made to the directive on the protection of the
financial interests of the EU against fraud by means of criminal law.
The report says that the Treasury will provide an update as soon as
possible. If that has not already happened, when is it likely to
happen?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070392000133" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070392000133">Page
10 refers to the trade agreement between the EU and Colombia and Peru.
I am genuinely not entirely sure what the current position is. Has that
agreement been concluded? Was there an undertaking, as has been
suggested to me, by the Government that there would be a vote in both
Houses on the trade agreement between the EU and Colombia and Peru?
Page 13 refers to passenger name record sharing with the USA to which
the Minister referred in his opening comments. How is that operating
and how effective is it proving to be? Page 16 refers to the asylum and
migration fund. How would this be affected if we exercised the blanket
opt-out? How much of an effect would an opt-out have on the
UKBA’s resettlement activities?</hs_para>

to the confiscation of the proceeds of crime in the EU; once again, the
Minister referred to this issue in his opening speech. Have any
problems arisen subsequently as a result of not opting in? I appreciate
that the Minister is unlikely to have all the information immediately
to hand to respond to my detailed points; I mean that—I would be
amazed if he did. However, I would nevertheless appreciate a response
at not too late a
stage.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-03?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_03_PT_1/39A033D93826BD662399D251FAAA998B461F99B4" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 3 July 2013">Wednesday,

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> My Lords, this has been a good debate.
I would love to be able to amaze the noble Lord, Lord Rosser. I will do
my best, but he is quite right in assuming that some of the questions
are quite detailed. However, I am becoming more informed every minute,
as the noble Lord can see, which is a very helpful support. I think
that the noble Lord and I start off as relative novices in this
esoteric part of the Home Office brief. We bow to the expertise to
which we have had the opportunity of listening. However, I have found
in the briefings which I have had that this is a fascinating and
important area of government with real effects on how the Government
operate and on the lives of the citizens of our country.</hs_para>

fully committed to engaging with Parliament on European Union issues
and on the opt-in in particular. As such, the debate has been useful.
Indeed, as noble Lords have mentioned, this is the second time this
week we have considered the implications of this. This is a more
general debate; we had a specific debate on Europol on the Floor of the
House on Monday. This shows the seriousness with which the Government
take these matters. During the period of this report, your Lordships
have debated two other decisions on UK participation in EU measures:
one on data protection and the other on the confiscation of criminal
assets.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13070392000138" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070392000138">I
will commence by going through points that noble Lords have made. I am
grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Corston, for her contribution. She
started off with a modest reprimand which was reinforced by the noble

plans and do not want this to happen again. We will be providing a

rightly asked that the committee be given enough time to consider our
proposals. The committee exists to scrutinise, and we want to
facilitate that. That is the intention of the code of practice. We are
conscious of the time constraints on the committee and, indeed,
sometimes on the process in which we are engaged. We will seek to keep
the committee informed of what is in development, as well as providing

regretted our decision not to opt in to the justice programme. My noble
friend Lord Taverne also expressed concerns about this. We have 
<?notus-xml column=461?>said that we will consider seeking to opt in after it is agreed, if
there is evidence to show that it is worth while. We take note of what

mentioned the committee’s advice on civil and criminal measures.
I completely agree with her about the measure concerning the estate of
a deceased person and the directive on access to lawyers. Certainly,
there needs to be a cautious approach in both cases because of civil
and criminal law. On the question of a common European sales law, I
agree it risks causing some legal uncertainly. However, the opt-in does
not apply to the measure since it has been brought forward only as an
internal market measure not as a justice
measure.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070392000143" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070392000143">My
noble friend Lord Taverne wanted more detail on the reasons for the
decision not to opt in to the internal security fund. The sums involved
are still unclear as discussions on the EU budget remain under
negotiation. However, we have committed to review the decision
post-adoption and will consult Parliament then. He asked also why the
merger of Europol and CEPOL is not a good thing. Noble Lords who were
present at the debate on Monday evening will have heard me explain the
Government’s position on this measure. We are concerned that by
combining the two we are going to dilute the core functions of Europol.
We do not believe that is in our
interests.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070392000144" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-gc0001.htm#13070392000144">The
noble Lord, Lord Boswell, asked what was happening to our mid-year
reports. Given this report was presented late, will our mid-year report
be late? We plan to send it to the committee this month. We are
catching up, and I hope we will continue to be on time in the future.
The noble Lord—I keep thinking of him as my noble friend but
given his now exalted position I have to reduce my friendship with him
as we need to be at arm’s length and it is difficult to
do—asked whether the Government’s position on the
interpretation of the opt-in had changed. The Government believe that
any measure including substantial JHA content triggers the opt-in
protocol irrespective of whether it has been categorised as a JHA
measure by the EU by, as he says, the citation of a JHA legal base. We
often assert that the opt-in applies to measures that are predominantly
non-JHA but which include a binding JHA content. That is what is
determining policy. The Government have not changed their position in
that regard, but it is very important to emphasise that it is the
binding JHA content that triggers the opt-in procedure.</hs_para>

asked about the inaccuracies that had crept into the annual report in
the matter of legal bases. There was an administrative error in
relation to the correct legal bases. The Secretary of State wrote to
the chair to explain that the correct bases for the

noble Lord also asked whether we had ever successfully negotiated a
change of legal base. We have done so in the case of a directive on
road transport offences, which secured unanimity in the Council to
change the transport legal base to a JHA legal base on police
co-operation. We did not, in fact, opt into that measure.</hs_para>

noble Lord, Lord Rosser, asked about the question asked by his noble
friend Lady Smith of Basildon in the Europol debate about opt-in
decisions pending. I had hoped that the noble Lord would ask about that
because I can place this on record and save myself a stamp. Among
others, we have opt-in decisions pending on the directive on legal
migration, a co-operation agreement with Indonesia, a mandate for an

debate, the noble Lord asked which law enforcement agencies say that we
should not opt into Europol. The Government are yet to take a decision
on the new Europol regulation and in the decision-making process we
have been consulting a number of law enforcement colleagues, including

noble Lord also asked when the debate will take place. I gave a
commitment that Parliament would be informed of the decision and I have

about the European surveillance order, which I remember the noble Lord,
Lord Hannay, talking about. I asked about that because I could not find
any record of it. I think the reference was to the European supervision
order, but the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, is normally so reliable, I can
understand why the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, followed up on this matter.
However, this measure was agreed under the pre-Lisbon arrangements and
would fall within the Protocol 36 decision. The Government will
determine their approach to implementation when the decision on that
protocol has been made.</hs_para>

which I have a note here was about the measures in Annexe 1 to our

opt-out decision in 2014? I cannot give noble Lords a definitive answer
until we have completed our discussions with the Commission on the
measures that we would intend to rejoin. We regard the legal thresholds
of practical operability and coherence to be a high bar.  I
hope that I have surprised the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, to some degree

future, it is not possible to say what proposals regarding an opt-in
will be brought forward over the remainder of this year. In the report,
we have given an indication of what we expect to happen based on work
programmes, our knowledge of dossiers which are being considered, those
which were carried over from last year and discussions we are having on
an ongoing basis with our European partners. The Government have been
very clear that we will take opt-in decisions on a case-by-case basis,
so noble Lords will understand that it is not appropriate for me to
comment on whether we will opt in to any new proposal that might come
forward in coming months. I can give a commitment that whatever
happens, we hope that the committee will work with us in scrutinising
these matters and we will give Parliament as a whole the opportunity to
be engaged in this important part of democratic scrutiny of European

expect a number of EU measures to emerge that will trigger a European
opt-in decision. Most significant is the new Eurojust regulation which
we expect to be published this month. At the same time, there is likely
to be a proposal for a European public prosecutor. We expect that, as
with the Europol proposal, the Eurojust opt-in decision will be subject
to parliamentary debates in government time. Noble Lords will be aware
that 
<?notus-xml column=464?>the Government have already indicated that we will not participate in
the European public prosecutor. We also anticipate the publication of
proposals on combating money laundering. After long negotiations, it is
possible that an EU-Canada passenger names records agreement will be
signed and concluded triggering opt-in decisions. I understand that the
Ministry of Justice is anticipating proposals on special safeguards in
criminal procedures for vulnerable suspected or accused persons and an
initiative regarding legal aid in criminal proceedings. It is also
possible that new initiatives on e-justice and the law applicable to
contractual and non-contractual obligations will emerge.</hs_para>

usually the case that we expect a number of further opt-in decisions
will fall to other government departments during this period. I assure

today published a White Paper on Reserve Forces, “Reserves in
the Future Force 2020: Valuable and Valued”. The White Paper
sets out our vision for the future of the Reserve Forces following the
consultation I launched last October, and the detail of how we will
make Reserve Service more attractive to individual reservists, their
families and their employers. It also confirms our intention to change
the name of the Territorial Army to the Army Reserve.</hs_para>

vision for the Reserves as part of the “Whole Force”, it
is necessary to make some changes to the Reserve structure and, in some
cases, the basing lay-down. While the Maritime Reserves and Royal
Auxiliary Air Force structures will see only minimal changes, the Army
has had to undertake a fundamental re-design of its Reserve force
structure to deliver the reserve component of the integrated Army
2020.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13070359000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-wms0001.htm#13070359000006">Against
the backdrop of the revised offer to the Reserve Forces set out in the
White Paper, the Army has developed a plan for the structure and basing
of the Army Reserve, consistent with the recommendations of the
Independent Commission’s review of the UK’s Reserve
Forces<Sup>1</Sup> led by General Sir Nicholas Houghton, Vice Chief of
the Defence Staff, in 2011. It follows the July 2012 and March 2013
announcements on Regular Army structure and basing, and completes the
announcements on the Army 2020 design. The plan provides clarification
on the future purpose, roles and locations of Army Reserve units and,
in doing so, generates the level of certainty needed to support the
major recruiting drive we are undertaking to expand the Army Reserve.
The restructuring will have impact across the United Kingdom and to
assist right Hon. and Hon. Members in understanding the effect of these
changes on their constituencies, documents setting out the detail have
been placed in the Library of the House.</hs_para>

Force 2020 design of a fully integrated, trained Army of 112,000,
comprising around 82,000 regular personnel and around 30,000
reservists, with an additional 8,000 reservists in training, the Army
Reserve will need to be restructured. The Territorial Army’s
current structure was put in place in 2007 and based on some 36,500
posts. It was never fully resourced or manned, it is no longer
consistent with Defence policy, and it would not fulfil the roles and
capabilities required of the Army Reserve under Army 2020.</hs_para>

trained strength of the Army Reserve from about
19,000 to 30,000, but at the same time, we will decrease the number of

revised Army Reserve structure of around 30,000 will no longer exist
simply to supplement the Regular Army in times of national conflict
but, as part of an integrated whole force, will be ready and able to
deploy routinely at sub-unit level, and in some circumstances, as
formed units. To deliver this effect, the Regular Army and the Army
Reserve will, for the first time outside of the two world wars, be
fully integrated within a single chain of command. Army Reserve units,
like their Regular counterparts, will be distributed in varying
proportions across the adaptable force brigades, the specialist
brigades forming force troops and, to a lesser extent, the reaction
force brigades. Most importantly, this structure will be properly
resourced both in terms of equipment and training and, as spelled out
in the White Paper, will be enabled by Terms and Conditions of Service
more relevant to the future requirements of Reserve service.</hs_para>

ensure that formed Reserve units and sub-units can operate effectively
alongside their Regular counterparts, Regular and Reserve units will be
formally paired. Pairing will optimise the use of training and
equipment resources, increase the capability of the integrated force,
and will ensure force elements are available at appropriate readiness
to deliver the Army’s outputs to Defence. While the majority of
Army Reserve units will be at lower readiness than Regular units, the
investment planned over the coming years will broadly align the

re-balance the Army Reserve structure have been based on military
judgement taking account of the capabilities required from the Reserves
in the integrated Army, the need to achieve full manning by 2018, and
the greater efficiencies in training and equipment resulting from
formal pairing between Regular and Reserve units. While some of the
changes may be unwelcome by the units affected by them, they are
necessary to deliver the effective, modern and integrated Army Reserve

changes will involve the re-roling of some units, the raising of new
units and the withdrawal of others from the Army Order of Battle. The
capabilities which will make up the future Army Reserve will be
different from today, and this change will also be reflected in the
number of units and sub-units held under each cap-badge. The current
Territorial Army structure supports 71 major units; overall it will
reduce to 68 major units in the future
structure:</hs_para><hs_WAIndent>Nine major units will be withdrawn,

the Royal Mercian and Lancastrian Yeomanry, none of these decisions
involves a cap-badge change. The Regimental HQ of the Royal Mercian and
Lancastrian Yeomanry will move to Edinburgh where it will be closer to
its paired Regular unit, The Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, which will be
based at Leuchars. It will assume command of existing Yeomanry
sub-units across Scotland and Northern Ireland. To better reflect its
new geographical focus, it is planned to re-name this Headquarters;
‘The Scottish and North Irish Yeomanry’. A, C and D
Squadrons of the RMLY will remain in their current geographical
locations (respectively Dudley, Chester and Wigan), but will come under
command of other Yeomanry regiment headquarters, improving their
ability to train effectively, and draw on support from their formal
pairing with Regular units; a troop will also remain in Telford, which
will be subordinated to A Squadron in Dudley. We expect that those
Squadrons will carry the RMLY cap-badge preserving it for the future,
in addition to the antecedents they currently carry.</hs_para>

currently occupies 334 individual sites around the United Kingdom,
including a number of locations with small detachments of fewer than 30
personnel—the approximate size of an infantry platoon. 
<?notus-xml column=76?>Some of these sites are seriously under-recruited. To
maximise the potential for future recruitment, and
particularly to capitalise on existing areas of specialist skills in
the national workforce, the Army has determined that it should increase
and rationalise the presence of the Army Reserve in urban areas, by
merging small, and/or poorly recruited sub-units, into larger sites
already occupied by other units in local or neighbouring communities.
As well as improving recruitment opportunities the greater
concentration of Reserve units in fewer locations, and their increased
proximity to their paired Regular units, will enable more effective use
to be made of manpower, infrastructure and equipment. As part of this
exercise, the Army Reserve will open or re-open nine additional Reserve
sites.</hs_para>

be delivering a focussed recruiting drive over the next couple of
years, we have decided to retain a significant number of small and
under-recruited sites, where long term viability is considered
possible. The units on those sites will be challenged to recruit up to
strength in the years ahead. From 2016, the Army’s Regional
Chain of Command will gradually rationalise and consolidate any sites
which remain persistently and seriously under-recruited and/or unable
to generate effective Army capability.</hs_para>

being announced today will result in the net vacation of 26 Army

undertaken to better define how those sites being vacated by the Army
Reserve will be managed in the future and how retained sites will be
improved and expanded where they are required to accommodate larger
numbers following consolidation of Army Reserve units. We expect to
invest around £80 million in improvements and expansion across
the Army Reserve estate, as part of a £120 million overall
investment in Reserve Estate.</hs_para>

the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) undertook a thorough and comprehensive
scientific review which focused on the medical and social harms of khat
consumption. The ACMD report gives considerable insight into the
complexity of this matter and, based on the available evidence, it came
to a reasonable conclusion in its recommendation to Government.
Although it recommended that khat should not be controlled, the ACMD
acknowledges that there is an absence of robust evidence in a number of
areas and that there are broader factors for the Government to consider
when making its decision. The decision to bring khat under control is
finely balanced and takes into account the expert scientific advice and
these broader concerns.</hs_para>

Europe—most recently the Netherlands—and the majority of
other EU member states have controlled khat, as well as most of the G8
countries including Canada and the USA. In all these cases
khat’s exportation, importation, supply and its possession or
use has been banned. Failure to take decisive action and change the
UK’s legislative position on khat would place the UK at a
serious risk of becoming a single, regional hub for the illegal onward
trafficking of khat to these countries. Seizures of khat transiting the
UK en route to the Netherlands have already been increasing in size and
frequency since the Dutch ban earlier this year. The ACMD report
recognised the likelihood that some khat is being re-exported to
countries where it is illegal. The ACMD could not determine the scale
of this activity based on the available evidence and acknowledged that
this concern forms part of Government consideration of the
matter.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13070359000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-wms0001.htm#13070359000028">Khat
continues to feature prominently amongst the health and social harms,
such as low attainment and family breakdown, cited by affected
communities and the police and local authorities working with them. The
ACMD acknowledged that there was insufficient evidence to enable the

and Environment Agency (EA) navigations. I said that there would be a
phased approach to the delivery of this vision. In phase 1, the
functions, 
<?notus-xml column=82?>liabilities and assets of British Waterways in England and Wales would
transfer into a new charity and that in phase 2, the EA navigations
would transfer in 2015/16. I made clear that the transfer would only
take place if sufficient funding could be found in the next Spending
Review to enable the charity to take on the liabilities associated with
EA’s navigations, and that a transfer would be subject to the
agreement of the charity’s Trustees.</hs_para>

Waterways’ functions, assets and liabilities in England and
Wales were transferred to the Canal &amp; River Trust on 2 July 2012.
This was a great achievement which has been widely welcomed and has

remains challenging and as a result Defra must identify additional
savings in 2015/16 to help deal with the deficit. Initial scoping work
on transfer costs which was undertaken during the New Waterways Charity
Project indicates that the transfer of EA navigations is unlikely to be
affordable in the current climate. The Government has therefore decided
that the Review planned for 2013/14 to consider options for the
transfer will be postponed until Defra’s finances improve and
there is a realistic prospect of the transfer being affordable and that
it can take place on terms which would enable CRT’s Trustees to
manage the additional liabilities
involved.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070359000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130703-wms0001.htm#13070359000062">I
realise that this decision will come as a disappointment to all those
with an interest in our inland waterways who share the
Government’s view that a transfer to CRT offers the most
sustainable long-term future for EA’s navigations. The
Government, however, remains fully committed to transferring the EA
navigations when the economic circumstances allow us to do  so.
The Government will review the position after  the next
Spending Period and will make a further announcement at that time on
the timing of the
transfer.</hs_para></Body></Fragment></System><System type="Writtens" ColStart="211"><?date 2013-07-03?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_03_PT_1/F8332B483D82B5D44821CC8203DC530E6BA7F04E" __version__="1.2"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="3 July 2013">Wednesday

procedures to be non-discriminatory and for individuals to be able to

finding a peaceful solution and applaud recent steps taken by all
parties to move the process forward. A peaceful resolution to the
Kurdish issue would significantly enhance the stability and prosperity
of Turkey and the wider region. We have shared lessons learned from the
UK’s experience in Northern Ireland with senior Turkish
Ministers, politicians and officials, and are ready to lend further
assistance if asked. The withdrawal of the Kurdistan Workers’
Party (PKK) militants from south-east Turkey is an important
contribution to a political settlement of the Kurdish
