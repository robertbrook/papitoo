This will diminish over time as the Afghans increasingly work
independently. In addition, we will retain sufficient force numbers to
ensure that we properly protect our adviser footprint after 2014. Until
NATO planning has matured, it is premature to speculate what other

Although I fully support the withdrawal of combat troops after 2014, I
can understand the Government’s reluctance to be absolutely
precise about the numbers remaining thereafter. However, does he accept
that the new, large Afghan army will still be short of a
number of military facilities, such as close air support, fuel and food
delivery, and medevac? If we are to ensure that the sacrifices of our
soldiers are not in vain, will the Government ensure that we help the

the noble Lord for his support for our moves post-2014. We are fully
aware of the issue of enabling support to the ANSF. Last year, this
priority switched from growing the forces to professionalising and
developing their ability to support themselves post-2014 as ISAF draws
down. In addition to taking the coalition lead in supporting the
officer academy, the UK will maintain its current development
assistance of £178 million a year until 2017, and we
will also contribute £70 million a year until at least 2017

Astor of Hever:</Member></B> My Lords, leaving medical equipment in
Afghanistan is being discussed at the moment and no decision has been
taken on that. By the end of 2013, the ANSF are due to have developed
sufficient medical capabilities to take over responsibility for dealing
with their own casualties with non-life-threatening injuries, known as
category B casualties. By the end of 2014 they will take over
responsibility for all their casualties, including the most serious
types of injuries. ISAF continues to monitor ANSF progress towards an
independent medical capability, and the UK is supporting it to deliver
surgical capability in Helmand through the provision of medical
advisors to Afghan medical
personnel<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T15:10:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071765000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0001.htm#13071765000007"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Coussins" PimsId="5193" UID="13071765000260" xid="1949" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0001.htm#13071765000260">Baroness

visiting our troops in Helmand will have realised the great
appreciation shown by the Afghan army for the British troops and the
way that they are being trained. Currently, a Select Committee in this
House is examining soft power, and soft power includes the military
influence in training and spreading the British influence into other
countries. I know that we are talking about the officers’
training academy, but are there intentions to carry on lower-level
training, which does so much to increase our influence in Afghanistan

about how much the ANSF appreciate the work we are doing to mentor
them. I saw that for myself when I was last in Afghanistan
and talked to a number of Afghans who are hugely appreciative of what
we are doing. As the Prime Minister has said, the UK has played a very
big part in the ISAF military campaign but we have also played a very
high price. It is therefore right to focus on the officer academy,
which is the one thing we have been asked to do by the Afghans, rather
than looking for ways to go beyond
that.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-17?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_17_PT_1/9A2BEB7C07CFF8EF0A160A69EAA9DF0F28030C41" __version__="1.11"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 17 July 2013">Wednesday,

of the proposed public forest estate management organisation will be
inclusive, taking into account the views of users and community groups
such as my own HOOF, which are instrumental in safeguarding our public
forests and understand every aspect of our forests, including the
commercial aspects? The Minister may say that they will be among the
guardians, but I firmly believe that they must also have a voice and a
vote on the board. I understand that the consultation on the new

in there. I can assure the noble Baroness that stakeholders will be
comprehensively involved in the process. She refers to HOOF; to dispel
some misunderstanding, it is worth saying that, far from reviving the
spectre of privatisation, or placing Ministers in total control of our
forests, as has been suggested, our proposals involve the legal
transferral of ownership of the entire estate from Ministers to a new
operationally independent public body. I say to the noble Baroness that
there is some misunderstanding; if it would be helpful to her, I would

develop a UK plant health risk register and provide strategic and

number of other courses of action, including developing and
implementing procedures for preparedness and contingency planning to
predict, monitor and control the spread of pests and diseases. We have
accepted both of these recommendations and are making progress on them.

released. Can he confirm that whole-life prisoners had always been
entitled under our law to a review after 25 years until they lost that
right in 2003, it seems almost as a result of an oversight? Will he
therefore ensure that the right to a review after 25 years is restored

possibility of a review, as in many other countries. Is this not a very

Lord, and I think that both interventions have helped to clarify
something that is not necessarily clear in coverage by the media. This
judgment did not say that anybody should be released immediately or
that whole-life tariffs may not be imposed, but it did say that
we should look at such sentences in the light of what was
described as penological purpose—punishment,
rehabilitation and prevention. The court held that the
system in England and Wales, which provides only for compassionate
release, was not sufficient.</hs_para>

Committee, many noble Lords expressed concern at the close working with
the insurance industry that this Bill has necessitated. The noble
Baroness, Lady Masham, expressed particular concern that the
appointment of a scheme administrator was already a done deal with
insurers. I offer my assurance that this is not the case and that we
intend to run an open competition for the contract of scheme
administrator, which will be chosen through the open tender process
according to our commercial criteria. I hope this reassures noble
Lords<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T15:40:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071765000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0001.htm#13071765000076">Turning
to the issue of poor record-keeping practice in the industry, I think
we all agree that we must work not only to support those who have
fallen foul of poor record-keeping and tracing in the insurance
industry but to correct it and stop it happening in the future. The
creation of the Employers’ Liability Tracing
Office—ELTO—was a step in the right direction, but there
are still insurers that are not tracing as they should be. Since we
last met, I have had a very positive meeting with the Financial Conduct
Authority. I have since received a very informative letter from the
FCA. I found the following extract particularly
positive:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13071765000208" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0001.htm#13071765000208">“We
are further strengthening our existing rules with new requirements for
firms to have effective processes for conducting tracing searches for
historical policies upon receipt of a request from a consumer or a
consumer’s representative. These new rules will become effective
from 4 December 2013. We therefore expect any firms that do not
currently have adequate tracing mechanisms in place to develop them in
advance of that
date”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="13071765000200" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0001.htm#13071765000200">In
brief, if an insurer is expelled from ELTO for not tracing as it should
or the FCA receives other intelligence suggesting poor or non-existent
tracing, this will serve as an immediate red flag to the FCA. It will
then put into place its enforcement action, which can include a
supervision visit from the

also look to gather market intelligence to assist us in taking a

issue that we discussed in Committee was the establishment of an
oversight committee. We welcome this proposal and have been exploring
with stakeholders how it might operate. As ever, there is a range of
options that we need to consider, and we continue to do so. We would
prefer a non-legislative solution if possible but we are aware that
noble Lords may wish to see something on a more statutory footing. I
ask noble Lords to consider the issues associated with trying to
establish a new non-departmental public body as we discuss oversight
further.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13071765000230" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0001.htm#13071765000230">3.45

issue that rightly received significant attention in Committee was that
of the rate of payments to be made. Perhaps it will help if I outline
how we have arrived at where we are on this matter. Insurers have made
it clear that paying an amount equal to 3% of employer’s
liability gross written premiums is affordable, to the extent that they
should not then need to pass these costs on to employers. The costs of
the scheme in the first few years will be higher because all eligible
people diagnosed between 25 July 2012 and the start of the scheme will
be paid alongside people diagnosed at the time—
contemporaneously—so we have introduced a four-year smoothing
period to ease that initial spike in cost.</hs_para>

analysts advised it that paying people 70% of average civil
compensation equates to the 3% of employer’s liability gross
written premiums which they maintain it can absorb, whereas our
analysis shows that the 70% tariff equates to less than 3% of written
premiums. This is because the ABI’s analysts and our own
forecasts on numbers of applicants coming to the scheme also differ,
and we have been unable to reconcile these discrepancies. I should
mention at this point that when we refer to a percentage of average
civil damages, the figures we are using are those published by the
National Institute of Economic and Social Research. We have already
published an ad hoc statistical report, setting these figures
out.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13071765000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0001.htm#13071765000081">In
Committee, the Government proposed that the scheme should start paying
people at the rate of 70% of average civil compensation. I stated
previously that our intention was that the figures obtained from this
equation will be uprated annually, in line with CPI. In addition, I
have agreed that the amounts of civil compensation in mesothelioma
cases must be current if we are expressing scheme payments as a
percentage of civil compensation. I suggested that a review of the data
every five years would enable meaningful trends to appear, given the
relatively low volume of such cases. 
<?notus-xml column=764?>We will certainly be reviewing the level of civil compensation in
mesothelioma cases on a regular basis and amending scheme payments
accordingly. Nevertheless, I understand noble Lords’ desire to
pay people at a rate higher than 70% of civil compensation.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13071765000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0001.htm#13071765000082">Following the debate in
Committee, I have been in further discussions with insurers and have
been able to secure an agreement to pay 75% of average civil
compensation. This is more than the industry wanted to pay but, using
the government analysts’ figures, it halves the gap in the
percentage of employer’s liability gross written premiums
between what was originally offered and the full 3%. I take this
opportunity to thank noble Lords and to acknowledge that the pressure
in this House on this matter has been a key driving force in achieving
the increased rate. I know that noble Lords would like the scheme to
pay even more than the 75% we have now achieved. However, we need to be
certain that the industry can afford to pay more without passing
disproportionate costs on to employers. The insurance industry
guaranteed to us that if we keep the levy within proportionate limits,
it will not increase premiums. We would need more clarity on the
numbers of applications to and costs of the scheme as a percentage of
gross written premiums.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13071765000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0001.htm#13071765000083">Since we last met, we
have been working on a proposed review process for the scheme, which I
know noble Lords will welcome. I expect to be able to present firm
details of such a process when we take this Bill to the other place
but, for the time being, I will outline my ideas. We intend to look at
the actual number of applications and real costs once the scheme has
been running for long enough to give us reliable data. As I indicated
when we previously discussed increases in average compensation
payments, looking at numbers too soon would not provide us with stable
data, nor would it show us much by way of trends.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13071765000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0001.htm#13071765000084">The initial four-year
costs-smoothing period would give use an ideal opportunity to collect
actual numbers and costs. We would then be able to see what the real
cost of the scheme is, compared to the current expectations about the
percentage of gross written premium it will take up. We would also be
able to assess whether or not costs had been passed on to industry and
to what extent. That would put us in much better position to carefully
consider whether we have set scheme payments at the right level and how
far current actuarial assumptions have been borne out in practice. We
have to be prepared for the fact that the ABI’s analysts may be
nearer the mark here, as we are dealing with behaviours in making
applications to the scheme which are not easy to predict. We also need
to bear in mind that costs to insurers will eventually reduce anyway as
the numbers coming to the scheme will fall as time passes and fewer
people are diagnosed with mesothelioma.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13071765000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0001.htm#13071765000085">To summarise, we intend
that scheme payments will rise in line with CPI each year. In addition,
if the level of civil compensation also changes, we need to look again
at the amount of the scheme payment to see if it should be changed in
line with that of civil compensation. The initial four-year
costs-smoothing period gives us an ideal opportunity to collect actual
numbers and costs and to look at the level of scheme payments in a much
clearer light. It will also give us an opportunity 
<?notus-xml column=765?>to assess any reaction by the insurance industry
that there might have been over the first four-year period.
These proposals show that the current level of scheme payments strikes
the right balance between paying people with mesothelioma and levying
an amount from insurers that will not inevitably be passed on to
employers. I also trust that I have reassured noble Lords that the
Government are committed to considering necessary changes when an
increase is justified.</hs_para>

Government’s intention is to support eligible people suffering
from this terrible disease and to start making payments as
soon as humanly possible. Indeed, timing is paramount. Mesothelioma
deaths are expected to peak in 2015 and we aim to have a scheme in
place by April next year. I ask noble Lords to keep this in mind during
today’s debate. Any delays will affect the very people we are
trying to help. I hope noble Lords will forgive me for taking up time
on these issues but they are critical as we consider the detail of the

permit me to intervene, I do not intend to engage in debate with the

“pre-statement”, for which I thank him. It is consistent
with the attitude that he has shown to this legislation and his
handling of it in the course of our consideration. However, there is

clarity of the drafting of Clause 2 and the interaction of parts of it.
Without going into the detail of that, I have been in discussion and
correspondence with the Bill team, and I am grateful to the Minister
for allowing that to happen. We did not bottom-out our discussions
about the fundamental issue but we revealed a number of things about
the interaction between the draft rules and Clause 2. Before I came
into the Chamber this afternoon, I got an e-mail saying that there was
a recognised tension in relation to the issue of limitation between the
draft rules and the current drafting of Clause 2. If the Minister is
not in a position to say anything about this now, perhaps he will make
time to say something on Report so that it will be on the record and

understand, is not to have ping-pong between the two Houses, because I

done so far on the Bill. It represents an enormous step forward, for
which the House is extremely grateful. The noble Lord, Lord Wigley,
raised a very important point. It is infinitely preferable not to have
to resort to primary legislation in future should changes be necessary
under the review process. If the Minister feels that the Bill is not
adequate in giving powers to the then Secretary of State to introduce
any changes by secondary legislation, will such provisions be
introduced at Third Reading or in the other

there are no further interventions, I will turn to the rather drier
amendments in this group. A number of noble Lords present today tabled
amendments in Committee to require the rules establishing the payment
scheme to be made by statutory instrument rather than having them
simply published by the Secretary of State. The amendments in this
group are aligned with a recommendation of the Delegated Powers and
Regulatory Reform Committee. Again, I acknowledged the concerns behind
these approaches. Today I am pleased to announce that this set of
amendments aims to establish the diffuse mesothelioma payment scheme by
statutory instrument rather than by publication by the Secretary of

made this change, a number of consequential amendments fall to be made
to other clauses, so that previous references to

scheme” instead of “regulations”, I should add
that the combined effect of the amendments will be that where

it will mean the scheme as set up by

for the amount of a scheme payment, for payment amounts to be dependent
on age, and for the division of scheme payments between dependants are
all now to be determined in accordance with scheme regulations. The
same applies to the circumstances in which a person is or is

Avebury:</Member></B> My Lords, I thought it was best to defer my
thanks until after the Minister had completed his remarks on this group
of amendments. I express my warm appreciation for the considerable work
that he has done on the Bill, resulting in his welcome announcement
this afternoon that the payments will increase from 70% to 75% for
civil compensation claims. Although that falls well short of what some
of us had hoped for originally, I have to say it compares with the
estimated £1 billion of cost that would have been paid by the
insurance industry if the employers had not gone out of business and
the employers’ liability insurance policies had not been lost
or, in some cases, possibly deliberately destroyed. That
£1 billion is estimated by the Asbestos Victims
Support Groups Forum UK as the amount that has been forgone over the
years by victims, who have not been able to formulate claims for the
suffering that they endured. At this stage, however, we have to be
grateful and I echo the thanks expressed by others to the Minister for

assumption that that is based on 100% of average civil compensation,

Minister’s opening statement, with which I think he was trying
to be helpful in setting the scene for this. I was also trying to be
helpful by saying what our position is on that. It seems to me that
that is my responsibility at this Dispatch Box on 
<?notus-xml column=769?>behalf of the Opposition. We have tabled an amendment, so we can pick
that up in due course. The key thing for us is whether the levy rate
will be reduced at the end of that four-year period or whether it can
be maintained at its opening level. Obviously that will have beneficial
implications for the rate of payments in due course, but perhaps we
will come to that on some of our later amendments. However, I support
the amendment moved by the

my name to this amendment, so forcefully and ably proposed by my noble
friend Lord Alton. This is an appalling and tragic disease. Although my
specialty was never respiratory medicine, in the course of my
professional career I saw many people suffering from mesothelioma and
recognised to the full its utterly devastating effects. Indeed, one
such person was a professional colleague of mine who was a consultant
neurologist. One of the disease’s most unfortunate features is
that, after exposure to asbestos, particularly blue asbestos, the
incubation period is extraordinarily long. People sometimes do not
develop the disease for many years after exposure. Indeed, I recently
learnt of an 87 year-old man who had developed mesothelioma for the
first time, having worked at the age of 40 as carpenter cutting up
sheets of asbestos. That is one of its appalling features, and its
effects are utterly distressing. It is not a localised cancer that
grows in a single location where a surgeon can remove it; it is a
diffuse involvement of cancerous tissue that grows over the surface of
the lung, between the lung and the chest wall. It gradually begins to
strangulate the lung and eventually causes respiratory failure. It is a

impressive. New researchers from other fields who had never

experience as a doctor, having been involved with a huge number of
different charities funding research over the years, is that the

new scientists into the field for which they have provided funds. One
has to think only of the British Heart Foundation, which has given a

my noble friend said, until this recent initiative by the British Lung

accept that a tiny percentage of the levy which they already lay on
insurance companies for the support of patients with this condition and

that it would provide funds that will attract scientists to work on
that highly intractable problem. The fact that it is intractable is not
an excuse. It deserves more attention, it deserves funding, and this

Selsdon:</Member></B> My Lords, I thought that the
death sentence was cancelled many years ago, but I almost
seem to have heard my own death sentence now. I worked with
asbestos for many years. I picked up Cape blue. Every now and then,
when you get a cough in your throat, you think, “Oh, have I
caught this disease”—I cannot even pronounce
it—“Is there something wrong with me?”. That was
during a period in industry. I came out of the Navy, where
of course we had masses of asbestos protecting ships, in repairs and
elsewhere. I worked with it. It was to some extent a mystical product
because it was the only fire protection kit available.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=775?><hs_para UID="13071765000145" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0001.htm#13071765000145">I then went into
industry because of the new developments. These were the new plastics,
which were suddenly to replace the whole of the construction industry.
I learnt about polyurethane, formaldehyde, polytetrafluoroethylene,
poly this, poly that. I would work on the shop floor without a mask,
because when you are young you do not have a mask, and when sent out to
do roofing materials, lay asbestos cement, cutting and so on, of course
we did not wear heavy boots with protective caps; one wanted to be
flexible. We did not have safety ladders; we slid down the outside.
When I was working on the Blyth Colliery project as a young rep up in
the north, I learnt about mining diseases—silicosis and all
those things that I could not
pronounce.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071765000146" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0001.htm#13071765000146">However,
that was another period of time. Now, quite suddenly—and, I
think, correctly; I have been impressed by what I have heard
today—out of this something has been identified. I have
tremendous regard for what the noble Lord, Lord Alton, does, but it is
the right thing in the wrong place. This Bill is the right one to go
through, and it could have gone through years ago. As I tried to look
at the figures, I suddenly realised that I am even more grateful to
your Lordships’ House because 50 years ago, when I first came
here, I would not have left the asbestos and the plastics world without
having to be in your Lordships’ House. I changed my job and went
into building and industrial research and I have learnt, over many
years, an enormous amount from noble Lords and have great respect for
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071765000147" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0001.htm#13071765000147">I think
that my noble friend Lord Freud and his colleagues have got it right.
The question that I ask is: why was this not done a long, long time
ago? What is being done about all those other historic diseases that
may have come from chemicals of one sort or another? As we have new
research developments, those who develop a particular product never
think of the future. They do not understand what smells and other
things can do. I never wore a mask and now I feel that I am starting to
cough a bit, but I have learnt a trick. In your Lordships’
House, when you stand up to speak, many people need a glass of water or
need to clear their throat. That may lead them to believe that they
have one of these industrial diseases. However, it is strange but there
is a little trick that you can do: wiggle your toes. That gets the
circulation going and stops you having a dry throat and having to look
to the Doorkeepers to ask for
water.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071765000148" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0001.htm#13071765000148">I say
to the noble Lord, Lord Alton, that I will help in any way that I can
to raise money for a research fund and others. I think that the way to
approach it is to look at those who may have had great success in
property development or things of this sort. Located in their
buildings—probably in almost every building in London—are
likely to be unacceptable levels of asbestos. However, the levels are
not unacceptable until you find it. It may be behind every
board. We used to make a product called asbestolux, which was a
fire-proofed, simple board used in all homes instead of plywood, which
was too expensive at that particular
time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071765000149" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0001.htm#13071765000149">Throughout
the land, from our colonies, asbestos, such as the Cape blue asbestos,
is virtually everywhere. The danger is, once you try to move it and
destroy it, 
<?notus-xml column=776?>you create dust and some of the research has not yet managed to identify
how you screen it. Perhaps your Lordships have been in a block where
someone is redeveloping a flat and before you know it, in comes an
enormous team of people with large fans that suck and circulate. You
wonder whether that is taking out some of the micro ingredients that
come with
asbestos.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071765000150" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0001.htm#13071765000150">Obviously,
you will find that in the building trade, people do not necessarily
follow what are called “building regs”. Therefore, many

let us just get on with this Bill and get it through. It can do a lot
of good as it stands. Do not hold it up and I will see what we might be
able to do to encourage some support anywhere else. I am grateful to

letter does not provide what we lawyers call further and better
particulars as to why the Minister believes that the proposal is not

Minister focused on a concern that research funding was the
responsibility of the Department of Health, while this was a
DWP-sponsored Bill. I hope that we will not hear that argument again
today. As a matter of law, of course the Government are indivisible,
and, as a matter of efficiency, government departments talk to each

other reasons, therefore, could there possibly be for the Minister to
suggest that the proposal of the noble Lord, Lord Alton, is not viable?
The Government must be satisfied that Clause 13 of their own Bill is
viable in providing a levy. These amendments simply provide for a
research supplement on this levy, which would be clear as to those who
are obliged to pay, the amount and the purpose. Nor can it be that the
Minister thinks that these amendments do not reach their target. As the
noble Lord, Lord Alton, mentioned, the amendments have been drafted by
Daniel Greenberg, a former parliamentary counsel of distinction, who is
editor of the authoritative work <I>Craies on
Legislation</I>.</hs_para>

could it sensibly be suggested by the Minister that the amendments are
not legally viable because they might be the subject of some legal
challenge under the Human Rights Act or the European Convention on
Human Rights. The Bill contains a levy and there are many other
examples of statutory levies introduced by Parliament to advance good
causes. The noble Lord, Lord Alton, has given a number of examples; 
<?notus-xml column=777?>I mentioned in Grand Committee the levy
on bookmakers under the Betting, Gaming and Lotteries Act 1963 for the
purpose of improving horse racing in this country. If, as Ministers
must believe, the levy in Clause 13 is legally viable and those other
levies are legally viable, I cannot understand why the amended levy of
the noble Lord, Lord Alton, is not equally viable. Any legal
action to challenge an amended clause—amended in the terms of
the noble Lord, Lord Alton—would be a legal action,
to coin a phrase, that is not legally
viable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T16:38:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071765000156" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0001.htm#13071765000156">There
is a vital need for research and research funding to combat this awful

Howarth of Newport:</Member></B> My Lords, I, like all noble
Lords, want to see more research into mesothelioma, above
all into ways to prevent people developing this terrible and lethal
disease. Noble Lords may be aware that quite recently
Russia, leading a group of another six countries —Kazakhstan,
Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan, Zimbabwe, India and Vietnam—blocked a move
to have white asbestos listed under the UN convention that requires
member countries to decide whether or not they should risk importing
that substance. I fear that asbestos-related diseases, including
mesothelioma, will long remain with us; we will need research for the

am entirely sympathetic to the purposes of the noble Lord,
Lord Alton, his co-signatories to the amendment and the larger number
of co-signatories to the letter that they were kind enough to send to
us. I congratulate the noble Lord on his dedication in this matter.
However, I have some difficulties in accepting the precise proposition
of the noble Lord. I have no problem about hypothecating part of the
levy for the purpose of research; I accept that precedents are there in
the Gambling Act, the Betting, Gaming and Lotteries Act and other
measures. I would not presume to take issue with the noble Lord, Lord
Pannick, on the question of viability as he has just expounded it. In

medicine and academic research support the case made by the noble Lord,
Lord Alton, and I applaud them for that.</hs_para>

problem. The insurance industry has told us that it is a willing funder
on the basis that the Government will fund the major part of the costs
of research. The employer’s liability insurers see themselves as
very much the junior partner in that partnership with the state. It was
probably not the case with the gambling legislation and the other

essential for the maintenance of academic freedom and for research
quality. Of course, it is legitimate for the Government to take a
strategic view and, indeed, for the Department of Health and the
National Institute of Health Research to set priorities and make broad
allocations. As the noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant, told us, when
he was a member of the Medical Research Council, the council identified
broad priority areas, although it did not think it appropriate to
identify individual diseases for which it was determined to fund
research. That was because the criterion for making specific awards
must be, above all, that of quality. Peer review, not Parliament or the
Government, should determine who receives publicly provided funding for
research. It follows from that that funding from the state cannot be

already been provided by the state for which mesothelioma researchers
are eligible to bid. The employer’s liability insurers have
already provided funds for research and have indicated that they are
willing to continue to do so. Therefore, the problem of finding money
for research into mesothelioma is not a lack of money on the part of
the state or a lack of money forthcoming from the insurers. The problem
must be that there has been a lack of high-quality proposals for
research in this field. There may have been some quite good proposals;
I think that some 80% of bids to the National Institute of Health
Research are unsuccessful. Such is the competition for funding from
that source that only the very best receive it, so it is not only
people who care very strongly about mesothelioma who are disappointed

in 2011 the British Lung Foundation invested £850,000 in
research into mesothelioma, and £400,000 was invested by other
charities. In Committee the indications were that it did not appear
that much money was coming from the Government. Now, if I understand it
correctly, the Medical Research Council has found some rabbits to come
out of the hat, and that is all to the good. However, more work clearly
needs to be done. If we give due credence to the figures that have been
quoted and requoted about the 56,000 people who are in danger of dying
from this, if any progress can be made by way of research to reduce the
likelihood of those people dying, that is something that we as a House
have a duty to undertake. Whether or not this is the appropriate
vehicle to do so, it is the vehicle that we have to hand at the moment

by the British Lung Foundation has meant that over the past three years
four large insurance firms have collectively invested £1 million
a year into research in this area. I warmly welcome that initiative. It
has seen concrete results, as has been mentioned, such as the creation
of Europe’s first mesothelioma tissue bank. However, that
funding will soon be coming to an end and we need to ensure that the
research goes on. The firms that were involved in the initial agreement
have indicated that the industry as a whole should be involved in
funding future research—that idea comes from them—and
that a voluntary agreement would be unworkable. If we are to secure the
breakthrough that we need in this area, funding must be made available
for research. If that needs legislative underpinning, so be it. Perhaps
the Minister can indicate that if the amendment passes, or if he finds
another way to reach the same objective when the debate goes on to
another place, he will consider including the possibility of a short
annual statement on the amount of funding going into mesothelioma
research from all sources and the progress that is being

illustrated at the beginning of this debate. I knew very little about
mesothelioma until I saw its debilitating effects on friends, including
the former Bishop of Peterborough, Ian Cundy, who some Members may
recall died in 2009. The knowledge that the cause of this cancer has
been lurking in one’s body for 20 years or more of active life
may suggest in itself that more research into detection and treatment
may prove valuable. There is nothing that can be done to rewrite
someone’s life history, which may include often unwitting
exposure to asbestos while young, but much can be done to promote
research into a disease that will kill 2,400 people in the UK this
year—the equivalent of wiping out one of Norfolk’s
smaller market towns within 12 months. If that sort of tragedy happened

Deben:</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, made an
important contribution to this discussion. As a former Minister, I
understand precisely the difficulties in which Ministers find
themselves, particularly in the medical area, because there are many
diseases that are extremely distressing and which, when specifically
singled out, can cause all of us to feel that we ought to do something
about it. There are few as distressing as this, but there are others in
parallel<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T16:56:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Minister has said so far is the right answer, distressing and difficult
though it is, particularly in terms of the danger that arises if we
start deciding politically which diseases are properly sought after and
which are not; this is a dangerous area to be in. My problem is
slightly different. I hope that, in his response, my noble friend the
Minister will not rely on the Treasury argument of hypothecation. One
of the disastrous themes in this country’s legislation is the
refusal of the Treasury to accept that hypothecation is an essential
part of sensible financial arrangements. Many things would be much
better done if there was a clear connection between what people pay
through tax and what
happens<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T16:57:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

interest in mind, as a passionate believer in the environment. We will
not get people to understand why they should pay congestion charges, 
<?notus-xml column=782?>for example, if the money is not clearly spent on
reducing congestion. In other words, there needs to be hypothecation. I
remember when I fought hard for and got the first hypothecated tax, the
landfill tax, which few would now deny was very important. My noble
friend the Health Minister remembers that as well as I do. It was a
battle against a theology. I hope that, when the Minister comes to
speak, he will do so in the terms of the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, and
not in the terms of those who deny this kind of response—not on
the basis of ensuring objective decisions by independent judgment, but
on the basis that there is something inherently unacceptable about
hypothecation.</hs_para>

to greater hypothecation, it would be signally more
democratic—although it might mean that the Treasury would have
less opportunity to get its fingers on the money on its way to that for
which it was needed. That is a wholly admirable aim: the effort to
ensure that there is a link in the public’s mind between what
they pay and what they get is an essential part of our democracy. I
hope that, of all the arguments my noble friend uses, he will eschew
that one. I would not like to be pushed over the edge to not support
him because of the importance of upholding the fine principle of
hypothecation.</hs_para>

at many times, very moving. There is a general consensus that this is a
terrible disease on which no proper research has been carried out. We

achieve that; perhaps the Minister can direct us towards another

right reverend Prelate said that it was a Cinderella of a disease, and
I think the arithmetic explains why. Some 56,000 people in this country
are expected to die with it over the next number of years, but it is

academics—as a disease of the past. Therefore, what is the point
of researching it and spending money when it is dying out, literally?
Wrong—this is a disease of the future, not of the past. If
somebody takes a moment to search the internet for ship-breaking in
Bangladesh, Chittagong and all those places, there are whole
generations who have yet to develop this disease because the exposure
of those people began only in the mid-1980s. They probably would not

we have a dilemma. As the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, rightly
said—I have had some responsibility for this area
myself—research is a unique area. It is built up around
individual institutions, where academics, particularly postgraduate
students, are attracted to pursue research, and there are just not
enough of them around. We are delighted to see the noble Earl, Lord
Howe, on the Front Bench—I have to say that the concept of a
brick wall, the term that the Minister used in Committee, and the noble
Earl do not go together. Can the Minister and his colleague advise us
whether there is any administrative mechanism that either department
could use to encourage people to come forward, such as offering
specific sums of money for a particular type of research—in
other words, offer a carrot—so that there would be something

the issue remains unresolved. Something must be done, be it through

had a negative response from the insurance companies or any other
source to this proposal? Are they threatening that if this were to
happen, it may cast a shadow on the whole scheme? I think the House

accommodating well placed money from foundations, trusts, charities or
private philanthropy. I do not see why a levy should be any different

although it is a tempting subject for debate. Throughout our
deliberations on the Bill and before, the noble Lord, Lord Alton, has

case that the noble Lord makes is thorough and incontestable. Despite
knowledge of this terrible disease and its long latency over many
decades, research spending by Governments has been derisory. The noble
Lord contrasted the levels of research on diffuse mesothelioma with
other cancers to reinforce his point but he acknowledges, as does the
noble Lord, Lord Walton—and as indeed do we—that the
insurance industry has funded such research in the past. The ABI has
made it clear to us in discussion that it stands ready to do so again
in the future, if the Government are prepared to play their part. They
had said that they would match-fund. I hope that we will hear from the

they will do so.</hs_para>

the noble Lord, Lord Alton, has made his case about the need for a
national research effort, so the issue is not whether but how this
outcome is to be achieved. His approach is focused on the insurance
industry’s contribution, which, as he explained, is set down by
Amendment 24 as a “Research supplement” raised under
regulations under the levy provisions. That supplement could not exceed
1% of that required for payments under the scheme. The proposed
regulations must cover how such amounts are to be applied and the role
of the scheme administrator. Of itself, the amendment makes no
reference to the Government’s obligations. I think that we will
hear a different approach from the Minister about the plans that he
would wish to develop to attract quality research funding for
mesothelioma. If this is right, we need to understand the parameters of
this: how much is involved and what is expected of the insurance
industry. We also need to understand whether the approach is
inconsistent with that of the noble Lord, Lord Alton, which is to raise
a levy on

should be put into research on this disease. Indeed, before this
amendment was tabled, my noble friend and I spent some time exploring
possible routes for funding. It is the fruits of those discussions that
I shall now cover. However, the mechanism proposed in this amendment is
not the best way to achieve the objective that the noble Lord, Lord
Alton, is aiming at.</hs_para>

reasons for this. In Committee, my noble friend set out some technical
but none the less important arguments as to why the Government are
resistant to the idea of a supplementary levy for mesothelioma
research. I will not rehearse those arguments again and my noble friend
Lord Deben need not worry as I am not going to rely on them at all. I
need to stress that any additional research charge of the kind proposed
by the noble Lord, Lord Alton, would, like all taxation, have to be
paid into the Consolidated Fund and, if hypothecated, would then have
to be paid out by the Treasury for a specific purpose. The
Treasury does not normally handle tax income in this way, and there
would need to be more convincing arguments before it could consider
doing so for mesothelioma
research.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071765000194" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0001.htm#13071765000194">The
more substantive problem with the amendment is to do with research
policy. As noble Lords will be aware—and the noble Lord, Lord
Howarth, pointed to this—there is a fundamental, widely accepted
principle that the use of medical research funds should be determined
not just by the importance of the topic but by the quality of the
research and its value for money. There is a good reason for this.
There will always be more proposals for high-quality medical research
overall than there are resources available for funding, and it is
arguably unethical to support second-rate work in a particular area at
the expense of higher-quality work in another equally important one.
Noble Lords will understand that this is why, as a rule, public
sector funders of research do not ring-fence funds for
particular diseases. It was the same principle that prompted
Dame Sally Davies to restructure the research funding that the
Department of Health was putting into the NHS over many years, so that
funds would flow, as they now do, to the most important,
highest-quality research.</hs_para>

mesothelioma, the real issue is not just the money; it is the quality
of the research being proposed. How can we try to ensure that the
research proposals in this field reach the quality threshold required
to secure funding? If that threshold is reached, funding is much less
of a difficulty; indeed there is no need to think about the forcible
gathering of funds from insurers. If noble Lords agree, the goal is how
we stimulate high-quality research proposals without undermining the
country’s strategic research mechanisms.</hs_para>

there was a blockage in the research process, but it was not total.
There is good news. As the noble Lord, Lord Alton, informed us,
spending on mesothelioma research is not as low as noble Lords might
believe from the discussions in Committee. The latest figures 
<?notus-xml column=786?>from the Medical Research Council show that its annual spend
on mesothelioma research rose from £0.8 million in 2009-10 to
£2.4 million in 2011-12. We should not belittle those figures.
That is in addition to the research supported by the £1 million
a year donated by insurance companies to the British Lung Foundation,
and research supported by the National Institute for Health Research.
Therefore, on the ability of the system to support publicly funded
mesothelioma research, we are not knocking at a closed

National Institute for Health Research will ask the James Lind Alliance

does it guarantee the quality of research on which such funds would be

steps and supporting the spirit of this amendment. I made it clear when
I spoke at Second Reading, in Committee and again today that if the
Government—during the many discussions that the noble Lord, Lord
Freud, and I have had about this—had been willing to accept the
principle and come forward with their own amendment, I would have been
happy to withdraw my own. The principle that I have been trying to
underline is the need for a statutory requirement to step up to the
plate to deal with this killer disease, which we all agree will take
any number of lives—an estimated 56,000 before the disease
completes its first 
<?notus-xml column=788?>wave. We heard in the quotations I presented to the House earlier today

This disease is specific and that is why the industry has accepted its

We do not believe that a legislative route is necessary. We

can do this in other ways. We can give the process exactly the kind of
kick-start that was referred to in the debate much more effectively
than can this amendment. Funders for research build areas for research

Alton of Liverpool:</Member></B> My Lords, this is not about
throwing money at problems. That is certainly something that I have
always eschewed throughout the whole of my time in politics. You have
to demonstrate the case and there is a case here. If 56,000 of our
countrymen are going to die of this disease over the next 30 years or
so, we have to find adequate resources to tackle mesothelioma. That is
not being done by this Bill. We have a rare opportunity to do something
about
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071782000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0001.htm#13071782000029"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Walton of Detchant" PimsId="4515" UID="13071782000486" xid="1485" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0001.htm#13071782000486">Lord

whether he feels that the important developments referred to by the

Medical Research Council, the NIHR and other organisations, might
not—at the moment—be a useful way

Alton of Liverpool:</Member></B> I am grateful to my noble friend and
yes, of course I am delighted that those meetings are going to happen.
The noble Earl was kind enough to say that perhaps the debates that
have been precipitated on this issue in Committee, at Second Reading
and again today have helped to bring that about. However, the moment
will pass and all of us who sit in this House know that once the
legislative vehicle has moved on, the opportunity to make something
happen disappears into the ether. That is why I intend to press this to
a vote and to test the will of your Lordships’ House.</hs_para>

very valuable scheme, what is now provided for in the capital is a
smaller, less costly scheme than was signalled in the February 2010

arguments in favour of a July 2012 commencement are flimsy to say the

could tip all this finely balanced negotiation over the edge, and that

presented to us for a February 2010 start date was an extra

negligence that employees were allowed to come home wearing their

I hope that he will consider levying the public liability insurance. He
was as good as his word; he discussed the question of public liability
insurance in this context with the Association of Personal Injury
Lawyers and with the ABI. He wrote to us following that discussion to

leaving behind only a small number of people, we could be justified in

substantially and that extending the scheme to this very small number

relation to the group of people who are referred to in the

employers’ liability insurance—or employers’
liability compulsory insurance, which I think is its proper

I know that it was sold in this fashion. I explored this argument in
Committee—I am grateful to the Minister, who, in his
characteristic fashion, addressed comprehensively in his letter those
issues that he did not have a briefing to address in
Committee—and I have now had it confirmed, from the information

invariably, employers’ liability compulsory insurance was sold
in a package, with, among other things, public liability insurance.
Consequently, it is invariably the case that the insurers, who carry
the employers’ liability risk, also carry the public liability
risk. It is the behaviour of exactly the same insurers, in either
destroying their records or failing to be available to those who
identified them as the insurers who carried these risks, that has
caused this deep failure in the insurance market. Therefore, there is
no difference in relation to the mechanism of insurance and its failure
to provide compensation for people who have been exposed to
environmental or secondary exposure, compared with those who were
employed in the first

their relative or loved one and their contracting the disease. Had they
had somebody to sue, they would have been able to get compensation. If
the employer does not exist and the insurer cannot now be found, they
are in exactly the same position as the relative who was exposed to the
fibres and carried them home. I made that argument, and from the way I
read the very carefully worded letter from the Minister, that appears
to be what his researchers have revealed: that this group of people

Stoneham of Droxford:</Member></B> My Lords, I will comment on a number
of issues to which these amendments give rise—and they are very
sensitive issues. Any start date is arbitrary, and there will always be
people who are caught by a start date, so whether it is 2010 or 2012, 
<?notus-xml column=800?>there will inevitably be feelings of unfairness.
However, the earlier the start date, whatever the cost—perhaps
the Minister will clarify the cost, but we were told it was £119
million, and if it is 70% of that it will come to £80
million—agreeing to that concession would cause a 25% increase
in the cost of this scheme. Where is the money going to come from? Will
it come from a new negotiation, or from reduced benefits and
compensation for those who will receive money from the scheme? That
question has to be answered by the movers of the
amendment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071789000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0002.htm#13071789000002">On
the issue of coverage, there are obviously concerns about the
self-employed and people from the same household, but are we saying
that we are going to complicate this legislation and hold it up while
we have an argument about public liability insurance versus employee

of this legislation is that we have kept it simple and we have an
agreement. It is a balancing act to get to that agreement and
to get the legislation through so that it
benefits the people who were in
employment. Once this settles down, we could consider coming back to
this—I hope the Minister will do so at some stage—and
look again at how we might cover the self-employed and people from the

Alton of Liverpool:</Member></B> My Lords, I will speak briefly to
these amendments, in particular to support what the noble Lord, Lord
McKenzie, argued in Committee and what these amendments call for today.
We had a long debate on 5 June, in which I spoke at some
length. The point I made then, which partly answers what the noble
Lord, Lord Stoneham, has just said about the arbitrariness of dates,
was that the original consultation period is surely the point
from which this scheme should kick in, not the date of July
25 last year, the last day of the Session, when a welcome announcement
was made that there would be a Bill along these lines and a scheme of
this kind.</hs_para>

of February 2010 is, for me, a seminal date. For those affected it
represented a promise waiting to be fulfilled. The eligibility date
should be at the commencement of the consultation. After all, the
Association of British Insurers began the discussions at that time. It
can hardly have woken up on 25 July last year, shocked at having failed
to make contingency plans or reserves. Therefore, applying the date of
February 2010 is the right and fair way to go about this. It is the
date that people anticipated and expected. In law, as well, it is far
more consistent. After all, there will be people who were diagnosed
with mesothelioma during that period and it is important that they are
accepted as part of this scheme.</hs_para>

Minister will not be in a position to share the legal advice that he
has been given within the department, but we might well leave ourselves
open to claims because of the consultation document that was issued and
the clear indication that this scheme would probably begin from as long
ago as February 2010, rather than 25 July last year. For those reasons
alone, I am happy to support the noble Lord, Lord

Wills:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, support these
amendments and endorse everything that has been said. On
Amendment 4, as my noble friend on the Front Bench has said,
little credence should be attached to arguments that insurers could not
reasonably have expected in February 2010 that a scheme such as this
could not have been brought forward in the foreseeable future. Indeed,
it is highly likely that the only reason for the selection of that date
is that it reduces costs. That is not a negligible consideration, but,
as we have heard, those costs are likely to be relatively small. We
have heard that they represent a considerable percentage increase, but
with all respect that is not the concern here. The issue is the
absolute sums that are involved, which are relatively small. They ought
to be easily affordable by insurers, particularly in light of the long
period in which insurers have got away without paying sums that they
should have been paying. In my view, those costs are unlikely to have
to be passed on to
employers<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

assumptions, that would in effect push the levy rate up to

Browne of Ladyton:</Member></B> My more fundamental point is that the
insurers that sold employer’s liability compulsory insurance
were the same insurers that sold public liability insurance to
individual employers, because they were sold in a package. That was my
experience 
<?notus-xml column=805?>when I was the Minister for employment between 2003 and 2004 when, the
noble Lord will remember, there was a significant failure of the
employer’s liability compulsory insurance market that had to be
resolved. His letter of 5 July to me and others confirms that that is
still the case, according to his research. These insurers are not
separate insurers, they are the same insurers, and I suggest that the
requirement to carry cover in relation to the specific risk of asbestos
would have been irrelevant to public
liability<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T18:32:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

date is concerned, I simply do not accept the point that the insurers
did not know until July 2012 that there was the expectation that a
scheme would be set up. From what the Minister has told us, there have
been two years of intense negotiations, generally with the ABI, which
has had to discuss matters and negotiate with a range of insurers.
There was an intense process under way, as we understand it, and
therefore it must have been very clear to insurers that something was
very likely to come from this and that was going to be the sort of
scheme that has now emerged. I do not accept that the first insurers
knew about it was the point when we said: “Here is the document.
This is what we are going
do”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071789000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0002.htm#13071789000040"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Freud" PimsId="5439" UID="13071789000406" xid="2007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0002.htm#13071789000406">Lord
Freud:</Member></B> I just want to clarify the point about the
expectations or otherwise of the insurance industry. From our
negotiations, which went on for a long time —more than a year; I
cannot remember exactly—it would have been anticipating that the
specific insurers with historic liability would have been pinned down
in a completely different way from this levy. We spent an enormous
amount of time working on that. As I have already told the House, my
first instinct was to try to get the actual insurers that
wrote the liability to find the money out of their balance sheets. I
judged that the legal risks to that approach were
high—not impossible, but high—and we therefore switched
to this other approach. Actually, the expectations that the industry
might have had would not have been set anything like as early as noble
Lords might
think<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T18:40:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> Again, I am grateful to the Minister
for that explanation, but it seems to me that the expectations were not
set only at the point of July 2012. On the cost that the Minister has
outlined, I understand that it has reduced from the original figure of
£119 million. I do not think that the figures that the Minister
has given reflect any additional benefit recovery potential that would
come from having two more years in the scheme, or know whether that was
fed in to any analysis of how it might impact on the spreading that
would arise from that. Maybe we will have to have that discussion on
another

the noble Lord prayed in aid a technical deficiency of the drafting. I
have done it myself; I think it was the noble Lord, Lord Deben, 
<?notus-xml column=807?>who advised generally against that. The thrust of the point made by the
noble Lord, Lord Browne, was that, basically, whether it is the
employer liability route or the public liability route, you are
basically coming back to the same insurers. Obviously, the
Minister’s point about there being some hope for the
self-employed —being able to argue that in certain circumstances
they were de facto employees—is

proposition that the start date should be the 2012 date. February 2010
is a better date. That was when the expectation was

up with a lesser scheme than was proposed in February, so their
expectation should have been of a higher obligation arising from that.

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall speak also to
Amendment 13. Amendment 11 requires that those diagnosed with diffuse
mesothelioma and eligible under the scheme should receive payment of an
amount no less than 100% of the average actual damages recovered in
mesothelioma cases. Because the scheme under consideration is a payment
scheme rather than a strict compensation scheme, it has been agreed
that a tariff based on average compensation levels taken over recent
periods should be taken as a reasonable proxy for compensation amounts.
The tariff, which we will discuss in subsequent amendments, is
comprised of bands depending on age at date of diagnosis. It is
understood that the starting tariff is accepted by the Government, the
insurance industry and the Asbestos Victims Support Groups.
What<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T18:55:39"></hs_TimeCode> is not
agreed is the percentage of the tariff that should be
paid.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13071794000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0002.htm#13071794000002">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T18:55:08"></hs_TimeCode>
amendment proposes that it should be 100%, a full compensation
equivalent. Hitherto, the Minister has referred to payment levels of
70% of the tariff and today we heard the good news that he has been
able to negotiate this a little higher with the ABI, with the
proposition that it now be 75%. These amounts are of course separate
from the payments towards legal costs and any research supplement,
should that re-emerge. We should make clear again that we consider that
the Minister has done a first-rate job in bringing the scheme thus far.
We have no doubt that he has had to endure many painful engagements
with the insurance sector, whose failure—or market failure in
his terms—is at the root of the problem that this Bill seeks
to address. I wish him to go further. I do not wish to seem
ungrateful for these efforts but we have an obligation to speak to the
victims to see it from their point of

provided for in this Bill operates when somebody has been negligently
exposed to asbestos and has consequently contracted diffuse
mesothelioma. This is, as we have heard, a terrible disease, invariably
fatal, which inflicts untold suffering on those who contract it and
also on their families. In Committee, a number of noble Lords spoke of
their own harrowing experience of witnessing the awful pain that
mesothelioma causes. The only thing that prevents individuals in these
circumstances getting proper compensation—the
government schemes fall far short—is the inability to
trace the employer that caused negligent exposure to asbestos or the
insurance company which provided employer liability insurance cover. No
blame can be attached to mesothelioma sufferers for this. It is not
their fault that, because of the passage of time, records have been
lost or destroyed. Many can trace those responsible and the new tracing
office will help more in the future. That is good news. That is as it
should be. However, for those who cannot, why should they not be
treated in an equivalent manner? They are the
victims<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T18:57:19"></hs_TimeCode>. If I

mesothelioma sufferers and their families, compensation isn’t
about money per se. For mesothelioma sufferers, compensation provides
solace that their loved ones will have some financial security when
they die. For their families, compensation is about justice. No one

of life, past, present and to come. Compensation stands in for justice.
To diminish compensation is to demean the pain and suffering families

we are encouraged to look at this through the eyes of the insurance

is necessary to encourage individuals to trace an employer or insurer.
We will be told that not all employers in the employer liability market
will have been in the market or on risk over the years when people were
exposed. That is notwithstanding that tracing or accessing the scheme
has to follow the same routes. References to public liability policies
not being traced are, by and large, a red herring. Collectively, over
the years, the industry would have had premiums for liability that it
has not had to meet, and it still has the benefit of premiums for other
exposures that remain outside this scheme. If there has to be some
rough justice at the edges of these arrangements, clearly the justice
should go to the sufferers. The insurance industry should make amends

Amendment 13 seeks to take the insurance industry at its word. It has
expressed concern that a levy rate of more than 3% could tip matters
over to a situation where the levy costs would have to be passed on to
industry. The noble Lord referred to that in his opening remarks. We
are sceptical about whether pricing of employer liability policies
would work collectively for all 150 or so market players in this way.
However, accepting that 3% is a tipping point for the sector,
Amendment 13 requires that the levy is a minimum of
3% or such lower sum as would provide for 100% of the tariff.</hs_para>

claim that at 75% of the tariff it is already at 3%, or
perhaps above it, in which case the 
<?notus-xml column=812?>amendment should not cause it a problem. On the
Government’s figures, the levy would be close to 3% for a 75%
payout over the initial four years of the scheme but below
3% for the latter six years if the tariff is to be paid in full. Given
that no one, we hope, is arguing that the percentage levy will reduce
in future, except to the extent of avoiding paying more than 100% of
the tariff, the amendment should be readily acceptable.</hs_para>

Howarth of Newport:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 16 is
in my name. Again, the common theme is that the amendments in this
group seek to maximise the amount that will be paid to mesothelioma
victims and their dependants. I will come in a moment to my own
amendment but I would like to say a few words in strong support of the
amendments in the names of my noble friends Lord McKenzie of Luton and
Lady Sherlock. It was certainly not the fault of the claimants that the
documentation went missing and it is very hard to see why they should
bear the burden. The Minister has spoken of the dangers of a
disproportionate burden on the employer’s liability insurers,
but is it not a disproportionate burden on the mesothelioma
victims?</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13071794000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0002.htm#13071794000009">The
ABI has put forward various arguments as to why payments under the
scheme should not be at the same level as the average of court awards.
The first is that an incentive must be provided for claimants to go to
court. If they could just as easily get 100% by going to the scheme,
why would they bother to go to court? With respect to the ABI, this
argument is nonsense. This will not be a matter of choice for the
claimants. The Minister’s letter to us of 4 July made it clear
that the scheme is designed as a,</hs_para>
<hs_quotefo UID="13071794000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0002.htm#13071794000060">“last resort

insurer are closed to the
individual”.</hs_quotefo><hs_parafo UID="13071794000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0002.htm#13071794000048">The
procedures under the scheme will make that a compelling reality. There
will be the single portal and the identical search for documentation.
Whether someone is on their way to having their case heard in court or
considered by the administrators of the scheme, they will have recourse
to the scheme only if they are unable to have recourse to the court, so
the incentive argument is nonsense.</hs_parafo>
<hs_para UID="13071794000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0002.htm#13071794000010">The ABI has also said
that it is important to ensure that the overall cost to insurers is
sustainable in the long term. I believe that the overall cost of a
somewhat improved scheme—we have been debating today a variety
of ways in which that scheme might be improved —would indeed be
affordable. Apart from the fact that the insurers did very well for
decades in being able to invest the premiums of mesothelioma sufferers
whose documentation could not be found and who
therefore could not bring a case, we have to remember in addition that
between 1979 and 2008 the employer’s liability insurers were
effectively subsidised by the taxpayer to the tune of hundreds of
millions of pounds, as they 
<?notus-xml column=813?>were allowed to keep the amounts paid out under the Government’s
pneumoconiosis scheme to offset against the cost of the liabilities of
the
insurers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071794000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0002.htm#13071794000011">Even
now, because the Minister declined in Committee to incorporate in the
Bill the possibility of creating parallel and comparable schemes for
other diseases such as asbestosis, asbestos-related lung cancer or
pleural disease, only some 50% of sufferers from asbestos-related
diseases stand a possibility of being compensated under this scheme.
Those other 50% will in effect be subsidising the insurers. Those are a
handful of reasons why I take with deep scepticism the proposition that
the insurers could not afford to improve the scheme. We know, indeed,
that their case load will fall, so even if it was a little pricey for
them in the early years it would rapidly become more affordable. The
Government are also going to smooth the way over the early
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071794000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0002.htm#13071794000012">It is
unlikely that the cost of these improvements would cause the cost of
the scheme to creep above the 3% of gross written premiums. I prefer
the DWP’s calculations on this to the ABI’s. However, if
that were to happen it would not be a disaster and is not terribly
relevant, because it is other factors that move premiums. The
Minister’s fear that any improvements to the scheme would lead
to the point at which additional burdens were placed, by way of higher
premiums, on employers and industry is misplaced. The premiums that are
charged in this market are the product of multiple factors and paying
the beneficiaries-to-be somewhat more generously would not have an
effect on the premiums. I do not believe that the percentage of gross
written premiums has any bearing on what premiums are sought in the
marketplace. The employer’s liability insurers pitch their
premiums at the maximum that competitive market conditions allow. They
will always do that, so the Minister’s fear is misplaced and he
should call their bluff on that.</hs_para>

reason that the ABI gives is to stop people getting more than the
courts would award. In its briefing, it said to us:</hs_para>

payments will be made … on a straightforward tariff, some people
will receive more compensation under the scheme than they would have
received in civil compensation, and the aim is to set the tariff at a
level that means this will only happen in a small number of
cases”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="13071794000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0002.htm#13071794000049">Elsewhere,
it told us that the intention is for the tariff to be set “a
little below” the average of awards made in civil cases. A
little below? The proposition is that 30% should be docked from the
average of court awards in the payments provided under the scheme.
Seventy per cent was not enough and while we are very grateful to the
Minister for easing the level of payments up to 75% of the average of
court awards, that is still not enough. Nor would 80%, as in the
amendment of my noble friend Lord Browne and the noble Lord, Lord
Wigley, be sufficient in my view. Ninety per cent is the very minimum
with which we could be satisfied. As the Association of Personal Injury
Lawyers has pointed out, the Financial Services
Compensation Scheme, which provides compensation where insurers have
become insolvent, pays at the 90% level.</hs_parafo>

my own Amendment 16, which would prevent what I regard as excessive
demands for repayment by the DWP through its agency, the 
<?notus-xml column=814?>Compensation Recovery Unit. The rationale for the
figure of £110,000 is that if we expect the average of payments
over the next 10 years to be £87,000—it may be
fractionally more, now that the Minister has moved it up to
75%—and if, as the Minister has advised us, the average recovery
required from claimants will be £20,480, add those two figures
and you get to £107,500. Round that up a little and you get to
£110,000. That is appropriate because payments under the scheme,
unamended, will be meagre. At the same time, the DWP
—and no doubt the Treasury, lurking behind it—
aggressively intends to reclaim 100% in recovery of benefits and
lump-sum payments from people who will have received only 70% of what
they might have received in court.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13071794000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0002.htm#13071794000015">Moreover, the
department intends no abatement in its reclaiming to take account of
pain and suffering, which they would do in the case of an award by
the courts. So we risk the £87,000 typical award by
the scheme being reduced by around a further £20,000 as a result
of the DWP’s reclaims. According to the Association of Personal
Injury Lawyers, the best estimate of what mesothelioma victims and
their dependants will receive from the scheme will, therefore, be only
60% of what the courts might have awarded. It cannot be right that
these people should receive only 60% of their legal entitlement when

about a gross and scandalous dereliction of their proper responsibility

number of people who should have had cover. This has been a great evil
and we should make amends as fully and generously as we possibly can.
Is that double negligence on the part of employers and insurers, from

very soon after diagnosis, so leaving their families with less
compensation than they would otherwise have been entitled to. Of
course, I welcome the move 
<?notus-xml column=815?>to increase the compensation payable from 70% to 75%, and I
thank the Minister for securing that improvement. However, whether the
Government propose that claimants should receive 30% or 25% less than
the average worth of a claim, it is essentially unfair that any

be balked at. On 25 June, the noble Lord, Lord Wills, asked the
Government what assessment had been made of the likely impact on the

to sufferers under the proposed scheme. In his response, the noble
Lord, Lord Freud, said that over the first 10 years of the scheme, if
the tariff were 100%, the amount of compensation paid would total
£451 million. Under the 70% tariff originally proposed, the
insurance industry was, by comparison, forecast to pay £322

getting away with 70% or 75% is a cost suffered by the victims’

Browne of Ladyton:</Member></B> My Lords, I have added my name to the
amendment in the name of my noble friend Lord Wigley. When he and I put
our names to the amendment, we were unaware of what the Minister would
be able to achieve without the benefit that our amendment being carried
by your Lordships’ House might give in strengthening his
negotiating hand. I have immense respect for my noble friend and his
decision not to press his amendment and I will not seek 
<?notus-xml column=816?>to do otherwise. However, I want to add to what has already been said in
relation to this group of amendments and the principle of
justice.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13071794000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0002.htm#13071794000025">In
one of the early sentences of his introductory speech at Second
Reading, the Minister enunciated a principle that, if a person is
damaged by the negligent actions of another, that person should be
entitled to compensation and, therefore, justice. I paraphrase him and
I am sure that I do not do justice to the eloquence of his words at the
time, but I remember pointing out that there was an inconsistency
between that and other recent actions of his Government in relation to
health and safety
law.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071794000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0002.htm#13071794000026">We all
agree with that principle and, with all due respect to the arguments
that can be made, I suspect that the Minister does not equate the
payments from the scheme with justice. He will be comfortable at the
Dispatch Box and probably will, in his characteristic style, say that
he is not presenting this as justice. Justice for these people would be
for an employer who is insured to sue, and 100% compensation. So we are
not going to do justice. I regret that we are not going to do justice
to the victims of this dreadful behaviour and of the dreadful history
that followed it, not necessarily on the part of employers—which
went out of business for lots of reasons—but certainly on the
part of the insurance
industry.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071794000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0002.htm#13071794000027">However,
we have a duty to strive for justice. The Minister eloquently
expressed, as he has done on a number of occasions, that this is
basically a negotiation. He has negotiated on behalf of the victims in
a situation where hitherto they had only statutory schemes to look to,
and he is to be congratulated on his achievement. I have experience of
the responsibilities he holds and know just how difficult the job is. I
have congratulated him on it in the past and he gets a significant
amount of deserved credit in this House for what he has
achieved.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13071794000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0002.htm#13071794000028">He
says that his ability to improve the scheme is a function of a number
of practical and realistic things: what is negotiable in the
circumstances of what the market will bear; and the point at which he
judges, and the insurance industry tells him, that it will be compelled
to transfer the marginal cost of the scheme to British industry and
thus affect competitiveness. It is also a function of the fact that he
is operating in a situation where he is seeking to have the scheme
funded by what he calls active insurers, which are not necessarily the
insurers that historically wrote the policies that carried the risk in
the first
place.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071794000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0002.htm#13071794000029">I
accept all that. In the debate on the previous group of amendments, my
noble friend Lord McKenzie made a point that prompts my own, which is
different from any that have been made in the debate. We do not doubt
the Minister’s bona fides, but whether we are at the limit of
his negotiating ability, or whether we can help him go a bit further
towards the sort of figure that is more like justice, it would be
helpful if we knew how many of the insurers with which he is
negotiating are those that carried this risk in the first place and
behaved in the way they
did.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071794000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0002.htm#13071794000030">Until
now, the Minister has deployed very adroitly the point about active
insurers as opposed to those who carried the risk. However, he has done
it in a very 
<?notus-xml column=817?>generalised way. I was not moved to interrogate him in detail until he
explained, probably for the second time —I did not pay enough
attention the first time—to my noble friend Lord McKenzie that
when he first approached the issue, his desire was to place the burden
on those insurers that underwrote the policies and risk in the first
place. That implies that he must have thought that there
were enough of them to carry the burden. Therefore, this cannot be an
insignificant number of insurers. The inference I drew from the
argument that he put forward in his contribution—which he may
now regret—was that a disproportionate burden was being placed
on people who were not about when the problem was being created.
However, my knowledge of the Minister and of his abilities, which is
growing, suggests that the opposite is the case, and that more of these
insurers than we think will have to pay
up.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071794000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0002.htm#13071794000031">If I had
thought about this before, I might have argued for a differential levy
in order to get a significantly increased amount of money, so that we
could all do what we wanted to do, which was get much beyond 70%. Is
the Minister in a position to help us? It may not be of any great
assistance to us, although there is still Third Reading, but at some
stage—I am not asking him to name and shame, although
I would quite like him to—it would be interesting to know the
number of insurers involved. Perhaps we could go a bit further. Could
he describe the scale of this market in monetary terms, and the
proportion of the market that is controlled by those companies that let
this insurance market fail? We would then all have a better sense of
justice and of where we should apply the
burden.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071794000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0002.htm#13071794000032">I will
say two more things. Unfortunately I had to leave the Grand Committee
before we came to debate this issue. When I read the <I>Official
Report</I>, I was extremely impressed by the amendment of my noble
friend Lady Donaghy, which proposed adopting the idea of the incentive
that the ABI deployed—which my noble friend Lord Howarth
demolished and which the Minister has now abandoned—and
reversing it to fix the compensation at 130% of the average, in order
to incentivise the insurance companies to get their colleagues to find
the policies, and to get the people who wrote them to carry the risk
and burden. That is where the incentive should be in this
situation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071794000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0002.htm#13071794000033">I
see that the noble Lord, Lord Stoneham, is in his place. I am glad
that, thus far in the debate, he has not deployed the argument of delay
in relation to this legislation. I do not resent—but I do not
like—the idea that those of us who have been trying to improve
the legislation somehow have to step back because we may delay the
point at which very deserving people can get some form of payment. I do
not like it for a simple reason. The Bill was introduced in your
Lordships’ House and went into Grand Committee. We are now on
Report and this is the first and earliest point at which we can vote on
anything in it. If the argument of delay in these circumstances is to
have any merit, it means that we have to accept whatever is presented
to us by the Government if it is broadly in a good area of public
policy. If in future we ever have to face an argument for reform of the
House of Lords, we had better not do

Wills:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, support the amendments in this
group and endorse everything that my noble friend on the Front Bench
said in support of them. In doing so, I express my appreciation for the

say a few additional words in support of Amendment 13, to which I added
my name. It sets out a mechanism to try to ensure that the Bill can be
a final settlement of the issue. It does so by setting out to ensure a
continuing equitable balance between the various interests at play. We
have heard at all stages of the Bill that there is strong support in
your Lordships’ House for the percentage paid to be not less
than 100% of the average damages recovered by claimants in mesothelioma
cases, and for the start of the scheme to be 10 February 2010. However,
at the same time, I think that your Lordships’ House recognises
the strenuous efforts made by the Minister to achieve a settlement with
insurers that could be delivered
rapidly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071794000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0002.htm#13071794000036">With
respect to my noble friend Lord Browne, the issue is not so much the
processes of Parliament as how obstructive the insurers are going to
be. I appreciate that there is a risk of unpicking what the Minister
has achieved and encouraging insurers to dig their heels in and be
obstructive. We have seen too much evidence of the obstructive approach
that they adopted in the past for that not to be a risk. Nevertheless,
we can improve the Bill further, and this amendment seeks to do
that.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13071794000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0002.htm#13071794000037">As I
understand it, the basis of the settlement, which can be
achieved rapidly, is that costs should not exceed 3% of the levy. That
is the point at which insurers estimate that they would have
to pass on costs to employers. It is the actuarial assumptions made by
insurers on this basis that have reduced the figure to less than 100%
for payments under the scheme, and set the start date at 25 July 2012.
Those actuarial assumptions are just assumptions. They could be
questioned, and, as we have already heard, the
Government’s assumptions are different. However, it may turn out
that they are accurate. All assumptions at this stage can be only a
best guess.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071794000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0002.htm#13071794000038">If
it does turn out that these actuarial assumptions by the insurers have
overestimated the cost of the scheme, the amendment will address that
eventuality. If, over time, once the smoothing period is over, the cost
of the scheme amounts to less than the 3% of the levy that insurers are
currently willing to contribute, the end result will be that insurers
will up paying less than they are currently prepared to pay—in
effect, they will save money—while victims of mesothelioma will
continue to receive less than many, and perhaps most, in your
Lordships’ House and outside it believe that they should
receive. Such an outcome would be manifestly unjust, and would lead to
considerable pressure in Parliament for new legislation to put right
such injustice.</hs_para>

amendment seeks to avoid that situation, and all the further delays and
uncertainty for victims of this disease that would result, by ensuring
that such an injustice will not occur. It places no new burdens on
insurers at all; it merely seeks to ensure that, whatever the outcome
of the actuarial assumptions that underpin 
<?notus-xml column=819?>the current provisions of the Bill, insurers will pay what they are
currently prepared to pay. It offers the victims of this dreadful
disease the comfort that, if there is more money available as a result
of those assumptions turning out to be inaccurate, it is those victims
that will get it and not the insurers. This avoids the prospect of
future wrangling and disputes, which I would have thought the insurers
would certainly welcome. It would be in nobody’s interest to
reopen the matter in this way, and this amendment offers a continuing
equitable outcome. I hope that it will find favour with the

replies, I should like to return to a point that came up in Committee
and to try to set the industry context in which these
misunderstandings, particularly those of the noble Lord, Lord Browne,

of the Council of Lloyd’s throughout the whole six years of its

audit committee for those six years; and, finally, I was chairman of
the committee that created Equitas. I have twice stood trial in America
for the fraudulent signing of the audit certificate of Lloyd’s,
of which I was fortunately acquitted each time, as it was a 25-year
mandatory sentence. I therefore have some perspective on these

noble Lord, Lord Browne, has a fundamental misunderstanding. There is
no such thing as an insurance industry in the context in which all
these liabilities were first conceived. Insurance companies do not
exist. They have morphed into what is now, effectively, a vast
international reinsurance market, where all these liabilities have been
swept up and eventually reinsured with each other until they are all
divided up against the entire global insurance market., Lloyd’s
itself is now wholly owned by Berkshire Hathaway and the negotiations
will, therefore, have to be entirely with Berkshire Hathaway and its

Lloyd’s, and then everywhere else. The negotiation is very

tabling these amendments. I will start with those relating to the rate

Lord Howarth, on the recovery of payments over £110,000. The
amendments tabled by the noble Lords, Lord McKenzie and Lord Wigley,
and the noble Baroness, Lady Sherlock, seek to ensure a minimum level
of scheme payment at either 100% or 80% of the value of an
average mesothelioma civil damages claim. I completely understand and
appreciate that noble Lords would like to see payment levels that are
closer to, if not equal to or above, those of average civil damages.
Equally, I take from our 
<?notus-xml column=820?>debates that I have noble Lords’ full support in wanting to
guarantee that we get the maximum possible payment for people who,
through no fault of their own, clearly cannot bring a case against an
employer or their employer’s insurers. As we have often
discussed, the funds to provide these payments are to be raised through
a levy imposed on the active insurance market. The amount of levy to be
imposed, and consequently the amount we can pay eligible people, has
been determined following considerable work and
negotiation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T19:34:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the point about incentives made by the noble Lord, Lord Howarth. We
have not made that argument. To the extent that it has appeared in some
of the earlier texts on this Bill, I think it reflects a shape that was
somewhat different when that argument might have applied. We have not
made it. It is not relevant to this particular scheme. The noble Lord,
Lord Browne, made the point in reverse. I actually give the
credit for the 130% to the noble Baroness, Lady Donaghy, who proposed
it originally. I have taken that point in a somewhat different way.
That is what has driven the discussions with the FCA and led to its
much tighter determination to have an effective incentive for insurance
companies to do the tracing that they should do and to ramp up the

do our best to ensure that costs are not passed on willy-nilly to
British industry and that the levy works in that way. At that time,
many of the insurers were not necessarily in the business on the same
scale that they are today. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Browne, has
asked for a full analysis. My noble friend Lord James gave him a
picture of the kind of capital pools we are talking about. That is what
insurance essentially is, with companies acting as agents. It is
extraordinarily hard, but there is already a big split—I do not
have reliable figures: I thought I had, but they are not reliable
enough to quote in public—between a large number of run-off
companies that are not active anymore, many of which are in run-off,
which is the polite way of saying they have given up administration,
because of some of the liabilities that they took. That needs to be
monitored, which is difficult to do. There is also the matter of the
market share of these companies. They may have been active for 50
years, but their market share may have changed dramatically. There is
also the fact that some may have kept very good records while others
have not, leading to a double whammy effect. Those that have paid up,
because they have really good records, are probably those from which we
are trying to take more money through this levy. I do not have a market
analysis of the kind that the noble Lord, Lord Browne, wants, but I am
confident in saying that nobody else has

us move on to where we have got to. Thanks to the combined and
consistent pressure on the insurance industry from both the Government
and noble Lords, we have secured what I could call a reluctant
agreement from insurers that the scheme payments will now be set at 75%
of average civil compensation. I emphasise again the important role
played by noble Lords in getting that outcome. I am grateful for that.
I have already talked about the different assumptions of the Government
and the industry regarding the volume of  
<?notus-xml column=821?>applications. The insurers have based their calculations on their own
figures, which they think will require a levy of close to 3% of their
gross written premium.</hs_para>

has been a tough negotiation and even those with whom the Government
were negotiating have had a tough job persuading others in that

this is a significant move from the insurance industry. If we could pay
people more, we would, but this is a balancing act. If we were to go up
to 80% or 100%, we would be very concerned about the costs being passed
straight on to British industry. Indeed, a key concern that I have had
about the structure of the scheme is that that should not happen, or
that the risks of it happening should be minimised, and that is what
the smoothing mechanism for the first four years is about. I know that
the noble Lord, Lord Browne, will not like me saying this but there

turn quickly to the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Howarth,

is intended to allow the scheme to recover any payment, or part
payment, in specified circumstances. Those specified circumstances will
form part of the regulations setting up the scheme and will be debated
in due course. However, the intention is that a payment that has been
made in error will be subject to repayment. This amendment would allow

that sort of payment should be asked to repay it, regardless of the
level of the payment. It would not be appropriate to allow someone to
keep any payment if it had been established that they were not eligible

consequence of an accident, injury or disease and specified social
security benefits or lump-sum payments have been paid in respect of the

Lords who have spoken in favour of Amendments 11 and 13. Perhaps I may
deal briefly with the Minister’s reply. We agree that we want to
get the maximum possible out of this. We acknowledge the improvement in
the incentive for tracing that the noble Lord announced earlier, and I
think that all noble Lords accept the increase from 70% to 75% in the
level of recovery. However, we always come back to analysing this from
a justice point of view: what is fair to insurers and what is fair to
people who have contracted diffuse mesothelioma because of
employers’ negligence. We cannot get away from the fact that
justice for them has to be 100% of the compensation that they would
otherwise receive if there were formal compensation arrangements rather
than the tariff. One hundred per cent of the tariff is justice;
anything less is
not<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T19:46:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Bach:</Member></B> My Lords, one way of cutting legal aid is to take
areas of law out of scope, which is something that this Government have
done with a vengeance. As this House knows very well, social welfare
law has been potentially destroyed by Part 1 of the Legal Aid,
Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012. However, there is
another way to do the same thing, and that is to cut the number of
people who can obtain legal aid in those areas of civil law—and
there are precious few of them—which are still in scope; for
example, mortgage possession and eviction cases, community care cases,
mental capacity cases and some domestic violence cases as well. By
these regulations that we are debating tonight, which my regret Motion
deals with, Her Majesty’s Government have excluded many who
could claim legal aid previously. Is that a fair or just thing to do,
particularly at a time of hardship and austerity for so many people?
That is my
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T20:00:21"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T20:05:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

person in receipt of means-tested welfare benefits—for example,
income support or guaranteed state pension credit—would qualify
for legal aid on both income and capital. They were described as being
passported. A quick decision could be made, which was easy to
administer for the Legal Services Commission as was, the providers of
that legal advice and the clients
themselves<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T20:01:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071796000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0002.htm#13071796000020">Now
the Government have put into place radical changes. The regulations
require a capital test as well as an income means test: if a person has
more than £8,000 capital, they are denied legal aid.
Interestingly, under welfare benefit law, that sum is £16,000
and if they have anything less than £16,000, they would still
qualify. My first question to the Minister is: why the
difference<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T20:01:39"></hs_TimeCode>? The
welfare benefit system also ignores the value of a person’s main
dwelling but in these regulations the value of their main dwelling is
taken into account. Therefore, my second question is: why is it taken
into account under these regulations but not under welfare benefit
regulations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T20:02:16"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

<?notus-xml column=826?><hs_para UID="13071796000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0002.htm#13071796000021">Of course, there is a
disregard of £100,000 for any equity and
£100,000 for any mortgage. Do the Government deny that many
people who own homes with mortgages and some equity will not qualify
for legal aid? The state has recognised in the benefits system that
these people cannot easily, or at all, access their capital because it
is tied up in the property that they have. Why will that not apply in
these cases too? My case is that this will affect a large number of
people’s access to some sort of justice. Her Majesty’s
Government estimate 4,000 people will be affected. The belief of many
outside is that that is an unbelievably small figure and that there
will be many more in practice. This is simply
unfair<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T20:03:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071796000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0002.htm#13071796000022">There
is also a need for a general discretion to disregard income and/or
capital where it was or is equitable in all the circumstances. In the
2000 regulations, there was a general discretion to disregard where it
was equitable in all the circumstances. There has been no evidence of
abuse of those regulations in that way. Why is it not in these
regulations? We all know cases, perhaps involving mental capacity or
disability, where justice demands legal help by way of legal aid. But
because of the inflexibility of these regulations there is, to coin a
phrase, no way out. There is certainly no way out with the exceptional
funding scheme, which perhaps now should be called the very rarely
exceptional funding scheme because it is not relevant to cases that are
still in scope. Section 10 of LASPO is there for areas of law now out
of scope. I fear the fact that there is no flexibility, and that the
£8,000 capital is such a ridiculously low figure, shows that the
purpose of these regulations is not to advance justice but
to restrict it—not to help people sort out their legal problems
but to make absolutely certain that they
cannot<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T20:05:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071796000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0002.htm#13071796000023">In
2009, when austerity had already begun, the Labour Government did not
reduce eligibility for legal aid in social welfare law; they increased
it by 5%. We recognised that at a time of economic difficulties, it is
crucial to ensure that people get quality and inexpensive legal advice
to sort out their legal problems rather than go without any access,
with the consequences that everyone knows; namely, that problems
multiply and magnify until often in the end the state has to pick up
the pieces arising out of problems with debt, welfare benefit mistakes
and loss of employment. That decision by that Government was not a
soft-hearted decision: it was based on a realisation that not only is
access to justice right in principle; in this instance it saves the
state money. It is not rocket science; it is just something that this
Government do not
get<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T20:06:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071796000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0002.htm#13071796000024">I
look forward to the contributions of other noble Lords in this debate

to address the debate itself. When I was a Minister, like him, I had to
undergo from time to time debates where the government policies that I
was trying to defend were attacked from start to finish by practically
everyone who spoke. It is not a comfortable position but I would argue
that there is still a duty on Ministers to answer the debate being
heard at that time. I do not think that the Minister did himself
justice last Thursday in the debate that the noble Baroness, Lady
Deech, began, but I know that he can. Anyone who heard him at Question

are already cases of people not getting legal aid when they should.
That is a consequence of so much social welfare law being taken out of

that are still in scope but as a result of the regulations that we are
debating tonight they are not able to access justice. That is a bit of
a scandal. The Government should think again about these regulations

Pannick:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Bach, for
moving this Motion. Over the past three years he has played an
essential role in identifying with forensic skill and great eloquence
the defects in the series of measures that this Government have brought
forward to limit legal aid in our society. The noble Lord has
repeatedly pointed out, accurately and with some degree of force, that
legal aid is a vital cement in our civil society. There is no point
whatever in this place conferring rights unless people have the
opportunity to vindicate them. It would be a great shame if there were
further reductions in the ability of persons other than the wealthy to
vindicate their rights by legal
process<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T20:09:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071798000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0002.htm#13071798000002">The
essential defect in these regulations is their treatment of the capital
sums owned by persons who are otherwise eligible for legal aid. I
cannot understand why the regulations apply different criteria to
capital from the criteria that are applicable in welfare law.
Regulation 8(2) provides that any person with more than £8,000
in capital will be denied legal aid, even though welfare benefits law
provides that persons qualify for means-tested benefits even though
they have up to £16,000 of
capital<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T20:11:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071798000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0002.htm#13071798000003">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T20:11:38"></hs_TimeCode>
is a further discrepancy in that the welfare benefits system ignores
the value of a person’s home. These legal aid regulations will
disregard only £100,000 of equity in property, under Regulation
39; and £100,000 of any mortgage, under Regulation 37. The
inevitable result is that many people who own their own homes will be
excluded from legal aid, even though they cannot in practice access the
capital<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T20:11:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071798000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0002.htm#13071798000004">All
this is very unfortunate, given that the Legal Aid, Sentencing and
Punishment of Offenders Act has already reduced the scope of legal aid
so that it is now skeletal. I am very concerned that even
within the much reduced scope of legal aid under that Act, people who
have no income and who are therefore eligible for welfare benefits will
be unable to obtain legal advice and assistance. As the noble Lord,
Lord Bach, said, there is a vital need in the regulations for more
flexibility<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T20:12:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071798000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0002.htm#13071798000005">The
Minister will no doubt tell us, as he usually does, that funds are
limited and that economies are needed, but to adopt criteria, as the
regulations do, which are more onerous than the criteria applied to
welfare benefits is simply irrational and fails to understand the vital
function of legal aid itself as a welfare benefit for the needy in our

Government and their predecessors have pushed very hard to widen house
ownership in the past 20 or 30 years. It has been successful.
Ownership, of modest homes, has spread to all corners of society. To
include their value in the assessment of legal aid places an unfair
burden on a modest number of the population who have striven to own
their own home. Not only that, but having owned one’s own home
one now finds that it has to be sold to pay for one’s care in
old age. It may have to be sold to raise money if one has the
misfortune to be involved in expensive litigation. Not only that but,
heaven forbid, it might even come to a mansion tax. In other words, one
is putting much too much pressure on that wide swathe of population
that owns a home of relatively modest value. They might have bought it
for a five-figure sum years ago, but they will now find their house in
that more than £100,000, and then £8,000, asset rank,
depriving them of legal

trouble for judges, who are trying to control what is going on in court

parity of arms between the self-representing litigant and the litigant
on the other side who may be able to afford a barrister. Complaints are

represents very little in the way of property. Values are substantially
higher than would be reflected in other parts of the country. A
pensioner on pension credit whose mortgage has been paid off and whose
home is worth £110,000, who could be living in a very modest
property in London to exceed that figure, will be ineligible for legal
aid. A recently unemployed father on jobseeker’s allowance in
negative equity with a home worth £240,000 and a mortgage of

of Legal Aid in England and Wales</I>, the Government

removal of capital passporting. Two others were to cap the subject
matter of the dispute disregard at £100,000 for all forms of
civil legal services, and to increase the levels of income based
contributions to a maximum of 30% of monthly disposable income. Before
the 1 April, someone receiving certain income-based benefits such as
income support, could have up to £16,000 disposable capital but
be automatically passported through the means test and be deemed
eligible for legal aid. However, a person not receiving a passporting

applicants with similar levels of capital may or may not be eligible
for legal aid depending on the source of their income. To achieve
greater internal alignment and fairness to all applicants for legal

passporting benefits should have their capital assessed in the same way
as it is assessed for others, although they would still be passported
through the income side of the test.</hs_para>

response to that consultation in June 2011 confirmed that they would
take forward the proposal, and this is reflected in these new
regulations. Therefore, under the new rules, all applicants for civil
legal aid are subject to the same capital eligibility test. This means
that any applicant with disposable capital above £8,000 will be
ineligible for civil legal aid, regardless of whether they are in
receipt of benefits. If the applicant’s disposable capital is
more than £3,000 but does not exceed £8,000, they will be
required to make a contribution from that capital towards the costs of
the legally aided
services.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071798000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0002.htm#13071798000032">Ensuring
that the capital assets of all applicants are subject to the same
eligibility test helps to focus limited public legal aid funds on the
most financially vulnerable clients and means that those who can afford
to pay, or can contribute towards the costs, do so. It is estimated
that assessing all applicants’ disposable capital will result in
approximately £10 million a year of savings in steady state.
This is not insignificant against a backdrop of continuing pressure on
public finances, where we need to continue to bear down on the cost of
legal aid to ensure we are getting the best deal for the taxpayer.
Disposable capital comprises all capital assets, including equity in
land and buildings, money held in a bank, investments, stocks, shares
and the monetary value of valuable items. However, there are certain
disregards in calculating the amount of an individual’s
disposable capital, including for mortgages and for equity in an
individual’s home.</hs_para>

explain what these are. If an applicant is contesting property with
their partner, their share of capital is assessed individually. Any
outstanding mortgage, up to the value of £100,000, is 
<?notus-xml column=833?>subtracted from the value of the property. Where assets are in joint
names, they will generally be treated as owned in equal shares. Thus
the remaining equity is divided equally between the parties. The first
£100,000 of the applicant’s equity is then disregarded
under the subject matter of the dispute rule. The applicant then
receives a further £100,000 equity disregard if the property is
their main dwelling. If the remaining equity exceeds the £8,000
capital limit, the applicant will be financially ineligible for legal
aid.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071798000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0002.htm#13071798000034">In
practice, this means that only those applicants who are contesting
large amounts of capital, or homes registered in joint names that are
valued in excess of £500,000, and where there is a mortgage of
at least £100,000, are excluded on capital grounds. We do not
think it unfair or unreasonable that people who are disputing
substantial assets fall outside eligibility for civil legal
aid.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13071798000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0002.htm#13071798000035">Where a
property is not the subject matter of the dispute, is in an
applicant’s sole name and worth more than £208,000, that
applicant would not normally be eligible for legal aid. However, a
further disregard of up to £100,000 would apply if the applicant

These are areas where people’s need for legal aid is acute: for
instance, housing repossession, domestic violence or community care.
With these regulations the Government have said, on the one hand,
“These are the areas where legal aid is appropriate”, but
on the other, “Those of you who may be poor in income terms but

That subject was covered in large measure by the noble Lord in his

by the time the Bill leaves your Lordships’ House, we need as

gross tariff as a schedule to the Bill. It is based on the national
institute analysis that sought to determine average civil compensation
awards for mesothelioma cases based on recent experience. It is set out
in yearly age bands and stretches from age 40—that
is, at date of diagnosis—to age 94. The tariff is intended to be
a proxy for levels
of<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> compensation
that would have been awarded had individual compensation assessments
been made. It is expressed in gross amounts, so if payments are made at
less than 100%, the relevant percentage would apply. The tariff
excludes the legal cost of reimbursement. I understand that the amounts
included in that gross tariff, reflected in the proposed new schedule,
are not contentious and are accepted by the Government, the ABI and the
Asbestos Victims Support Group campaigners and its professional
advisers. However, it would be good to have the Minister’s

resist the tariff going in a schedule to the Bill, although we would
contend that that is where it belongs. An alternative approach is
acceptable to us, as long as there is certainty on the gross starting
tariff. The amendment also calls for the tariff to be uprated annually
by reference to inflation. We have adopted the CPI measure and the
Minister has already said that that is the intent. However, again, it
is important to have that on the

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, we have Amendments 25 and 29
in this group and we support Amendments 17 and 30 in the name of my
noble friend Lord Howarth, although there is some overlap between the
two sets of amendments. I will be brief as I believe we are pushing at
an open door from what the Minister told us earlier today. Amendment 25
calls for the establishment of an oversight committee to monitor,
review and report to the Secretary of State on the overall arrangements
touched on by this legislation. It would undertake this task in
relation not only to the scheme and the technical committee but to the
tracing office and the electronic information gateway. They fit
together, and we know that the insurance industry sees them as an
integrated package.</hs_para>

idea of an oversight committee was originally prompted by concerns over
the extent to which the insurance industry may be engaged in all of
this, possibly as a scheme administrator—although we welcome the
news announced earlier today about the open competition—and
certainly on the technical committee, running the tracing office and
devising the portal. An oversight committee properly constituted would
provide a level of reassurance for those whom the scheme should benefit
and would be a counterweight to the level of engagement of a powerful
industry with clear financial interests in how it all works, as my
noble friend Lord Howarth so powerfully demonstrated. That is why we
believe that the oversight committee should include representatives of
asbestos victims support groups and the trade unions which have
supported them, with an independent chair. Effective oversight would,
we suggest, help the hard-pressed DWP resources, 
<?notus-xml column=841?>and an annual report from the committee could be incorporated with an

Committee and in meetings thereafter, the Minister has expressed
support for an oversight committee. We heard it again today and I know
that he has considered various options. While disappointed not to see a
specific amendment from the Government today, we hope for an assurance
that they will introduce an amendment when the Bill passes to the House
of Commons. I was not quite sure that it was clear enough in the noble
Lord’s opening statement, so I hope he will clarify matters. It
would be good if that assurance spelt out at least the bare bones of
what is
intended<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T21:07:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071798000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0002.htm#13071798000077">Amendment
29 is a return to the issue of support for sufferers of other asbestos
and long-latency diseases. The payment scheme in this Bill relates to
those diagnosed with diffuse mesothelioma. It therefore excludes other
asbestos-related diseases such as asbestos-related lung cancer and
asbestosis. It also includes other work-related, non-asbestos diseases
such as pneumoconiosis. The DWP’s June 2013 analysis quotes the
Health and Safety Executive data on industrial diseases, which has an
annual estimate of sufferers of asbestos-related diseases of
some 3,500—that excludes those suffering from
mesothelioma—and of non-asbestos-related industrial diseases of
some 4,200. Many of these will face the same problem in identifying a
negligent employer or an employer liability insurer. The DWP’s
June note acknowledges that many of the diseases covered do not share
the same characteristics as mesothelioma, and that their severity and
progression may vary, depending on the heaviness of exposure to
asbestos<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T21:08:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071798000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0002.htm#13071798000078">It
also highlights the fact that, for example, only a small proportion of
asbestos-related lung cancers are compensated through government
schemes, because of the range of different causes of lung cancer that
mask an asbestos cause. Notwithstanding this, and perhaps somewhat
strangely, in computing the effect of extending the scheme, it has been
assumed in the data that the same proportion of those with diffuse
mesothelioma who can access the scheme proposed by the Bill will be
able to access an extended scheme, that the same level of scheme
payment will be received, and that the same amount of benefit will be
recovered. These are fairly broad-brush assumptions, to say the least.
In resisting this amendment, the Minister will doubtless point to the
costs of bringing forward an extension of the scheme. On the basis of
their estimates over a 10-year period, they suggest that there will be
5,100 successful applicants for other asbestos-related diseases and
6,100 with non-asbestos work-related diseases. There will be additional
levy on insurers of £478 million and £564 million
respectively.</hs_para>

figures are shocking. It is not so much the amounts as the suggestion
that over the 10-year period some 11,200 people will miss out. By how
much will depend on benefit recovery arrangements, but they could miss
out to the tune of £1 billion. If the concentration were just on
the other asbestos-related diseases, not expanding the scheme will deny
5,100 people, who will miss out just because an employer has gone out
of business or cannot be located and a relevant insurer cannot be
established.</hs_para>

amendment requires the Secretary of State to bring forward proposals
within a year to establish other schemes to cover these other diseases.
We have been clear that we do not want the pursuit of broader coverage
to hold up the scheme for diffuse mesothelioma, and there is no reason
why acceptance of the amendment should cause this to happen. It is
accepted that it will be difficult to graft onto the mesothelioma
scheme the tariff approach, given the varying degrees of suffering that
some of the other diseases entail, and that there may be convoluted
issues around causation. Therefore, while continuing to acknowledge the
merits of the mesothelioma scheme, we should no longer look aside from
those people—many thousands on the Government’s own
figures—who face terrible suffering because of the negligence or
breach of statutory duty of an employer. This is all the more important
where access to the state lump sum and social security support is more
difficult, as it is for some.</hs_para>

payment was made to a minor or to a person who lacks capacity. I am
content that the selection process for our scheme administrator, in

are several areas in this amendment that I wish to reflect

the Employers’ Liability Tracing Office. ELTO is a private
company funded by the insurance industry. The Association of British
Insurers is currently looking to recruit representatives from
stakeholder groups to sit on the board of ELTO to monitor
its performance. Having stakeholder representatives on the board of
ELTO will allow them to directly influence the work of ELTO, as well as
ensure that it is performing to expected standards. In addition, we
expect that the technical committee will sit within ELTO. If that
expectation is realised, the ELTO board, which by then should include
stakeholder representatives, will be able to monitor the performance of
the technical committee and report on this through the annual ELTO
report. It will also allow stakeholders to identify any concerns and

the proposal in the amendment to report on the proposed electronic
information gateway. There may well be merits in looking at how any
gateway interacts with the scheme in order to ensure that it is
supporting, rather than hindering, applications. However, we cannot yet
say whether or not an electronic information gateway will be
introduced, so it is not possible to work out the details of how this
monitoring may be carried out. I prefer a non-legislative solution to
this issue that allows us to set up a proportionate and flexible
oversight committee, made up from all stakeholder groups that have a
stake in the operation of the scheme. It will provide valuable support

come to the amendment that would require a report to be published
giving details of government plans to establish future schemes. I
understand the desire for us to commit to going further and to helping
as many people as we can. We have discussed before why the particular
nature of mesothelioma lends itself to a discrete scheme aimed at that
disease alone, and that separate schemes would be required to provide
for sufferers of other diseases. While I understand and agree with the
intention to keep up this momentum and for a commitment to do further
work, I am afraid that I must reject this amendment. First, the complex
and varied nature of other diseases would necessitate significantly
more complex schemes that could take several variables into account.
They are the ones that the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, pointed to, and
include the severity of the disease and the contributory factors when

I draw noble Lords’ attention to the work of ELTO and the recent
work of the FCA in conjunction with ELTO that I spoke about earlier.
These two bodies have taken very positive steps towards correcting the
market failure in the insurance industry. In the first year, the
overall rate of successful traces increased from 46% to 71%, while the
rate of successful mesothelioma traces increased from 34% to 58%. This
work should not be underestimated. It may be that, in time, the work of
these bodies brings further improvement until one day we get to a stage
where the number of untraced records is so small that additional
schemes are not needed. We need to give the measures that are in place
sufficient time to show the progress that they are
making.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071798000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0002.htm#13071798000093">The
figures show that a much more significant improvement has been made in
the overall tracing rate than in the rate of tracing mesothelioma-only
cases. This shows that a scheme for mesothelioma cases is necessary,
and reinforces my point that the steps we have taken already may in the
fullness of time be sufficient for other
diseases.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071798000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0002.htm#13071798000094">We
also need to be mindful of the resource constraints within which we
have to operate. The DWP will rightly focus on ensuring that the scheme
operates as expected in its first years. There will undoubtedly be
teething problems, as there are in any new scheme. Although we will do
our utmost to minimise them, it would be naive to think that there will
be none. It would therefore not be the best use of limited resources to
divert them into producing a report into other schemes. As I have
indicated, this would be complex to design and would be at the expense
of the scheme that we
have.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071798000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0002.htm#13071798000095">While I
do not accept the amendment, which would commit us and future
Governments to producing a formal report every year, I am alive to the
need to review the situation as time goes by. Certainly, once we are
able to see how much ELTO has improved things and how well the payment
scheme has worked, the Government will be in a position to undertake
such a review. I remind noble Lords that provision exists for

Howarth of Newport:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the
Minister for his full response to each amendment in this group. He
tells us that sufficient safeguards are in place to ensure the
objectivity and unbiased behaviour of the scheme administrator, and
asks us to accept that the open procurement competition will be a
contributor to guaranteeing that impartiality. However, it may be
difficult for him to find anybody competent to run the scheme who is
not in the industry, so the problem of conflict is likely to persist. I
do not wish continuously to impugn the motives of people in the
insurance industry, and would like to think that those who are
appointed to work as administrators of the scheme will set out with the
best of honourable
intentions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071798000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0002.htm#13071798000099">We
are always being warned, however, that we should avoid situations of
conflict of interest and, from time to time, people are vulnerable to
the temptations that conflicts of interest present to them. There is a
whole institutional temptation here because the insurance industry
stands to gain significantly from cases not going to court and from
cases not being handled generously by administrators, who will have
such absolute powers of determination. I therefore remain concerned
about this, although the Minister offered a little reassurance about
Clause 4(3)(b) when he said that it was harmless. Certainly, on the
face of it, the wording of it seems to give enormously large powers to
the administrator, but I accept what he said about the purpose of that
particular piece of drafting.</hs_para>

oversight committee, it is good that the Minister agrees that there
should be such a committee; he made his points about getting
stakeholders on to the board of ELTO and the technical committee being
within ELTO, so that stakeholders would be in a position to keep an eye
on the performance of those parts of the whole apparatus. He said,
understandably enough, that he wants a non-legislative solution, but we
will probably want to know a good deal more about the provision that he
intends to propose before 
<?notus-xml column=846?>we can agree that it is right in principle that
there should be a non-legislative solution. My noble friends may want

to the report on future schemes, the Minister again rejected the
proposal from my noble friends, as he does not want to divert scarce
resources—no doubt of time and energy, as well as
money—to preparing that. He suggested that the complexities of
the other asbestos-related conditions are such that they would not fit
well into the mould of the scheme that we are legislating for in this
Bill. I hope, however, that the Minister will continue to reflect on
the fact that there are—as my noble friends explained
compellingly, and rather movingly—large numbers of people who
are suffering from these other conditions. At the moment they have all
too little support; we know that there is a vast disparity between the
lump sums that are paid under government schemes and the awards that
the courts provide and the lesser payments that the scheme will
provide. These people continue to be seriously disadvantaged and we
cannot be happy with
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T21:27:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071798000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0003.htm#13071798000102">I
was pleased that the Minister was able to tell us that the success rate
in tracing has been improving spectacularly, which suggests that it
could always have happened if there had been the will on the part of
the industry to do this. We must be pleased that it is now doing better
but, equally, we must have means to keep the pressure up and to ensure
that, in the future, there is not again any deterioration in the
success rate of tracing and, above all, that elements of the industry
do not resume the practice of conveniently losing or shredding
documentation, which is the great scandal. They are getting off all too

the annual report, the subject of Amendment 30, the Minister wanted us
to accept that scrutiny and reviews are already planned and that we do
not need to worry because everybody will keep an eye on it and
Parliament does not need to be too bothered by it. I do not think that
the annual Written Ministerial Statement that the noble Lord has
promised is good enough for Parliament, even when combined with the
online information that he said will be made available. He will have
seen already the intensity of interest in your Lordships’ House
and he will certainly see both greater intensity of interest in the
House of Commons when it comes to scrutinise this Bill and a wide and
deep concern across the country. I think that it is a proper
responsibility of Parliament to invigilate this process, and an annual
report is a convenient and practical means for Parliament to do so.

slightly less reassured about the oversight committee than I expected
to be, partly because it looks as though it might be a fragmented
effort, given the ELTO structure. The noble Lord said that his
preference was for a non-legislative solution, and we do not have a
problem with that. However, will a conclusion be reached as to whether
the non-legislative 
<?notus-xml column=847?>solution will be found by the time the alternative
of a legislative solution passes in the Commons? It would be a pity if

James of Blackheath:</Member></B> My Lords, the sole purpose of this
amendment is to make sure that we do not lose track of the very
important but parallel issue of asbestosis that affects members of the
fighting services. I remind noble Lords of the amendments made some six
years ago by the former Government that were very much against the
interests of former officers and servicemen, particularly in the Royal
Navy. There was a very bad record of asbestos-related illness,
particularly on ships such as HMS “Furious”, HMS
“Albion” and, above all, the Royal Yacht
“Britannia”, which was a floating
death-trap.</hs_para>

consequences of the amendments made six years ago were that the amount
of compensation one was entitled to was reduced very drastically; in
addition, the period of claim was limited so severely that it could not
possibly allow for the inevitable eventual development of the disease
and the justification for a claim. Armed Forces people have been very
poorly treated in this and although we are talking here of a different
branch of asbestosis, I remind your Lordships that in the insurance
world they would not make that distinction. Nobody ever wrote a policy
for mesothelioma on its own any more than they wrote one for asbestosis
without embracing the generality of it. This is an important factor
that has sometimes been forgotten in this
debate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071798000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0003.htm#13071798000118">In the
matter of the Armed Forces, these people have been left
exposed—to a greater or lesser degree—to all the
consequences we have been talking about that are associated with this
disease. They are going to be somewhat perplexed when they find out
that the Government have gone out of their way to pass this splendid
Bill to help sufferers of a different form of asbestosis while doing
nothing whatever to amend the drastic reductions made six years ago to
the terms available to
servicemen.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071798000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0003.htm#13071798000119">I
was very grateful for a joint meeting between the Minister’s
department and the MoD, from which I came away with the great
expectation that there would be a thorough analysis of data
of the actual exposure and the number of cases concerned, and that this
would open the way for some sort of parallel accommodation to be
agreed. There was no question of dipping into this Bill’s pot to
pass money over but there was the suggestion of perhaps a separate pot
being arrived at by the Ministry of Defence, which could help to close
the gap between the have-nots of the Armed Forces and the haves who
will benefit from this

amendment is that, unfortunately, the MoD has not provided the expected
data. I talked to the noble Lord, Lord West, about this matter earlier
and he showed a keen interest. He was an officer on one of the ships
that was greatly affected and had the 
<?notus-xml column=850?>responsibility of overseeing the engine room replenishment of one. He
therefore regards himself as a prime candidate for the condition in

“Callous Government plan for the many and abandon
their heroes of the seas”. We do not want that, and it would be
unfair anyway. We need a commitment to do something for Armed Forces

exactly the same wording, in the hope that by then we will have a more
positive approach to how we can arrive at a solution to give some
parallel improvement to the terms available to former members of the

raised this issue with passion and commitment in Committee and,
doubtless, previously. I am not sure that I understand all the detail
of the proposition he is advancing and the background case but I
certainly encourage him to continue with his campaign. I think that the
noble Lord was seeking to advance the argument that some people are
being dealt with under this Bill but that there are members of our
Armed Forces who are not being dealt with on an equivalent basis. He
keeps referring to asbestosis. This Bill relates to diffuse
mesothelioma, which is different from asbestosis. In fact, we have just
set our face against developing a scheme that has broader implications

asbestosis<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T21:43:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071798000124" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0003.htm#13071798000124"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord James of Blackheath" PimsId="5103" UID="13071798000184" xid="1943" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0003.htm#13071798000184">Lord
James of Blackheath:</Member></B> I thank the noble Lord for that. I
hope I made clear the distinction that I am looking at this matter from
an insurance industry point of view; namely, that asbestosis covered
everything and that six years ago we inadvertently disadvantaged the
Armed Forces so severely that we have put them way below the benchmark
that we are seeking in this Bill for sufferers of mesothelioma. A
comparison is bound to be struck. Veterans’ groups are bound to
pick it up and there will be people who are very unhappy to see this

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> I am grateful to the noble Lord for
that clarification, and I accept the point. If he is comparing people
with diffuse mesothelioma who are not being treated on an equivalent

address that in this

remind my noble friend of the distinctive characteristics of
mesothelioma that allow for a relatively straightforward and quick
scheme to be established, such as its undeniable link to asbestos
exposure, the lack of co-causality with other factors such as smoking,
and the very short time between diagnosis of the symptoms and death.
These unique elements of diffuse mesothelioma allow us to establish a

note, too, that the mesothelioma payment scheme proposed in the Bill
addresses a market failure related to employer’s liability
insurance. Armed Forces personnel are not normally covered by
employer’s liability insurance due to the Government

required to fund payments for individuals for whom they have never

may be helpful to the noble Lord if I also mention a major practical
issue raised by the amendment. In 2016, as in all years, local

the referendum will be scheduled for the first Thursday in May 2016.
The sunset clause would take effect on 30 April 2016, right in the
middle of local authorities’ preparations to hold a referendum.
Furthermore, if the amendment is accepted, by that time, the provision
would have disappeared from the statute book and rendered regulations
relating to the conduct of the referendum and its effect in direct
conflict with the legislation on which they are based. That is because
they would be based on the definition of the relevant basic amount of
council tax, including rather than excluding levies. That would be a
recipe for confusion and would not be fair on local authorities or
council tax payers. So, for reasons of principle and practicality, the

Tope:</Member></B> My Lords, I will take a little longer on
this amendment as we return to the subject of statutory notices. The
amendment is simple, clear and straightforward. It would remove the
requirement to publish statutory notices in local newspapers, but it
would require local authorities still to publish those notices in such
a way as is likely to bring them to the attention of the greatest
number of people in the area most
concerned<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T21:52:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

amendment were well rehearsed at Second Reading and in Grand Committee.
We know that the legislation dates from 40 years ago, in 1972, which
was a very different world. I think that there is common agreement that
the publication of a statutory notice, often in small print and in an
impenetrable form, in the middle or back pages of a local paper is,
arguably, the least effective means of communication. Those arguments
were well rehearsed in Grand Committee and I shall not repeat them all
today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T21:52:53"></hs_TimeCode>. What were
much less well rehearsed were any arguments against the actual
amendment. Instead, noble Lords made perfectly valid points with which
I agreed but which had nothing to do with the purpose of the amendment.
Let me begin by being clear what the amendment does not do. It does not
remove or weaken in any way the requirement on local authorities to
publish statutory notices. Indeed, I would argue that it strengthens
that requirement, because it requires them to publish them in a way
most likely to reach the greatest number of people in an area, which a
statutory notice in a local newspaper certainly does not do. Nor does
it make any changes to the 163 enactments, which I listed in another
amendment, that require publication of a statutory notice. I happen to
agree with the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, when he said that a cull of
those enactments is probably overdue, but that is not part of the
amendment. It can, and I hope will, happen
anyway<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T21:53:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307184000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0003.htm#1307184000011">I
agree with noble Lords who said that not everyone looks at the local
authority website or even uses the web at all. The amendment
deliberately does not specify how statutory publication should be done,
only that it should be done in the best way. In some areas, and in some
circumstances, that may well be through the local newspaper.</hs_para>

speakers in Grand Committee agreed that the requirement to publish in a
local newspaper came from a very different age. Communication methods
have changed hugely in the intervening 40 years. So have local
newspapers themselves. There are fewer of them, they are generally less
well-read and, as the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, graphically illustrated
in a previous debate earlier on Report, the coverage of local
government by local newspapers has also changed. It is a fast-changing
world, not least in the field of mass communication. It would be wrong
now for government to specify how statutory notices should be
published. That would be likely to be out of date even before it was
enacted, let alone in 40 years’ time. It would also not be in
keeping with the spirit of localism. There are very different
circumstances in different areas. Some are fortunate enough to have a
well-read daily local newspaper; some still have widely read and paid
for weekly newspapers; and some have weekly free sheets that may reach
a greater proportion of the local population. But many areas now have
none of those things. Not all statutory notices are appropriate to a
whole council area. Publication of some can be much better targeted at
the particular area to which they relate. These are all reasons why I
believe that, while the statutory requirement to publish these public
notices must remain, the decision on the most effective way to
communicate them should be with the local authority and not enshrined
in statute.</hs_para>

last year local authorities spent £26 million on the publication
of statutory notices in local newspapers as well as a further
£17 million voluntarily on general advertising. This
was really the only argument put forward against the purpose of the
amendment; that local newspapers are in difficulty because of the
changes in communication and that therefore local authorities should
continue to be required by law, not by choice, to subsidise them
through the publication of statutory notices. I do not think anyone
regards that as a tenable argument at any time, but it is certainly not
one in the face of the severe budget pressures on all local authorities
now. Many local authorities, including my own, have good and positive
partnerships with the local press that are of mutual benefit and that
is surely the route down which we should all be encouraged to
go.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307184000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0003.htm#1307184000014">Although

has to use a means of publicity that will bring it to the attention of
the greatest number of people in the area. I hope no local authority

council’s main page, and the website has to be easy to navigate
to get the information off it. I also ask the Government to introduce
an automatic postcode search facility so that someone who wants to
inquire, as they do on a planning matter, can input a postcode, as they
can in most local authorities, and get a straightforward list of
current planning applications in that area. I propose that the same

noble Lord’s proposition is in many ways sensible. Even under
the present law, councils certainly have the right to advertise in ways
additional to publication in newspapers if they choose.
Eventually, no doubt, that will become pretty much par for the course.
The Government could facilitate the process by at least reviewing now
rather than at some definite point in the future the list of items that
have to be publicised, because frankly it is ridiculous. Planning
matters are clearly important. However, when it comes to dog control
orders or their revocation, the licensing of buskers, charges for
street trading licences, abandoned shopping trolleys and charges for
public baths and wash-houses, one wonders whether a formal statutory
notice of any kind is desired. It is certainly not required, and
certainly not in paid publications.</hs_para>

accountability. The noble Lord has highlighted the cost of statutory
notices and suggested that local newspapers are one of the least
effective ways to convey information to people. We do not agree.
Research by GfK for the Newspaper Society found that the reach of local
newspapers was much greater than council websites: 67% of
the respondents to that survey had read or looked at their local
newspaper for at least a couple of minutes within the past seven days,
compared with 9% who had viewed their council website. Some 34% of
adults questioned had not accessed the internet at all in the last 12
months.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307184000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0003.htm#1307184000029">The
most recent internet access quarterly update from the Office for

qualified support. I acknowledge, of course, that that was four years

notices being advertised in newspapers is that in some of our larger
cities there are large communities that have no language to read a
local newspaper. It can be very helpful when the council passes out
information in appropriate languages, and I do not think that any of
the debate we have had so far has given any indication of

polls are a very important way in which matters of interest can be
aired and views sought, but they are governed by some fairly archaic
legislation, which is more than 40 years old and contained in Schedule
12 to the Local Government Act 1972, and they are open to abuse. The
issues are fourfold. First, incredibly minimal requirements are
necessary to trigger a parish poll, which I have referred to in the
past. Secondly, although it has to be on a parish matter,
“parish matter” as a term of art is nowhere defined.
Thirdly, once triggered, the costs incurred by the principal authority
in conducting the 
<?notus-xml column=861?>poll are recoverable from the parish. While these may not be great in
the overall score of things, in proportionate terms for a parish
budget, they are pretty significant. Fourthly, there is no obligation
to act on the poll, regardless of its outcome. Indeed, a number of
polls have had very poor turnouts and inconclusive or even
contradictory outcomes, as was outlined in the report by Action with
Communities in Rural
England.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307184000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-0003.htm#1307184000048">This

something. I believe, and have to accept, that the regulatory reform

it from Grand Committee, would be for a Private Member’s Bill to
be brought forward in a future Session, but at the cost of a further
delay. If that is the only way forward, although it seems an awfully
long-winded way of achieving something that really should be fairly
uncontroversial, so be it. I would be happy to offer any assistance or

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, these amendments refine the
provisions in the Bill that enable existing inspectorates to co-operate
with an inspector, appointed by the Secretary of State, to inspect a
best-value authority under Section 10 of the Local Government Act 1999,
as amended by this Bill. Clause 33 and Schedule 10 to the Bill give a
similar power to the Secretary of State’s existing power to ask
for an inspection of a best-value authority. This is intended for use
as a last resort in very serious cases, such as the ongoing
intervention in
Doncaster<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T22:27:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

2, 25, 36, 38, 54 and 72 of Schedule 12 amend existing legislation to
enable existing inspectorates to co-operate with such a corporate
governance inspection, as they sometimes do at present. The relevant
bodies and inspectors are Ofsted, the Care Quality Commission, Her
Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary, Her Majesty’s
Chief Inspector of Prisons, Her Majesty’s Inspector of
Probation, and Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of the Crown
Prosecution
Service<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T22:28:09"></hs_TimeCode>. The
amendments to each of these paragraphs of Schedule 12, which take the
same approach in each case, achieve this policy intention more cleanly.
They remove the provision suggesting that a chief inspector may be
appointed under new Section 10 as an inspector by the Secretary of
State to inspect a local authority. This is because it is unlikely that
it would be the chief inspector himself or herself who would undertake
the inspection. Instead, it simply states that the chief
inspector—or the commission, in the case of the Care Quality
Commission —may do anything they think appropriate to
“facilitate” such an inspection. This could include
releasing staff to form part of an inspection team. All these
amendments allow bodies to co-operate; they do not compel them to do
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T22:28:56"></hs_TimeCode>. We believe
that these amendments simplify and clarify our approach without
significantly affecting the impact of the Bill. I beg to

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, in response to the
Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee report on the Bill, we
have amended Clause 38. Provisions for compliance with the code now
include the power for the Secretary of State to make a direction
requiring individual authorities to comply with some or all of the
code, and that the exercise of the power to ensure compliance with the
publicity code in relation to classes of, or to all, local authorities
should be made by an affirmative statutory instrument. As a consequence
of this, we are required to amend the Long Title of the Bill to
accurately reflect that a requirement to comply may not be the result
solely of a direction. Our amendment makes this clear in the Long Title
of the Bill. I beg to

Beecham:</Member></B> My Lords, we have spent some time debating the
requirements on local authorities to comply with the code of practice.
I suppose this is our last opportunity to comment before Third Reading
and the eventual passage of the Bill to the House of Commons. It is an
opportunity to reiterate the problems that many of us envisage in the
Government’s approach.</hs_para>

grateful to the Government for clarifying the Title of the Bill, but
the Title is almost irrelevant to the substance with which councils
will have to contend. The further accretion to the Secretary of State
of powers to direct individual councils is not a concession from the
original proposition that a direction can be given to all councils. In
replying to this short debate, will the Minister indicate exactly how
the Secretary of State intends to go about giving his directions,
whether to individual local authorities or to categories of local
authorities? Would he envisage doing so after consultation and, if so,
with whom: individual authorities or the Local Government
Association?</hs_para>

Secretary of State involve in the consultation process? For example,
before making any direction, would he consult the local print media,
which he purports to be most concerned about? How would he do that,
particularly if he is issuing a general direction? Has the Secretary of
State consulted at all, with anybody, about this proposal, thus far? It
would be interesting to know whether he has had meetings with, for
example, the Newspaper Society, if that is the correct name of the

those points. Many of them deserve further conversation in the
Corridors and elsewhere. The Bill is part of a long process by which we
hope to devolve more power to the cities and local authorities of
England—an objective that I know the noble Lord shares. There
are many difficulties in doing so, particularly during a recession when
there are insufficient funds to do everything that one would like to.

first order, on the Surveillance Camera Code of Practice, follows on
from Section 30 of the 2012 Act and reflects a coalition agreement
commitment to the further regulation of CCTV. The Government support
the use of CCTV, automatic number plate
recognition—ANPR—systems and other surveillance camera
systems to cut crime and protect the public. In general terms, the
public support their use. However, that support is conditional on these
cameras being used proportionately to meet a legitimate aim and being
used effectively in meeting their intended purpose. For too long we
have seen the use of CCTV and the advance of technology develop without
a proper regulatory framework, with ever greater potential for
surveillance and ever greater potential to interfere with
citizens’ rights and freedoms.</hs_para>

encourage compliance with the code, review its operation and provide
advice about it. Noble Lords may be aware that the Secondary

this code. The code is based on 12 guiding principles which are
applicable to any overt operation of CCTV in public places. Those who
work to these guiding principles will be better placed to reassure the
public about their intentions and to share images and information of
evidential value with the police and the criminal justice system to
help investigate crime and bring criminals to justice. The commissioner
will provide additional information which complements the guiding

and seeks to add the three non-territorial police forces—the
British Transport Police, the Civil Nuclear Constabulary and the
Ministry of Defence Police—and the Serious Organised Crime
Agency to the list of relevant authorities which will be placed under a
duty to have regard to the code from the outset. Each has been
consulted over the proposal and each has consented to it. Our intention
in expanding the list to additional forces is to provide further
assurance to the public that overt surveillance by the state is being
effectively and transparently
regulated.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071783000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071783000008">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T15:49:23"></hs_TimeCode>
turn to the second order before the Committee today, which brings into

determinations as provided for by the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012.
This order implements an important element of the Government’s
commitment, set out in the coalition’s<I> </I>programme for
government, to restore balance between the protection of
individuals’ rights and protecting the public in respect of
police retention of DNA and fingerprints.</hs_para>

propose to commence the substantive powers in the 2012 Act from October
this year. This will mark an important change. From this point, with
the exception of convicted individuals, DNA and fingerprint material
will not be held indefinitely. This guidance deals with a limited
exception whereby it may be necessary to extend retention for the
purposes of national security. We want to ensure that, in exercising
their powers to extend retention by the making of a national security 
<?notus-xml column=285?>determination, chief officers and chief constables are doing so in an
open, transparent and consistent way. This guidance seeks to achieve
that. The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T15:49:23"></hs_TimeCode>
guidance is introduced pursuant to Section 22 of the 2012 Act and is
applicable throughout the United Kingdom. It sets out the basic
principles underpinning the new powers, specific requirements governing
consideration of necessity and proportionality and clear processes for
making or renewing a national security determination, including
appropriate direction as to the responsibilities of chief officers or
chief
constables.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071783000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071783000010">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T15:49:23"></hs_TimeCode>

new commissioner for the retention and use of biometric
material—the Biometrics Commissioner, Mr Alastair
MacGregor QC. The retention of biometric data by the state
is a justifiable interference with the right under Article 8 of the
European Convention on Human Rights where it is necessary and
proportionate to do so and where it is in accordance with clearly

Earl of Erroll:</Member></B> My Lords, I will say a few words because
this is an area in which I take an interest. In principle, I have no
trouble with using surveillance cameras around the place to find out
what happened after an event and, in some cases, to anticipate what
might happen. The only thing that has ever worried me is when things
are linked together to try to surveil and track a population around.
From that point of view, ANPR cameras could be used for purposes other
than traffic management and could start to be used for tracking people.
A lot of that stuff involves data protection, so all this looks fairly
innocuous.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071783000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071783000014">The
main thing that I am worried about is whether it really does anything.
At the end of it all, these are all good words. Are we just adding more
cost and stuff than can be more effectively used elsewhere? It looks
like we have just invented a couple of extra posts, which will be very
nice for someone; it will do a bit more box-ticking so everyone will
think that it has all been covered. However, if it starts being really
effective, it will interrupt other people’s jobs where they do
need cameras, and make them more difficult.</hs_para>

words of caution: let us not waste public money on something that is
merely a cosmetic exercise. At the same time, many of the issues that
do matter in this are covered by the Data Protection Act, for instance
accurate databases and things like that. So they are already covered
elsewhere. Will having an extra commissioner really make a difference?
It is obvious that I am sceptical about it. It does not really address

is the point that the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, made. Can the Minister
say where in this order is anything that restricts the use of CCTV by
individuals or private companies and makes any difference to the
potential exposure of criminality that the Government have identified?
I am not sure what that means in the context of this order. It may be a
government objective, but it is nowhere in this order that I can find,
because only public bodies—mainly the police and local
authorities—are bound by the order before us today. The
consultation and the order will not prohibit the installation of CCTV.

it is not just the document; to compound the issue, the Home Secretary
has also created a new bureaucracy in the form of a Surveillance Camera
Commissioner at an annual cost of £250,000 a year. When I first
read that, I thought that I had slipped back into an episode of
“Yes Minister”, with Jim Hacker speaking. You could
almost write the script about a Surveillance Camera Commissioner. What
is not clear from the order is how the commissioner will ensure
adherence to the code. Will the commissioner have any statutory powers
to do so? How will the commissioner investigate? Will there be any
legal power to surrender CCTV recordings? Will there be any sanctions
if people do not comply with the guidance, as outlined in the order? I
cannot see any sanctions in
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T16:00:59"></hs_TimeCode>. The code
therefore becomes nonsense if there are no powers or sanctions. What is

scrutiny committee asked what the code added to existing powers. That
issue has to be addressed, particularly when taking into account the
additional cost of about £1.6 million. This is significant. The
police budget has been cut by a massive 20% and we are losing 15,000
police officers, the vast majority of whom will be taken from the front
line—those on the beat and involved in community safety work. We
could end up with the nonsense that in order to use CCTV, police forces
have to employ staff to do back-office work to comply with all the
bureaucracy while police officers are being lost from the front line. I
am convinced that that is not what the Minister

that we are not against oversight. There is a common-sense element in
the code of conduct but, as the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, also said,
these tasks are already being undertaken. I have no doubt that room can
be found for improvement but it seems that this common-sense approach
will be replaced by a monstrous paper trail that will include reviews,
consultations and technical assessments. From the impact assessment,
the cost of all this will be something like £14.1 million a
year. The impact assessment also states that that is a best guess. The
government readily accept that the cost could be as high as
£29

one considers how onerous the requirements of the code of practice are,
£14.1 million might be a conservative estimate. There need to be
annual reviews of every CCTV camera and the possible effects on
privacy. How will that be done? If guidance is being issued there will
be obligations as to how that can be carried out. It would be helpful
if the Minister could shed any light on that. All the cameras that we
are 
<?notus-xml column=288?>talking about are those in public places, so there presumably needs to
be an assessment of who goes to those public spaces in order to be able
to ascertain the effects on their privacy. I cannot see any other way
in which that task could be undertaken. Even if the Minister can
reassure me that it does not mean that, there needs to be guidance as
to exactly what is meant, and the guidance is not clear. Local
authorities will produce their own ways of interpreting the guidance
and say, “That is what we have to do, so we will not have a CCTV

authorities have to create teams to provide information about CCTV, at
an expected cost of up to £114,000 for each team. There has to
be an assessment of all the information being stored, and a lot of it
is stored because the police may want the information at a later date

has to be given to any “operation, technical and competency
standards”, with a general principle that all the technology
should comply. I am not clear what that means, but perhaps the Minister
can help me. Is it intended that through the regulations the local
authority or police, at a potentially huge cost, may have to replace
equipment not because a force does not think it is working or because a
replacement would be cost effective but because the equipment does not
match the technical standards created by the Surveillance Camera
Commissioner—although we are not yet clear as to what that role
is? The commissioner could set standards with which every force must
comply and they could then have to change their
equipment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T16:04:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

are good reasons to think that the costs may be even higher than the
Government estimate. There are 11 “guiding principles” in
the code of conduct, seven of which involve no monetary cost, yet each
places bureaucratic obligations on the police. That will be expensive.
The impact assessment claims that the cost of complying with the scheme
will be found from existing budgets. If the Minister can tell me how,
that would be extremely helpful. Were local government and the police
specifically consulted on the costs; did they agree that they could
meet them from existing budgets; and were they aware of the huge costs
involved?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071783000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071783000027">The

Government often say that something is cost neutral. That means that it
is cost neutral to the Government; the costs are passed further down
the line to other organisations, because somebody has to pay for
bureaucracy. Is the Minister able to explain where within the existing
budgets that money can be found? Whenever I have asked questions in
your Lordships’ House about budgets or service cuts for police
and local authorities, Ministers say that it is a matter for local
government or the police, not for them, and that it is a local
decision. Ministers create the conditions that lead to cuts, because
Ministers set the budget. If the Government are saying that extra
expenditure has to come out of the existing budget, there is an
indirect relationship. Although the local 
<?notus-xml column=289?>police or council may decide what cuts have to be made as a result, the
decision has been imposed by government or Ministers. That is not
localism, it is evading responsibility. If this order is passed, police
and local councils will have no choice but to comply with the
additional bureaucracy, and I do not know how they will pay for
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071783000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071783000029">We are
already seeing huge cuts in CCTV. We have seen thousands of street
lights being switched off across the country, including in my county,
because local authorities cannot afford the increased electricity
bills. What use will CCTV be at night if there are no lights on the
streets? I shall not go into detail, but Gloria De Piero MP has used
freedom of information requests to get some idea of how CCTV has been
affected by local authority budget changes and budget cuts. The figures
we have relate to public-facing CCTV cameras, not to private property
cameras. Craven District Council in North Yorkshire has cut all its
CCTV cameras since 2010; in Trafford there has been a 53% cut; in
Blackpool it is nearly 50%; and in Bolsover it is 44%. Across the
country we are seeing the number of CCTV cameras operated by local
authorities being cut, and I cannot see the order before us today
making things any easier for local authorities. The huge bureaucracy
and paperwork will make things more difficult for local
authorities.</hs_para>

what is the policy intention behind this? I have read the stated
intention, and like the Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee I
cannot see that what is in the order complies with that policy
intention. If it is really to achieve better oversight of CCTV, which
we would not necessarily oppose, there is very little in this new
regime to deliver that, but is the effect not more likely to be to
reduce the number of CCTV cameras across the country? If that is the
case, the level of bureaucracy and the cost to local authorities and
the police will make it a pretty well designed instrument, because that
seems to be the result. I do not think that that is what the public
want.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071783000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071783000031">At the

to biometric information, which is a hugely important issue. The
Minister will recall our original concerns about the changes that the
Government are introducing in relation to holding DNA evidence. There
was a long debate in your Lordships' House, and I do not intend to
repeat those debates today. The Protection of Freedoms Bill was
introduced into Parliament in February 2011; it got Royal Assent on 1
May 2012, yet over a year later the Government are only now taking
legal steps to provide the guidance needed on holding biometric
materials such as DNA evidence and fingerprints, allowing for an
extension  if it is in the interests of national security. I do
not 
<?notus-xml column=290?>understand why that has taken so long, given the implications for
national security. There is nothing more important for any Government

current position is that biometric evidence, however vital it may be in
fighting crime and protecting security, must be destroyed after it has
been held for three years, if the person is not convicted or charged
with an offence. Yet it is possible to keep it for longer if the law
enforcement agencies are of the view that it is in the interests of
national security to do so. The guidance to give effect to that is
before us today and has taken some time to reach us. I fully understand
and accept the point that such technical and important guidance must be
fit for purpose. However, the Government have known about the need for
such provision since February 2011, so it is hardly a surprise that we
would have to have such
guidance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T16:11:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071783000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071783000034">I
have three key questions other than the one that I have just asked.
What system has been in place until now for applying for an extension
to hold biometric data for longer? The Minister will know from previous
debates on the Bill addressed in the Intelligence and Security
Committee that national security relies on bringing evidence together
from various different sources, places and times—so it is a bit
of a jigsaw that has to be put together. Since this provision came in,
there must have been cases in which data held may have been older than
three years, so what process has been used? Have there been any
applications to extend beyond the three years? I am told that there
have not been any, but I find that quite startling, and if the Minister
could confirm that or give me further information it would be really
helpful. That has huge implications for public safety since Royal

Baroness, Lady Smith. It is the first time that we have had the chance

arise because we have not had a chance to discuss these matters before.

have to say to the noble Earl that this is not a cosmetic measure; it
is not designed as a patch, to cover something up. The recent report of

apply to just 2% of the cameras in place, because the vast majority are
in commercial premises or private

have to say that, untypically, the noble Baroness exercised a degree of
hyperbole on this issue. That is rather out of character as I usually
agree with her view on issues and think that she sees them clearly.
However, in this case she appears to have become confused about the
cost and efficiency of the measure and its objectives, which are, after
all, to protect the privacy and rights of our citizens in a public
place where surveillance cameras operate. I think it is reasonable that
public authorities utilising cameras in public places are placed under
an obligation to ensure that those cameras are used properly, that the
images are used for the purposes for which they were designed and not
used improperly, and that there is a responsibility to ensure that
these things are effective. If the noble Baroness wonders why this does
not apply to the conventional “one in, two out”
regulatory reforms,  it is because this concerns not business
but state institutions—local authorities and the
police—and they are not included in this policy

noble Baroness asked about the cost of the commissioner. The figure of
£250,000 is the cost that the previous Administration identified
for an interim CCTV regulator. The commissioner will encourage, advise

not believe that “proportionately” does not have a

benefits of better quality images, help in investigating crime and

requirement to replace an existing system but organisations will be
encouraged to work to approved operational and occupational standards.

Therefore, if some of the definitions are vague and general rather than
specific, that is because the code does not contain a detailed,
prescriptive and one-size-fits-all guidance which defines every
circumstance. Some may regard it as vague but  it is a matter
for operators to assess necessity and proportionality when using CCTV
and ANPR, and to then test their judgment with the public and their

say SOCA they mean the National Crime Agency, which will be its

have viewed the establishment of the CCTV and surveillance commissioner
and his role by the response of authorities such as SOCA and, for that
matter, the non-territorial police forces which have been pleased to
sign up to this code. They can see the huge advantages of being part 
<?notus-xml column=293?>of a group of law enforcement agencies that receive

noble Baroness also asked about the mechanism for enforcing compliance
with the code. Perhaps I may explain. Local authorities and the police
will be under a duty to have regard to the code when exercising their
functions. The SI will place a statutory duty on them. When a local
authority or police force fails to do so, it will be vulnerable to
judicial review for a breach of that statutory duty. The possibility of
being subject to such a legal challenge will incentivise local
authorities and the police to adhere to that statutory duty.</hs_para>

talk about DNA and the noble Baroness’s comments in that area.
This is complex legislation, as she will appreciate, and
considerable work has been carried out to date to prepare
the relevant systems and to consult law enforcement authorities. Having
made the policy decision, we undertook a full public consultation and
carefully considered the responses before we brought this guidance
forward. I am satisfied that it is in time and is specifically designed

particularly asked about the current legislative framework against
which decisions have been made. The current legislative regime whereby
material is held by the police and other law enforcement authorities is
still in effect. There have been no applications to extend the

noble Earl, Lord Erroll, will be pleased to hear that under guiding
principles one and two we are clear that the use of CCTV or ANPR must
be in pursuit of a legitimate aim and meet a pressing need and must

countervailing balance that this code is designed to reconcile. These

intention is to give communities confidence that camera systems are
used to meet a legitimate aim, that they are necessary and

understand—and that they are used effectively to meet a stated
purpose. The vast majority of systems are operated privately. However,
local authorities and the police are key organisations in ensuring the
safety and security of our public places—which is where the code
is initially focused—and therefore have a significant interest
in the use of CCTV. That is why the starting point of our journey of
incremental and measured regulation is to place them under a duty to
have regard to the code. CCTV is used in a wide variety of settings for
a wide variety of purposes. Therefore, the code does not contain
detailed, prescriptive, one-size-fits-all guidance which attempts to
define every circumstance. Some may regard this as vague, but it is for
operators to assess necessity and proportionality when using CCTV and
then to test their judgment with the public and partners. This code
will help them do so.</hs_para>

this complex and challenging arena we have always been clear that our

Rennison characterised this as taking small but practical steps, and I

We are taking action to reassure the public and as a driver of public
standards. We in government remain committed to ensuring that, where
the powers which these orders seek are granted, they are necessary,
proportionate and transparent and, crucially, that their use goes hand
in hand with respect for our long-held individual rights and freedoms.

However, I am not convinced that he has addressed them all. I am still
unclear on the point, which he did not answer, on the enforcement or
monitoring powers of the Surveillance Camera Commissioner. He said that
it was a statutory duty on local authorities or the police, so the fear
of judicial review would ensure that they carry this out. My experience
of local authorities is that the fears of the cost of judicial review
often lead them not to take an action that they would otherwise take.
My fear would be that the costs of a judicial review—and there
are 12 principles under which they could be judicially
reviewed—could lead a number of local authorities to say that

the capacity and powers to comprehensively tackle consumer detriment in

is widespread support for the transfer to the FCA, and agreement that
we have got the balance about right. We first consulted at the end of
2010 on broad policy options. Then, following extensive work on regime
design with firms and consumer groups, the Government published
detailed proposals on 6 March this
year.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071783000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071783000061">The
statutory instruments that I am introducing today take into account the
feedback that we received from a wide range of stakeholders during the
consultation period. These instruments effect the transfer of consumer
credit regulation to the FCA under powers taken in the Financial
Services Act 2012. The RAO order amends the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000, or FSMA, and associated secondary legislation, to
bring consumer credit into the scope of FCA regulation and to apply the
FSMA regulatory regime to consumer
credit<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T16:34:55"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T16:34:53"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T16:34:56"></hs_TimeCode>.
The order also makes extensive amendments to  
<?notus-xml column=296?>the Consumer Credit Act 1974—or CCA—in relation to the
functions of the OFT. The consumer credit order ensures that retained
provisions of the CCA continue to apply appropriately and can be
effectively
enforced.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071783000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071783000062">Before
turning to the specifics of the new regulatory regime for consumer
credit, I draw attention to the scope of regulated activity in this
market. The Government’s policy is to carry forward the current
scope of consumer credit regulation. We are, however, making a few key
changes that were well supported by respondents to the consultation.
The most significant of these relates to a new growth sector in the
market, peer-to-peer lending.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13071783000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071783000063">The RAO order creates a
new, bespoke regulated activity that brings together what peer-to-peer
platforms do when they arrange credit agreements between lenders and
borrowers. It ensures that the consumers who borrow and those who lend
via the platform are both protected. Secondly we are aligning the
definitions of credit broking and credit intermediation, and narrowing
the definition of credit reference agencies to capture only those who
provide credit references as a primary activity. Thirdly, we are
removing third party tracing agents from the scope of regulation, as
they do not carry on a financial activity. Fourthly, we are clarifying
that not-for-profit debt advice is carried out by way of business and
is therefore a regulated activity. This was called for by
not-for-profit debt advice providers themselves, and will ensure
consumer protection is consistent. Finally, in view of responses to the
consultation, we are extending the current exemption for insolvency
practitioners to include advice that they may reasonably provide in
their professional capacity in anticipation of a formal
appointment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071783000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071783000064">I
now turn to the three main components of the new FSMA regime for
consumer credit. The first one is authorisation. Unless they are
exempt, all firms will need to be authorised by the FCA in order to
carry on consumer credit business. They will have to meet a much higher
bar than under the current licensing regime. The RAO order revokes the
OFT licensing regime to allow for the move to authorisation under FSMA,
but the Government recognise that a one-size-fits-all approach will not
deliver its vision for a competitive and sustainable credit
market.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071783000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071783000065">The
RAO order therefore provides for what is known as the “limited
permission regime”. To be eligible for this regime, firms must
only conduct certain specified lower-risk credit activity. The quid pro
quo is that those firms will face lower costs and fewer regulatory
burdens. The RAO order defines the activities which are eligible for
the limited permission regime. They include: credit brokerage, where
firms do this as a secondary activity to their main business, such as
car dealers; and sellers of goods and services who provide credit
without interest or charges, for example a gym or golf
club.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071783000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071783000066">The FCA
must assess firms against prescribed threshold conditions. Limited
permission firms will have to meet a smaller, modified set of threshold
conditions which have been designed to suit the lower-risk nature of
their business. For example, a simpler solvency test 

<?notus-xml column=297?>will apply. One of the advantages of the FCA regime is that it can make
rules to tackle actual or potential detriment in the market much more
quickly than the Government could legislate. Its rules are also binding
on firms, while the OFT’s guidance is not.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13071783000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071783000067">The RAO order repeals
certain provisions of the CCA and related secondary legislation to
allow the FCA to make rules in these areas. It revokes advertising
requirements so that the FCA can make rules under its financial
promotions regime instead and it revokes “form and
content” requirements in the CCA so that the FCA can cover these
requirements in its rules.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13071783000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071783000068">Finally on enforcement,
the FCA has a more flexible and robust enforcement toolkit than the
OFT, and will have greater resources to take action on
breaches of its rules. The RAO order therefore provides that certain
requirements in the CCA that are currently subject to criminal
penalties should instead be punishable by the FCA’s regulatory
powers. Some criminal offences in the CCA will remain in force under
the FCA regime, where there is greatest risk of consumer
detriment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071783000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071783000069">In
addition, the consumer credit order applies the FCA enforcement toolkit
to provisions of the CCA which will still apply under the new regime.
It also ensures that there is no double jeopardy—a person may
not be convicted of an offence under the CCA where the FCA has already
used its enforcement powers in relation to the same breach. The
consumer credit order provides for the continued role of local
authority trading standards, and the Department of Enterprise, Trade
and Investment in Northern Ireland, in investigating and prosecuting
offences under the CCA. Trading standards will play an important new
role in supporting the FCA to police the regulatory boundary and to
take action against illegal loan
sharks.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071783000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071783000070">Consumer
credit firms should not see this transfer as wiping the slate clean.
The RAO order gives the FCA the power to take enforcement action
against any breach of the CCA prior to the transfer, but it will not be
able to apply its rules or sanctions retrospectively, as this would be
unfair to firms. Unlike the OFT, the FCA also has the power to require
redress to be paid to consumers. In addition, customers of consumer
credit firms will still have recourse to the Financial Ombudsman
Service.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13071783000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071783000071">The
timetable for the transfer to the FCA is driven by the demise of the
OFT on 31 March. We recognise that this is a challenging timetable for
firms, which is why the Government have introduced provisions to help
smooth the transition. We recognise that firms will need to prepare for
FCA authorisation, so the RAO order allows the FCA to grant interim
permissions based on firms’ existing OFT licences. Interim
permissions will allow firms to continue to trade from 1 April, but all
firms will still need to apply for full authorisation by April
2016.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13071783000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071783000072">This
approach will mean business as usual for firms but allows the FCA to
deploy its full enforcement powers to protect consumers during this
period. The RAO order includes transitional provisions, so that firms
who have already applied to the OFT for a  
<?notus-xml column=298?>licence do not have to reapply from scratch for FCA authorisation and
live enforcement action will be seamlessly picked up by the new
regulator.</hs_para>

committed to promoting continuity in the conduct requirements that
firms need to abide by to ensure that the compliance burden is
manageable. The RAO order allows the FCA to designate, as rules,
secondary legislation made under Part 2 of the CCA. The new regulator
is also incentivised to replicate CCA requirements in its rules. Where
rules are the same, or substantially the same, as CCA provisions, the
requirement to conduct a cost-benefit analysis is waived and the
FCA’s competition duty does not

Kirkwood of Kirkhope:</Member></B> My Lords, I will make a brief
intervention in the Grand Committee’s proceedings. These are
extensive and important orders. I confess that I defer to the knowledge
that other noble Lords have on consumer credit, but I would like to tax
my noble friend with a request for assurances about payday loans and
unsecured household credit. There have been some big changes in that
field and I want to detain the Committee for a moment on that
issue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071783000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071783000076">However,
before I do that—and my noble friend will understand why I have
been put up to this in a moment—I want to raise an issue about
Article 9 of the consumer credit order, which includes provisions for
local weights and measures authorities to institute proceedings in
England and Wales, and in Northern Ireland. Given my accent, he will
not be surprised to know that I would like an assurance that this does
not mean that weights and measures enforcement cannot take place in
Scotland. I am sure that he will tell me that it is a Section 30 order
or some such thing but I will be able to go home more safely at the
weekend if I can say that I asked the
question.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071783000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071783000077">I
come at these orders from the niche direction of the whole question
about unsecured short-term household lending. Other people have been
doing a lot of work on this but the matter has been drawn to my
attention simply because of the massive increase that we have started
to see in the amounts of money rolled over and borrowed under the
existing payday loan
provisions.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13071783000150" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071783000150">4.45

of Fair Trading has been doing its best but is struggling to regulate
this area and to get a handle on what has been going on. I remind noble
Lords that the OFT’s most recent report on payday loans
estimated that between £2 billion and £2.2 billion was
borrowed in paydays loans in 2011-12, up from £900 million in
2008-09; so a very big and fast increase has taken place in a very
short space of time. I am not asking for payday loans to be closed down
or for anything like that because the industry that provides them is
responding to a real and urgent need and, in the context of the period
of austerity that we are going through, that need must be recognised,
but I am saying that they need to be regulated better. Clients who seek
payday lenders’ services need better protection.</hs_para>

orders cannot suddenly magic the OFT into the FCA. That would be
unrealistic, but if we cannot do something until the Financial Conduct
Authority is established, can the Minister assure the Grand Committee
that the time between now and April will be used to make sure that all
the powers, toolkits and the rest of it that we hear so much about will
be put in place so that when we get to April 2014 he and the
ministerial team will be confident that the FCA is on top of an
increasing problem of lack of regulation?</hs_para>

proper and proportionate—I make no complaint about
it—regulation for micro-businesses. Micro-businesses deserve
exemption from some of the heavy-duty regulation but some payday
organisations that provide unsecured short-term household lending are
small businesses, and some of the bigger risks come from smaller
businesses. Some of the bigger companies are a bit better organised and
are better able to be observed and controlled. Can I have an assurance
that the exemptions for micro-businesses are not going to let slip
through some providers of these services who may be as big a part of
the problem, although on a smaller scale, as some of their more
professional, larger scale colleagues in the industry?</hs_para>

Financial Conduct Authority to address what the OFT put its finger on
as the problem in this market? The market is failing because the way it
works is that lenders have to grab and get an established connection
with a borrower. Speed is of the essence. The advertising is now so
slick and makes it all seem so easy. Speed comes before proper
assessments of the creditworthiness of the families and households
applying for these loans. The OFT is right in putting its finger on
that as the key issue. If the Financial Conduct Authority is not alive
to that, it may not be able to do the job that I hope it will
do.</hs_para>

authorities, aggressive debt collection and the proportion of payday
loans that are rolled over are serious problems. I hope my noble friend
will take all these things back to the department and that he is able
to give the Grand Committee an assurance this afternoon that, come
April next year, we will be confident we can deal with them. I am
concerned not just about the effect on low-income households but the
increase in fraud. Professional fraudsters are stealing people’s
identities and using payday lenders to defraud people’s bank
accounts. That is an increasing problem that we need powers to deal

Government have any plans between now and April to talk to responsible
organisations such as the Consumer Finance Association, which has a
code of practice, although it is not strong enough? I would like there
to be a statutory code of practice and the association wants to resist

final question is about credit unions, which I think are included in
these orders. I should be grateful if my noble friend could confirm
that. My concern is  
<?notus-xml column=300?>that people are starting to think that credit unions are similar to
providers of unsecured, short-term household lending, and they are not
the same. Credit unions have an important role but they do not give out
money to people who have trouble in repaying debts, because that would
destroy the credibility of credit unions. I am getting serious
representations from people in the credit union sector who say that
they are being confused and conflated with those short-term lenders in
a way that is not constructive.</hs_para>

orders are the right thing to do. I am sure that the Government have
carried out the consultation properly and the orders are a real and
urgent upgrade on the 1974 consumer credit rules. I am in favour of all
that. However, perhaps my noble friend can reassure me on some of these
issues. I am sorry to detain the Committee on a relatively small matter
but these could become big issues. It is therefore right for the Grand
Committee to spend some time considering
them.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-17?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_17_PT_1/56F6917EC342D3AD7AF9A166CF86EB9A42CA1191" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 17 July 2013">Wednesday,

Kramer:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall comment on three aspects of
these orders, of which I am very supportive. First, I welcome the
elements of the order that create a regulated environment for
peer-to-peer lending platforms. While most industries have spent their
energies saying, “Remove red tape”, this industry has
been coming to the Government and the regulator saying, “Please
can we have proper regulation”, because it knows that without
proper regulation, rogue players can come in from the outside,
undermine the credibility of the industry and probably provoke a
regulator to come in with inappropriately heavy regulation as a
consequence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T16:53:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Minister reassure me that the industry has been involved in negotiating
and structuring these regulations? It looks to me as though they meet
the test, but can he assure me that they reflect the kind of safeguards
that that industry has already outlined in its code of conduct,
established under its trade association? I think that that code was to
be the basis of most of the discussions. It is a real way forward
because, as we know, the banks have been very challenged over providing
the credit we need in our economy, and peer-to-peer lending is
increasingly coming in to fill that gap to provide both competition and
additional resource, which is useful and
positive<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T16:53:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

I pick up my noble friend’s comments on payday lenders. I share
many of his concerns about this industry. Indeed, the whole House did
so, as the Minister will remember, during the passage of Financial
Services Bill in 2012, when an amendment that we colloquially called
the Sassoon-Mitchell amendment put very effective powers into the hands
of the FCA. When it takes over supervision of this industry in April
2014, the FCA will have powers to regulate, manage and supervise
it.</hs_para>

powers were written with an eye to some of the regulation that has been
put in place in Florida—I believe 13 states use this kind of
regulation—which includes the ability to limit the amount of
borrowing to $500 outstanding at any one time, to limit the number of
outstanding loans, to cap interest rates and fees and to provide for a
grace repayment period.  It also has various other
characteristics. I would like 
<?notus-xml column=301?>assurance that the order does not compromise the wide range of powers
sought by the House in the legislation and in the
amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T16:55:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071783000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071783000090">Like
my noble friend, I am concerned with the impression the industry is
giving of marketing energetically and raising its interest rates above
and beyond what most of us already regard as high levels. I hope the
FCA will be able to hit the ground
running<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T16:55:53"></hs_TimeCode>. That
means going through the consultation process and deciding how it will
manage that
regulation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T16:55:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071783000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071783000091">It
is also a systems issue. As the Minister knows, the various US states
that have regulation have systems that allow them to see on a real-time
basis what applications are taking place, what the amount is, what the
interest rate is, unauthorised roll-overs and so on, and they are able
to manage the process. This not only allows the regulator to look at
the data and intervene in retrospect, but enables it to set up systems
so that if the rules are contravened an automatic decline shows up and
an offending loan cannot be made. While it needs time to put such a
system into place, I wonder how likely it is that the FCA will be in a
position to deliver it as early as April and, if not, what the thinking
is around
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T16:56:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071783000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071783000092">I
am afraid my next question comes from my lack of understanding and my
difficulty in reading my way through orders. It concerns social impact
investment, the financial promotions order and its relationship to the
FCA. The Minister will know that if, for example, a social enterprise
attempts to create a new community hall, it can turn to members of the
local community and ask them to donate. However, it cannot ask them to
invest without offending Finprom unless it has become a qualified
investment, which is financially impossible for any kind of small
project<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T16:57:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071783000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071783000093">We
raised this issue during the passage of the Financial Services Bill and
the Government expressed their desire to deal with this problem and
enable a project to turn to individuals with small amounts of money and
allow them to invest. Will the FCA have the necessary power to make
those changes under Finprom without having to come back for new primary
legislation? I assume that, in the end, we will see a kind of
materiality clause that will state that if you want to make an
investment of less than £500, or whatever, you will not have to

Hayter of Kentish Town:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for
his clarity in introducing these orders. Very often we are not wholly
behind what the Government are doing but, on this one, we are. We
welcome the move to the FCA and these
SIs.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T16:59:11"></hs_TimeCode> I have
supported the policy behind them for a long time, but I do not know for
how long my party has done so. We particularly welcome the powers they
give to the FCA. As the Minister implied, they will be its enforcement
tool kit for consumer credit and will strengthen its powers to punish
misconduct. We also welcome the Government’s decision not to
exempt small businesses, as that might have weakened, rather than
strengthened, consumer
protection<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T17:00:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

concerns, and a very small one which I hope to raise. I know that the
first will be familiar to the Minister. It is the concern raised by R3
Group about insolvency practitioners who are already regulated, albeit
by a plethora of recognised professional bodies. R3 pointed out that
the exemption for insolvency practitioners—which both it and we
welcome—might not work quite as intended if it covers only any
pre-appointment advice which is reasonably likely to lead to an
appointment. R3 is worried that IPs, having given advice and heard
more, may consider that formal insolvency is not the right way forward.
R3’s question is whether the earlier advice that it gives
requires it to be FCA authorised. It has a slight worry that if it did,
it might find itself recommending insolvency in order to avoid double
regulation, which would clearly not  be to anyone’s
advantage. It might have to do that to avoid double regulation or bite
the bullet and be regulated. However, that would probably be too
expensive, particularly for smaller IPs. Is the Minister sure that the
term “acting with reasonable contemplation of appointment as an
insolvency practitioner” will not force IPs into launching a
formal insolvency, rather than giving general debt advice, in order to
avoid such double regulation? I hope that the Minister will give some
comfort on that today. If not, perhaps he will talk further to R3 about
it.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13071783000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071783000096">The
second issue is payday loans, and I make no apology for returning to
it. This has already been raised by the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood of
Kirkhope, and the noble Baroness, Lady Kramer. We and the charity
StepChange are concerned that the staged transition to FCA regulation
may allow payday loan companies to continue to run on a business model
based on multiple rollovers of debt, with predictable and rather
serious consequences for the borrower.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13071783000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071783000097">We very much welcome
the FCA’s power to consider business models, especially given
what we know about this industry. The OFT found that half the revenue
of these firms comes from loans that are rolled over at least once and
one-fifth of payday loan companies’ revenue comes from customers
who are forced to roll over a loan four or more times. Their very
business models are based on people getting into debt trouble. That is
why the scrutiny of business models is so much needed, but—to
echo other noble Lords—it is needed now, not in three
years’ time.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13071783000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071783000098">Will the Minister
confirm that the interim permissions regime, which allows for staged
transition to FCA regulation, will not be used by payday loan companies
to delay that scrutiny of their business models by the FCA? The
Minister knows better than us, because it is in the impact assessment,
the figures from StepChange, which suggest that unaffordable,
unsuitable credit is a key contributor to its clients’ debt
problems. Furthermore, many of the worst examples of poor conduct seen
by that charity include firms that operate very much at the margins,
lending to lower income and vulnerable consumers. We do not want to
wait until 2016 for the FCA to cast
its—hopefully—extremely beady eye over these
firms’ business models. We therefore look forward to quick and
effective implementation of the FCA credit regime.</hs_para>

is a very small issue—the FLA has raised with us its anxiety
that the new rule book is not yet available in draft, and it wants the
Government and the FCA to ensure that arrangements for the new regime
coming into operation in April will be promulgated in good time. That
does not seem too much to ask; we simply seek some reassurance on

he will know, it would be completely improper in Scotland for anybody

noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, concentrated, as other noble Lords did to a
certain extent, on payday loans and what is happening about them. The
FCA has a formal responsibility for managing payday loans from next
April, but it is not waiting until next April to start to think about
the issue. Indeed, it is going to set out draft rules in September for
a consultation. I am sure that many people will want to get involved in
that consultation. That gives a certain amount of time to get rules in
place by the time when it takes over the formal responsibility. The FCA
has also reminded the banks of their obligations when cancelling
continuous payments authorities, which is obviously an issue for payday
lending
consumers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T17:07:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071783000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071783000104">The
noble Lord said that he hopes that micro-businesses will not be exempt
from this provision because they are very important even if they are
not very big. The micro-business exemption does not apply in this area;
that would obviously compromise consumer protection because there are a
lot of small businesses. Although we tend to be familiar with a number
of brand names, very often the worst
offenders—literally—are small, local
operations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T17:08:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071783000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071783000105">BIS
has launched a review on voluntary payday codes that will survey
lenders and consumers and provide a sense of progress. The codes were
implemented by lenders last November, and we expect BIS to publish
findings in the autumn. We hope that will put pressure on the trade
association to raise its game ahead of
April<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T17:08:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071783000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071783000106">The
noble Lord made the point that credit unions are not a perfect
substitution for payday lenders, and I completely agree. The extent to
which the two seem to be equated with the good and bad ends of
short-term lending has rather surprised me. Credit unions are really
vehicles for people who take a longer-term view of a loan. If you are
signed up to a credit union and have established a history of savings,
it can help if you 
<?notus-xml column=304?>get into difficulties and can act in the same way as a payday lender
would, but they are very different. The other problem is that, in many
areas, there is no credit union of any significance or it is quite
difficult to find out about
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T17:09:22"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T17:08:58"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T17:07:57"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T17:09:30"></hs_TimeCode>.
Having said that, the Government support credit unions, and we are
doing a number of things to make them more attractive, such as
increasing the maximum rate of interest that they can charge from 2% to
3%, but as the noble Lord said, they are a partial solution to the
problem.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13071783000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071783000107">The
noble Baroness, Lady Kramer, began by discussing peer-to-peer lending.
I congratulate her on the extent to which she has been able to raise
peer-to-peer lending as an issue in this House and more broadly and has
encouraged the Government to come forward with these regulations. We
are in discussions with the industry. We were actively engaged with it
before we produced these regulations and it has been very keen to be
regulated because it, in a sense, gives a stamp of authority to the
whole sector which, for a new sector, is very welcome.</hs_para>

noble Baroness asked whether the order in any way compromises the
FCA’s ability to undertake a number of things, including a
capping power. It does not. That was one of the issues that it will
consider as it thinks about its rule-making power. She described the
conditions in Florida which have enabled very effective regulation of
payday loans while enabling the payday loans sector to carry on in
operation. Like her, I have been extremely impressed by the extent to
which Florida has managed to go a long way to solving the issue that we
are grappling with, which is how to ensure that poorer people can get
access to money when they need it but do not get fleeced. We hope that
there are some lessons that we can take from Florida, not least on a
real-time payday database, which the FCA is very interested in. If we
decide to go for it, it will take a bit of time to put in place, and it
would be expecting a bit too much to think that we could do that by
next April.</hs_para>

asked about social investor exemption from the financial promotions
regime. These regulations do not affect the rules in that respect. We
are actively looking at how we can resolve the problem she explained.
The challenge is, as ever, to make sure that we are able to put in
place a regime that not only allows the kind of lending she is talking
about but safeguards consumers. That is the balance we are still
grappling
with.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071783000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071783000110">The
noble Baroness, Lady Hayter, asked about R3 and its concern that in
extending the exemption for insolvency practitioners, in part in
response to its concern, we might not have got it quite right. We are
pretty confident that the extended exemption that is designed to give
comfort to insolvency practitioners when giving advice will do that
without running the risk that she talked about. Officials have been and
will remain in discussions with them to make sure that their fears are
put to rest. We do not believe that they need to be
worried.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071783000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071783000111">The
noble Baroness raised multiple rollovers of debt and hoped that we will
not delay work in this area. The FCA is very much on to this. There is
no

it will look
at.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071783000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071783000112">Finally,

It will be available in draft early in the autumn, and we hope that the

apologies to noble Lords for beginning this debate with a technical and
specialised subject, I will introduce the Companies and Partnerships
(Accounts and Audit) Regulations 2013. These regulations close a

businesses most affected by these amendments are limited partnership
investment funds in the private equity, venture capital and real estate
sectors. These specialised businesses have been aware of the planned
changes as far back as 2010, when BIS consulted on closing the relevant
loophole. The loophole allows certain limited partnerships to avoid
preparing accounts and reports where these are required by EU law.
Accounts such as those for limited liability companies are required
where the partnerships in question are structured to have limited
liability.</hs_para>

regulations started as soon as this problem was identified. Following
the 2010 consultation, we have continued to work with stakeholders who
responded. Certain other unlimited companies and general partnerships
are also affected, but we believe there are few, if any, of these in
existence. The amendments in the regulations close the theoretical
loophole that is available here
also.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071783000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071783000118">By<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T17:23:31"></hs_TimeCode>
way of background, these loopholes originated in the 1993 regulations
that first implemented the relevant provisions of the EU fourth
directive, after they had been inserted into that directive, in 1990.
The defective drafting that caused the loophole was then carried over
from the 1993 regulations into the Companies Act 2006 and the
Partnerships (Accounts) Regulations 2008, so these regulations insert a
new systematic definition of a “qualifying partnership”
into the Partnerships (Accounts) Regulations 2008. This replaces the
previous definition, which contained a technical drafting error.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T17:24:13"></hs_TimeCode> regulations
also insert a systematic definition of what is meant by the
“members” of a qualifying partnership. This addresses
similar technical drafting errors and removes some previous unnecessary
gold-plating.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071783000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071783000119">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T17:24:39"></hs_TimeCode>
regulations also correct the implementation of requirements relating to
the publication of a qualifying partnership’s accounts. Where a
qualifying partnership has no UK limited company members or EU
equivalents, the regulations ensure that accounts are made available
for inspection in the UK. Where the qualifying partnership has no
principal place of business in the UK, it will now have to publish the
accounts at a nominated UK address. This ensures that the directive
requirements are met and are enforceable under UK
law.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071783000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071783000120">These
regulations also address a separate and unrelated issue in order to
complete the implementation of the 2009 EU electronic money directive.
They ensure that all forms of e-money issuers are covered by the full
audit and accounting requirements of the Companies Act. These
amendments were missed when the EU electronic money directive was
implemented in 2011 and have been developed in consultation with the
Financial Conduct Authority and HM
Treasury.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071783000121" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071783000121">The
impact assessment published with these regulations estimates that
between 5,000 and 8,000 limited partnership investment funds are
affected. The costs are likely to be between £8,000 and
£30,000 per fund per year in accounting and audit. These costs
would be likely to double in the first year, as the relevant
partnerships and their auditors will have to prepare and audit full
accounts for the first time. The costs will also be higher for around
10% of limited partnerships, which will have to prepare consolidated
accounts. The remaining 90% will be able to take advantage of recent
changes introduced to UK accounting standards, which allow them not to
produce consolidated
accounts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071783000122" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071783000122">The
revised regulations have the following important effects. First, they
increase the transparency of accounting and reporting by the
partnerships affected and, secondly, they address outstanding issues
with the implementation of two EU directives. The changes take effect
for accounting years beginning on or after 1 October. The limited
partnerships affected will have at least the whole accounting year to
prepare.</hs_para>

now turn to the second statutory instrument under consideration, the
Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Reports and Directors’ Report)
Regulations 2013, which covers narrative reporting. The Government

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, as I was saying, in removing
the requirement for reporting on policy and payment of creditors, we
are taking this issue seriously. In November, my honourable friend in
the other place, the Minister of State at BIS, Michael Fallon, wrote to
companies to encourage them to become signatories to the prompt payment

signed up to the prompt payment

regulations are not intended to stand alone and will be supported by
guidance from the Financial Reporting Council. This guidance will be

for those companies whose thinking on their reporting is still in

statutory instrument on today’s agenda, the Large and

Regulations 2013, covering
reporting<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T17:45:05"></hs_TimeCode> of
directors’ pay. It is worth taking a few moments to elaborate on
the reasons why it is important to make company reporting on
directors’ remuneration more transparent. As the Committee will
know, the Government’s comprehensive reforms to executive pay
addressed concerns that the link between directors’ pay and
performance has grown weak. This is damaging for the long-term
interests of business and it is right that the Government are acting to
address this

draft regulations are the final part of those reforms. Changes to
primary legislation contained in the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform
Act have given shareholders new voting powers to hold companies to
account. These regulations give detailed effect to those changes for
shareholders by setting out the information that quoted companies must
include in a directors’ remuneration report. As a package, these
reforms contribute to the Government’s wider aim of establishing
a corporate governance system that supports long-term, sustainable
growth<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T17:46:11"></hs_TimeCode>. The
regulations focus on the content of the company’s report on
directors’ pay. They cover both the required disclosure of pay
policy and the improved transparency of reporting on pay and I shall
deal with those in
turn<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T17:46:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071788000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071788000005">First,
on the remuneration policy, the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act
amended the Companies Act 2006 to give shareholders new voting powers
to hold quoted companies to account on directors’ pay. Quoted
companies must put their remuneration policy to shareholders at a
minimum interval of every three years. These regulations give effect to
those changes by setting out the details of the information that quoted
companies must give to shareholders in their directors’
remuneration policy. The policy must include: first, a description of
the elements that make up each director’s remuneration package,
such as salary, pensions and bonus; secondly, the maximum that may be
paid  for each of those elements; thirdly, an
explanation  of how payments are linked to different levels of
performance and how that performance is measured; and, finally, the
company’s policy on recruitment and exit
payments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T17:47:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071788000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071788000006">In
addition to the directors’ remuneration policy, companies will
be required, as they are now, to produce an annual remuneration report
setting out what directors have been paid in the past financial year.
Remuneration reports can currently be long and opaquely written, which
is why we are proposing significant changes to those reports to make it
much clearer to investors how much directors have been paid and how
this links to performance. In the new annual remuneration report,
companies will have to: first, report the amounts paid to each director
in terms of their salary, pension, benefits, annual bonus and long-term
incentive plans, and provide a single figure for total pay; secondly,
explain clearly how the payments relate to performance by giving
details of actual performance against the targets set and how that
relates to the amount received; and, thirdly, provide contextual
information, including details of the fees paid to remuneration
consultants 
<?notus-xml column=310?>for advice to the company relating to directors’ pay, and a

the changes to the primary legislation, shareholders will continue to

would make it clear that these reports are not intended to be long
legalistic documents but to provide clear and meaningful information to
company shareholders which allow them to hold the company to account.

regulations have been developed in close consultation with a wide range

industry-led guidance to aid companies and investors in their
implementation of the regulations. We welcome this guidance, which is
being developed by companies and investors together and is scheduled to
be available in September. The guidance will be of real benefit in
ensuring that companies provide a meaningful level of detail to their
shareholders. However, and arguably more importantly, it also

concern about these regulations, worthy though their purpose is, is
that they do not provide enough specific focus for an individual
company. We are going to get a series of bland statements. We are going
to have a meat cleaver rather than a surgeon’s knife. The
regulations continue to put far too great an emphasis on reporting the
past, judge the ship by the shape of the wake and do not provide
directors with sufficient safe-harbour provisions in respect of
forward-looking statements. For noble Lords who are not familiar with
the term “safe harbour”, it describes a means whereby you
can say something about the future without being sued for doing so,
provided that you do not say something that is utterly
reckless.</hs_para>

proper safe-harbour provisions built into these regulations. I do not
see them there and I hope that my noble friend can say something about
this when he winds up. To be really helpful to shareholders, actual and
potential company reports need to look forward and peer into the fog of
the future, but directors will be reluctant to do so unless they have
adequate

that tirade about the utility of the strategic report, I turn to the
directors’ remuneration regulations. I understand the
Government’s position given the public anger and
concern about what are seen as unreasonable rates of pay and rewards
for failure. I certainly support the idea of a binding vote for
shareholders, but company remuneration reports need to take place
against an informed background.</hs_para>

regulations require very complex executive remuneration figures to be
reduced to a single number. I understand the attractions of simplicity
but, for example, let us take the “Single Total Figure
Table” set out under Regulation 5(1). I invite my noble friend
to consider column “e”. The problem is that we are
required to have a single figure to deal with all pension-related
benefits. Pension valuation is an arcane, obscure and difficult subject
and has been known to make strong men weep. A tiny change in the gilt
rate, which forms the basis for discounted future liabilities, has a
dramatic effect on future values. Last year, the remuneration report
that I signed off for my company showed that the transfer value of one
executive’s pension had increased by £542,000 from
£2.8 million to £3.3 million. Had we paid him
more? No. Had we paid him less? No. We paid him what we had always paid
him. Yet, because of the way that gilt rates and valuations work, there
are these huge swings. He had no control over that and we had no
control over that, which leads to obscurity, misinformation and
shareholders not getting accurate and proper information. I am not sure
how, with those sorts of disclosures, we are going to avoid perverse
conclusions being
drawn<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T18:03:26"></hs_TimeCode>. We have
on our board two executive directors. Every year, we are now going to
have three shareholder votes to deal with their pay. I do not mind
having three votes and I do not suppose that the shareholders do
either, but it is a sledgehammer to crack a
nut<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T18:03:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

friend mentioned that many remuneration reports were long and opaque.
He said that the purpose was not to have long legalistic documents. The
remuneration report that I signed off for last year’s chairman
of the remuneration committee was eight pages long. We have received
the first draft from our remuneration consultants on what will happen
when we pass these regulations into law, because we are discussing the
matter on Friday. Surprise, surprise—it is 21 pages long. So it
is not going to be a shorter document. It may perhaps be less
opaque—I do not think it is—but it will be nearly three
times as long. I am not against transparency or disclosure, but I want
the Government and the Committee to realise the 
<?notus-xml column=314?>practical implications of what we are passing today. What we are trying
to do is worthy, but the results are not as we hoped.</hs_para>

regulations, will my noble friend give an undertaking that we will look
at them in three years to see whether they have had the effects that we
want them to have? I went out a few minutes ago because my phone rang,
and it was our remuneration consultant because I had rung her to say,
“We’re discussing this in a few minutes. What do you
think about it?”. I wanted to get her views. She said, “I
think they’re a complete waste of time. I don’t think
they’ll achieve anything the Government seek to achieve at
all”. So I think we need to look again at this and I hope my
noble friend can agree to do that.</hs_para>

these regulations, we need to think carefully about what we can remove.
I know my noble friend gave some examples. He talked about removing the
disclosure of charitable donations. That is one line. It is,
“The company gave no charitable or political donations”.
I am delighted to have that out, but we have to do some serious
restructuring of the way we handle and publicise company
accounts.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13071788000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071788000027">Who
are the winners and losers of these regulations? The first and biggest
winners are the accountants. No wonder the Financial Reporting Council
is saying that it wants to show how to do it better. More stuff will
need verifying, more people will need to go in to check and more people
will need to prepare the reports, which will be huge. Remuneration
consultants will be winners because they will have an opportunity to
sell their wares. Lawyers and actuaries are coming along behind because
they, too, will be asked to verify and ensure that we are complying
with this increasing raft of regulations. The losers will be the
companies, which will undoubtedly have to add to their non-productive
resources to collect all this information and put it together in a
comprehensible form. Will these regulations benefit shareholders? The
jury is out. Possibly they will, but I think it is all going to be lost
in the
wash.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071788000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071788000028">At some
point, the Government—the department—are going to have to
look at the balance between process and judgment. These regulations
extend process. We will tick the boxes and do it all, we will make sure
that we disclose whatever, but I confidently predict that when our
annual report is published in November it will not be 97 pages; it will
be between 110 and 120 pages. They will add between a
quarter and a third to it.</hs_para>

UK plc needs first-class men and women to act as executive and
non-executive directors of our public companies. They are the backbone
of our economy. We need to strike a balance and find an appropriate
level of transparency and disclosure while avoiding a situation where
the personal financial rewards that quite rightly follow commercial
success lead to finger pointing and the politics of envy. It is in all
our interests to ensure that this balance is properly struck, but I am
not sure that we have achieved it this

very expert in this area, but I declare an interest as vice chair of

was a reference to environmental, social and human rights issues and

have a lot to say on the first set of regulations, which seem to be
about tidying up and closing a loophole, although the question of
whether there would be any tax consequences as a result of the changes
occurred to me. I thought the point about narrative reporting was
interesting and I could not help reflecting on the experience of the
noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, and the range of his comments. I suppose
there is one side of me that inclines to what he says—that less
is probably more. He is probably right. As a small shareholder myself
in a number of companies, how many times do I bother to wade through
the annual report? It is not very often, unless I am really desperate
in my reading material. However, I think that the companies that we are
talking about have a duty to report comprehensively and responsibly. We
do not want any more of it than is necessary but we cannot honestly say
that everything is right these days and that we are in a climate where
nothing bad happens or where companies’ behaviour is always
perfect. The Minister conveyed a lot of interesting information to us
about narrative
reporting.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071788000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071788000032">Overall,
I welcome the new strategic report section and the way that it will
deal with environmental, social and human rights issues. The Minister
mentioned Bangladesh, which is just one example of how this can impact
on companies. What I did not hear in all his comments was any mention
of ethics, which are important to the way that companies behave. If
this points them in that direction, that is a good thing. Company
policy on ethical behaviour is becoming more and more important. We see
large companies behaving very irresponsibly and unethically, and then
being required to make enormous payouts. The recent example of payment
protection policies is one of a number of such cases. These
regulations would certainly not do those companies any
harm.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071788000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071788000033">The
Minister then talked about the action plan on business and human
rights, and the requirement to report. I think I am right in recalling
that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office are supposed to be publishing
a document soon on the UN Ruggie principles. Will this legislation
encompass those
principles?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071788000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071788000034">I
welcome the section on gender reporting, especially on board members,
although not on that alone. It is important that we see how much
progress has or has not been made. In the current climate, if we are
serious about controlling greenhouse gas emissions, that is perfectly
reasonable as well. An area that interests me, which I would
not mind seeing in an annual report,

Hodgson of Astley Abbotts:</Member></B> The noble Lord talked about
gender reporting on boards. I understand that and am in favour of it.
However, he has only to look at the list of the directors at the front
of the annual report to see who are men and who are women and to draw
his own conclusion. We do not have to have a section on gender
reporting. The information is all there and people can gather it

Young of Norwood Green:</Member></B> I am sure it will be there, but
the report does not actually say what the company’s policy is on

one.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071788000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071788000037">As I was
saying, one area that interests me and which I would not mind seeing in
annual reports—it might be there already, buried away—is
the amount of training that companies provide and the number of
apprenticeships that they take on. That is another interesting signal
of their attitudes towards their workforce and this is an area to which
this Government, after all, say they are absolutely committed. We know
we need a more skilled work force and more apprenticeships, so a
requirement in relation to those areas in the regulations would not go
amiss.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13071788000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071788000097">6.15

why charitable arrangements are burdensome. I would welcome an
explanation of why they are seen as such. I would not have thought they
merited a huge amount of effort.</hs_para>

which I ask the Government to think again is the policy and payment of
creditors. The Minister referred to the companies which have signed up
to a prompt payment code, which is good, but there is, again, an
ethical sense to this. We know how many SMEs live and die by the prompt
payment policies of companies and I find it puzzling that that should
be
dropped.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071788000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071788000040">The
question of directors’ pay has, quite rightly, become the focus
of a great deal of attention. Why? It is because we have seen many
companies—I do not mean the noble Lord’s company; in
fact, I am thinking of investing in it, if only to benefit from the
offer of the beer—which have rewarded not only failure but
failure and unethical activities as well. This is an important area
and, by and large, I welcome the regulations. If the policy included
the issue of workers’ representation on the remuneration
committee, that might inject some reality; and, given the Hutton report
on the ratio between the average workers’ pay and
directors’ pay, a comment on that issue would not go amiss
either. Some of those ratios over the past 10 or 15 years have grown
enormously, unjustifiably so in many cases. Some of the examples of
reductions in directors’ and chief executives’ pay are
interesting. People are beginning to realise that their pay has grown
unreasonably, usually on the basis that if we did not reward them we
could not possibly find anyone else to do the jobs. I have always
doubted
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071788000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071788000041">On the
pay and the pension bonus, I take the point that the noble Lord, Lord
Hodgson, made. However, that situation should be explained. I accept
that there will be a variation depending on market performance but I
cannot see any reason why that should not be explained. The total
remuneration package that has been described includes pay, pension,
bonus, performance and exit payments. We have recently seen some
unbelievable examples of exit payments in the BBC, where people have
walked into another job immediately and still received an additional
year’s salary. We need 
<?notus-xml column=317?>to know the justification for that. As to the annual remuneration report
and the amounts paid to each director, and pay and performance fees
paid to remuneration consultants, again, if investors want to see the
full picture, that is the kind of information that they
require.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071788000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071788000042">As to
the passionate plea from the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, of course no one
wants these reports to be any longer than they need to be. I am sure
that the Churchillian quote was apt and that the length of the report
is inversely proportional to the amount of readership it encourages.
However, I would have thought that there were ways of giving small
investors a key point summary and directions to the full body of the
report if they want more information. Again, this area is ripe for
development.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071788000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071788000043">The
noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, made an interesting point about principal
risks and uncertainties. It is difficult but, again, necessary, given
that some companies have made some unbelievable investments that have
brought them to ruin. Making sure that they are assessing risks as best
they can, given that there is a general risk about the growth of the
economy, is right. I was not quite sure that I fully understood the
concept of the safe harbour provisions, but no doubt the Minister will
be able to explain
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071788000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071788000044">The noble
Lord, Lord Hodgson, made a valid point on a three-year review process.
We do not want these reports to be any longer than they need to be. I
am sure that over a period we will see what the Government would see as
best practice and encouragement to develop it. With those thoughts, I
look forward to the Minister’s
response.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-17?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_17_PT_1/CE138B69B057C6013B06FB6E9358E24FB224F284" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 17 July 2013">Wednesday,

good point about the size of the report. The noble Lord, Lord Young,
mentioned concern about extending the report to include a strategic
report given the history of reports and my noble friend Lord
Hodgson’s example of a report that was 15 pages a few years ago
and is now 70 pages. It will be up to companies to decide how long
their reports will be and, no doubt, they will want to make them as
succinct and readable as possible to include the extra requirements. I
hope that will include cutting down on other areas so that the reports

Hodgson was concerned about the disclosure of risk. He raised an
important point. The guidance on the strategic side of the report will
provide guidance for businesses on deciding their key risks. He made
the important point that it is quite challenging for a company to
decide what risks are under its control and what risks are not, such as
the economy. The guidance is designed to help with that approach but it
will be up to the company to decide 
<?notus-xml column=318?>what it puts into its report on an annual basis. This guidance will be

friend Lord Hodgson and the noble Lord, Lord Young, raised the safe
harbour provision. The answer to the question, “Is there a safe
harbour provision for directors?” is yes. The detail is in
paragraph 17 of the schedule. It extends the safe harbour provision in
Section 463 to the strategic report. The Companies Act permits
directors a defence that they were not reckless, and we have made a
consequential change to the law to extend this safe harbour defence to
the preparation of the strategic report. I hope that that gives some
comfort to my noble friend Lord
Hodgson.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071788000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071788000049">My
noble friend Lord Hodgson raised the issue of the numbers of women
being included in the report. It is fair to say that he was somewhat
exercised by this. However, I hope I can reassure him, and answer a
question about this matter from the noble Lord, Lord Young, by saying
that this is about ensuring that businesses are managing their boards
better to understand their customers, investors and staff. Evidence
suggests that diverse boards are better boards and help employees who
may hope to move up into management. The whole objective is to be
transparent and to provide full and purposeful figures and to allow
stakeholders to look at the reports. The measure is designed to be
helpful to them as opposed to simply not including
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T18:25:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071788000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071788000050">My
noble friend Lord Hodgson did not agree that the single figure
disclosure would provide accurate and useful information for
shareholders. I think that he was referring to the new figures that
will be required. He gave the example of a director’s pension. I
totally understand his point about pensions being pretty complex and
that to reduce them to a single figure is challenging. As regards the
example that he gave, it would be fair to say that, just as in company
reports and auditing reports, you would have a codicil saying,
“This figure is particularly high because of a particular
aspect”, which would make the issue clear. Perhaps my noble
friend was making the broader point that if you put in single figures
the whole time you may obscure the bigger picture. I hope I can
reassure my noble friend that companies will have guidance on this and
will have to make simplicity a byword when reporting these figures. The
regulations will prescribe the minimum requirements but there is
nothing to stop companies providing any other material that would help
shareholders better understand the information or put it into context,
which is the nub of the matter. My noble friend asked whether the
Government would undertake to review the regulations and their effects.
The noble Lord, Lord Young, also asked about reviewing. The Government
have committed to review the regulations in 2017, which is not too far
off, so I hope that gives some
comfort<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T18:27:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071788000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071788000051">The

include a company’s ethics policy, which is an interesting

<?notus-xml column=319?>interesting point about charitable donations and asked why we were
planning to cut the figures relating to those donations. The format of
the charitable donations disclosure required companies to disclose the
name of the recipient, the amount and the true purpose. For those
companies which make a lot of donations this was becoming a burdensome
requirement. The total figure is still included in the accounts but the
objective of this move is to leave out figures that are becoming
somewhat meaningless and rather
burdensome<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T18:28:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071788000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071788000052">The
noble Lord asked whether these measures had any tax consequences. There
are no direct consequences and the tax transparent status of
partnerships is unaffected. The changes that we are proposing do not
amend the tax law. The noble Lord also asked about pay ratios and,
specifically, why we did not require companies to report on the pay
ratio between directors and the average worker, which is a fair point.
Companies will have to say more about how the remuneration committee
has taken into account employee pay  and publish the percentage
increase in the pay of the chief executive and that of the workforce.
However, disclosure of pay ratios has its limitations and could provide
misleading information. For example, a company with a large number of
low-paid employees would have a big ratio but a company that had
outsourced such employees, which might be less socially responsible,
will none the less have a better ratio for entirely artificial
reasons<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T18:29:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071788000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071788000053">The

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Business,
Innovation and Skills (Viscount Younger of Leckie):</Member></B>
I beg to move that the order be considered by the
Committee. Primary authority is a statutory scheme, which was launched
in 2009. Under the  scheme, businesses can form a partnership
with a single local authority, the primary authority. This
gives the business a single point of contact to help it to comply with
regulation. There are currently 785 businesses and 104 local
authorities in partnerships covering more than 64,000 premises. They
provide support on complying with many regulations, including
regulations on health and safety, age-restricted sales and trading
standards. The purpose of the order is to extend the primary authority
scheme to cover additional regulations not currently within it. It will
enable businesses to benefit from primary authority in relation to
three additional regulations: first, Part 1 of the Housing Act 2004;
secondly, the Sunbeds (Regulation) Act 2010; and, thirdly, the Single
Use Carrier Bags Charge (Wales) Regulations
2010.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071788000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071788000063">Reducing
regulatory burdens on business is important for growth. It is essential
that businesses are able to comply with regulations efficiently. In
their responses to the consultation on these proposals, businesses told
us that they need reliable advice and confidence that their approach to
compliance will be treated consistently. We know that businesses value
primary authority. Not only have they told us so in consultation but
recent evaluation showed that more than 90% of business respondents
would recommend primary authority to others. That is why the Government
are committed to ensuring that as many businesses as possible can share
in the benefits of it and that the scheme covers a wide range of
regulation.</hs_para>

business alone. By reducing duplication in the enforcement of these
regulations, primary authority saves time for local authorities, too.
It allows them to use their time better to target rogue traders and
help businesses to deal with the most severe risks. Moreover, local
authorities that choose to become primary authorities can recover the
costs from the business.</hs_para>

importantly, primary authority increases protection for consumers. The
majority of UK businesses want to protect their customers and follow
the law, but they need advice that they can rely on and need to know
that the law will be applied consistently. This enables them to invest
in compliance—for example, by putting policies in place or by
training
staff.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071788000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071788000066">We have
opened up eligibility for primary authority to many more businesses
through the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013. From October,
this will enable businesses that share a “common approach to
compliance”, such as trade associations and franchises, to enter
primary authority partnerships. This order strengthens primary
authority further. It will allow businesses to access primary authority
for additional areas of regulation. I shall now discuss these
extensions in more
detail.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071788000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071788000067">First,
Part 1 of the Housing Act 2004 is a crucially important piece of
regulation for improving the standards of the private rental sector in
this country. Let me 
<?notus-xml column=322?>provide an example of the benefits that primary authority can bring to
this area. A landlord may have received conflicting advice from two
local authorities on how best to fireproof his properties. By obtaining
appropriate advice from a primary authority, he will have the
confidence to spend money on installing new fire doors, knowing that
they are suitable. The Government have considered the detailed
consultation responses on the inclusion of Part 1 of the Housing Act.
Lettings businesses and some local authorities were in favour of the
extension but many local authorities had reservations. We have worked
closely with housing authorities to ensure that there will be no
unintended consequences. We are confident that the intention of the
legislation to provide risk-based protections will be supported by
primary authority but we will continue to monitor its application. The
Government believe that the benefits of the primary authority scheme
should be extended to the private rental sector. Primary authority will
provide an avenue for advice that gives certainty to landlords, thereby
giving them the confidence to invest in properties. As one local
authority commented, the extension,</hs_para>

turn to the second extension, which is to include the Sunbeds
(Regulation) Act 2010. Bringing this law within the scope of primary
authority will mean that if a leisure company wants to offer sunbeds
for use, it can receive advice about how best to ensure that these are
not used by children. Moreover, a business unsure about the additional
legislation in Wales, made under this Act, can gain assured advice
about the health information that it needs to display. As a local
authority in Wales commented:</hs_para>

the final extension to primary authority which we are discussing today
concerns adding Welsh regulations on single-use carrier bag charging to
the scheme. This existing regulation requires businesses to charge
customers in Wales for certain carrier bags. Primary authority will
ensure that businesses, whether based in Wales or not, can access
robust and reliable advice on complying with this Welsh legislation.
For example, many businesses deliver products to customers in Wales
from England. They will be able to gain advice on the requirements to
keep records of the charges made to customers.</hs_para>

will extend the scope of primary authority, enabling businesses to

Young of Norwood Green:</Member></B> My Lords, we welcome this
approach. If, as the Minister said, it reduces duplication and gives
more consistency, what is not to like? I listened carefully as he went
through the various areas where it would extend the application of a
primary authority and I have a couple of questions. Is there any impact
at all on local employment partnerships? While I welcome the fact that
landlords will not get conflicting advice, I could not help thinking
about the tenants. What impact will the measure have on them in terms

regards bringing sunbeds into the scope of primary authority, not only
children but adults often overindulge in that area. However if there is
consistency, again that seems a good thing. Similarly, as regards

Young of Norwood Green:</Member></B> I think that I had almost reached
a conclusion. I think the Minister mentioned something about
monitoring, and I was going to ask whether there was a fixed review
period in relation to
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071788000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071788000075"><B><Member ContinuationText="Viscount Younger of Leckie" PimsId="4709" UID="13071788000125" xid="2037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071788000125">Viscount
Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, first, I thank the noble
Lord, Lord Young of Norwood Green, for his collegiate approach and for
his general welcome for this statutory instrument. He raised a couple
of questions. The first was whether LEPs would be impacted. I can
confirm that there is no direct impact on LEPs as they operate
independently from local authorities and the primary authority scheme.
However, if a LEP decides that it wishes to address the issue of the
burden of compliance within its area, it is free to encourage the
uptake of the primary authority scheme among
businesses.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071788000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071788000076">The
second question related to the effect on tenants of the changes that we
are making to primary authority and to the landlord housing scheme. The
Government 
<?notus-xml column=324?>believe that it is important that tenants are protected and that
landlords in the private rented sector provide safe and healthy
housing. Primary authority is consistent with this. By giving
businesses certainty about their obligations, primary authority makes
it simpler for lettings businesses to comply with any regulation. When
businesses understand what is expected of them and know that it will be
applied consistently, they are more likely to invest in compliance,
which leads to raised protection for tenants. The noble Lord, Lord
Young, asked about the fixed review period, and I can confirm that
there will be a review after three
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071788000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071788000077">Finally,
just before we broke to vote, the noble Lord asked whether this will
protect adults as well as children using sunbeds. Primary authority
advice will be available to cover the full range of protections under
the Act, which creates a duty on businesses in England and Wales to
ensure that no person under 18 uses or is offered the use of a sunbed
on their premises. The Act also gives powers to the Secretary of State
and Welsh Ministers to enact further secondary legislation in England
and Wales. In 2011, Welsh Ministers introduced measures in Wales under
this Act that further regulate the sale and hire of sunbeds and require
the provision and display of health information and the provision of
protective eyewear. This will protect both children and adults. The
inclusion of the Sunbeds (Regulation) Act 2010 within the scope of
primary authority will therefore cover the enforcement of these areas.
I hope that that answers all the questions raised by the noble Lord,
Lord
Young.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071788000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071788000078"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Young of Norwood Green" PimsId="4703" UID="13071788000126" xid="1710" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-gc0001.htm#13071788000126">Lord

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> That is a fair question. We are not

The UK Government have not yet reached a decision on mandatory charging
for carrier bags in England. We are first monitoring the results in
Wales and Northern Ireland and the outcome of the Scottish consultation
on such a charge. We need clear, robust data before making any
decisions. That way, we will be aware of any unintended consequences of

serious problem which HMRC estimates leads to revenue losses of
approximately £1.2 billion a year. It also has a detrimental
impact on the legitimate businesses attempting to compete in this
sector. This is why the Government consulted last year on potential
measures to deal with this problem. Measures covered by the
consultation included beer fiscal marks, supply chain legislation and a
registration scheme for alcohol wholesalers. The consultation also
explored alternatives to these options that could assist HMRC’s
enforcement strategy.</hs_para>

consultation highlighted the potential anti-fraud benefits but also
some considerable impacts the proposed measures might have on
legitimate alcohol supply chains. After fully examining the case for
and against the proposed measures, the Government has decided not to
proceed with beer fiscal marks or supply-chain legislation at this
time.</hs_para>

provided on beer fiscal marks to show that, although it could be a
useful tool to counter trade in illicit products, the costs of affixing
stamps to goods could be significant for the UK brewing industry and
particularly for legitimate importers and exporters. Therefore, the
Government will not be proceeding with the introduction of beer fiscal
marks at this time to allow exploration of other, less burdensome
options to address alcohol fraud.</hs_para>

legislation, the consultation highlighted issues regarding the
practicality and cost of introducing new ‘track and
trace’ systems across the brewing industry, as well as concerns
regarding the likely effectiveness of the measure. The Government does
not therefore intend to legislate for this measure at this time, but
wishes to continue to explore available and emerging technologies that
could help to secure alcohol supply chains. The Government will also
consult shortly on new proposals to strengthen due diligence
obligations of excise businesses throughout the supply-chain.</hs_para>

the positive response across all sectors towards the option to
register alcohol wholesalers and can also see that there could
be benefits in authorising this part of the supply chain, which is
frequently the point at which illicit products are distributed. The
Government wishes to consult further with relevant sectors informally
over the summer of 2013 to refine the design of a registration scheme,
and fully understand the costs, benefits and implications if it were
introduced. This will also include seeking views on the specific powers
and sanctions that would be essential if the scheme is to be effective.
The outcome of this further work will inform the Government’s
future decision on whether to proceed with wholesaler
registration.</hs_para>

considered a large number of alternative measures, including many
proposed by industry. The Government intends to progress a wider
programme of change to policy and enforcement to strengthen the current
‘Tackling Alcohol Fraud’ strategy. Full details of that
programme, will be published shortly but will include steps to increase
collaboration with industry and between enforcement agencies; measures
aimed at tightening controls in the existing excise regulatory system;

those with particular learning needs, should be secondary ready at age
11 – that means using a higher measure of what success looks
like. We are already raising the threshold for the percentage of pupils
to be ready for secondary school to 65%. But we know that schools and
teachers have already raised their game way beyond this. For that
reason, we will expect a very high proportion of pupils – 85%
– to reach the new, higher secondary readiness threshold for a
school to be above the bar. Since we know that both children and
schools can achieve this, it is right that we set this as a minimum
standard.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071786000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-wms0001.htm#13071786000072">Our
new national curriculum is designed to give schools genuine
opportunities to take ownership of the curriculum. The new programmes
of study, published on 8 July, set out what pupils should be taught by
the end of primary education. Teachers will be able to develop a school
curriculum that delivers the core content in a way that is challenging
and relevant for their pupils.</hs_para>

core subjects at the end of key stages is designed primarily to enable
robust external accountability. We will continue to prescribe statutory
assessment arrangements in English, mathematics and science. National
curriculum tests in English and mathematics will continue, and will
show whether pupils have met a demanding secondary readiness standard,
which will remain the same from year to year. We propose to report
pupils’ test results as a scaled score, such as those used in
international surveys, to make sure that test outcomes are comparable
over time. We will report each pupil’s ranking in the national
cohort by decile to show their performance relative to their peers
nationally.</hs_para>

high aspirations for all schools and pupils. Our new targets will
prepare children for success. At the moment, pupils are being asked to
reach a bar that too often sets them up to fail. So that all children
– whatever their circumstances - can arrive in secondary school
ready to succeed, we are giving significantly more money to primary
school pupils eligible for the pupil premium. This will support this
step-change in
ambition</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071786000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-wms0001.htm#13071786000075">We
introduced the pupil premium in 2011 to help schools close the
attainment gap for disadvantaged pupils. In 2014-15, total funding
through the pupil premium will increase by an extra £625m to a
total of £2.5bn. We will use the extra funding to increase the
level of the pupil premium for primary schools to £1,300 per
pupil compared with £900 in the current year. This 44% rise in
the pupil premium is the largest cash rise so far. This should enable
more targeted interventions to support disadvantaged pupils to be
“secondary ready” and achieve our ambitious expectations
for what pupils should know and be able to do by the end of primary
education. We believe in early intervention because the greater the
numbers of disadvantaged 
<?notus-xml column=113?>pupils that leave primary school with basic literacy and numeracy, the
greater their chances of achieving good GCSEs.</hs_para>

schools fairly by acknowledging the performance of schools whose pupils
achieve well despite a low starting-point. We will therefore look at
how we can introduce a reliable, robust measure of progress that we can
take into consideration when holding schools to account. A school that
does not achieve the attainment threshold will not be judged to be
below the floor standard if its pupils are making good progress. The
progress measure will also help identify coasting schools, whose pupils
do not achieve their full potential. Ofsted will focus its inspections
more closely on schools below and just above floor standards, and
inspect schools with good performance on these measures less
frequently.</hs_para>

report on the progress pupils make during primary education. In order
to measure pupils’ progress, we need to measure how each
pupil’s end of key stage 2 test results compare with the results
of pupils with similar prior attainment. Currently the baseline
against which we measure progress is at the end of key stage 1. We
could continue to keep the baseline at this stage. Alternatively, we
could introduce a similar teacher-led baseline check early in
Reception, which would help teachers understand the stage the child has
reached and allow the crucial progress made in Reception, Year 1 and
Year 2 to be reflected in the accountability system. Our consultation
seeks views on which is the best
option</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071786000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-wms0001.htm#13071786000078">Finally,
we recognise that teachers are professionals, and we want to give
schools more freedom over the way they measure assessment. We have
already announced that we will remove the current system of national
curriculum levels and level descriptions, which imposes a single system
for ongoing assessment and prescribes the detailed sequence for what
pupils should be taught. This will leave schools free to decide how to
track pupils’ progress. Ofsted will expect to see evidence of
pupils’ progress, but inspections will be informed by the pupil
tracking data which schools choose to keep.</hs_para>

a custodial sentence of 12 months or less, a recall petition will be
automatically opened in that member’s constituency (under the
Representation of the People Act 1981, where a member receives a
custodial sentence of more than 12 months, they are automatically
disqualified from membership of the House). If 10% of constituents sign
the petition, the MP’s seat will be vacated and a
by-election called. The former MP may stand as a
candidate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071786000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-wms0001.htm#13071786000087">Secondly
a recall petition will be opened where the House of Commons resolves
that one of its members should face recall. This will ensure that a
member could also face recall where they have committed serious
wrongdoing which did not result in a custodial sentence, for example, a
serious breach of the House of Commons Code of Conduct. This will be a
new disciplinary power for the House to help ensure that it is able to
deal with disciplinary issues effectively. Constituents would again
then have the opportunity to decide if a by-election should be

little overlap in the activities of the two bodies and his conclusion
that greater efficiency is to be gained from reducing the burden of
regulation than from structural reform. The review recognises that
there is scope for improvement in the ways the bodies operate, and that
efficiencies can be achieved by way of a review of human tissue
legislation. There are 18 recommendations in total to help achieve a
reduction in the burden of regulation. Most of the recommendations are

We recognise the importance of that and understand that there will be
particular sensitivities around such an undertaking but believe that
the evidence presented in the McCracken report is persuasive. We are

this year. They will keep a share of the business rates paid in their
area, and also keep a share of any increase in business rates (subject

the period 2030 – 2060 which will be an annual payment of
equivalent amounts, funded by DECC. These funds are specifically
intended to benefit the local communities who are hosting new nuclear
power stations and the Government fully expects that the Local
Authorities will involve their communities in developing their spending
plans, with Government also providing assistance and support in its
development. Given the amount of time before this phase of funding will

<hs_para UID="13071786000181" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-wms0001.htm#13071786000181">Today the independent
Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) published its third fiscal
sustainability report (FSR). This document meets their requirement to
prepare an analysis of the sustainability of the public finances each
financial year, and provides an important insight into the state of the
public finances taking into account the significant impact of
demographic change. The report was laid before Parliament earlier today
and copies are available in the Vote Office and Printed Paper
Office.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071786000182" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-wms0001.htm#13071786000182">The
OBR FSR projections show that public sector net debt is expected to
fall to a trough of 66% of GDP in the early 2030s, before rising to
reach 99% of GDP in 2062-63 in the absence of further policy change.
The FSR shows that, without additional policy change, an ageing
population is projected to increase age-related spending by 4.4% of GDP
between 2017-18 and 2062-63, as health, social care and pension
expenditure become an ever larger proportion of total public spending
and the economy.</hs_para>

the long-term sustainability of government revenues. As in previous
years, the OBR project that oil and gas revenues will decline markedly
over the coming decades. Updated projections show revenues declining
from 0.4% of GDP this year to 0.03% of GDP in 2040-41, with total
revenues over the projection period revised down by £11bn. The
OBR consider the impact of alternative scenarios for oil and
gas prices and for production and conclude that revenues will
fall below 0.1% of GDP in the coming decades, even in these more
optimistic scenarios.</hs_para>

committed both to strengthening our fiscal position now and making it
sustainable for the long term. The OBR analysis makes it clear that the
Government’s medium-term consolidation plan is essential to
restoring long-term sustainability of the public finances. A
deterioration in the primary balance in 2017-18 worth 1% of GDP could
increase projected public sector net debt in 2062-63 to around 150% of
GDP. The OBR discusses the impact of changes to policy on their
long-term projections. They show that  
<?notus-xml column=126?>excluding policy changes announced since the 2012 FSR, public sector net
debt would have been projected to be around 50% of GDP higher by
2062-63. They identify the additional spending reductions announced for
2017-18 as one of the key factors in containing the growth of spending
over the long-term, demonstrating the importance of the
Government’s programme of fiscal consolidation for the long-term
health of the public
finances.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071786000185" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-wms0001.htm#13071786000185">The
FSR presents long term projections of state pension expenditure
including the Government’s new single tier state pension. The
single-tier reforms will restructure current expenditure on the State
Pension into a simple flat-rate amount, to provide clarity and
confidence to better support saving for retirement. This reform will
cost no more than the current system.</hs_para>

will complement the bold measures already taken by this Government to
improve the sustainability of UK pension systems. Bringing forward the
increase in the State Pension age to 66 to 2020 is expected to deliver
savings of around £30bn while bringing forward the increase to
67 to 2028 is expected to deliver savings of around £70bn.
Further, the Government has set out its plans to consider future
changes to the State Pension age in a more regular and structured
manner, ensuring that the State Pension age keeps pace with changing
demographics and putting State Pension expenditure on a more
sustainable
footing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071786000187" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-wms0001.htm#13071786000187">Together,

Pension comes alongside the Government’s reforms to Public
Service Pensions. The Government has set out a package of reforms to
rebalance taxpayer and member contributions in the short term, and to
ensure that costs are sustainable and fair in the long term. The new
scheme designs, rebalancing of contributions between members and the
taxpayer, and switch to uprating by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) are
forecast to save £430 billion over the next 50
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071786000189" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717-wms0001.htm#13071786000189">The
OBR’s report also focuses on the pressures of an ageing
population on social care spending, and the projections reflect for the
first time the impact of the historic reforms to social care funding
announced earlier this year. The Government will introduce a cap on
lifetime care costs, greater means-tested support for residential care
and deferred payments, so that nobody faces unlimited care costs, more
people get support with their residential care costs sooner, and nobody
is forced to sell their home in their lifetime to pay for
residential care. The Government is also taking action to deliver
better, more efficient care. For example, the Spending Round set out
radical plans to create a £3.8 billion pooled budget
shared across health and care, to deliver more integrated services,
which we expect to manage down pressures across both
services.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Statement">

on an amendment to EU marketing standards for olive oil (Commission
Regulation no. 29/2012) the Government consistently opposed a new EU
requirement for bottles containing olive oil in the catering sector to
be non-refillable and non-resealable from 1 January 2014. However, this
only formed one element of the proposals which also included improved
labelling provisions for consumers and the UK, therefore, abstained in
the final vote. Given the support for the proposal from olive oil

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department
for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Lord De Mauley):</Member> The
human health risk assessments performed for chemicals in the UK and
European Union are in line with internationally accepted procedures;
for example, those described by the World Health Organisation. For
substances such as pesticides, extensive animal study data sets are
required, including chronic/carcinogenicity and reproduction studies. A
full range of end points is routinely examined, including sub-clinical
effects. Acceptable exposure for humans is determined by dividing by a
factor of 100 (or more), a dose that produces no effect in the most
sensitive animal study. Due to the large number of general chemicals
addressed by the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation &amp;
restriction of Chemicals (REACH) Regulation (EC No. 1907/2006), a
tiered testing approach is undertaken. More extensive data are required
for those substances produced or imported in the greatest
amounts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13071767000199" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717w0001.htm#13071767000199">Recent
publications in the scientific, peer reviewed literature indicate that
this approach is as applicable to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDs)
as it is to other classes of chemicals. This is supported by the recent
Opinion of the Scientific Committee of the European Food Safety
Authority (<I>EFSA Journal 2013;11(3):3132</I>), which stated that
‘<I>EDs can therefore be treated like most other substances of
concern for human health and the environment</I>’. The studies
that are required to be undertaken for regulatory purposes are expected
to identify any compounds that act on endocrine sensitive tissues or
hormonally controlled physiological processes. Any such effects are
considered as part of the overall risk
assessment.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question"><hs_DebateHeading UID="13071767000347" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130717w0001.htm#13071767000347">Young
