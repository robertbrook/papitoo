its position is on giving the British people a say on our relationship
with the European Union it will let us know. In introducing the Bill,
as I said, I speak for many in the Chamber and for many millions

giving the public a real say—a real choice between the best

what we on this side are offering the British public: I think that

him at a later stage, should the Bill go forward today, to slow it down
and bog it down in parliamentary procedure, I hope he will resist the
temptation and allow us to get it through so that his constituents and

understanding of devolution and, indeed, democracy. The last time I
checked, there was an election in Scotland in 2010 that resulted in the
Scottish National party, which had committed to a referendum in its
manifesto, securing a majority in the Scottish Parliament. By contrast,
not one of the principal political parties that stood at the
last general election in the United Kingdom and secured representation
in this House advanced 
<?notus-xml column=1182?>what is proposed in this Bill. There is a fundamental difference because
a majority was secured in the Scottish

am delighted to speak in this debate, which has so far lived up to
expectations. I would not have missed it for the world, because it must
be one of the oddest debates ever held in this Chamber on a private
Member’s Bill Friday. It is odd because of the politics of the
occasion. I do not think there has been a private Member’s Bill
Friday in the time that I have been in this House when the Prime
Minister has been forced by his Back Benchers to come here to jump to
their tune. Normally, Prime Ministers hold a sort of lofty disdain for
private Members’ Bills, but our Prime Minister, in the eyes of
Europe, has been humiliated here today by his own Back Benchers. That
is one oddity about today. The second oddity is the reason the Bill is
here at all, which I shall come to, and the third oddity is what is in

aim seemed clear enough: to put the Prime Minister’s promise on

to a referendum after the next election. The Bill is very clear: the
referendum could happen as soon as the Bill has been passed. It is not
about after the next election or after renegotiation—it is any
time now. That is very odd, because the Prime Minister is on the record
as opposing a referendum Bill now. Why, then,

showing the unity of the Conservative party, all the Bill has done is
show how thin is the veneer of unity that they are trying to present.

who say that we could be like Switzerland or Norway. They are fine
countries, but I do not want to be like them. Clearly, the days of
empire and global military 
<?notus-xml column=1198?>might are long gone and rightly so, but I am still sufficiently

there is a case for a referendum in principle, and I see that. It is a
long time since we had one, and to an extent the demand for it has
taken on a life of its own beyond the issue of Europe. However, those
of us who can see that case also have a responsibility to be clear
about the conditions in which a referendum would serve the national
interest. If we are to ask people to vote, the choice has to be clear.

it may be very different from the way it is today. Both those judgments
are true, so how can we have a referendum when the consequences of
leaving might be clear enough, but it is not clear what the
consequences of staying will be. Clearly, we need to pursue reform and
to reshape the EU so there can be a clear and settled choice. I am not
one of those—not all of those in my party agree with this, but I

Denham:</Member></B> My right hon. Friend is right. What worries me is
that the Prime Minister represents a party in which that generation of
confident patriots, who believed that this country could shape Europe
to the benefit of Europe and in the interests of our country, has gone.
The Conservative party is split. There are those who simply want to
leave come what may. They are the people Lewis Carroll satirised 150
years ago when he had the Queen of Hearts say, “Sentence first,
evidence later”. They have made up their minds. The other
faction of the Conservative party simply believes in repatriation and
repeal: returning to the country those rights that give working people
decent protections—maternity pay, the right not to be maimed and
killed at work, and paid holidays—in order to repeal them. Those
are the only two positions that exist in today’s Conservative
party. So when my right hon. Friend says that these negotiations should
start now, the problem is this: yes, but you must have people who are
going to be credible in those negotiations.</hs_Para>

effective in the country. This has been too long coming: an
unconscionable period of time. I made a famous prediction, which I

who lead us have sought to control this issue. There is no defence of

elite in our political parties, which rises to the top, forms judgments
and changes its judgments. Peter Shore wrote perhaps the most balanced
speech, titled “A thousand years of British history”,
when we knew nothing, rather like the other day in the Commons, about
what the Government’s intentions were in joining. That speech
asks a series of questions. We know nothing about this. We wonder. We

Ian Davidson</B> (Glasgow South West) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> I find
myself agreeing completely with what I believe to be the three
motivating thrusts of those who have brought forward the proposal we
are discussing today. The first is the clear need for renegotiation of
the terms of Britain’s relationship with the European Union; the
second is the need for a referendum on Britain’s membership of
the EU on renegotiated terms; and the third is the question of whether
we trust the British Government. I find myself agreeing with
Conservative Back Benchers that the Government cannot be trusted, so it
is necessary to put things down in legislation in order to allow them
no wriggle-room whatever.</hs_Para>

remember being one of those Members who voted with the Foreign

remember the Conservatives saying that when they got to power, they
would have a referendum on the Lisbon treaty, yet no referendum on

sufficient so legislation is

Gentleman. May I remind him that what the Conservative Front-Bench team
said in opposition was that they would hold a referendum in the event
that the Lisbon treaty had not been ratified by the time we came into
office? That is why my right hon. Friend the Foreign
Secretary went round a number of European capitals, urging them
“Please, do not ratify”—unlike what the United
Kingdom had done—so that when we came to power we would be able
to veto it and have a referendum for the British people. It is that
misunderstanding that is so important. This was not a categorical
undertaking for a referendum; it would happen only in certain defined
circumstances<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-05T11:26:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070542000317" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130705/debtext/130705-0001.htm#13070542000317"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Davidson" PimsId="2856" UID="13070542001668" xid="157" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130705/debtext/130705-0001.htm#13070542001668">Mr

impression created was that the Conservatives were against
the Lisbon treaty and that a referendum would be held. When they got
into power, was a referendum held? No, 
<?notus-xml column=1203?>it was not. That is what people will remember. That is what the people

Gisela Stuart:</Member></B> A small group of us here have shared these
debates. For the benefit of those who did not, Governments have found
ways to get out of having to comply with their promises once they are
in government —and with the Tories it was about when to ratify.
With the Lib Dems, they got out of having a referendum on the Lisbon
treaty by suddenly wanting an in/out referendum —and now that
they can have that, they want something
else<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-05T11:27:00"></hs_TimeCode>. The real
lesson is: once in government, people do not allow referendums; in

for this, we will send round Len McClusky.” I said, “I
know Len McClusky. Len McClusky is a friend of mine. I had Len
McClusky’s support in the last general election. I had the
support not only of Len McClusky but of the GMB, Unison, UCATT and the
Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, while opposing
me were only Conservatives, nationalists and snivelling Liberals. And I

enjoying what is happening with the Conservatives and UKIP, because
UKIP is also entirely capable of eating into our vote, as voting for
UKIP is a vote against leadership and government by an elite that is
seen to be out of touch. It is a revolt, in a sense, by those who see
themselves as little people ignored by the existing system. While
Europe has been the particular issue around which it has coagulated,
that is not necessarily the only issue on which it sees itself as
divorced from politics. However, the Conservatives have reacted to UKIP
almost solely on this issue.</hs_Para>

has already indicated he intends to vote for the terms that are offered

points for renegotiation should we be focusing on? The first is the
question of ever closer union. It is clear to me that we have to make
it clear—absolutely clear, crystal clear—that we reject
totally the concept of ever closer union and the idea that the EU is a
ratchet which only ever turns in one direction. I support devolution
for Scotland on the principle that I believe powers should be moved
downwards. I support the concept of subsidiarity, too, as I believe
that in principle we ought to say that all powers held at any given
level should be moved to the level below, unless a very strong case can
be made for retaining them where they are. The onus ought to be on
those who wish to hold them centrally to justify that position, rather
than the converse. That has not been the position of successive British
Governments up until now, and it should be, and I think we ought to
make it absolutely clear that that is our position going forward, so
that the inexorable expansion of the EU’s powers—like the
Blob in the science fiction films that used to replicate itself every

second issue is control of our borders. I do not believe that it is
appropriate to have enormously tight restrictions on immigration from

leads to a situation in which some of the restrictions on migration
from outside the EU are, in my view, too tight, driven by a desire to
keep down the numbers. It is meaningless to have restrictions on the
outside and allow anybody who is given leave to remain in Spain,
France, Greece, Bulgaria or Romania to come into the United Kingdom
simply because those countries have given them citizenship rights. We
have to have control over our borders, which means saying to our
European colleagues that we do not accept unfettered free movement of

sold the jerseys, I think all these issues could very well be

final point I want to make is that the Conservative drive for
renegotiation seems to be driven by the sort of impulse that means
every time Conservatives walk by a house and see a chimney, they regret
that a small boy is not climbing up it. I think the Conservative
party’s wish to repatriate powers over labour relations and
working conditions is driven by a desire to drive down terms and
conditions to the level of the 18th or 17th or 16th century,
if they think they can get away with it. There is no future for Britain
in the long term if we go back to having small boys climb chimneys. It
is rules and regulations—and, indeed, red tape—that stop
us having small boys climbing chimneys. Those Conservatives who say
that the main drive behind renegotiating the EU treaties is to have a
freer labour market have got to come clean and say whether they believe
a search to the bottom is the way forward for Britain. I do not believe
we should be seeking to compete by lowering working standards, and that
is one of the points on which Len McCluskey and I would be as
one.</hs_Para>

on how I will vote at that time, because I recognise that the European

trade unions are actively campaigning for a referendum. Indeed, the
advisory board of The People’s Pledge, one of the great
organisations calling for a referendum and which is running a
successful campaign, was made up of at least three senior union
representatives, including Bob Crow and Bill Greenshields, as well as a
number of others—the list goes

basis of what they believe is offered to their members once the

Labour party’s view on these matters is best
described as being in a state of flux. It is a caterpillar, which, in a

our position in a relatively short time, as events change, because we
are clearly heading for a crisis in the European Union. I do not
believe that the euro is sustainable in its current form for much
longer. As the euro degenerates, and as unemployment rises—it
already affects 50% of young people in Spain—we will see more
social unrest in Europe and there will be an inexorable drive among the

case has been advanced for a referendum now, before the election, but I
wish to make it clear that I am completely opposed to that. An in/out
referendum now would give us two choices, neither of which I find
acceptable. Staying in on the existing terms would give the green light
to those who wish to continue their spendthrift ways and want to
continue the process towards ever-closer union. Getting out
is simply a retreat and a surrender to separatism. I am opposed to that

allowing the Government to renegotiate—or on demanding that they

supportive of the proposed wording—the point of saying that this

to why the chosen date should be 2017 rather than 2016 or

that my hon. Friend saw the light. Some of us not only campaigned in
the referendum in 1975 but voted against the Single European
Act—only three colleagues who did so remain in the House and,
unfortunately, they are all Opposition Members. This is terribly
important. My hon. Friend voted for the measure at the time because he
thought that he was voting for a common market in goods and services.
That is what the British people thought, and we tried to persuade them
that it was going to be more than that: it was going to be a united
states of Europe. That is the direction of travel, and there is no
indication that the direction of travel has changed, which is why we

This issue is about political union. If we strip away all the arguments
about repatriation and renegotiation, there is no doubt whatsoever for
anyone—I go to COSAC, which is the meeting of the chairmen of
national scrutiny committees on European affairs throughout Europe; 27,
now 28, chairmen joined together—that this is about political
union. We should be under no illusion about that. It is not about
anything else now. We had
Mr<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> Barroso
telling us recently in the blueprint paper that the European Parliament
is the only Parliament for the European Union. It is categorical, and I
will challenge any Member of Parliament to get up and suggest that this
is not embedded in the Maastricht treaty. That is what it was all
about—creating a new European Government, and it has grown
exponentially ever since.

right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary is right. We said that we
wanted to have a referendum on several of those treaties. Indeed, the
Conservative party was united in voting for a referendum on the Lisbon
treaty. However, we have now reached a different situation.
That is why it is important for the House to bear in mind
that it is not a question of what may happen between now and
2017; it is happening already. There is clear evidence of the
development, endorsed by the other member states, of a two-tier Europe
between the eurozone and the European Union itself. That is the
fundamental change that is already taking place, without a

unacceptable burden on our businesses and their employees emanate from
Europe, and the fact that there is 55% youth unemployment in Spain and
in Greece, which is blighting a generation. Does my hon. Friend agree

Members, have debated this in complete unity, for the same reason:
freedom is about freedom of choice. In parliamentary and constitutional
terms, freedom of choice depends upon freedom of choice at the ballot
box and in the marketplace. If we get the first, the political choice,
wrong, as has been going on with this European Government, we will end
up with austerity, small and medium-sized businesses not being able to
work properly, and massive unemployment among young people, which I

on more than one occasion in this House about the disconnect that now
exists between the people and the political class in Parliament. People
feel that their concerns are not being given high enough priority and
that, with regard to the EU, promises have been broken. On the Lisbon
treaty, for example, they believe that the Labour party promised a
referendum on the European constitution. I remember before a previous
election Tony Blair, with the encouragement of Lord Mandelson, bringing
the referendum rabbit out of the hat, but he reneged on that pledge
when he got into office, claiming then that there were red lines that
they would negotiate and that it was therefore no longer a
constitution. The people simply do not believe that.</hs_Para>

not just for a promise or a pledge but for some kind of guarantee
enshrined in legislation. Of course we know that this Parliament cannot
bind a successor Parliament, but that applies to every aspect of
legislation—to every Act that is ever passed. However, a
guarantee enshrined in legislation will make it a lot harder for any
incoming Prime Minister of whatever party to have—I was going to
say the courage—the audacity to come before the House and say,

take seriously the rise of UKIP, and understand why millions of
people—including former supporters of my party as well as of the

my speech as quickly as I can.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-05T12:26:05"></hs_TimeCode>We must
understand that the momentum behind this debate comes principally from
a sense of suffering felt by families up and down the
country—anxiety about whether their children will get jobs;
fears about long-term security and the sustainability of their
pensions. Under such circumstances, the EU has become a proxy for the
public’s wider anger about good services and housing, and in
doing so it has provided fertile territory for a lot of myths about the
EU. I do not for one moment doubt 
<?notus-xml column=1219?>the anger—indeed, I have confronted it—in some parts of
our country about the impact of too much migration too quickly, and the
sense of broader insecurity. People feel that their living standards
are falling. They are falling, but that is a result of decisions by
this UK Government, not decisions by Europe.</hs_Para>

principally about managing the Conservative party, and evidence
suggests that for the majority of right hon. and hon. Members in that
party it is about exit, not renegotiation in Europe. The real tragedy
is that renegotiation is possible, is needed, and is always to be
achieved, but that is not done by saying one thing at home and a
different thing in the Council of Ministers. If the Prime Minister is
serious about renegotiation, he must spend time going round the
capitals of Europe and visiting his counterparts, building trust and
securing the support of other European leaders for his case for change.
That is what will achieve change in Europe.</hs_Para>

is, of course, an agenda for reform, which Labour would support
wholeheartedly and—I hope—on a cross-party basis, if only
the Conservative party would demonstrate that it is serious about
reform rather than exit. Reform of the EU budget, the appointment of an
EU commissioner for growth, reforming transitional arrangements to
address issues such as too much migration too quickly, more powers
delegated to national Parliaments—those are all parts of an
agenda for reform that I am sure we could share.</hs_Para>

deliberate, debate and discuss the complex issues around it. Those of
us who are today putting forward this proposal for a referendum are
saying that we trust the British people to discuss such complex issues

many hon. Members who have said that this is an issue of trust. I do
not think that political parties should feel they cannot trust the
British people on this important issue, which has been the dominant
issue of the past 30 to 40 years. The constant debates in the House and
in the country, and the fact that the issue has seized the
consciousness of the British people, mean that at some stage we have to
put it to the British people. I believe that this should be done sooner
rather than later. We should do it now, if we can; if not now, then

Actually, I think the British people know the issues now. They
understand the issues that confront Europe, and I am not sure that a
public education campaign is what they need, as long as we are
committed to reform, and to changing the way in which the European
Union operates. There is much that we need to change on the justice and
home affairs agenda, for example, including measures on the European
arrest warrant and on the way in which countries such as Greece have to
deal with illegal migration. There are so many other areas that we need
to look at. We can be part of that process as we go along within the
European Union; we do not need to have a separate set of negotiations.

a Liberal Democrat, I like referendums—and we have been

Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. We were quite happy with the
referendum on the European Community in 1975, and we even went along
with the referendum on AV—the alternative vote
system—although we obviously cannot win them all. At the time of
the Lisbon treaty, we alone supported an in/out referendum for this
country—not at four years’ remove, not for some future
Parliament, but at that time. We got absolutely no support from the
Conservative party at that stage.</hs_Para>

am afraid that that was the completely consistent position through to
the general election of 2010, and it is more or less our position now.
The Deputy Prime Minister has set out our position, the only difference
being that in the meantime we have passed the European Union Act 2011,
which rather watered down the Liberal Democrat commitment to an in/out
referendum and adopted—<I>[Interruption.] </I>Conservative
Members may laugh, but they have obviously not read their own manifesto
of 2010. What is in the European Union Act 2011 is precisely the basis
on which Conservative Members fought the last general election, which
was the idea that there should be a trigger relating to the transfer of
power. The Conservative manifesto stated that in the event of a
transfer of power from the British level to the European level, a
referendum on that transfer would be held. That is exactly what went
into the European Union Act in 2011. We will quite happily use that to
trigger—that is fine—but we are still committed to an
in/out referendum, and I am still going to argue for

disagree with very little of what he actually wanted to change in

agenda. We have gone along with Conservative colleagues in supporting
the Government’s review of the balance of competences. I think
that is a very important process, and I think it is an absolutely
correct one to carry out, but I also think it was ill-judged to attach
a time bomb to all this and say that unless we get what we want we will
do this or that, and to try to negotiate on a unilateral basis. It
is important now to try to achieve these reforms on a

problems continue. The uncertainty that the Bill creates for business
is clear, even if we make a number of big assumptions about the
referendum process: first, that the Conservative Front Bench will not
change its position between now and 2017, but having changed it three
times in two years, that is a big assumption; secondly, that the
timetable for the referendum does not have to be changed in any case,
although we may find in 2017 that we are in the middle of a
renegotiation or treaty change process resulting from changes in the
eurozone, and at such a juncture, it would be nonsense to hold a
referendum, as another referendum might be provoked in only a matter of
months or years, so we would not really know what we were voting for in
those circumstances; and finally, if the political landscape had not
completely changed in any case we might have a different Government
with different priorities and there might be a recovery in the European
economy, and we may find votes for the UK Independence party subsiding
and that Europe is not quite such a big priority—it is not a
terribly big priority for most voters according to existing
polls—so the idea of spending yet more hundreds of hours of
parliamentary time banging on about Europe might not seem quite as
appealing.</hs_Para>

seems to me a straightforward matter. This House, by signing various
treaties, has taken away from the British people the right to throw out
the rascals who are making their laws. It is time, after those
treaties, that the people were given a chance to have that say in a
referendum. My party’s position on a referendum can, I hope, be
improved. We can have no principled objections to a referendum: it was
the Labour party that first gave the people the chance to vote on the
then EEC. We said in our 2005 manifesto that people would have a
vote on the European constitution. Unfortunately,
when the name of that constitution was changed to the Lisbon treaty,
the vote was denied them. That was a huge mistake and is one of the
reasons why the people of this country have lost

argument against those who say we do not need a referendum, three or
four reasons have been given for why we need a referendum. One is
uncertainty. That is the most perverse reason. There is uncertainty
because 80% of the British people want a referendum and they are
surprised that we cannot come to a conclusion about when that
referendum should be and what the question should be. The debate would
not go away and the uncertainty would not decrease if we opposed the

second reason given, which is related to the uncertainty argument, is
that British business is opposed to a referendum and jobs would go.

Ireland, Germany, Italy and the newer members of the EU, many of whom

Henderson</B> (Sittingbourne and Sheppey) (Con):</Member> There are a
number of good reasons why we should remain members of the

number of hon. Members have said, we are not here to discuss those; we
are here to discuss the referendum. This debate is about whether we
should allow the British public to decide once and for all whether we
should remain

many ways it saddens me that the Bill has been introduced. Under normal
circumstances, political parties set out their policies at election
time, and if elected are expected to deliver those policies. But with
Europe it is different, because the British public simply no longer
trust politicians to deliver on their promises. The public are cynical,
and rightly so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-05T13:12:53"></hs_TimeCode>.
The Bill is designed to show that on this occasion the Conservative

why are the British public so cynical? It is because they have been
denied a say for so long. It is worth remembering that when Britain
joined the European Economic Community in 1972, the British people were
not consulted. In 1993, the Maastricht treaty changed the name of the
EEC to the European Union. As

past. They remember Blair’s promises on the EU constitution and
Lisbon, when a referendum never materialised. They remember—or
are constantly reminded, I should say—of Liberal Democrat
promises at every general election on the need for a real referendum,
which, strangely, never materialise even when they share
power.</hs_Para>

referendum that was promised on the Lisbon treaty. Those parties would
surrender more powers to Brussels and adopt the euro. However, they
prefer to abstain on the Bill and call it a stunt than to engage the

era when the public are given referendums on local neighbourhood plans,
whether to adopt elected mayors and whether the parliamentary voting

the possibility of the UK no longer being seen as a sound location for
inward investment. Let me be clear: the single market is of central
economic importance to this country and 3.5 million jobs depend on that
market—150,000 in my country of Wales. Some companies say that
leaving the European Union will make no difference, but many others

needs certainty, people need certainty—as a minimum, they must
be certain of when the uncertainty will end. People also need to know
that Britain is ready for the results of a referendum, so let us do the
work now. There is nothing to stop the Government and the civil service
doing the ground work. Tell us what leaving or staying in the EU might
mean. Tell us that leaving is a possibility. Alongside the Bill, why
not publish an audit of the costs and benefits of EU membership, sooner
rather than later? Those are all activities we can undertake
now.</hs_Para>

trusting the people, but about people beginning to trust us again, as
the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Zac Goldsmith) said. Looking at the
records of all the political parties on Europe over the last 20 years,
the public find there is not much that they can trust in what any of
the political parties have said. That is precisely why we need this

the next election without offering the people the chance of a
referendum will not be looked on very well. I am therefore confident,
as some of my colleagues are, that our party will change its mind on

much—I will not go through all the different treaties. No one

What is the point? I genuinely cannot understand why we want to
abstain, other than to say that we are playing into the hands of the
Conservatives. I do not think I am playing into the hands of the
Conservatives by voting for this Bill today; I am playing into the
hands of my constituents and the British public, who want a referendum.

feel strongly that this Bill sends a message today, 40 years
after we originally joined the Common Market, that we are in a new
century and a new era. Europe has changed. Our country now needs to
make that final decision about whether our future will be in Europe or
whether we can see a better future outside Europe. We will be vilified
by the establishment—anyone who has tried to speak out on Europe
over the years has been vilified. The mantra of the European Union
elite has always been “Ever closer union”. They will not
allow such minor concerns as the opinion of the public to interfere in
referendum decisions. Over and over again, decisions are quietly pushed
through in Europe. We have to speak out. Now is the time for this
Parliament to say, “We want to govern our own country; we want
to have a referendum,” and let the public
decide<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-05T13:43:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

constituency is dominated by manufacturing companies that have a strong
presence in Europe: 88% of vehicles produced in the Vauxhall factory
end up in mainland Europe. We are trying to incentivise the supply
chain in the automotive sector, and in a range of other industries, to
come to the UK. During the four-year period, there will be key
investment decisions. My worry, when we talk to people in China and the
far east about bringing supply chain back to Europe, is that if there
is uncertainty about Britain’s place in Europe, they will be
more likely to place their investments in mainland Europe. That needs
to be considered during the passage of the Bill. If we are to have a

by the 1980s that our economy had become inextricably linked with the

who are of the view that our current relationship with Europe is
satisfactory or for those just want to leave the EU, but the reality is
that most of the British people, and most of the Conservative party,
are in the same space as me, thinking that there can be a role and a
constructive relationship with Europe, but that at the moment it is not
right. Europe simply has too much power. We need the opportunity to
seek a renegotiation and put that to the British

aspects of our lives. The British people do not like it. It will be bad

don’t want any more benefit tourists. We don’t want any

are certain to change course and bring forward a different
proposal—as would any other majority Government. If there is a
coalition Government, we will be back exactly where we are today.

would represent an extension of the opportunities available for British
business, and I remember that from the time when I worked with Margaret
Thatcher, who has been quoted several times. She was the person who
signed the single European Act, and she told us she did so because of
the advice given to her by the lawyers, that it was designed to achieve
the single market, and once that was done it was no longer necessary
and it would, essentially, come off the statute book. Unfortunately the
legal advice was wrong. It was not just confined to single market
measures. That phrase was interpreted to push through measures that had
nothing to do with the single market. It was for that reason that she

David Lammy</B> (Tottenham) (Lab):</Member> I am very grateful for the
opportunity to speak in this Adjournment debate. I want to talk about a
particularly important subject—young fathers, a group that is
often overlooked, frequently marginalised, and rarely supported in our
society.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13070542001327" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130705/debtext/130705-0003.htm#13070542001327">Over<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-05T14:31:37"></hs_TimeCode>
the past few years, there has rightly been a lot of concentration on
young mothers, with particular public policy concentration on teenage
pregnancy. However, there is so little provision for young fathers that
we do not even know how many there are in Britain, because there are no
accurate figures. However, those of us representing constituencies like
Tottenham know that they exist and that they are frequently crying out
for help and support.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13070542001328" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130705/debtext/130705-0003.htm#13070542001328"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-05T14:32:10"></hs_TimeCode>Modern
society is changing more quickly than ever before. The traditional
society of the 1950s was opened up with the social liberal revolution
of the 1960s and the economic liberal revolution of the 1980s. Both
have brought more women into the workplace, raising their skill levels
and aspirations, with society increasingly seeing them not just as
mothers but as workers in the workplace. That is incontestably a good
thing. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-05T14:32:42"></hs_TimeCode>At the
same time, the British family has changed. Between 1975 and 1997, the
time British fathers spent with their children on an average working
day increased from just 15 minutes to two hours. Again, that is
incontestably a good thing.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13070542001329" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130705/debtext/130705-0003.htm#13070542001329">However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-05T14:29:47"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-05T14:35:00"></hs_TimeCode>,
policy has often not caught up with the way that families want to live
their lives. Too often, it rests on outdated assumptions of one carer,
usually the mum, and one breadwinner, usually the dad. That does not
reflect the reality of very many families out there in our
country<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-05T14:33:25"></hs_TimeCode>.
Therefore, in 2010, I set up the all-party group on fatherhood to place
the importance of fathers on to policy makers’ desks and into
their in-boxes, and to bring our 19th-century social policy up to date
with our 21st-century economy and family life.</hs_Para>

others have been instrumental in raising these issues over many years,
often against a backdrop of official indifference or, sometimes,
hostility. Adrienne Burgess and her colleagues at the Fatherhood
Institute have shifted the terms of the debate, as has Professor Tina
Miller at Oxford Brookes university, both of whom well understand that
active, engaged fathers are good for families, good for children, and,
importantly in these straitened times, good for the economy. I salute
their
work.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070542001331" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130705/debtext/130705-0003.htm#13070542001331">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-05T14:35:00"></hs_TimeCode>
also salute the work of many organisations—too numerous to
mention—that work with not only fathers, but young fathers in
places such as my constituency. They often do so out of the limelight
and often try to convince local public services of the value that dads
can offer families. I am thinking in particular of Shane Ryan and his
group Working with Men, which works extensively in south London. Such
vital work is too often
under-appreciated<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-05T14:34:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Lammy:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman raises an important point to
which I will return. We as policy makers need to think about and
understand families. There may not be a relationship between mum and
dad, but more often than not the father needs to remain engaged. In the
case of young fathers, they need a lot of support to remain engaged, or
they might walk away and never
return<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-05T14:36:58"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-05T14:37:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070542001336" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130705/debtext/130705-0003.htm#13070542001336">Our
media talk so often about “feckless fathers” and
“deadbeat dads” and assume that all young fathers fit the
same, sometimes inaccurate stereotype. That has to stop. It is time for
young dads not just to be listened to, but to be heard, because they
are all too often unwilling to disappear from their children’s
lives. They are often disfranchised by neglect and by lack of support
from the system, not by design. Mums, dads, children—the whole
family—lose out if young fathers find themselves in that
position<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-05T14:37:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070542001337" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130705/debtext/130705-0003.htm#13070542001337">Let
us be clear: as President Obama has said, what makes a man is not
conceiving a child, but having the courage to raise one. Fathers of
whatever age have to live up to their responsibilities and to the high
expectations that we should all as a society have of them. That does
not mean that society should not help them live up to those
expectations, particularly when they are young

fathers present specific issues. It is often the case that they were
looked-after children, excluded from schools or raised in poverty.
Teenage fathers are three times more likely to have failed to have
completed secondary education and much more likely than their peers to
not be in education, employment or training. Unfortunately, many are
young offenders: 12 % of 15 to 17-year-old offenders have children of
their own, and nearly half of those aged 22 and under are or are about
to become
fathers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-05T14:39:11"></hs_TimeCode>. Many of
them have never seen what good parenting looks like so, without

often, we condemn young fathers for their background. They are failed

when they 
<?notus-xml column=1256?>become fathers. That feeds feelings of deep inadequacy and shame. They
know that they are unprepared for fatherhood, but do not know where to
turn to for support. They have much higher rates of anxiety and

A debate on this matter in Parliament is long overdue. On housing, the
single room rate for people up to the age of 35 means that
increasingly, young men live in bedsits in houses with lots of other
young men. That is not a suitable place to take a child if the father

Lammy:</Member></B> My hon. Friend raises an important issue. If we
believe, as I suspect Members across the House do, that we must keep
fathers engaged with their children, assuming that there is no issue
such as violence, the contact that they have with their children is
fundamental. Policies such as the room rate cut across that. The costs
that society has to pick up when a father becomes disengaged from his
son, and the costs of the repetition when that son becomes a young man,
are considerable. I am pleased that she has raised that
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-05T14:41:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070542001343" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130705/debtext/130705-0003.htm#13070542001343">The
Work programme is limping along and the Youth Contract is not doing its
job for this cohort of young men. We need tailored programmes for young
men, and for young dads in particular, because we understand the cost
to society if they do not get it right at this stage.
Things<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-05T14:42:12"></hs_TimeCode> do not
look good, which can make these young men very angry. When I hosted a
recent meeting of the all-party parliamentary group on fatherhood in
which we spoke to young fathers, I saw just how angry these young men
can be because of their frustration at wanting to be good fathers, but
not being supported by the

only are young fathers not supported or helped; they are demonised by
journalists and politicians. Myths solidify into facts. The isolated
but deeply regrettable incidents of men who father children with
different mothers become the rule, not the exception. Figures from the
Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission show that fewer than 5,000
men are paying maintenance for children they have had with three
partners and that fewer than 500 men are paying maintenance for
children they have had with four partners. Although those men may not
have lived up to the high expectations that we should have of them,
they do not represent the vast majority of young
fathers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-05T14:43:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070542001345" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130705/debtext/130705-0003.htm#13070542001345">We
must bust some other myths too. The majority of young fathers are in
relationships with the mothers of their children. The millennium cohort
study found that 
<?notus-xml column=1257?>half the partners of teenage mothers were living with them during the
pregnancy. The vast majority of young fathers intend to play a full
role in their children’s lives, and that intention does not
disappear with the first sleepless night or the first nappy—in
fact, it often grows. The same study found that one in five
non-resident fathers who had low contact with their 10-month-old
infants were in more frequent and often daily contact when the child
was three. Young dads want to be there for their children just as much
as all dads; they just need support to do it, as one would expect of
young

young dads live chaotic lives. Many hon. Members will be familiar with
young people who live chaotic lives, perhaps even in their own homes.
For many young men, becoming a dad is the wake-up call that pushes them
to take control of their lives and to take better care of themselves,
as well as their families. That is exactly what I saw when I visited St
Michael’s Fellowship in Brixton—a wonderful organisation
that works with young dads in some of the most testing circumstances in
Britain. I wish to place on record my thanks to Seany O’Kane,
who runs the scheme, and to Kim Normanton, a BBC producer who allowed
me to spend time at St Michael’s recording

involved in their children’s lives and to be good role models.
They each told me that they feel they are on their own and expected to
get by without help, support or even recognition of their needs. Too
often, they come up against maternity services at children’s

that young dads often have greater needs than other fathers, and in
other parts of our public services that would mean more provision for
them, not less. In too many parts of our public services, however,
young fathers are practically invisible—at best ignored, and
seen by some workers as a risk or a danger to be avoided. Too many are
denied access to their children and have to fight their way through the
courts. Without legal aid many men are now presenting to MPs in a
breakdown situation with their partners, and they have to supervise
themselves through the court system. Expecting an 18, 19 or 20-year-old
to supervise themselves through a legal process is expecting too much
and nothing short of a national disgrace. The Government should think
carefully about their provisions for legal aid in such family
cases.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070542001349" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130705/debtext/130705-0003.htm#13070542001349">There
is no statutory requirement to provide services to young fathers.
Support is piecemeal, patchy and at heart a postcode lottery. Too
often, young fathers say they are ignored by public service
professionals, who assume that the father is not really interested in
their child. Where support is provided to fathers, it is often generic
and tailored to older fathers who may need less help. A recent survey
found that in half of cases involving a young family, the health
visitor did not even know the father’s name. Young fathers often
have little contact with midwives, health visitors and social workers.
Children’s centres often have targets for engaging with dads,
but there are no data on how many children actually come into contact
with their dad. Good children’s centres, 
<?notus-xml column=1258?>like Earlsmead and Noel Park in my constituency in Haringey do encourage
such contact, but many will

is a problem, and not just for the dads themselves. Research suggests
that the mother’s perspective on her care will be determined to
a large extent by her partner’s views. A young father who is
engaged with public services is more likely to remain supportive of
their children’s care as they grow up. That is good for children
and the partner. Young mothers who believe that their partner is
supportive have higher self-esteem, lower depression, and are more
likely to be positively attached to their child.</hs_Para>

should be a win-win situation is too often a lose-lose
one—public services push away a young dad, which leads to a
young mum bringing up her child on her own. Such reluctance to engage
with young fathers might also spring from a reluctance to engage young
people at all when it comes to sex education. Young dads know less
about sex and relationships than young mums, although most are happy to
learn<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-05T14:48:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070542001352" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130705/debtext/130705-0003.htm#13070542001352">A
reluctance to engage young dads before the birth feeds into a lack of
provision for couples to raise their child together after the birth.
Most residential homes are for mothers and babies only—again,
treating fathers as though they are a danger, irrelevant, or both. Too
many young couples are forced apart because of local authority housing
decisions that do not take a whole-family approach that would enable
young parents to establish their own households. Pressure on young
fathers and families builds up, making it even more difficult for them
to look after their

need an entire shift in attitude on behalf of public services from
focusing exclusively on the mother and child to thinking about the
family, including the father, however young he might be. That must
begin from the high expectations that we should have of all fathers.
Significant numbers of the birth certificates of children born to
teenage mothers do not identify the father at all. How can we show
fathers our expectations of them if we do not even require their names
to be on their children’s birth certificates? Will the Minister
explain—I have raised this issue in many forums—why his
Government have not enacted the provisions in the Welfare Reform Act
2009 that would provide for joint birth registration?</hs_Para>

dads often experience significant financial hardship. We know that the
best way for them to provide for themselves and their families is
through skilled, decent, well-paid work. The problems that young
fathers face because of the Work Programme’s one-size-fits-all
approach are too numerous to mention. Will the Minister raise that
issue with his colleagues in the Department for Work and Pensions? It
is not acceptable that public services should fail to engage with young
fathers at all. Young dads should be engaged from antenatal services
onwards, improving outcomes for their children and breaking down
poverty and social exclusion. To achieve that, maternity services,
health visitors, social workers and children’s centres should,
at the very least, always record the father’s details,
regardless of his age, and work with the voluntary sector and
children’s centres to provide the best possible targeted support
for the family as a whole, including young dads.</hs_Para>

State for Education about what more the Government can do to raise the
profile of the expectations that we should have of young fathers and
the services that local authorities and local institutions need to
deliver if we are to see fewer break-ups and less poverty as a result?
Will the Minister also work to introduce parenting education for all
secondary school pupils? Most of all, if we are to support young dads
properly, we need the data to understand how many are out there. How
many are being helped by our public services, as well as by local
authorities and the voluntary sector? Will the Minister ensure that
those data are collected in a standardised form, where safe to do so,

will the Minister and his colleagues commit to improving the services

better fathers than they might otherwise have been. Will the Minister
commit to reinstating the teenage pregnancy strategy, which provided so
much support for young parents? There has been a substantial cut. Local

attainment, improved behaviour, better well-being and better
relationships with their children. As he said, the foundations of so
many social problems—and success stories—are laid in the

centres have the capacity to be life changing, ensuring that the
families who need the services the most get the support they need. By
identifying, reaching and helping the families in greatest need, they
help to improve parenting capacity and health and well-being, and
support the development of children so that they are well prepared to
start school. Children’s centres offer different approaches to
provide an environment in which fathers feel comfortable. For example,
many offer stay and play sessions for fathers and children or networks
to enable fathers to meet up and feel confident to use their local
centres. I remember a few years ago, as part of an inquiry by the
Children, Schools and Families Committee, visiting a children’s
centre in Westminster North where it was doing exactly that: trying to
work out how better to engage with young dads.</hs_Para>

through interacting with the staff to enable him to be better around

is vital that very young people who are about to become parents get the
support they need too. Pregnancy and birth present the first
opportunity to engage fathers in the care and upbringing of
their children. It is important that both the mother and father feel
involved in the pregnancy from an early stage. In 2011, the Royal
College of Midwives published “Top Tips for Involving Fathers in
Maternity Care”. It cites the teenage pregnancy support unit in
Hull, which assesses the needs of young fathers as well as young
mothers, and provides support to develop parenting skills. On a recent
visit to Eagle Bridge health centre in Crewe, I met a teenage couple
who were first-time parents. They spoke about how they were benefiting
from the personalised support they were receiving from the family nurse
partnership programme. The right hon. Gentleman spoke about a wake-up
call, and that was very much that couple’s experience of the
programme, which supports children in some of the most disadvantaged
circumstances. By 2015, some 16,000 families in need will be benefiting
from the
service<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-05T14:59:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Norman
Baker):</Member></B> I am pleased to announce today our plans to reform
the bus subsidy system. We intend to implement a package of measures
designed to improve services by making the subsidy provided to bus
companies—bus service operators grant (BSOG)—more
targeted and
accountable.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13070546000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130705/wmstext/130705m0001.htm#13070546000036">In
2012 there were 4.7 billion bus passenger boardings made in England and
over 60% of all public transport trips were made on local buses. Given
the crucial role the bus network plays in supporting social inclusion,
linking people to places of commerce and providing employers with
access to labour markets, buses deserve to be recognised as the
backbone of our public transport system and key to a healthy, growing
economy.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13070546000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130705/wmstext/130705m0001.htm#13070546000037">However,
despite pockets of strong growth, overall bus patronage has been in
long-term decline. Added to this, the way in which subsidy is used to
support the bus market has become increasingly poorly targeted. This
economic context, however, makes it imperative to push for improved bus
services that are more locally accountable and provide better value for
passenger and taxpayer. This is why we intend to reform bus subsidy by
making the following
changes:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13070546000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130705/wmstext/130705m0001.htm#13070546000062">creation

first three of these changes will take effect from 1 October
this year. However, I have decided to allow more time for local
authorities and operators to prepare for the paying of BSOG for

will not come into force until 1 January
2014.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13070546000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130705/wmstext/130705m0001.htm#13070546000039">We

funding for supported services to local authorities will give
communities more control over how money is spent. At the same time, I
am keen this change should not cause temporary instability to local
services. The majority of both bus operators and local 
<?notus-xml column=75?>authorities have asked for an extended period of ring fencing, and I
believe that the case is a strong one. The funds which we devolve will,
therefore, be ring fenced until the end of 2016-17. In turn, we expect
local authorities to take due account of the tendered BSOG foregone by
bus companies operating non-commercial services in managing existing
contractual arrangements with them for these services and when agreeing
new
contracts.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13070546000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130705/wmstext/130705m0001.htm#13070546000041">A
further key reform is the introduction of better bus areas. I was
delighted to designate Sheffield as the first BBA in February. Other
local authorities had until today to bid to become BBAs with
announcements on further designations to be made this autumn. BBAs
offer an opportunity to explore how bus subsidy can be better used by
local authorities, working with local operators, to attract more people
onto buses and ensure better value for the
taxpayer.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13070546000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130705/wmstext/130705m0001.htm#13070546000042">Management
of bus services in London is the responsibility of Transport for London
and most of the substantial funding from central Government to support
transport in London is currently paid to TfL in a single 
<?notus-xml column=76?>grant. In line with this, from October a sum broadly equivalent to the
BSOG for London services will be paid directly to TfL and the Greater
London
Authority.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13070546000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130705/wmstext/130705m0001.htm#13070546000043">Finally,
BSOG was designed to support local bus services, but over time a wider
range of services than was intended laid claim to some of the subsidy.
So, we have tightened the rules so that certain services are no longer
eligible for BSOG. In particular, the removal of eligibility from rail
replacement buses will also serve as a message to the rail industry
that we expect them to use trains rather than buses wherever
possible.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13070546000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130705/wmstext/130705m0001.htm#13070546000044">The
Government recognises that this package of reforms represents
significant change for the industry. Local authority and bus industry
views have therefore been vital to the development of our proposals and
I am grateful for the input we have received. The reforms announced
today mark an opportunity to reshape the support we provide for the bus
industry for the better, using a long-standing subsidy in a targeted
manner in order to improve services, encourage partnership working and
deliver better value for money. I look forward to the improvements that
these reforms will
bring.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment></System><System type="Writtens" ColStart="809"><?date 2013-07-05?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_05_PT_1/12A6D80CC2FBD53CA7DB7E7751FF463830E8EEEA" __version__="1.1"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="5 July 2013">Friday

provided by the detailed developed submissions and their independent
assessment by external experts. The cost breakdown for the proposed
projects was evaluated internally by the Technology Strategy Board in
terms of eligible costs under the rules of the competition, and tested
for reasonableness, based on evidence from the large number of projects
that the Technology Strategy Board has successfully funded. Since third
party contracts would be subject to public procurement rules, it was
not possible for applicants to specify which third parties would be
undertaking specific project activities in detail. The Technology
Strategy Board relies on the public procurement process and the
independent auditing of the local authority accounts to ensure that the
appropriate processes were followed and value for money
secured.</hs_brev><hs_8Question UID="13070541000028" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130705/text/130705w0001.htm#13070541000028">Royal

this guidance is being updated as part of the Government's review of
planning guidance. Article 4 directions vary significantly in scope,
and can apply for example to a single property or a wider area. It is

imposed unnecessary restrictions on business, and made it too difficult
for buildings to have different uses and to change uses. The
Government's response to the Portas Review in March 2012 noted
that the Government was undertaking a wider review of how change of use
is handled in the planning system, with a view to reducing the burden
of regulation.</hs_Para>

High Streets Forum was set up in March 2013. It is considering a wide
range of issues, including planning, that impact on the high street.
The proposal for a temporary two-year flexible use was set out in the
July 2012 consultation "New opportunities for sustainable development
and growth through the reuse of existing buildings". The summary of
responses was published in May 2013, and the amended rules came into
force on 30 May 2013. As announced in the Budget, we are considering
what further steps can be taken to support vibrant town centres and
help get empty and redundant buildings back into productive

primarily under the auspices of the strategic health authorities, who
themselves published their own strategic vision documents, upon which
the final report drew considerably. The national review team was
led by Professor the Lord Darzi of Denham, the then

decided. However current rules exempt claimants from serving waiting
days where they have returned to jobseeker's allowance within 12 weeks
of the end of a previous claim to jobseeker's allowance or a previous
claim to another benefit, for example employment and support allowance.
Young people who receive Jobseeker's allowance under severe hardship
provisions are also exempt. It is likely that these exemptions will be
carried forward to the new, extended seven-day waiting

achieved a job outcome rate three percentage points or more higher than
the lower performing prime provider in year 2 of the programme, ending
March 2013. They must also have achieved a satisfactory rating in their
most recent assurance review and in the most recent Merlin Standard
assessment of their supply chain management. Assessments of
