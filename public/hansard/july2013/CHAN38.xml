Gentleman’s question. DFID has health programmes and general
programmes to lift people out of poverty, but also to ensure that they
have access to services like health care that can help them get on with
their day-to-day lives. I will write to him with a fuller update on

West Africa has particularly high rates of population growth, and there
is much less take-up of family planning there. DFID’s work
involves not only family planning—which is a complex
issue—but the delaying of first pregnancies, access to economic
assets for girls, getting girls through secondary school and preventing
violence, all of which contribute to making the population richer and
more
successful.</hs_Para><Question><hs_Para UID="13071772000092" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0001.htm#13071772000092"><Number>11</Number>.

instance, although Scunthorpe hospital is on that list of 11 hospitals,
an extra 100 nurses are working there compared with three years ago. In
addition, 10 of those 11 hospitals have higher numbers of clinical
staff. The

offenders were removed from the UK in 2012 and the annual removal rate
has remained broadly consistent since then. However, the number of
foreign nationals in prison in England and Wales is still far too high,
and while it is lower than at the election, we can do more. That is why
the Justice Secretary is working to secure compulsory prisoner transfer
agreements with those countries with the highest populations of foreign
offenders. The Government will make it clear in the immigration Bill
this autumn that foreign national offenders will be deported except in
exceptional circumstances. I think that everyone in this House can

Minister for Schools (Mr David Laws):</Member></B> We are today
announcing the launch of our consultation on primary assessment and
accountability, alongside a significant increase in the pupil premium
for primary schools. This is about delivering a step change in
aspirations and attainment in primary education, and these proposals
are among the most important that our Department has announced since
the formation of the coalition Government. We want as many children as
possible to be ready for secondary school by the time they leave
primary school, and the reforms we are announcing today are designed to
ensure that pupils are well prepared for the next stage of their
education, and that schools do not allow pupils to fall behind. We are
confident that primary schools and pupils can and will rise to that
challenge.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071772000210" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0001.htm#13071772000210"> We
want to see a step change in attainment at the end of primary school.
In the past, the achievement bar was set too low and too few pupils
cleared that bar. Our ambition is for all pupils—excepting some
of those with particular learning needs—to be ready for
secondary school at age 11. That means we need a higher measure of what
success looks like. We are already raising the threshold for the
percentage of pupils to be ready for secondary school from 60% to 65%,
but we know that many schools and teachers have already raised their
game way beyond that level. For that reason, in the future we will
expect a high proportion of pupils—85%—to reach the new,
higher secondary readiness threshold for a school. Since we know that
both children and schools can achieve that, it is right that we set it
as a minimum
standard.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071772000211" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0001.htm#13071772000211">Our
new national curriculum is designed to give schools genuine
opportunities to take ownership of the curriculum. The new programmes
of study, published on 8 July, set out what pupils should be taught by
the end of primary education. Teachers will be able to develop a school
curriculum that delivers the core content in a way that is challenging
and relevant for their pupils.  Statutory assessment in core
subjects at the end of key stages is designed primarily to enable
robust external accountability. We will continue to prescribe statutory
assessment arrangements in English, maths and science. National
curriculum tests in English and maths will continue, and will show
whether pupils have met a demanding secondary readiness standard, which
will remain the same from year to year. We propose to report
pupils’ test results as a scaled score to ensure that test
outcomes are comparable over time. At the moment, pupils are ranked by
levels. In future we will report each pupil’s performance
relative to their peers nationally, as well as their levels of
progress. This is key information for parents: it will help them easily
to see how their child has performed compared with the national cohort
of pupils.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13071772000212" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0001.htm#13071772000212">It is vital
that we set high aspirations for all schools and pupils. Our new
expectations will prepare children for success. At the moment pupils
are being asked to reach a bar that too often sets them up for failure
rather than success. Indeed we know that over half of pupils who
currently reach just the 4C benchmark standard fail to secure five good
GCSEs including English and 
<?notus-xml column=1100?>maths. So that all children, whatever their circumstances, can arrive in
secondary school ready to succeed, we are giving significantly more
money to primary school pupils eligible for the pupil premium. That
will support the step change in ambition we are announcing
today.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071772000213" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0001.htm#13071772000213">We
introduced the pupil premium in 2011 to help schools close the
attainment gap for disadvantaged pupils. In 2014-15, total funding
through the pupil premium will increase by £625 million to the
total of £2.5 billion pledged by the coalition in 2010. We will
use the extra funding in the year ahead to increase significantly the
level of the pupil premium for primary schools to £1,300 per
pupil, compared with £900 in the current year. This 44% rise in
the pupil premium next year is the largest cash rise so far. That
should enable more targeted interventions to support disadvantaged
pupils to be secondary ready and achieve our ambitious expectations for
what pupils should know and be able to do by the end of their primary
education. Early intervention is crucial: the more disadvantaged pupils
who leave primary school with strong literacy and numeracy, the greater
their chances of achieving good GCSEs.  We will fix the
level of the secondary pupil premium in the autumn, but it will rise
further, by at least the level of inflation next
year.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071772000214" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0001.htm#13071772000214">We
also want to treat schools fairly by acknowledging the performance of
schools whose pupils achieve well despite a low starting point, even if
that does not reach the very ambitious attainment targets we are
setting. We will therefore look at how we can introduce a
robust measure of progress that we can take into
consideration when holding schools to account. A school that
does not achieve the attainment threshold will not be judged to be
below the floor standard if its pupils are making good progress. The
progress measure will also help identify coasting schools, whose pupils
do not achieve their full potential and should be doing much better
even if their school is meeting the attainment targets. Ofsted will
focus its inspections more closely on schools below and just above
floor standards, and inspect schools with good performance on these
measures less frequently. </hs_Para>

continue to report on the progress pupils make during primary
education.  In order to measure pupils’ progress, we need
to measure how each pupil’s end of key stage 2 test results
compare with the results of pupils with similar prior attainment. This
is an opportunity to reconsider the structure of statutory assessment
early in primary schools.  In particular, we are consulting on
when we should have a baseline test or assessment to measure
pupils’ progress.  Currently the baseline against which
we measure progress is at the end of key stage 1. We could continue to
keep the baseline at this stage. Alternatively, we could introduce a
similar teacher-led baseline check early in reception, which would help
teachers understand the stage the child has reached and allow the
crucial progress made in reception, year 1 and year 2 to be reflected
in the accountability system. Many schools do that. Our consultation
will seek views on which is the better
option.   </hs_Para>

recognise that teachers are professionals, and we want to give schools
more freedom over the way they measure assessment. We have already
announced that we will remove the current system of national curriculum
levels and level descriptors, which imposes a 
<?notus-xml column=1101?>single system and prescribes a detailed sequence for what pupils should
be taught. That will leave schools free to decide how to track
pupils’ progress. Ofsted will expect to see evidence of
pupils’ progress, but inspections will be informed by the pupil
tracking data that schools choose to keep.</hs_Para>

together, this combination of measures will ensure that pupils are
ready for success in secondary education, and a better start in
secondary school will ensure a better start in life. This country is
now moving from an education system that served the needs of a minority
to a system of high expectation and high standards for every single
pupil. Today’s announcements are a key step in that continued
journey. I commend this statement to the

Labour came to power in 1997 we inherited a sorry state in the
education system. From day one we gave priority to primary education.
In 1997 only 59% of 11-year-olds reached the expected level of
attainment in maths and 65% in English. By 2010 these figures had risen
to 79% and 80% respectively. That was huge progress, but I agree that
we need to build on this success. I take the opportunity to pay tribute
to the hard work of heads, teachers and support staff in primary
schools across the
country.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071772000220" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0001.htm#13071772000220">It
is right that we have high expectation for all children in all schools,
raising aspiration and unleashing potential. We will engage
constructively with this consultation. We know from outstanding primary
schools such as Cuckoo Hall primary in Enfield and Westfield community
primary school in Wigan that all children can realise their true
ability when they receive an excellent education. On leaving primary
school, children need to be prepared with the knowledge, the skills and
the resilience to take on the secondary curriculum. Despite massive
progress, there are still too many children who are ill-equipped when
they begin their secondary education.</hs_Para>

all children reach at least the expected levels in maths and English is
crucial. High standards of numeracy and literacy are vital; so, too, is
a broad and rich curriculum that promotes creativity, enrichment,
citizenship and resilience. I worry that the Government’s
approach to the curriculum is too narrow and risks selling children
short. What assurances can the Minister give that the
Government’s changes to the accountability system will promote
breadth and depth of learning, as well as literacy and numeracy? He has
set out a new floor target of 85%, but that target is for an assessment
that the Government have yet to define. Surely that is putting the cart
before the horse. Would it not make for better policy to define the
learning outcomes first? My worry is that this is another classic case
of policy making on the
hoof.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071772000222" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0001.htm#13071772000222">Similarly,
the plan for ranking 11-year-olds has all the hallmarks of such an
approach. To rank 11-year-olds runs the risk of removing year-on-year
consistency, because children will be benchmarked against their peers
in their current year, rather than against a common standard. Does the
Minister agree that this risks damaging standards by not ensuring
consistency over time?</hs_Para>

have sent out confused signals about attainment and progress. On the
one hand they are scrapping level descriptors, which heads and teachers
tell me are crucial for monitoring progress between assessments, yet on
the other hand, the Minister is rightly emphasising progress measures
today. That is very confusing. I ask the Government to think again
about the abolition of level
descriptors.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071772000224" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0001.htm#13071772000224">On
the baseline measure for five-year-olds, there is sense in developing
policy about how best to establish prior attainment to provide both
teachers and parents with a clear indicator at the start of primary
school. The devil will be in the detail, so it is vital that there is
full consultation on
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071772000225" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0001.htm#13071772000225">Finally,
on the pupil premium, additional funding to support the progress of
disadvantaged children is welcome. I have seen many schools that have
made excellent use of the pupil premium. In his statement, though, the
Minister said, “Early intervention is crucial”, and I
agree with him. However, how does that sit with the fact that the
biggest cuts in spending in his Department have been in early
intervention funding? Can the Minister assure the House that additional
funding really does mean additional funding?</hs_Para>

the Minister may—to coin a phrase—be robbing Paul to pay
Paul. The Chancellor announced in the spending review that the
Government are moving to a national funding formula. The independent
Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned that this move could hit

this really is new money and not simply giving money to schools with a

sensible and constructive approach that the hon. Gentleman has taken. I
particularly welcome the fact that he has said that he is prepared to
engage with us in dealing with some serious and important issues, such
as the baseline for measuring progress. It encourages me that we can

respond briefly to five points that the hon. Gentleman made in his
response. First, on the Government’s inheritance, I accept that
progress was made under the previous Government, particularly in some
parts of the country such as London. However, our inheritance of
aspirations at the end of primary level was, frankly, hopelessly low.
Even today, we allow schools potentially to pass their floor targets
when one third of their pupils or more fail to achieve a basic level of
English and maths. Worse still, our very measure of
achievement—the 4C measure—leads to more than half the
youngsters who achieve just that level failing to get five good GCSEs.
In other words, we have been sending out a message about what success
looks like at the end of primary school which is totally wrong. Indeed,
some of the best schools in the country—including St
Joseph’s primary school in Camden, which the Deputy Prime
Minister and I visited this morning—have already moved well
beyond 4C and in many cases are aiming at much 
<?notus-xml column=1103?>higher levels, such as 4A, 5C and so forth. The Government need to catch
up with those schools, which are leading the debate in
education.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13071772000230" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0001.htm#13071772000230">The second
point was about the broadness and richness of the experience in
schools. The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right that, although the
concentration on English and maths is important, we do not want that to
lead to a dramatic narrowing of the curriculum. The other subjects that
people take, both academic and vocational—arts, music and
sport—are incredibly important. However, no one can succeed in
secondary education if they cannot read and add up. No one can enjoy
the opportunities in all the other subjects if they are not equipped
with those basic skills. I would also refer the hon. Gentleman to the
changes we have already announced in the secondary measures of
accountability. We will be incentivising schools to take not just five
but eight GCSEs, and we will allow that to include vocational as well
as academic subjects.</hs_Para>

point that the hon. Gentleman made was about whether 85% was the right
level and whether we were right to set such an ambitious target now, in
advance of the precise measures being introduced in 2016. I think we
are right to set out those principles now. The schools that he and I
are familiar with, from inner London and elsewhere, are already setting
levels of aspiration of 85%, 90% or 95%, at an even higher level than
4B, which I talked about in a speech a couple of months ago, so I think
that we are right to raise expectations now. For too long we have had
expectations set by very low levels, which are more about the levels
set for school intervention than about reasonable aspirations for all
schools.</hs_Para>

not talking about publishing information about individual students at a
national level. That would of course be totally wrong. What we are
talking about is something that I think virtually every parent in the
country will welcome, which is more information—and more
meaningful information—about how their children are doing. At
the moment, apart from a few people in the Department for Education and
around the House, level descriptors frankly mean nothing to the average
parent. Having a mark, a measure of progress and a clear sense of where
their pupil is versus the rest of the cohort is only sensible. Parents
could do that at the moment through the levels process, if they could
actually understand that process, which is so complicated. What we are
doing will help parents, but we will listen to the messages that come

me turn to the hon. Gentleman’s point about money and early
intervention. What we are announcing is about doing a lot more through
early intervention. The additional money for the pupil premium that the
Government have delivered, even in these times of austerity, is
something of which the coalition can feel incredibly proud. The levels
we are setting today will mean that the additional money going to
pupils from the pupil premium from their time in primary school will be
£8,000 or £9,000 per pupil. That is a massive amount to
help schools across the country, particularly in disadvantaged areas,
to bring children up to a reasonable standard.</hs_Para>

of State of micro-managing individual schools and telling them what
interventions they need to deliver. Schools have a better understanding

than we will ever do, sitting in a Department in London. However, we
are going to hold schools to account for ensuring that whatever
interventions they 
<?notus-xml column=1106?>use are successful. We have worked closely with Ofsted to ensure that
this is a key part of the accountability process for schools, and that
there is a much greater focus by Ofsted on narrowing the gap. The chief
inspector has made it clear that schools will no longer be ranked
outstanding if they are failing in this key area, and there will be a
requirement on schools that are not delivering a good standard to
commission support from key leaders in education, such as national
leaders of education, to bring advice into the school when it is
failing to narrow the gaps. We have also recently appointed the widely

deprived communities are going out to engage with reluctant parents and
they often have considerable success in persuading those parents that
education is important for their young children’s future. This
can be a way of engaging parents who might not have had good
educational experiences themselves, potentially enriching their own

Many schools have closed the gaps very considerably. The important
thing is to make sure that the accountability system is an intelligent
one, as it would be possible to close the gap but at a very low level
of attainment, while some of the schools that we wrote to this year had
high levels of overall attainment but large gaps, so they should have
been doing better for their youngsters. Our attention was drawn to
schools where there was no gap, but where the attainment of
disadvantaged youngsters was not good enough. The accountability will
be for the gap, but also for the progress made by
disadvantaged youngsters and the level of attainment of disadvantaged
youngsters in a school compared with the national average. There will
be no hiding place for schools that might otherwise have a small gap
but at a very modest level of
attainment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071772000269" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0001.htm#13071772000269"><Member ContinuationText="Ian Swales" PimsId="5649" UID="13071772001624" xid="1133" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0001.htm#13071772001624"><B>Ian

</B>With permission, Mr Speaker, I shall make a statement on the
Government’s response to the alcohol strategy consultation.
Today we are publishing an analysis of responses to the consultation,
along with a “next steps” document. Copies of both are

behaviour and alcohol-fuelled disorder can make towns and cities
effective no-go areas for law-abiding people, particularly on Friday
and Saturday nights. In nearly 50% of the incidents of violence that
took place in 2011-12, the victim believed that the perpetrator was
under the influence of alcohol. Excessive alcohol consumption costs the
taxpayer huge amounts of money: alcohol-related crime and health harms
are estimated to cost society about £21 billion every year. The
Government therefore have a role in seeking to curb excessive drinking.
We have already increased duty on alcopops, and have introduced a
wide-ranging set of reforms to tackle binge drinking.</hs_Para>

and effective policies. We are not in the business of making laws that
do not work. For that reason we have consulted widely, and have taken
time to consider carefully the representations that we have received
and all the relevant arguments. Our response identifies three kinds of
action that are necessary. The first is targeted national action: the
Government must deal with cheap alcohol, and the alcohol industry must
strengthen its voluntary commitments to reduce alcohol-related
harms.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13071772000289" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0001.htm#13071772000289">There has
been much speculation about the Government’s plans in relation
to minimum unit pricing. That policy will remain under consideration,
but it will not be proceeded with at this time. We do not yet have
enough concrete evidence that its introduction would be effective in
reducing harms associated with problem drinking—this is a
crucial point—without penalising people who drink responsibly.
We will tackle the most egregious examples of cheap alcohol by banning
sales of alcohol below the level of alcohol duty plus value-added tax.
That will come into effect in England and Wales no later than the
spring of 2014, and will stop the worst instances of deep discounting
that result in alcohol being sold cheaply and harmfully. It will no
longer be legal to sell a can of ordinary-strength lager for less than
about 40p.</hs_Para>

decided not to ban multi-buy promotions. There is still a lack of
convincing evidence that it would have a significant effect in reducing
consumption. It would not be reasonable for us to introduce a ban,
especially at a time when responsible families are trying hard to
balance their household budgets. We will, however, make current
mandatory licensing conditions more effective. We will enable tougher
action to be taken to deal with irresponsible promotions in pubs and
clubs, and will promote responsible drinking by raising customer
awareness of the availability of small servings.</hs_Para>

not to proceed with the introduction of minimum unit pricing at this
stage gives the alcohol industry an opportunity to demonstrate what
more it can do to reduce the harms associated with problem drinking.
Our challenge to the industry is to increase its efforts, building on
what has already been achieved 
<?notus-xml column=1114?>through the public health responsibility deal. That includes improving
education to promote safer drinking, reducing the availability of the
high-strength products that cause the most harm for problem drinkers,
and responsible marketing and product
placement.</hs_Para>

intend to facilitate local action. Targeted action by pubs and clubs
themselves has proved hugely effective in curbing irresponsible
drinking. Best Bar None, National Pubwatch, Purple Flag and community
alcohol partnerships are all good examples of what can be achieved when
industry works in partnership with local areas. We will build on this
by identifying a number of high-harm local alcohol action areas and
work with them to strengthen local partnerships, improve enforcement
and increase good practice of what works locally, including how areas
can make the most of available health data as part of local decision
making.</hs_Para>

area is promoting growth, by freeing up responsible business and
community groups from unnecessary red tape, while maintaining the
integrity of the licensing system. We will make it quicker and easier
for community groups and those wanting to sell small amounts of alcohol
as part of a wider service to do so via the community and ancillary
seller’s notice. We will increase the annual limit for the
number of temporary event notices that can apply to a particular
premises from 12 to 15, and free up businesses that provide late-night
refreshment by removing the requirement to have a licence where there
is no need for one. We will abolish the requirement to renew personal
licences every 10 years. We also plan to consult on whether to abolish
personal licences altogether.</hs_Para>

together, the Government’s response to the alcohol strategy
consultation represents a proportionate approach to tackling the worst
excesses of alcohol consumption without penalising law-abiding people
or responsible businesses. That is the right balance, and I commend
this statement to the House.</hs_Para>

thanking the Minister for giving me advance sight of his statement? He
told us that the Government’s policy on alcohol is on track, and
I wondered whether that was why I was sent his statement with the track
changes still in place. After several months of speculation, we finally
have confirmation to Parliament that the Government have performed a
U-turn on their flagship policy, abandoning their intention to bring in
minimum unit pricing and a ban on multi-buy deals. However, the

minimum unit pricing the first major policy announcement in the House

deputy to announce the U-turn. The Government may pretend this is not a
U-turn, but the evidence is overwhelming. The consultation was never
about whether or not to introduce minimum alcohol pricing; it was about
what level that should be at, and the Government chose 45p to consult

has been calling for a complete package of measures to tackle alcohol
problems, including dealing with licensing, education in schools and
giving public health a bigger role. Labour has said all along that
several issues with minimum alcohol pricing had to be addressed before
implementation. We argued that it could result in a windfall to
supermarkets, and we were concerned that it may not be compatible with
EU law and also that it was not the magic bullet the Government were
claiming. But we also clearly offered to work with the Government to
overcome those obstacles. They chose to ignore all those concerns and
pressed ahead with their flagship policy on minimum unit pricing. So,
of course, Lynton Crosby has now ordered a U-turn, to get the barnacles
off the boat, and minimum pricing, along with most of the rest of the
alcohol strategy and other important public health measures, has been
scrapped. MPs have been left to read about it in the press over the
weekend, while Cabinet members compete to improve their standing in the
Tory party by briefing the press of their
opposition.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071772000301" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0001.htm#13071772000301">Instead,
we now hear that the Government want to introduce a ban on the sale of
alcohol “below cost”. That policy was first announced in
a written ministerial statement in January 2011, so we have taken two
and a half years to return to exactly where we started. The Minister
claims that that proposal will ban cheap supermarket sales, but
research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies has found that such a ban
would raise the price of less than 1% of the alcohol sold in the
off-trade, with most of that sold in discount stores, not
supermarkets.</hs_Para>

Government put minimum unit pricing at the heart of their approach and
have now abandoned it, and many other policies are just not working.
The late-night levy has not worked. Will the Minister confirm that no
local authority has actually introduced a late-night levy and that the
estimates on how much additional revenue it would raise for
cash-strapped police forces will not materialise? Nothing has been done
on education in our schools or on advertising. The alcohol strategy was
meant to be about changing the culture of excessive consumption, but
the level of binge drinking among 15 to 16-year-olds in the
UK compares poorly with that in many other European countries. Mentor,
the drug and alcohol charity, says that 60% of schools fail to teach
drug and alcohol education more than once a year. And why is there no
mention here of the role for health and wellbeing boards, set up by
this Government, and why is public health not a licensing condition? We
are also still waiting for the Government to make up their mind on full
cost recovery for licence applications for local authorities, which are
struggling with reducing budgets and having to take enforcement
action.</hs_Para>

measures in the statement on personal licences and temporary events, it
seems to envisage that economic growth in this country will now be
powered by the late-night drinking economy—is this the
Bullingdon plan for growth? After attacking the Licensing Act 2003, it
is curious that Ministers now want more late-night drinking. Do I
detect traces of lobbying on the Minister’s breath? After a
two-year Whitehall farce over the Government’s alcohol strategy
we have ended up exactly where we started. On minimum alcohol pricing,
the Prime Minister, like the Grand Old Duke of York, has marched us up

overwhelming response in favour of minimum unit pricing. However, we
consulted openly and I can tell the House that 34% of respondents

level and would significantly reduce harm, but 56%—substantially
more—disagreed with that proposition. So we consulted on it and
we heard what people had to say. We are, of course, mindful, in a way
that some Opposition Members may not be, that introducing a minimum
unit price has significant impacts on people with low incomes. It does
not affect the Labour elite in north London, but it does affect some of

legislate—not “may” legislate—for a minimum
price, which was in line with the recommendation made by successive
Home Affairs Committees over seven or eight years. The hon.
Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Tracey Crouch) cited a number of
figures, and the £21 billion cost of alcohol-related crime that
the Minister highlighted would fund the police service for two years.
Will he tell the House how much time he will give the alcohol industry
to drink at the last-chance saloon before he comes back with a firm
proposal to initiate a minimum price for
alcohol?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071772000315" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0001.htm#13071772000315"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Jeremy Browne" PimsId="4753" UID="13071772001646" xid="897" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0001.htm#13071772001646">Mr

Gentleman’s core premise. In response to the consultation, 34%
of people favoured a 45p minimum unit price, but 56% disagreed with
that proposal. The most commonly expressed concern was that such a
policy would have an unfair impact on responsible or moderate drinkers.
It is reasonable to make the point that a person who can afford to
drink a bottle of Chablis every evening would not be affected by the
right hon. Gentleman’s approach, yet a person without the means
to buy Chablis, and who therefore had to drink a cheaper bottle of
white wine every evening, would be affected. There are several
reasonable considerations that we must bear in mind about the social
impact of introducing minimum unit pricing.</hs_Para>

People were asked whether they agreed with a minimum unit price of 45p.
The majority said that they did not and only about a third said that
they did, but we do not know whether the majority disagreed because
they thought it should be twice as high or half as high; they just
disagreed with the figure they were given. I think that it is important
to look at the evidence from the legal developments in Scotland, if it
is forthcoming in time, and from Canada to see how the policy works in
practice. There are some other points that are worth bearing in mind,
which I have tried to touch on this afternoon, about getting the

criticism being directed at me is based on the premise that alcohol
consumption and violent crime are going up, but actually both are going
down. The one note of caution I would mention to him is that that is
overall alcohol consumption across the population. The Government do
not deny that there are problems with people drinking excessively or

a matter for the Department of Health than the Home Office. With regard
to licensing regulations, we have brought in quite a lot of
restrictions. For example, it will no longer be possible to find the
kinds of offers where a flat-rate fee is paid to enter a bar and one
can then get unlimited free drinks, or where women are served free
drinks but men are not. Such promotions, which we believe were

conclusions. I will make three very brief points. First, I think that
the measure will make a difference—I am not exaggerating its
scale—by introducing VAT plus duty as the bottom threshold.
Secondly, many supermarkets are taking voluntary action following the
types of representations I have been talking about. Asda, for example,
has removed alcohol promotions from the reception areas of its
supermarkets, which some people thought were inappropriate. Thirdly,
the Government reduced beer duty in the most recent statement from the

the House first, so could you please offer some guidance on the
appropriateness of the response and, given that the former Secretary of
State for Wales, the right hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs

been made to me by the Minister to correct the record. Secondly, the
hon. Gentleman is in pursuit of salvation on this matter, but I think I
might fairly make the point that he has found his own. He asks what
mechanism is available to him to, in a sense, put the record straight,
and the answer is that his ingenuity and indefatigability have enabled
him to do precisely that through this point of order. It may well be
that it would be more to his taste for the Minister to come to the
House, but Ministers are responsible for their own words and decisions
on whether to provide a correction. Some people might feel—I
leave it to colleagues to judge—that the hon. Gentleman has now
substantially achieved his objective of clarification. Perhaps we can
leave it there for
today.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-17?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_17_PT_1/E196DFC31DF81621D42E011E5D144CEF8406B1CF" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="17 July 2013">Wednesday

registration was not mentioned. Indeed, surveys show that 20 times more
people are satisfied with how we register to vote than are
dissatisfied. What is more, there is little incentive to register
fraudulently because when councils look at the electoral register, it
might lead to a higher council tax
bill.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071772000406" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0002.htm#13071772000406">Instead
of reducing the electoral register to tackle a fraud that does not take
place, we should enhance it to fight bigger crimes. The problem with
our electoral register is not that too many people are on it, but that
3.5 million people are not. There is a lot that we could do about that.

would go even further. Registering should be stage one in the process
of interacting with Government. At a stroke, that would reinstate
millions of people who are missing from the register. The vast majority
of the missing people are eligible for benefits, tax credits, pensions
and so on, and many are already receiving them. Bringing those people
on to the register would ensure that even more people engaged in the
democratic process. The Bill is about living in a
something-for-something society—public services in return for
civic duty; the rewards of living in a democracy in return for signing
up to democracy. Registering to vote is about engagement. It is a
recognition that a person is not on the margins, but a full participant
in society. It is our social

somehow operating a private interest, that is a preposterous argument.
Ministers work for the Crown on behalf of the public, because we live
in a democratic society. For anybody to suggest that Ministers or a

preposterous argument. I hope that when she reflects, she understands

me illustrate the problem as I see it. Were an MP to find themselves on
the board of, or be a consultant to, a tobacco company—to take
an example at random—they would be bound by a fiduciary duty to
pursue the financial interests of that tobacco company. Imagine
proposed legislation to improve public health, which would be damaging
to the interests of the tobacco industry, being introduced in the House
of Commons. The perception of a conflict of interest would arise in the
public’s mind. An explanation would have to be sought on the way
an MP chose to vote, particularly if the remuneration
received—as is the case for some hon. Members—is two or
three times greater than the remuneration they receive as an MP. The

the Member for Warrington North (Helen Jones) said, when hon. Members

my argument and might decide to join us in the Division Lobby. I hope
others do, too, because, on this question of fiduciary duty, if an MP
is remunerated, sometimes very substantially, it will create the
perception that they might be tempted to calculate the impact of a
particular proposal on that income before deciding how to vote. I do
not suggest that any MP has ever done such a thing, but in the public
mind, that is a widespread view. If we cannot agree this afternoon,

perception will continue that politics works for a tiny closed circle
of people at the top of our

rules yet find it increasingly hard to get by, and that brings me to
the kernel of my argument. Millions of people play by the rules, but
feel that they are getting a really rough deal, while also believing
that there is a different set of rules for others, particularly those
at the top. We politicians must take account of that public mood. It is

profession to continue—doctors, farmers, lawyers and,
presumably, architects. There are all sorts of partnerships and a sole
trader or partner would be able to continue to work in their interests,
but a director of a company would apparently not be able to do so. I
presume that he would exclude paid directors of companies that are
limited by guarantee, which are often not-for-profit organisations. I

dismiss the issue of earnings, because clearly Opposition Members are
very happy for people to earn a great deal of money if necessary, as

question of time, since no argument is being presented that Members are
incapable of undertaking other activities and that they would not have
sufficient time to look after their constituents. Clearly, they do and,
if anything, all the evidence suggests that Members are devoting more
time to their responsibilities in this House and using the advances in
communications technology and elsewhere to provide improving services.

we do that.</hs_Para>

Member of Parliament. Before I was elected as MP for
Greenwich in 1992, I ran a small business
offering housing consultancy services—so the Conservative
Member, the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr
Stuart), who believes Opposition Members do not have business
experience is not correct—and that reflected my own career in
housing over the previous 20 years. I sold that business when I was
elected to the House, but remained as a consultant to the organisation
that bought the business until I became a Minister in 1997. From 1997
to 2005 I served as a Minister in the Department that is now known as
the Department for Communities and Local Government—it would
take up too much of my five minutes to list its various names when I
was a Minister there. That was the hardest-working second job I had by
a long way during my time here.</hs_Para>

some without remuneration— from organisations operating in
fields in which I had previous professional experience or relevant

is certainly right that we should be debating this issue as there is
genuine public concern that MPs should act in the public interest, and
should not abuse their position by undertaking inappropriate activity
on behalf of lobbyists or organisations seeking improperly to secure an
advantage. I stress the word “improperly” because it is
also right that organisations, whether commercial or not, which want to
influence Parliament should be able to speak freely with MPs and have
relationships with supporters in this House. I myself, in the voluntary
sector before I was elected in 1992, had frequent contacts with MPs and

states that, as part of a regulatory framework for MPs’ second
jobs, following the next general election no MP
should be permitted to hold “paid directorships or

What is the difference between a paid directorship or consultancy and a
contract to write a book or an article, or a payment for practising as
a lawyer or a doctor, or a fee for providing a piece of expert advice?
Is it the payment that is the problem? If so, the motion is far too
narrow as it would leave open 
<?notus-xml column=1145?>all kinds of opportunities for MPs to receive payment for remunerated
activities other than those described as directorships or
consultancies. If the problem is not the payment but is instead the
relationship implied by the directorship or consultancy, why should a
paid directorship of an organisation with a remit that clearly involves
public interest objectives, such as the construction of social and
affordable housing, be banned whereas a remunerated relationship other
than a directorship or consultancy with a profit-making organisation

on to the question about what I bring to the Chamber as a
doctor, I shall give one example, which is very relevant today. The CQC
issued a report today on the Heatherwood and Wexham Park Hospitals NHS
Foundation Trust, a trust that rather bizarrely secured foundation
trust status in 2007. The trust is financially unviable and has
significant clinical problems, according to the report. I highlighted
this at the Department of Health shortly after arrival. My continuing
work at the time was in Slough. I was working as a GP and I knew there
was a problem. I contacted Monitor, I contacted the CQC, I spoke on the
telephone to that fantastic individual, Cynthia Bower, and pointed out
to her that there was a problem. I am slightly surprised that it has
taken three years for the CQC to conclude that there is a problem, but
the fact that I was still working in the area gave me evidence and
first-hand experience of what was going on, and my constituents
recognise
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071772000542" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0002.htm#13071772000542">The
other example that I can give the House is of the hospital that I would
like to see built in the Thames valley. That is based on the experience
of working throughout the constituency. In the register of
interests, I have various entries because I do
not work in just one practice. I work all over the place—whoever
will take me—and from that experience I have a
regional perspective on the health economy in the
Thames Valley, a perspective that is almost unique,
particularly if one adds to it the fact that I am also a Member of
Parliament in the Thames valley. The two together make me a better
Member of Parliament for the Bracknell constituency. So although I
recognise what the shadow Front-Bench team is trying to do, this is the
wrong way to go about it. I ask the Front-Bench team to reflect on
that.</hs_Para>

my hon. Friend the Member for Hemsworth pointed out, perception is key
in this agenda. We know that Parliament and MPs are held in very low

the trust of the electorate. I say that because I have spoken to many
constituents—people have also written to me—who have
said, for example, that the top-down reorganisation of the national
health service was done only because many senior Conservative MPs stood
to benefit financially from the 49% privatisation. Surely none of us,
on either side of the Chamber, can allow that sort of perception to
persist among the wider electorate. People need to have trust in their
Members of Parliament. The motion would go a long way towards

of the motion is absolutely dreadful, in that it would pick up one of
my businesses but not the other. Why is that? What is the sense in
picking up one structure of ownership and not another? The Opposition
are also suggesting that we should not take the earned money, but they
have no problem with those Members who are shareholders taking unearned
income. Traditionally, Labour Members thought that earned income was
more acceptable than unearned income, but they now seem to be arguing
that we should have our unearned income. That is easy enough for me to
structure, as I am in control of my corporate structures, but it is
difficult for other people in other circumstances. The whole thing is
frankly absurd. It drives us on again to what I think the hon. Member

not think we should have a political class. An Opposition Member has
called for a political class—he said those words, and I see nods
around the Chamber—but I think that is very dangerous. It is
dangerous to have a situation where external bodies beyond the
Government, who do control votes in Parliament, control people in
Parliament. Apart from being extremely badly drafted, the motion drives
things further towards a political class. Thus people who have not had
real jobs go through the special adviser process and all that sort of
thing, ending up not being in the real world. That moves against the
concept of people being able to be Members of Parliament for a short
period of time, and what do we gain from it?

the motion is wide enough. The motion says, “You’re a
full-time MP and you’re nothing else.” Whether or not
someone votes 30% of the time or 100% of the time, they should not be
paid any more than the basic salary of an MP. That is what the people
of this country 
<?notus-xml column=1153?>want us to be: full-time Members of Parliament.. They are sitting out
there asking, “Why on earth do these people need to do more than
they are doing already? Why should they be so different from
us?” For at least the past five years, they have been asking,
“Are these people on the same planet as us? Do they go to the
same shops? Do they live in the same world?” They think that the
answer to those questions is no, and unless we can convince them that
we understand how they feel, they will not be interested in democracy.
That is a long-term worry for the House. If we continue to be so unlike
those people, they will become less and less likely to get off their
backsides and vote for any of us, let alone those we are discussing
today.</hs_Para>

it is entirely reasonable for Members who wish to go off and do other
work to do so under certain circumstances, but let us get away from the
idea that MPs, who get a handsome salary as far as most of our
constituents are concerned, should greedily look for other earnings. Of
course it is an advantage also to work as a journalist, a writer or
whatever else, but when it comes to the crunch and there is a crisis,
when Members know that they should be here writing to Ministers,
demanding answers, making a case or meeting people, if someone comes
along and says they’ll pay them ten grand to write an article in
the next 24 hours, what choice will they make? If there is no money
involved, there is no real choice, as we know where our loyalties lie.

MPs should have a look at the Register of Members’ Financial
Interests: a number of Members earn hundreds of thousands of pounds.
This issue is about buying access. MPs should look at themselves in the
mirror and ask whether they are really so clever that companies, which
are engaged in business MPs have no experience in, really want them to
join their boards for their personal knowledge and insight. The reality
is that companies want privileged access to MPs and are prepared to pay
for it.</hs_Para>

the motion is either too narrow or too wide. They could have tabled an

when this place resembled more a gentlemen’s club than a
people’s Parliament, being an MP was seen as a second job.
However, it is impossible to deny that things have moved on and that,
rightly, the public’s expectations have changed. Of course it is
good for Members to keep connected to the world beyond Westminster and
to have outside interests, a point made by my right hon. Friend the
Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr Raynsford) and the hon. Member
for South Swindon (Mr Buckland). It is important that we remain
connected with the outside world, but I have to say this, particularly
to Government Members: being in touch does not depend on a
Member’s ability to earn unlimited and large amounts of money
from the private sector. That is a very interesting definition of being
in touch. It is perfectly possible to have “outside
interests”, in the true sense of the words, without having
unlimited outside financial
interests.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071772000662" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0003.htm#13071772000662">A
legitimate question was asked about MPs not being able to retain their
skills—in medicine, law or engineering, for example—and
whether that would leave the House worse off. We have been clear that
MPs would still be able to do a certain amount of work. They would be
able to keep up their expertise by, for example, working as a GP like
the hon. Member for Bracknell (Dr Lee), or as lawyers or engineers.
They could still do that, but a limit would be placed on how much they
could earn. As hon. Members have pointed out, such limits have been
applied successfully in many countries. Clearly, the current rules are
not fit for purpose in the 21st century. This is about changing
politics to make it more open, transparent and trusted. My right hon.
Friend the Member for Doncaster North (Edward Miliband) said last
week:</hs_Para>

vast majority of all MPs have performed their duties properly within
the rules. And raising this issue casts no doubt upon that. But we
should question the rules. The question of MPs second outside jobs has
been discussed but not properly addressed for a generation. The British
people expect their MPs to be representing them and the country not
anyone
else.”</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13071772000663" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0003.htm#13071772000663">This
has been an important debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Derby North
(Chris Williamson) hit the nail on the head when he talked about public
perception and our absolute duty to repair public trust in the politic
process, and rightly referred to the much stronger restrictions on
MPs’ outside earnings elsewhere in the world. We can look at
those systems. My hon. Friend the Member for Blaydon (Mr Anderson) gave

<?notus-xml column=1164?>the House a reality check, pointing out that MPs were paid three times
the average wage. He talked about the miners he met at the weekend at
Maltby pit and spoke with passion and principle about people out there
for whom life was very tough and who might be watching this debate,
wondering, “What planet are some of those people
on?”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071772000664" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0003.htm#13071772000664">My
hon. Friend the Member for Newport West (Paul Flynn) reinforced that
point by talking about the bubble we sometimes live in here. He said
that the public would be rightly baffled by some of today’s
contributions. My hon. Friend the Member for North West Durham (Pat
Glass) made an interesting proposal: since the Government are keen on
capping benefits, why not a cap on outside earnings for MPs? That is
worth considering. My hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Ian Lucas)
also made a powerful case for reform.</hs_Para>

right hon. and hon. Members on the Government Benches defending the
status quo. The Leader of the House was his usual complacent self,
taking a “nothing to see here, move along” approach in
his opening remarks. Interestingly, the hon. Member for Birmingham,
Yardley (John Hemming) talked about simply popping off to London Bridge
for a few hours to do a bit of work and bemoaned the creation of a
political class, which was exactly the same argument raised in 1911
when it was decided to pay MPs in the first place.</hs_Para>

Home Department, the hon. Member for Taunton Deane (Mr
Browne), who probably has one eye on the reshuffle and that Cabinet
post that never seems to come, will understand that the former Prime
Minister does not receive a single penny in outside earnings. I am
happy to help him on that important fact. Outside interests contribute
not to the richness of debate in the House, but to the richness of
individual Members; and they add value not to our deliberations, but to

at the scale of the problem. Apparently, 18 Governments Members have 53
extra jobs between them. I sympathise with the Whips; I do not know how

there will be a clear choice at the next general election between the
Labour party, which wants big reforms, our politics opened up, and big
money taken out of politics—including new rules and
new limits on second jobs—and those in the Government, who
say they want more of the same, the status quo, no change
and business as usual. We can either look forward, as the Labour party
will do, to a new Parliament and a new settlement where public, not
private, interest comes first, or look to the Conservatives and the
Liberal Democrats, for whom second jobs have because second nature and
where the public invariably come second too.</hs_Para>

questioned the rationale behind the Labour motion, and highlighted
contradictions in it. I agree with him entirely. My hon. Friend the
Member for Bracknell (Dr Lee) highlighted the value of his ongoing
involvement in the NHS and the direct benefit that his constituents
derive from that. The hon. Member for Derby North (Chris Williamson)

hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Yardley (John Hemming)
highlighted the nonsense of opposing directorships and consultancies,

(Mr Anderson) seemed to suggest that hon. Members having second jobs
was depriving young people in his constituency of jobs, which I think
was a fallacious argument. I commend him, however, for spotting the
flaw in Labour’s motion, because it does not do what he wants.
He wanted all second jobs to be addressed, but that is not what the

hon. Friend the Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale (David Morris)

extra money or having a conflict of interest, because it is not clear.

he is committed to regulating second jobs. Again, he did not provide
any clarity on which second jobs. Why are some acceptable but others

it is not our business to table amendments to a deeply flawed motion.

conclusion, the House will have noticed the contrast in approaches. It
could not be clearer. Instead of leading a serious debate on a concrete
proposal, the Opposition have gone for grandstanding and spreading
slurry indiscriminately, referring to the perception of a problem while
denying that there is a problem. They are calling for regulation of
second jobs, but from today’s evidence I would say that we need
better regulation of the day job to stop Opposition spokesmen requiring
the House to waste its time considering feeble and confused motions
such as this one. The Government, on the other hand, are committed to
promoting transparency, both in Members’ relations with the

House is concerned about the Government’s approach to managing
risk in the NHS; notes that the Government is still to respond fully to
the Francis Report, despite the Prime Minister promising on 6 February
2013, <I>Official Report</I>, column 281, a detailed response by the
end of March 2013; believes that the Government is in danger of
ignoring the lessons of recent failures by cutting thousands of nursing
staff; is concerned at recent reports revealing pressure to roll out
the NHS 111 telephone service despite serious concerns about it not
being safe to do so; is further concerned at recent reports that plans
are not in place to avert an Accident and Emergency crisis next winter;
recognises that the 14 Trusts investigated by Sir Bruce Keogh have seen
increasing problems since May 2010; further believes that the
Government’s failure to implement the key recommendations of the
Francis Report, combined with the disruption of the recent NHS
reorganisation, risks making it more likely that failures of care will
happen in future; further notes the Government’s recent
commitment to openness and transparency in the NHS; therefore calls on
the Government to publish the NHS transition risk register as ordered
by the Information Commissioner and Information Rights Tribunal; and
further calls on the Government to bring forward urgent implementation
of key Francis recommendations to improve patient safety, including a
duty of candour, benchmarks on safe staffing and the regulation of
healthcare
assistants.</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13071772001225" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0003.htm#13071772001225">I
have called this debate today to try to map a way forward for an NHS
which, right now, is feeling battered, bruised and under attack. It has
just come through the worst crisis in accident and emergency for more
than a decade and it is only months away from another winter which, if
nothing changes, will most likely be just as bad or possibly worse for
patients. I spend considerable time on the NHS front line shadowing
staff, so I pick up what they say. They feel exhausted, unsupported and
have a profound sense of uncertainty about where the NHS is heading.
Today it is in a fragile condition. The way the Government conduct
themselves in the coming months and the decisions they make will have a
major bearing on their ability to manage the risks that the NHS is
facing. For the sake of patients everywhere, they must urgently raise
the morale of NHS staff and restore some trust. Later I will make some
suggestions on how that can be done.</hs_Para>

report was a verdict not on the past, but on what is happening now.
Standards have fallen, not only in the 14 trusts considered in the
Keogh review, but across the NHS. Throughout the first six months of
this year, hospitals were sailing dangerously close to the wind,
operating way beyond safe bed occupancy levels, with general chaos in
accident and emergency. How did we get here? To hear Ministers now, it
is as though the last three years have not happened—it is all
about the last Government. However, one of the main reasons why the NHS
is struggling is the destabilising effect of a reorganisation that
nobody wanted and nobody voted for. It is exactly three years since the
bombshell of the “Liberating the NHS” White Paper landed
on an unsuspecting NHS.</hs_Para>

One of the things that shocked me most when I received the Francis
report, which I commissioned under the previous Government, was the
revelation that on receiving foundation trust status, the board of Mid
Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust had begun to hold its meetings in
private, rather than in public. It had taken the freedoms, yet decided
to become more secretive. That was fundamentally unacceptable, and I
made that point loud and clear to the NHS when I received that report.
I do not think that there is any difference between us on this. I
believe in openness and transparency too. Ours was the Government who
brought in the Freedom of Information Act and independent regulation
for the NHS. On that matter, we can make common
cause.</hs_Para>

I think it important also to take account of what Keogh said about

between them and Mid Staffordshire. What they have in common is
geographic isolation. Hospitals serving smaller market towns are not
supported by the same clinical networks as others, and may find it more
difficult to attract qualified staff. I agree with the hon. Gentleman

been a marked change in the coalition Government’s approach on
the national health service. It started with the absurd argument that
the problems in accident and emergency departments were the result of
the 2004 GP contract. Is it not more likely that what is happening is
that Mr Lynton Crosby is telling Government Members to squeeze the lead
that Labour has had over the Conservative party for many decades on the

Opposition is what they are trying to do? They ought to be ashamed of

before, the NHS is fragile right now because of his reorganisation, and
it cannot keep taking these knocks on a daily basis. The blame game is
destructive and polarising, and it has to end. He is in real danger of
losing any remaining good will in the NHS work force, and none of us
and, more importantly, none of our constituents can afford to see those
crucial staff become fed up, lose heart and walk away. Government

the other, although Government Members seem to think they can attack
the health unions for somehow being the enemy of patients. Ordinary
people do not see it that way. They know that the staff are there for
them day in, day out. We support the staff to help the patients. If
staff are rewarded properly and have good working conditions, they will

but we do not hear much credit coming in this direction, do we?
Government Members are happy to take the credit and then they try to
cast off all the blame for everything else. My point is that criticism
must be fair and made with care. We all 
<?notus-xml column=1179?>have a duty to point out the failings of the NHS, in our own
constituencies and nationally, and that is what I did when I did the
Secretary of State’s job. However, we have to do that

them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071772001284" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0003.htm#13071772001284">Hospitals
are not the architects of all the problems we read about. For example,
they are all struggling with the fallout of severe cuts to social care
budgets, the appalling cost of which I recently revealed: a
66% increase over two years in the number of over-90s coming
into A and E via blue-light ambulance. In human terms, more than
100,000 very frail and frightened people have been speeding through the
streets of our communities in the back of ambulances. Hospitals have to
absorb that extra pressure and also struggle with longer delays in
getting people back home. We are in real danger of asking too much of
our hospitals by allowing them to be the last resort for people who
would be better supported elsewhere. Without a greater understanding of
that situation in the current debate, and if the trend towards the
vilification of NHS managers continues, who will take on the job of
running our acute trusts? Good people will walk away and no one will
want to do the job. Again, the NHS simply cannot afford
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071772001285" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0003.htm#13071772001285">This
crude blame game is an election strategy with two components: run down
the NHS; and pin all the failings on the previous Government. The NHS
cannot take 20 months of that until May 2015. It has been destabilised

push it over the
edge.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071772001286" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0003.htm#13071772001286">The
Secretary of State needs to change course and find a way of bringing
people back together, so the purpose of the debate is to put forward
two constructive proposals to manage risk in the NHS—one for
now, the other for the long term. First, I turn to the immediate
proposal. It is clear that the best way to draw a line under recent
events and unify people would be for the House to embrace today the
analysis and main recommendations of the Francis report. The motion
highlights the three most significant recommendations: benchmarks on
safe staffing; a duty of candour on individual NHS staff; and the
regulation of health care assistants. If all parties endorsed those
proposals, it would send staff a message of support and recognition of
the pressure that they are under, while the patients who have suffered
poor care would receive the positive message that the parties are
working together to prevent that from happening to
others.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071772001287" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0003.htm#13071772001287">Given
the tragic events that lie behind them, public inquiries should, when
possible, produce consensus. It is extraordinary that, having
commissioned a three-year public inquiry, the Government have slowly
been distancing themselves from the Francis report’s analysis
and conclusions ever since its publication. It is hard not to conclude
that the report did not deliver what the Government wanted and that
they have spent the past five months rewriting it. They have come up
with their own recommendations on chief inspectors for hospitals,
general practice and social care, yet dragged their feet on the actual
recommendations. They have substituted the verdict of Francis on
Ministers in the previous Government with that of the kangaroo court of
Lynton Crosby. We do not oppose chief inspectors, but if the Government
believe that ever-tougher central regulation 
<?notus-xml column=1180?>will bring about the culture change locally that everyone agrees is
necessary, they are mistaken. We need change that will have an

Friend has probably been in the Chamber on most of the occasions when I
have raised the question of safe staffing with the Secretary of State.
It was cited in the Francis and Keogh reviews, and the Care Quality
Commission tells us that one in 10 hospitals has unsafe staffing
levels. The Secretary of State dances around the issue again and again,
but he will not take action. Yesterday, I asked him to introduce
transparency to the process so that hospitals do not have wards with
ratios of two staff to 29 patients, but he refused to answer my
question. Does my right hon. Friend agree that if hospitals were
transparent about their ratios, that would be the way forward, because
we would know where we
were?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071772001289" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0003.htm#13071772001289"><B><Member ContinuationText="Andy Burnham" PimsId="2376" UID="13071772002430" xid="81" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0003.htm#13071772002430">Andy

rather
avoid.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071772001290" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0003.htm#13071772001290">Staffing

immediately ordered an in-depth review of all hospitals in England,
which led to warnings on five of the trusts on the Keogh list. Those
warnings were inherited by the hon. Gentleman’s Government, but
Ministers allowed those trusts to carry on cutting staff, and the same

is long overdue. If the Secretary of State took these three sensible
measures, he would provide support to staff and reassurance to the

challenge the NHS faces. That brings me to my final point on the
longer-term solution. I have thought long and hard about what happened
at Stafford hospital and why we hear recurrent echoes of the same
elsewhere in the NHS, with older people lost on acute hospital wards,
disorientated and dehydrated. I believe that the problem goes far
deeper than any regulatory solution. Governments of all colours have
underinvested in social care over many years, and in the end we get
what we pay for: a malnourished, minimum wage system that dishes out
care in 15-minute slots, which is barely time to make a cup of tea, let

how many hours they will be working, how can we expect them to pass on
a sense of security to those they care for? We will not get the care

However, here is my challenge to the Minister of State, who has been
roused by that statement: he cannot speak the language of integration
while legislating for fragmentation and competition. We are hearing
reports from across the country of sensible collaboration between
secondary, primary and social care being blocked by the competition
provisions of the Health and Social Care Act 2012. Torbay, the beacon
of integrated care, fears that any qualified provider may break up its
celebrated model. That has led the Minister to suggest in the <I>Health
Service Journal</I> that his integrated care pilot area might be
offered exemptions from the Act’s competition provisions. Surely
that is the clearest admission from the Government that the Act they
passed is a barrier to the change that the NHS needs. Collaboration or
competition? Integration or fragmentation? In the end, they have to
make a choice; they cannot have it both ways. If the Minister is
serious about this, the last offer I make is that we will work with him
to fast-track repeal of the competition provisions of the Health and
Social Care

their own political ends. If, from here on in, they intend to continue

the decision to hold a public inquiry into Mid Staffs, which the right

the Keogh review, which reported yesterday that 14 hospital trusts have
excess mortality rates. This is the first time the NHS has ever
conducted such a review. We have also published individual surgeon
outcomes—the first country in the world to do so across an

to the substance of the motion, which is about risk for the NHS. Two
big risks face the NHS. They face not only the NHS, but all major
health care systems. The first is financial sustainability and the
second is an ageing population. The litmus test for the success of the
NHS in the next 65 years will be whether it confronts those huge
challenges while looking after people with dignity, compassion and
respect. I believe that there are three pillars on which we must build
to make that possible. The first is a radical transformation of
out-of-hospital care. We know that a consultant is responsible for us
when we are inside hospital, but who is responsible for a vulnerable
older person when they leave hospital? Too often, their care falls
between the cracks, with no one being accountable. The NHS could lead
the world in this, but we have made it impossible for GPs to look after
people proactively because of how the GP contract works. We need to
change that, so that in an integrated, joined-up system of care, there
is always an accountable clinician or named GP and the patient knows
who it is. In the consultation on the changes to the NHS mandate for
next year, therefore, I have asked NHS England to ensure a named
clinician responsible for every vulnerable older person.</hs_Para>

the three pillars we need to reduce risk in the NHS is technology. The
technology revolution has transformed many other sectors, but has
barely touched the NHS. A and E departments cannot access GP notes and
so give medicine without knowing people’s medication history.
Ambulances pick up the frail elderly without knowing whether they are
diabetic or have dementia. This has to change. Technology can also cut
costs. Retail banks have reduced their costs by a third, and we need
those precious savings for the NHS, which is why I have said I want the
NHS to go paperless by 2018 at the latest, with online prescriptions
and booking of GP appointments by 2015. Technology is also a vital key
to delivering integrated care, which is why data sharing will be a key
condition of accessing the £3.8 billion joint health
and social care fund announced by the Chancellor in the spending
review.</hs_Para>

pillar to help the NHS cope with new risks is science. It might
surprise hon. Members that I mention that today, but the UK has a long
track record as a world leader in medical science. We were the first to
unlock the secrets of DNA in 1953; we did the first combined heart,
liver and lung transplant; we invented in vitro fertilisation,
alongside many other advances, and we must play to those strengths.
Science can transform our understanding of disease, and help us deliver
truly personalised care. Our aim is by 2015 to put the UK at the
forefront of the genome revolution worldwide, and I have set up
Genomics England, led by Sir John Chisholm, to deliver that
vision.</hs_Para>

Dobson</B> (Holborn and St Pancras) (Lab):</Member> I do not wish to
get involved in great party turmoil on this matter, but it seems to me
that a characteristic of any health care system is whether it is
entirely devoted to managing risk. When people are ill or injured,
their lives and health are at risk, and it is also possible that any
treatment they may be offered will itself be risky.</hs_Para>

problem faced by doctors, nurses and midwives is that of uncertainty,
and they want to give the right diagnosis. It is statistically true,
for example, that the average GP will be confronted by 1.5 patients who
are suffering from meningitis in a 35-year career, yet we expect them
to make the right diagnosis. It is difficult. If the GP has made the
right diagnosis—I am not necessarily talking just about
meningitis—we expect them to come up with the right treatment,
which involves another judgment and a great deal of uncertainty. Even
if the diagnosis and choice of treatment are right, it may be that the
treatment will, for one reason or another, go wrong.</hs_Para>

within the national health service, most people, most of the time and
in most places, get very good treatment. Over the past 15 or 16 years,
there has been a big reduction in mortality in hospitals, a big
improvement in people’s recovery from treatment for a serious
illness, and we have been catching up with some countries that had a
better record than us. Despite all the criticism, general satisfaction
with the national health service remains high. If people are asked what
they think of the national health service, about 60% say it is pretty
good. If they are asked how the NHS treated them or a member of their
family, the percentage of those who are satisfied is usually in the
high 80s or low 90s. Any political party or political leader would love
that sort of satisfaction rating.</hs_Para>

the achievements of the previous Labour Government was the capital

concerns me most, however. I remember when I first became Secretary of
State for Health being telephoned by a very good friend who was then a
professor in the medical school at Nottingham and said—I shall
have to bowdlerise this—“For Lord’s sake, leave us
alone. Do not reorganise; do not distract people from their usual
jobs.” That is what too many Governments have done, including
this one, but I do not want to go ranting on about it.</hs_Para>

want to talk about is not mentioned very often. It became fashionable
to say that the money must follow the patient and that we did not want
to hand over big lumps of money to hospitals and other parts of the
health service as that did not provide the right incentives. The only
trouble is that as a result NHS transaction costs went up from 4p in
the pound to what is estimated now to be between 12p to 15p in the
pound. That is a lot of money—about £8 billion, £9
billion or £10 billion extra, just because of the new method of
funding. If we want to release funds to help people who are being
treated in the health service and who want to be treated there, to
provide the buildings, equipment and staff, and to encourage the staff,
we must think about the money being squandered on transaction costs.
Unless we do something about that, it will only get worse under the new
system.</hs_Para>

have to ask why this review was not commissioned at the time if there
were, through 81 requests, serious concerns raised. What did people
have to hide? In 2009 the right hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull West

one-off, but unfortunately we know from the Labour “lines to
take”—which are in the inquiry so are in the public
domain—that Labour knew there were 12 hospitals with equal or
even worse mortality rates. That was denied, but, tellingly, that brief
says Labour should try to avoid naming them. That stands in stark
contrast to the approach taken in the Keogh report, which has been
transparent in naming those trusts where there are problems. Unlike
Labour, I do not think being honest about the situation prevents
improvement; actually, I think it helps
improvement.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071793000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0003.htm#13071793000022"><B><Member ContinuationText="Charlie Elphicke" PimsId="5713" UID="13071793001185" xid="1061" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0003.htm#13071793001185">Charlie

If we put institutions first, and if we worry about staff and staff

I referred earlier to figures from the Library, but those figures are

days of a non-elective hospital procedure in England was 4,850 in
2001-02 and 3,684 in 2010-11. That is a significant drop, so I hope the
Secretary of State will correct the record, change his view that there
was a “slight” improvement and confirm that was a
significant improvement, because that is what the evidence from his own
Department says. Why is that important? It is important for a number of
reasons. It is important to see improvements, but we should also bear
in mind that the fall from 2001 took place against a massive
increase—4 million additional admissions—in
the number of people admitted to hospital. It is also important because
people want to see continual improvements and be assured that their
relatives and friends are receiving the best possible
treatment.</hs_Para>

with the difference being paid for by the two primary care trusts. This
Government have got rid of the PCTs, but they have still not put in
place a way of funding the hospital on a long-term basis. The
uncertainty continues, despite debates on the matter in this place and
meetings with Ministers, and we still do not know what is going to
happen. It is an excellent hospital with brand-new facilities, but it
is facing a real 
<?notus-xml column=1197?>challenge. We need the Government to make decisions about hospital
funding, to ensure that it and others can continue; otherwise, many
more hospitals will get into
difficulty.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13071793001171" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0003.htm#13071793001171">6.16

Pugh</B> (Southport) (LD):</Member> This debate is notionally about
managing risk in the NHS, but it is actually about reputational risk
for Secretaries of State. I genuinely feel sorry for all Secretaries of
State, because it is very unlikely that nothing will go wrong on their
watch. It is unlikely that the entire NHS will perform optimally, that
there will be no significant variation in performance and that the NHS
will deliver an absolutely perfect service.</hs_Para>

of State have to get a whole raft of things right. They have to get the
funding, the appointments, the regulation and the legislative framework
right, and when something goes wrong, they have to get the
troubleshooting right as well. They also have to keep a whole raft of
health professionals happy, including pharmacists, dentists, GPs,
nurses, midwives and health visitors, as well as patients from the age
of nought to 90. Surveying that task, I think we have to agree that it
is mission impossible.</hs_Para>

things that will afford a Secretary of State the most protection are,
first, good regulation and inspection, and secondly, the professional
commitment, engagement and dedication of health professionals including
doctors, nurses, ambulance staff and, dare I say, managers—or,
as they are they are sometimes referred to in this place, bureaucrats.
I think we all acknowledge the need for good management in the
NHS.</hs_Para>

appallingly badly served by the regulators. Let us take the Care
Quality Commission—where do I begin? And what about Monitor?
Yesterday, we had the statement on the Keogh report. Before that, we
have had statements on Mid Staffs and Morecambe Bay. Although not many
people have acknowledged it yet, the majority of the hospitals involved
are foundation trusts, and were inspected by Monitor. The majority were
given a positive, green risk rating in 2010. What does that tell us
about foundation trust status and its benefits? What does it tell us
about Monitor, and the CQC, as regulators? Bizarrely, we seem to have
given those bodies, which do not seem to be wholly competent, an
increased role in the health service over the past couple of
years.</hs_Para>

other protection from serious embarrassment that is available to a
Secretary of State is the fact that the NHS survives most things. There
is a huge amount of professional commitment from NHS staff. Ironically,
however, that can be undone by unwise, poor, tick-box, target-chasing
and clinically unjustified regulation. That applies across the NHS and,
I would suggest, across public services as a whole. Regulation and
inspection, if ill-advised, can undermine professional standards, with
disastrous effects for individuals and institutions. Certainly, those
who know anything about Ofsted will know that Ofsted can do that, and I
am sure that the CQC has done it. The Government have also done it
through distorting priorities or simply by inspecting the wrong thing.
The truth is that we need to work more with the grain of professional
judgment, to listen to it more and not assume that it is always a
self-serving producer interest. We can encourage the best and challenge
the worst, without disparaging professional ethics.</hs_Para>

Government have got themselves into a sort of enviable no-lose
situation with regard to the public services. If policies are supported
by professionals, it proves that the Government are right. If on the
other hand policies are opposed by professionals, it proves that the
Government are challenging the provider interest and are right
again—so they can never be proved wrong. My simple
point—it is the only one I really want to make—is that if
Governments were not always so easily persuaded that they were right,
we would get a whole lot less
wrong.</hs_Para>

Phillip Lee</B> (Bracknell) (Con):</Member> The title of the debate,
“Managing risk in the NHS”, is very important.
Indeed—although this may not be a topic for today—we
ought to start thinking about the whole concept of risk and what
patients will accept in terms of risk, especially given that everyone
now has access to information via the internet. Invariably, the first
thing someone puts into Google is the thing they are least likely to be
suffering from as a consequence of the symptoms they are experiencing,
so it is extremely important that risk is discussed much more with the
patient population. As the right hon. Member for Holborn and St Pancras
(Frank Dobson) said, it is extremely difficult to be a GP and to try to
manage the demands being placed on the health service when people are
coming in thinking that their headache is a brain tumour and so
on.</hs_Para>

particularly appropriate that I am speaking in this debate, because
today the Care Quality Commission has published a report on Heatherwood
and Wexham Park Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. I am surprised that the
hon. Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart) has not taken the opportunity
to speak in this debate as a consequence. The report highlights
significant concerns about the trust and the care of patients. None of
the concerns was news to me: I approached the then Health Secretary
about them in June 2010; I spoke to Monitor, whose chief executive told
me, remarkably, that he had no concerns whatsoever and nothing had come
across his radar about the trust; and I also spoke to Cynthia Bower in
September 2010 about them. I say that because Monitor and the CQC were
clearly not fit for purpose and doing their job of finding out what was
wrong with hospitals.</hs_Para>

the current Secretary of State’s desire to have a chief
inspector of hospitals, and I wholeheartedly support him on that
concept. However, I counsel colleagues on both sides of the House that
if we start looking properly at the performance of hospitals, we will,
judging by the list of experiences that the right hon. Member for Cynon
Valley (Ann Clwyd) has just shared with the Chamber, have plenty more
stories to deal with about hospitals, and how they fail or are
failing.</hs_Para>

concentrate primarily on legacy and the genesis of these problems,
which probably blight both parties. A hospital does not suddenly become
a problem in the space of a couple of years; that can occur over a
number of decades. The problem we have in this country is that a large
number of our hospitals are not fit for purpose. There is a legacy of
poor location, not only because the land was often bequeathed, but
because the buildings are often not fit for purpose. That is the
particular problem at Heatherwood, and with its theatres, as was
highlighted in the CQC report.</hs_Para>

a legacy in respect of the district general hospitals in general. They
have had their day and we do not need them any more; we need regional
specialist hub hospitals such as the one I have been proposing for the
Thames valley for the past three to four years. I say 
<?notus-xml column=1201?>that because if we are trying to provide care, it is incredibly
difficult to mitigate risk when the theatre is not fit for purpose or
when the hospital cannot be staffed appropriately. Labour Members have
made much mention of nursing numbers, but the issue is much bigger than
that; it is about the quality of the clinicians. Most clinicians have
to specialise and sub-specialise, and the only way in which we will be
able to provide the very best care in the 21st century is by having
fewer acute hospitals. All the royal colleges share that opinion; I am
not cornering that market. The flip side, however, is that we will have

some in Labour seats and some in marginal seats. If those of us who are
interested in this topic truly want to improve care for all, we really
need to remove party politics from the reconfiguration debate and
engage in a cross-party discussion about where these hospitals should
be. If we did that, if we managed to build some new hospitals—I
suspect that we will have to build quite a few, because, as I said, the
problem with a number of established hospitals is that their locations
are inappropriate, as is certainly the case in my part of the
world—and if we could come to a consensus and some agreement on
this, we would be bequeathing to future generations a hospitals sector

be interesting to compare our mortality rates for various conditions
with those of Germany, Holland and France over the past seven to 10
years to determine whether there has also been a decline in those
countries. It is difficult to claim that it was just the investment of
money that led to reduced mortality rates in this country. I do not
rule out the fact that the investment was a factor, but I suspect that
the decline was due to advances in medicine and technology, and indeed
in the skill base of

we reconfigure, consultants will have a larger throughput of patients.
It is interesting to note that Tameside covers about 175,000
patients—not enough—that Basildon and Thurrock covers
about 300,000 or so, and that Mid Staffs covers about 225,000.
Hospitals should 
<?notus-xml column=1202?>cover a minimum of 500,000 people, if not 750,000, if they are truly to
deliver the best acute and surgical care. The staff, especially the
consultants, will want such a throughput of patients so that they can
maintain and enhance their skills, and thereby improve mortality
statistics. I therefore conclude by begging the Government and the

the medical royal colleges in deciding how hospital inspection
processes should be implemented and about the importance of clinical

thoughtful speech. He called for good management and spoke of the need

often not played their part. That is why we need to ensure that the
regulators continue to come to the table and that the improvements at

problem with mandatory staffing ratios is that they would just provide
another tick box that would not necessarily bear a relation to what
good clinical care looks like. There is a clear difference between
mandatory staffing ratios and appropriate staffing levels, as the
Francis report indicated. We need staffing levels that reflect the
needs of the patients on the ward. Those will vary from ward to ward
and will change on a daily basis according to the needs of different
patients. It is important that we consider the patients who are in
front of the doctors and nurses on the day. It may not be nursing care
that is needed, but care from other members of the multi-disciplinary
team such as physiotherapists and health care assistants. That is why
it is wrong to use mandatory staffing ratios as a measure of good
care.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071793000122" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0004.htm#13071793000122"><B><Member ContinuationText="Barbara Keeley" PimsId="4794" UID="13071793001212" xid="910" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0004.htm#13071793001212">Barbara

Gentleman, other Ministers and the Secretary of State is that there
must be transparency in the numbers. Ratios of 2:29 have been reported
to me, which nobody would be comfortable with. My excellent local
hospital puts information about staffing ratios on the boards in each
ward. Does he not think that we should move rapidly to provide
transparency on this matter? I am asking not for mandated ratios, but
transparency so that patients and their families can see what the ratio
is.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071793000123" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0004.htm#13071793000123"><B><Member ContinuationText="Dr Poulter" PimsId="5522" UID="13071793001213" xid="1024" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0004.htm#13071793001213">Dr
Poulter:</Member></B> The hon. Lady makes a very good point about the
importance of having staffing levels that are appropriate to the needs
of the patients. That is why NHS England is considering toolkits that
will help hospitals to build the right care in the right place and at
the right time for patients and to adapt care so that it is provided by
the appropriate professionals, according to patient
need.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071793000124" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0004.htm#13071793000124">The
debate has rightly focused on transparency and openness. We have not
got that right in the NHS since the Bristol heart inquiry, which took
place under the previous Government. Both the Government and the
Opposition believe that we need to support staff who feel that they
need to speak out and that there needs to 
<?notus-xml column=1208?>be greater transparency and openness. I believe that the steps that the
Government are taking will make a difference. We are introducing a
contractual right for staff to raise concerns and issuing guidance on
good practice in supporting staff to raise concerns. We are
strengthening the NHS constitution and have set up the whistleblowing
hotline to support whistleblowers. We are also amending legislation to
secure protection for all staff through the Public Interest Disclosure
Act 1998. We are doing good work and it is right that we continue to do
all that we can to support staff in raising concerns about patient
care, where that is
appropriate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071793000125" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0004.htm#13071793000125">We
must focus on improving productivity in the NHS so that we can do more
with the resources that we have. As the Secretary of State outlined,
that is about improving the technology in the NHS so that we can spend
more money on care and free up staff time. If we use technology to
better join up health and social care, staff will spend less time on
paperwork and more time with patients, which will improve patient
care.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071793000126" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0004.htm#13071793000126">It
is important to consider the fact that there are higher levels of
morbidity and mortality at weekends and in the evenings. There needs to

that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071793000127" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0004.htm#13071793000127">In

tight constraints on domestic public spending, the MFF agreement
reached, which delivers a reduction of €35 billion on

€908.4 billion, a real-terms reduction of over three
per cent in payment appropriations, represents a good deal for
taxpayers; welcomes the Government’s successful defence of the

in recent years due to the 2005 decision to give away parts of the
abatement, shares the Government’s disappointment at the Council

Flello</B> (Stoke-on-Trent South) (Lab):</Member> On a point of order,
Mr Speaker. The House is probably not aware that the Central Lobby
reception staff, William and Carlos, are due to be subject to a major
change. Central Lobby reception staff, as the first point of contact
for Members and the public, give a positive impression of both Houses
in their fine formal clothing, mirroring that of our excellent
Doorkeepers. They have an extensive knowledge of the Members of both
Houses and the ability to provide an important extra layer of security
to the Palace of Westminster. All that is set to change this
October.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071799000003" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0004.htm#13071799000003">Gone
will be the smart formal wear, to be replaced by what in my opinion, by
comparison, is a sort of glorified school uniform. The staff will be on
rotation, so that valuable knowledge will be lost, and I believe
security will be seriously weakened. May I ask, Mr Speaker, that 
<?notus-xml column=1218?>your Committee meeting in September urgently considers this issue, and
perhaps considers transferring the function of Central Lobby staff to
the Serjeant at Arms Office? In the meantime, may we have a moratorium
on these changes until the end of the
year?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071799000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0004.htm#13071799000004"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Speaker" InTheChair="True" PimsId="3965" UID="13071799000364" xid="43" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0004.htm#13071799000364">Mr
Speaker:</Member></B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his point
of order. I make two points in response. First, security matters should
not be discussed on the Floor of the House, and the hon. Gentleman will
not expect me to do so. Secondly, with reference to the changes that he
describes, it is of course open to the hon. Gentleman and others to
discuss these matters with the Serjeant at Arms if he so wishes. If
there is a feeling among Members that they would wish this matter to
come before the House of Commons Commission, I cannot off the top of my
head see any reason why that should not be possible. I think I would
want to consider the matter further, but my instinctive reaction to the
hon. Gentleman is what I have just set out. I hope that that is helpful
to him and to others interested in the
matter.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071799000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0004.htm#13071799000005"><Member ContinuationText="Sir Gerald Howarth" PimsId="1032" UID="13071799000365" xid="291" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0004.htm#13071799000365"><B>Sir
Gerald Howarth</B> (Aldershot) (Con):</Member> Further to that point of
order, Mr Speaker. I was not aware of that proposal until I heard about
it a moment ago from the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent South (Robert
Flello). I am bound to say that what he said shocks me. I hear what you
have said, Mr Speaker, and I would like to make it known that I, with a
few years’ experience in this House, strongly endorse everything
the hon. Gentleman said.</hs_Para>

Speaker:</Member></B> On the strength of what the hon. Gentleman has
just said, it looks to me as though he is potentially joining forces
with the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent South (Robert Flello) and could
be part of a delegation. It is always a pleasure to hear from both hon.
Members—on this occasion and, it would appear, in the autumn. I
hope that is helpful.</hs_Para>

are seeking to catch the Chair’s eye. I therefore propose that
there should be a six-minute limit on Back-Bench contributions. Such a
limit would of course have to be reviewed in the light of Front-Bench
contributions. I feel confident, therefore, that the Minister and
shadow Minister will wish considerately to tailor their contributions
to facilitate the participation of their
colleagues.</hs_Para>

accrue from the mid-2020s, but this is not about back-filling budgets
in the next Parliament. As I also said earlier, the review has not
addressed the question of  
<?notus-xml column=1222?>whether the UK should remain a nuclear weapon power, because complete
unilateral disarmament is not the policy of either the Conservative
party or the Liberal Democrats—or, indeed, of Labour. The review
did not seek to address the question of whether we should possess
nuclear weapons. However, the scale and posture of our nuclear weapon
capability can change.</hs_Para>

credible submarine-based alternatives to the current proposal; and,
thirdly, are there alternative nuclear postures that could maintain
credibility? The review has been thorough, detailed, extensive and
objective. The analysis looks in detail at specific combinations of
platform, delivery vehicle and warhead design, but excludes
technologies that could not be ready by 2035. Variants of the current

for alternative platforms, the review considered large aircraft, combat
jets, surface ships and multiple types of submarine, including those
with a dual role. As for alternative delivery systems, the final
analysis was focused on two types of potential future cruise

cruise missile, each carrying one warhead. Warhead design issues were
considered and were important in the review.</hs_Para>

of our ability to deliver alternative options showed that producing the
warhead and its integration into a cruise missile or bomb would be the
critical challenge. The reality is that the UK nuclear warhead
programme is highly optimised around producing and maintaining warheads
for the Trident missile. The review found that moving towards an
alternative would add technical, financial and schedule risk to the
programme. Delivering a warhead for an alternative system would
therefore take at least 24 years—deliverable with some risk by
about 2040. The crucial point is that the review judged this warhead
time scale to be longer than the Vanguard submarines can safely be
operated for. There are, of course, options to bridge the gap, but when
we

longer part of state security and defence postures. It is true that
Britain has made significant steps since the cold war in disarmament
terms. Some would argue that Britain has done its bit for disarmament
and we have reached the minimum level possible. That argument has been
deployed at every point at which we have scaled down over the past 20
years, but each time it has proven not to be true. The next step down

the most comprehensive study on nuclear weapon platforms and postures
ever published by the UK Government. I believe that as large numbers of
nuclear weapons remain and the risk of proliferation continues, it is
right that the UK retains a nuclear capability for as long as the
global security situation makes that necessary. But I also believe that
that capability should be scaled and deployed to meet the threat we
face now, and held as a contingency to deal with the threats we may
face in the future. We should seek to balance the costs of this
insurance policy against the other needs of defence and, indeed, other
priorities across government.</hs_Para>

conclusion I draw from the Trident alternatives review is that although
alternatives exist, there is no new system available before the lives
of the current Vanguard submarines come to an end to meet those
criteria. But a step down the ladder is available: ending 24-hour
patrols when we do not need them and procuring fewer successor
submarines, moving on from an outdated cold war concept of deterrence
to one fit for the world we inhabit now. For the remainder of this
Parliament the coalition  
<?notus-xml column=1227?>Government’s policy will remain exactly as set out in the
strategic defence and security review. We will maintain the deterrent
as it is, and preparations for a successor system will continue. But
the final main-gate decision on whether to proceed with a like-for-like
replacement of Trident will be made in 2016, after the next general
election. It is therefore up to the different political parties in this
House to decide the positions they will take before that time. For the
country, I hope that the publication of this review will mark the start
of a national debate on one of the most profound questions of our time,
and I commend the Trident alternatives review to the
House.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-17?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_17_PT_1/EDB34098474AE259349432AB21348BD2E57A051D" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="17 July 2013">Wednesday

Secretary to the Treasury either has a different report in front of him
or he has read the report and not understood it. The Government
commissioned the alternatives review into the future of UK nuclear
deterrence back in 2011. It was part of the agreement in the shotgun
marriage between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats following
the 2010 general election. As he said, the Government’s stated
position was to “maintain Britain’s nuclear
deterrent”, but the Liberal Democrats had an opt-out in that
they could be allowed to make the case for alternatives. So, more than
two years later, we have finally been presented with those
alternatives.</hs_Para>

Liam Fox</B> (North Somerset) (Con):</Member> I will begin by saying
that this is not the most comprehensive review of this subject carried
out in recent years: the previous Labour Government carried out a
comprehensive review. I can say that with some confidence, because one
of the first things I did as Defence Secretary when we came into
government was to ask to see that work and check whether its
assumptions and costs were still valid. It was my view that they were,
and that continuous-at-sea deterrence still represented the best system
and best value for our nuclear deterrence.</hs_Para>

review, we looked at the previous Government’s review and at the
systems that have since been rejected again. No Member wants to have an
air-launch system or a silo-based system in their constituency. At the
time, the Liberal Democrats put forward a proposal on the cruise-based
system that they believed to be credible. We, of course, maintained our
belief that CASD was the best, along with a replacement for the Trident
programme.</hs_Para>

number of reasons why I was happy for the review to go ahead. In
particular, it would show the Liberal Democrats that the cruise-based
system was a non-starter. First, it would be too expensive. It would
require research and development for the missile system and for changes
to the submarine programme. It would be slower and more easily
intercepted. It would require our submarines to be closer to target,
and therefore more likely to be detected. It would also—no small
point—be illegal under the treaty on the non-proliferation of
nuclear weapons. It was a non-starter. I am therefore pleased that the
Chief Secretary, who is not in his place at the moment, came to the
conclusion, rather belatedly, that it would be good to keep the Trident
replacement system. It is a gain for the whole House and the country
that the Liberal Democrats have seen sense.</hs_Para>

deeply depressing, however, is the willingness of the Liberal Democrats
to abandon CASD. It has been the position of both major
parties—the Labour party and the Conservative party—to
have CASD based on four boats, or fewer if technology allowed. Let us
be frank: in the foreseeable future, technology will not allow us to go
below four boats. We need one going out, one coming in, one in refit
and one in training. It is not possible to maintain what we have and
what we want at lower levels than that, given present technology. If we
go down to three, CASD cannot be guaranteed. If we go to two boats, we
cannot have it at all, so that is an unrealistic proposition.</hs_Para>

Liberal Democrats saying with this policy? They are saying that we
would abandon CASD, but deploy at times of increased international
tension. What does any Member think would happen to international
tension if we deployed a nuclear system 
<?notus-xml column=1236?>that was not otherwise deployed? That would be a crazy foreign policy. I
have to say to my Liberal Democrat colleagues that it is all very well

manoeuvre.</hs_Para>

Chief Secretary said that they would save £4 billion over the
lifetime of the programme—£4 billion over a 34

days of what we spend on pensions and welfare. This is supposed to be

would be a £4 billion saving, given the monumental disruption it

to be lost, as the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness (John Woodcock)

crucial question to be asked by anyone who wants to dismantle or
diminish the CASD posture is: what will the world look like in 30, 40

what the risk assessments will be in the future, and it is not our job
to play roulette with the security of future generations in our
country. We are being offered 50 years of protection from nuclear
blackmail for the people of our country. There are those who say that
£20 billion or more of capital costs is too much for 50
years’ protection from nuclear blackmail, but that it was all
right to spend £9.5 billion for six weeks for the

present it in this manner, we do serious damage to our credibility when
talking to our electorate. In my opinion, the report was born of
unworthy motives and conducted without any outside consultation, and to
present it with the kind of hyperbole we have heard tonight—as
the 
<?notus-xml column=1237?>most comprehensive examination of our nuclear deterrent in a
generation—is clear and utter nonsense. The report picks apart
nothing in the 2006 White Paper; indeed, despite the best efforts of
the right hon. and learned Member for North East Fife (Sir Menzies
Campbell) at the last general election, it confirms the basic
underpinning of the report and denies the credibility of what was said
at the last general election: that we can have a cheap nuclear
deterrent.</hs_Para>

there is the question of whether we should have a nuclear deterrent at
all. It is raised in all our constituencies all the time and is a
perfectly reasonable question. Some Members believe and say openly that
we should not have one, while others, I think, believe the same, but do
not say so openly. The first question, then, is whether we should have
one at all, but the report was not commissioned to examine that
question; it was commissioned to examine the second question, which
inevitably flows from the first: if we decide to have a nuclear
deterrent, what kind should it be? What is the best system? What is
affordable, effective and a real deterrent? That is where the report
falls down.</hs_Para>

such thing as a non-credible or a less-credible deterrent. There can be
no such thing as a part-time deterrent. To be a deterrent, something
has to deter. Doing anything less than deter stops a nuclear deterrent
from being a deterrent at all. It turns it into what? Potentially, at
times of crisis, it turns into an invitation; it most certainly turns
it from a deterrent into a weapon. If we look at what underpins the
White Paper— and as the previous speaker clearly
stated—we seen that such a weapon would be dangerous to deploy.
How, when and in what circumstances would it be put to sea? How would
we disguise, at a time of rising tension, that we were doing that? It
would be dangerous to deploy and difficult to sustain. It is all right
to say that if we have three boats, we could, for a time in some
circumstances, up our level of deterrent and go back to
continuous-at-sea deterrence. Yes, we could do that for a while if we
got ahead of the crisis, stepped back to CASD, deployed a boat at sea
and kept it at sea throughout that time. But with three boats, for how
long could we do that?</hs_Para>

Government and the Labour party accept—indeed, it would be
nonsense not to accept it—that technology may change the need
for a fourth boat. If it does, why on earth would we do anything other
than have three boats? However, if technology does not change those
basic parameters, we will lose our ability to deter for a considerable
time. This is not something we can just rescale in a matter of months;
it would take years to rescale and we would therefore be rendering our
deterrent non-sustainable.</hs_Para>

does not ask an honest question and I do not believe it was an honest
process, but the review has at least flushed out the issue of whether
Trident can be done on the cheap. I would not want to have an
examination in a cheap operating theatre by a doctor who had been
trained on the cheap, and I would not want a deterrent that was done on
the cheap. If we are to have a deterrent, let us have a deterrent that
deters, as that is the only one worth
having.</hs_Para>

that the principal reason why alternative systems were found not to be
viable was not—as some have suggested—because they were
not technically viable. In contrast, it was because the length of time
such alternatives would take, and the amount of money it would involve
to equip a warhead to an alternative system, would make such
alternatives prohibitive in the medium term. That is the expert view of

that we must consider the threat we might face in 20, 30 or 40

deterrent in 20, 30 or 40 years’ time that is capable of
deterring the threat that we might face at that point. My point is
simply that the threat we face today is not the same as it was at the

for the nuclear deterrent—uniquely among our military

The idea that the nuclear capability has a deterrent effect at all only
by being patrolled 24/7 is clearly absurd. All the rest of our

seeks to prevent war—is a key element and cornerstone of the
defence of our country. It is a vital ingredient in our membership of
NATO and our relationship with the United States of America, our
strongest ally, and ensures our seat on the UN Security Council.
Britain’s nuclear deterrent helps to prevent would-be aggressors
and other countries from attacking us or using their nuclear arsenals
to try to blackmail us. Our ownership of this highly successful
deterrent came about following the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
which brought about a dramatic end to the final phase of world war two.

implications.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071799000215" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0005.htm#13071799000215">The
implications of that event were so dramatic that no one has ever sought
or dared to push international conflicts to a point where any country
has had to use nuclear weapons, which have been Britain’s most
effective insurance policy. Indeed, the development of nuclear weapons
since Hiroshima and Nagasaki continues to have a significant impact on
the veterans who were dispatched to Christmas island and other places
to take part in the very tests that made the nuclear deterrent that we
are discussing today possible. We must remember that we owe them a
great debt of gratitude. Indeed, it would be most helpful if the

nuclear deterrent continues to play a significant role in maintaining
peace throughout the world. Unpredictable countries such as Iran and
North Korea, which are threatening to develop their own nuclear

Devonport dockyard, which is responsible for refuelling and refitting
our nuclear submarines, is a vital part of our local economy, as more
than 25,000 people in the Devonport travel-to-work area depend on
defence for their livelihood. Yesterday’s mind-boggling

continuous-at-sea deterrent and reduce the number of submarines from
four to three, or even two, would have a devastating impact on the

Liberal Democrats’ proposals were to become a reality, they
would not only damage 25,000 people’s livelihoods but have a
major impact on our low-skills and low-wage economy. They would also
damage the job prospects of the young people who are about to start at
Devonport’s university technical college, which is set to give
youngsters an education that will eventually deliver a skilled work
force who could be employed in our dockyard. That would be most
unhelpful. A reduction in the number of nuclear submarines would mean
less refitting work, and the highly skilled work force in our dockyard

importance of Devonport to the south-west’s economy and the
defence of our nation, I find it extraordinary that the Liberal

tools that they will use in any negotiations that they might have with
Labour, should the result of the next general election be a score
draw—I very much hope that that will not happen—as it was
in 2010. Sadly, the Leader of the Opposition has not said that the
future of four nuclear submarines and the continuous-at-sea deterrent
would not be up for negotiation in any potential coalition or supply
and demand agreement, and I would be grateful if his position on this
could be confirmed. At least we now know for sure that there is only
one way in which we can be certain of maintaining our nuclear
deterrent. That is to have a Conservative victory at the next election,
which would ensure that our country could continue to play a
significant part in global politics and that we had the necessary tools

ourselves.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-17?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_17_PT_1/0B00D9E4112D1344D7CE2ED2514AD193EB44E339" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="17 July 2013">Wednesday

to take Scotland’s share of the Trident nuclear missile system

taxpayers’ annual contribution is £163 million. That

Royal Marine officers. It could train nearly 4,000 nurses, or more than
4,500 teachers. It could build between 13 and 20

Mordaunt</B> (Portsmouth North) (Con):</Member> Yesterday we were able
to read the Government’s much-anticipated report on Trident and
its alternatives, and I am delighted that it confirmed that the most
effective and value-for-money option for the deterrent was a
four-submarine CASD. How vexing, though, for the civil servants who
worked so hard on it that half, or more accurately one seventh, of the
Government have decided to disregard those findings, and to promote an
option that was not included in the report’s brief because it
was considered to be too ludicrous: a two-boat, part-time deterrent,
which, as we all know, is no deterrent at all.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13071799000238" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0005.htm#13071799000238">I would not
go so far as to say that some of my best friends are Liberal Democrats,
but I am sure that their hearts are in the right place. Sadly, the
location of the collective Liberal Democrat head is not always obvious;
certainly, on this issue they seem to have taken leave of their senses.
Yesterday the Liberal Democrats were in chaos, reeling from the
discovery that the three-boat option did not deliver the savings for
which they had hoped. In scenes reminiscent of Mitchell and
Webb’s “Numberwang”, they ran around Whitehall and
Millbank yelling different numbers in the hope that one of them might
strike a chord.</hs_Para>

more appropriately named game show to describe yesterday’s
endeavours would be “Pointless”. Let me explain why. The
report puts the cost of two new submarines at £10 billion, the
cost of three at £14 billion and the cost of four at
£16 billion, excluding the attendant costs of missiles, warheads
and infrastructure. According to the Liberal Democrats, those figures
plainly show £6 billion of waste, but that analysis
reveals a skewed sense of value for money. My understanding of the
figures is that we could spend £16 billion on something or
£10 billion on nothing, and the Liberal Democrat preference for
the latter option has led me to conclude that it may not be a
coincidence that the MOD budget was balanced only when Main Building
became a Liberal Democrat no-fly zone in the last
reshuffle.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071799000240" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0005.htm#13071799000240">In
the absence of the Liberal Democrat head, it is perhaps not
unsurprising that they are ruled by their heart, which in truth yearns
for UK nuclear disarmament. Certainly the former Defence Minister, my
hon. Friend the Member for North Devon (Sir Nick Harvey), when debating
the matter with me yesterday on the BBC, would not agree that we could
now proceed to produce two submarines and have a debate about the
others later. If he had been pro some kind of deterrent, he would have
agreed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071799000241" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0005.htm#13071799000241">It
may or may not be the case that we face no nuclear threat at the
moment—although how would we know, because we would have
deterred it?—but we cannot know what the future will bring. That
point has been well made by several Members today. The Liberal Democrat
position is contingent on the continuation of the current international
climate, which, I remind Members, is influenced by CASD. Do the Liberal
Democrats know something that we do not? Does their influence reach
places that we cannot reach? Has the Tigger-like charisma of my hon.
Friend the Member for Cambridge (Dr Huppert) and his cycling
crusade, for which I salute him, had such an impact on the
bicycle-loving populace of China that, should that state fall into
malign hands, we need only deploy him on his bike to avert disaster? Or
perhaps the Business Secretary has been able to 
<?notus-xml column=1248?>persuade North Korea and Iran that they should not waste their time and
treasure on nuclear weapons—after all, if they want to bring
down the British Government, they need only give him a call. Or perhaps
our polyglot Deputy Prime Minister has managed to negotiate with all
prospective despots and promoters of state-sponsored terrorism to cut a
deal of non-aggression for the next 50 years. If that is the
case, I must counsel them that, in my experience, anything the Liberal
leader might promise, even if it is in writing and witnessed by a
Select Committee, might not actually come to pass.</hs_Para>

Democrats might very well know something that we do not, which might
explain their relaxed stance on CASD, but we must plan and prepare for
the possibility of aggression from a nuclear power, so let us consider
the options. What about the middle way of a three-boat fleet? The
report concludes that with only three boats there would be several
unplanned, as well as planned, breaks in deployment over a given
20-year period, whereas that has not been the real-life experience of
operating a four-boat fleet.</hs_Para>

take the cited savings of approximately £3.5 billion on
whole-life costs as correct, the average annual saving for the
surrender of our continuous nuclear deterrent over 45 years of spending
would be £78 million. As Trident and welfare are often presented
as rival candidates for cuts, let us put that £78 million per
year in context by comparing it with the approximately
£160 billion annual cost of social security. Indeed,
the total average cost, including missiles, warheads and
infrastructure, of the whole shebang of a four-boat fleet would be
about 1% of the non-pension welfare budget. CASD is value for money,
and any alternative that is not continuous and is vulnerable to attack
is neither value for money nor up to the
job.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071799000244" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0005.htm#13071799000244">Today,
I have made a light-hearted speech about a very grave subject. I have
done so because I wish to persuade our coalition colleagues of the
error of their arguments. In the past three years they have had a steep
learning curve in the realities of power. On the evidence of their
current antics, they have at least one more lesson to learn: the first
duty of a Government, of any colour or combination of colours, is to
protect the United Kingdom from these dread weapons. I urge them to do
so.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-17?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_17_PT_1/7AAD606E723FBB77D06F0D67CBDAC8A800D68CE7" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="17 July 2013">Wednesday

baffles me why the Deputy Prime Minister sacrificed a Liberal Democrat

the importance of the deterrent. All Labour colleagues would

during the cold war, but I have absolutely to disagree with him. We are
in a multipolar world where there will be emerging powers in the next
40 years, and the certainties we had in the cold war about the Soviet
bloc no longer exist. It has been said several times, so I will not
labour the point, but we are being asked to try to guess what the
situation may be in 30 or 40 years’ time. It is not a criticism
of the national security strategy from 2010 that it could not see the
Arab spring coming less than 12 months ahead. Can he honestly tell us
why he is so confident about the state of the world in 30 or 40
years’
time?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071799000248" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0005.htm#13071799000248">The
Chief Secretary to the Treasury, who has scuttled off, I suspect to cry
somewhere in the corner, has claimed that this is a comprehensive
document. I tabled about 35 parliamentary questions to the Deputy Prime
Minister earlier this year and was astonished at some of the answers
that were revealed. There was no discussion with the United States, at
any level, about the role of CASD. The Chief Secretary quoted President
Obama at length, but he did not even have the courtesy to approach the
United States embassy, the Pentagon, the State Department or the White
House. There was no discussion with our NATO colleagues. There was no
discussion with the French or any other international allies, and there
were no discussions with the defence industry, save for cursory visits,
I think, to Aldermaston and Barrow. There were no discussions with the
local authorities that would be affected, and none with the Defence
Secretary, except on one occasion during the two-year process. The
Chief Secretary to the Treasury does not even have a pass for Main
Building, which goes to show how little credibility he had. It is worth
noting that he was flanked at all times by two heavies from the

If he spoke to trade union leaders at Faslane—the hon. Member

The hon. Members for Islington North (Jeremy Corbyn) and for Brighton,
Pavilion (Caroline Lucas) and I, from our respectively opposite sides
of the argument, successfully procured a debate on 17
January. Strangely enough, I did not hear many of these Liberal
Democrat midway positions articulated on that occasion. The hon. Member

it is possible to make a principled and coherent case either that we

a couple of elements that I regard as particularly significant. The

yes and no. It does not just rest on the notion of unacceptable loss;
it rests on the twin notions of unacceptable loss and unavoidable loss.
That is where the whole concept of continuous-at-sea deterrence is
central, because if one thinks one has a chance of avoiding an
unacceptable level of retaliation, one might well take that chance in
the hope that one will not have to face up to it.</hs_Para>

before, and I will quote it again tonight, what was stated the first
time a senior British defence specialist considered the concept of what
in those days would have been called atomic deterrence. That was in
June 1945 in a top secret report drawn up by a committee of defence
scientists headed by Professor Sir Henry Tizard. He made a comparison
between the atomic bomb, which at the time had not yet been tested or
used against Japan, and the concept and practice of
duelling:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13071799000337" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0005.htm#13071799000337">“Duelling
was a recognised method of settling quarrels between men of high social

the document, which was prepared by two civil servants in the Cabinet
Office specially seconded from the Ministry of Defence, a number of
strange concepts are articulated. One of them is
familiar—continuous deterrence, which is referred to without
quotation marks. Then the document refers to things called
“focused deterrence”, “sustained
deterrence”, “responsive deterrence” and
“preserved deterrence”. I have studied this subject for
at least 31 years and I have never come across those terms before. At a
briefing earlier today, the two civil servants were good enough to
admit that in fact they had made them up. That is perfectly okay,
except for one thing—the use of the word
“deterrence”. They could just as easily have referred to
something like “intermittent deterrence”,
“semi-deterrence”, microscopic deterrence” or
“virtually zero deterrence”. It is not really deterrence
unless it is certain; that is why it used to be called “mutually
assured destruction”. It is not enough to be able to threaten
destruction; it has to be assured because otherwise the person may not
be deterred.</hs_Para>

only reason we put that off was to enable the Liberal Democrats to have

did not even consider a two-boat solution; it considered only a
three-boat or four-boat solution. It could hardly be a breach of the
coalition agreement if

than pursuing that particular argument, I want to argue that it is now
time to shift the emphasis of the defence debate and that the best

fuels conflict, hunger and violence around the

is why it is deeply worrying and, indeed, the height of
irresponsibility that both the 2010 strategic defence and security
review and this review of an alternative to Trident have not explored
the full range of options. The Prime Minister trumpeted the review as
“neutral” and “factual”, but I would argue
that it is biased and empty of essential facts. That means that there
is a risk that any parliamentary votes taken in 2016 will be
ill-informed and hung up on a cold war era that has long
gone.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071799000278" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0005.htm#13071799000278">The
decision that should be taken is one based on what would genuinely
contribute most to the security of the British people. There is a real
argument that says that by not replacing Trident we could improve
national security and allow the Ministry of Defence to spend the more
than £100 billion saved over the lifetime of any successor
nuclear weapon system on an appropriate response to the real security
threats and challenges of the 21st century. The 2010 national security
strategy identified these as organised crime, cyber-warfare, pandemics
and, of course, climate change. Scientists, former US Presidents and,
indeed, former UK Prime Ministers, among others, have all agreed that
climate change is in fact the greatest threat facing humankind, and
every pound spent on Trident is a pound not spent on more appropriate
responses to the real dangers linked to climate
change.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071799000279" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0005.htm#13071799000279">If
that is the case, let us explore how that money could have been better
spent. The £80 billion to £100 billion price
tag for Trident could have been spent on energy  
<?notus-xml column=1254?>efficiency, energy conservation and renewable energy, all
of which represent an investment in a positive
future and the opportunity to be world leaders in
an area of rapidly advancing
technology, as opposed to a cold war past. Just £16
billion would insulate the 16 million homes in Britain that
are currently uninsulated, saving 4% of UK carbon emissions
and helping to prevent 20,000 annual cold-related deaths, and
£30 billion would provide 3,500 offshore turbines, supplying 15%
of UK electricity use. Crucially, positive investment in a greener
future would make us more secure by reducing the impacts of climate
change and ending our dependence on foreign oil—a key root cause

bottom line is that the UK does not need Trident; nor can we afford it.
An independent and strategic assessment of risk does not justify
spending tens of billions of pounds on Trident when we have, for

question whether or not the initial estimated £25 billion could
pay instead for 60,000 newly qualified nurses or 60,000 new secondary

fundamental questions need to be asked. A nuclear weapon is not a
targeted weapon. Let us imagine we set off a nuclear weapon against,

most matters. They have never quite forgiven them for the 100 years war
or the French revolution—<I>[Interruption.] </I>See, they are
cheering up now. They are licking their lips at the prospect of war
with France. Indeed, this whole building is festooned with memorabilia
about the French revolution and the defeat of Napoleon. If they wanted
to teach the French a lesson by sending a nuclear weapon against them,
it would not take out a military establishment or an airport; it would
take out millions of people in the civilian population, just as it
would if used against Moscow, Pyongyang, Tehran or anywhere else. A
nuclear weapon is a weapon of indiscriminate mass destruction against a
civilian population. Small nuclear weapons were used in 1945 over
Hiroshima and Nagasaki. They were tiny in comparison with one warhead
on one part of a Trident submarine now, and the cancers from those
weapons have existed and lasted for 60 years. The use of a nuclear
weapon sets off a nuclear winter and an environmental disaster for
those affected.</hs_Para>

Trident, I say that by 2020—if the main-gate decision is taken

Will defence chiefs at that time accept cuts in every other area of
defence expenditure to accommodate the construction of those new
submarines and new missile system? I seriously doubt it. Those in the
House who talk so glibly about nuclear weapons know full well that
there is a serious debate in the Royal United Services Institute and

Reevell</B> (Dewsbury) (Con):</Member> I first stopped and thought
seriously about nuclear weapons and the issues associated
with them 30 years ago after I spent some time in the forest near a
little town called Menden in West Germany. I was there with 50 Missile
Regiment, which had battlefield nuclear weapons—we do
not have those any more. The purpose of that regiment, come war time,
was to fire its Lance missile into Soviet tank configurations, possibly
in a battlefield context as a first-strike weapon. The regiment had
three missiles, but it only ever trained to use one because its
signature would have been picked up and the regiment would have been
wiped out by Soviet battlefield nuclear weapons before it had even got
close to loading the second missile. Its members did not bother
practising to drive away either, as they had worked out that they could
not get away fast enough to get out of the impact area of the weapon
that would be fired against them. I have no doubt that the regiment
would have been prepared to fire its weapon, and it was a sobering
experience.</hs_Para>

later in the Army I was tasked with lecturing and explaining the
consequences of using intercontinental nuclear weapons, and I had to
learn the difference between the consequences of using ground-burst
weapons—those have been replicated on television and people
might have seen the force that moves out along the ground—and
air-burst weapons. Ground-burst weapons are appalling, but the
consequence of air-burst nuclear weapons is truly horrific by
comparison. I learned two lessons from those experiences. First, that
such weapons are the worst example of man’s ability to cause
death 
<?notus-xml column=1260?>and destruction, and secondly that this country must never be exposed to
those who believe they could use such weapons against us with
impunity.</hs_Para>

over the years others have taken a different stance, and have done so
in a principled way—I am thinking of previous Labour party
leaders who had an open and sincere belief that they expressed during
the 1980s. They were wrong: the SS-20s did not disappear from the Ural
mountains because well-meaning people danced around Greenham Common air
base but because cruise missiles were put into Greenham Common air
base.</hs_Para>

too, that for some the idea of putting country before party is
difficult. I understand that when coalition offers an opportunity for
power, their approach might well be that party policies are paramount
and not what is best for the United Kingdom. It is unfortunate when
that happens, not least because it leads to a large amount of
expenditure of time and money on reports such as the one we have been
considering over the past couple of days. Commissioning a report in the
false hope that it would undermine the argument for a submarine-based
nuclear deterrent was always going to fail. Russia is not modernising
its submarine fleet for no good reason and China is not expanding its
submarine programme on a whim.</hs_Para>

published and confirms that the only viable option is the
submarine-based system, but what comes next, sadly, is the most
appalling piece of “party before country” politics that I
can recollect. The analysis of my coalition partners seems to be,
“Our report has confirmed that the submarine system is the only
option. It is the only option because it provides an effective
continuous deterrent, so we will therefore go with the submarine
system, but seek to make it non-continuous and therefore less effective
and seek to portray that as progress.” If the Chief Secretary is
a unilateralist, he should have the moral courage to come out and say
so. If he is not, he should realise that this idea ranks somewhere
between third rate and poor. The “four boat, continuously at
sea” policy is the only practical way to maintain the effective
deterrent that has protected these islands for a long time. It is about
time we got on with its modernisation.</hs_Para>

Our continuous-at-sea deterrence is an important contribution to NATO.
It is a pay-back to the United States for being the ultimate guarantor
of European security. We should not imagine for a minute that if we
started downgrading our deterrent, the United States would remain as
interested as it is now in maintaining security in Europe, with all the

point that I wish to make briefly is what defence policy is really

that then settles what we need for the future. The whole point about
defence planning and defence policy is that it is about preparing for
what we do not expect, making contingencies for what we cannot foresee.
That is what the whole document fails to do. The idea that we now live
in a different world from the one we lived in during the cold war, and
therefore that the global environment has given us permission to
downgrade our nuclear capability, is clearly
nonsense.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307185000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0005.htm#1307185000052">There
is another misunderstanding. This is not a weapons system that we have
not used, do not use and are unlikely to use. The importance of our
continuous-at-sea deterrent is that we use it every day. It shapes the
global environment in which we live. Why is state-on-state warfare a
second-tier threat rather than a primary threat? 
<?notus-xml column=1263?>Why has state-on-state warfare between the major powers become
unthinkable since the end of the first half of the 20th century? It is
because those major powers have nuclear weapons. Were we to start
destabilising the credibility of our continuous-at-sea deterrence, we
would be destabilising the very global environment which the Liberal
Democrats believe gives them permission to go part-time on our
deterrent. My hon. Friend the Member for Aldershot (Sir Gerald Howarth)
put it well. The part-time deterrent is no deterrent. We might as well
pack it in unless we are going to stick with continuous at-sea
deterrent.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-17?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_17_PT_1/39A5A01ADD1440CF762A61C128B9972F325429BC" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="17 July 2013">Wednesday

and cost, through a continuous- at-sea deterrent. We have rightly been

that the Liberal Democrats have taken two years to review a policy and
spent thousands of pounds of taxpayers’ money, only to conclude

ultimate insurance policy, it cannot be taken seriously if it is only
part time. If that is what the Liberal Democrats are proposing, it will

decision for this House, that decision should not be taken in isolation

alone in the rest of the UK. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend

listened carefully to the Chief Secretary’s speech and to
contributions from the only other Liberal Democrat Member who was
prepared to support this 
<?notus-xml column=1269?>position today, I am still completely at a loss as to what the Liberal
Democrats’ policy on Trident actually is. After a two-year
review that was specifically designed to help them to come up with a
policy, they still have not decided whether they are in favour of two
or three submarines. At the start of the week, they briefed the
national newspapers that they would come out in favour of just two
successor submarines. One newspaper

however, it was revealed that the Trident alternatives review did not
even examine the option of replacing the current fleet of four Vanguard
submarines with just two successor boats. Why not? Because at the
outset, when the Liberal Democrats had the opportunity to raise the
issues that they wished to be considered in the review, they did not do
so. What a shambles. Only the Liberal Democrats could hold a two-year
review, brief the newspapers that they are in favour of an option that
was not even in the review and then, when the review is published,
refuse to confirm whether they are in favour of it or

Green</B> (Stretford and Urmston) (Lab):</Member> Last week was
national transplant week, and the NHS highlighted an important campaign
to increase organ donation. Donor rates have, pleasingly, increased by
50% since 2008, but although almost every one of us would accept a
donated organ if we needed a transplant, only 57% of relatives agree to
organs being retrieved. However, that proportion rockets to 95% if the
deceased has discussed his or her wishes in advance with family
members. Some 19.7 million of us are on the organ donor register, but
three people still die each day while waiting for a transplant, so I
wholeheartedly support the efforts of NHS Blood and Transplant to
increase the number of organs donated. I add my voice to those who
advocate an opt-out
scheme.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307185000112" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0005.htm#1307185000112">Having
met and talked to transplant survivors, I can testify to the immense
gratitude that they feel to donors who have literally given them a new
lease of life, but donation is only half the story. Although the
selection and allocation of organs for transplant is much less widely
discussed, it is also a complex and controversial
issue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307185000113" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0005.htm#1307185000113">A
few weeks ago, I met my constituent, 18-year-old Natalie McCusker, who
had been on the waiting list for a lung transplant for 19 months. She
described to me what it is like to live in a state of limbo waiting for
a suitable transplant. She has been too unwell to go to school,
although her school arranged for her to participate in classes via
Skype. She wanted to study sciences, but could not because oxygen
cylinders and science experiments do not mix. As a young girl, she had
enjoyed and been very good at sport, but that has become impossible
since she became too ill. The effects on her family have also been
profound; for example, her mum has taken a five-year career
break.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307185000114" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0005.htm#1307185000114">Natalie
was first told that she would need a transplant when she was 15. She
initially hoped it would be carried out at Great Ormond Street
children’s hospital, but people transfer to the adult register
at the age of 16, so she was advised to delay transplant surgery until
she moved to the adult
list.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307185000115" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0005.htm#1307185000115">When
Natalie first moved on to the adult system, she was able to access
treatments that are deemed unsuitable for children. At first her
condition improved, but seven weeks after taking her GCSEs, she became
much more unwell. She was eventually listed for a transplant in
November 2011. I completely accept that there are different clinical
demands when treating children and adults, and that there is a need for
separate systems. However, from the patient’s point of view, it
seems that the transition may lengthen waiting times, and it also means
that a new relationship of trust and confidence must be built up
between the patient and new teams of
clinicians.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307185000116" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0005.htm#1307185000116"><Member ContinuationText="Jim Shannon" PimsId="650" UID="1307185002247" xid="1218" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0005.htm#1307185002247"><B>Jim
Shannon</B> (Strangford) (DUP):</Member> I am grateful to the hon. Lady
for bringing the matter to the House. I have a particular interest in
organ transplants and donation because I have carried a card since I
have been able to do so. In Northern Ireland, we carried out about
eight 
<?notus-xml column=1272?>transplant operations in 2008, but now in 2013 we carry out more than 50
a year—almost one a week. That has happened not only because
those who carry the card pass on their organs when they die, but
because we have the largest number of live donors in the whole of the
United Kingdom—far above the average for England and Wales. If
more effort was made on live donors, it could help to address the
problem faced by the hon. Lady’s constituent. The evidence from
Northern Ireland indicates that the longer one is on a donor list, the
less one’s health deteriorates, so perhaps the Minister will
address that point when she responds to the
debate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307185000117" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0005.htm#1307185000117"><B><Member ContinuationText="Kate Green" PimsId="5566" UID="1307185002248" xid="1207" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0005.htm#1307185002248">Kate
Green:</Member></B> I note with interest what the hon. Gentleman says
and I am sure that the Minister will want to respond to that point.
Obviously, we would want to explore all methods of increasing the
number of donor organs available. We should bear it in mind that one
person may donate up to nine organs following their
death.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307185000118" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0005.htm#1307185000118">I
was talking about the crucial importance of a sense of trust and
confidence between patients and clinicians. For a course of treatment
as massive and life-changing as transplant surgery, that is certainly
no trivial matter. I cannot suggest any easy answer to that, but my
first point to the Minister is to ask her to consider ways in which the
disruption of the transition process between childhood treatment and
the adult list could be minimised, with a particular interest in
ensuring that waiting times are not extended
unnecessarily.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307185000119" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0005.htm#1307185000119">There
are other concerns relating to the allocation of organs for those on
the waiting list. The current process for allocating hearts and lungs
for transplant is based on dividing the country into a number of zones.
That means that if someone lives in one zone and a suitable organ
becomes available in another, they might not receive it simply because
they are on the wrong waiting list. In following a rigid zonal
approach, important considerations of equity across the country could

in my region, the north-west—it is your region, too, Mr Deputy
Speaker—wait the longest in the country for lung transplants:
over 400 days in Manchester, compared with under 200 in Cambridge.
According to a written answer I received from the Minister on 15 May,
between April 2008 and March 2011 62.2% of patients in the north-west
waited more than six months for a lung transplant, compared with an
England average of 47.3%, and 23.2% of patients in the north-west
waited more than 18 months for such a transplant, compared with an
England average of 15.8%. The north-west also has among the highest
death rates for those on the waiting list for a lung
transplant—between 20% and 30%.</hs_Para>

we need to look again at the operation of the zonal system so as to get
the balance right between the underlying issues of urgency,
geographical proximity between donors and recipients, and waiting
times. The most urgent cases should clearly take priority. One approach
could be to treat urgent cases on a national basis and, if no urgent
case exists, to allocate on a zonal basis. If that approach was
adopted, zones would need to be more dynamic. In other words, if the
waiting list grows the zone would also expand to give access to more
organs.</hs_Para>

we could move to a fully national allocation system, whereby patients
could be matched with suitable organs across the country. I recognise
that geographical considerations are of course important, not least if
the ischemia time, the time between organ retrieval and transplant, is
integral to the success of the operation. For heart transplants, in
particular, it very often is, and the system for heart transplants in
fact appears to work effectively. That seems to be much less true for
lung transplants. Equity is also a consideration. It is of course
important to have regard to the interests of those who have been on the
waiting list the longest, and that really should not be dependent on
where someone lives and which list they are
on.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307185000123" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0005.htm#1307185000123">I
understand that the NHS is now considering whether to move to a
national registration system, which would be fairer to patients in
regions such as ours. In the US and much of Europe this approach has
already been adopted or is being considered. The evidence suggests that
it could achieve greater equity without any increase in mortality
rates, or indeed cost.</hs_Para>

block? Inertia and convenience undoubtedly play a part. I acknowledge
that there is already better sharing of organs between zones when a
suitable match cannot be achieved within a zone, but it seems that some
transplant centres might be more interested in building up the scale of
their own activities rather than progressing the idea of a national
scheme that could deliver greater equity for all patients. Progress
towards delivering a national list scheme in this country is proving
painfully
slow.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307185000125" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0005.htm#1307185000125">What
steps are being taken to make progress towards a more equitable
national scheme of allocation, and what is the Minister’s
attitude to the development of such a scheme? What work, if any, is
being done to develop a national approach, and over what time scale
might progress be expected? How best can we make use of technology and
the sharing of data to facilitate the allocation of organs between
zones? What learning and best practice can be adopted from other
countries? What incentives would encourage a more equitable system of

for 19 months, while waiting for her transplant, her life was put on
hold. Perhaps that wait could have been shorter if she had not been
restricted to a single zonal waiting list. Yesterday she wrote to me to

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Anna
Soubry):</Member></B> Let me begin by congratulating the hon. Member
for Stretford and Urmston (Kate Green) on securing this debate, raising
this important issue, and enabling us to discuss it for this very short
period. It is not really a debate but a number of questions quite
properly asked, no doubt many of which I will not answer, through no
unwillingness on my part but because, as I always say, the usual rules
apply. However, all questions will be answered, if not by me tonight
then certainly by way of a letter. I thank the hon. Member for
Strangford (Jim Shannon) for his helpful and interesting contribution.
He has been good enough to provide me with a clipping. I believe that
it is about kidney transplants and kidney donations, and I will make
further inquiries.</hs_Para>

know and understand, Mr Deputy Speaker, this matter has come up by way
of the fact that hon. Lady, as she explained, has a constituent,
Natalie McCusker, who has had a lung transplant. We are all delighted
that she was able to have that lung transplant.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="1307185000130" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0005.htm#1307185000130">As we know,
the donation of organs is sometimes from a living source, to put it in
crude terms. There are many examples of people who have made the most
amazing sacrifices, often within families, to supply a kidney to a
loved one so that they can live. There is, of course, the whole
additional subject of what happens on death and the wishes of somebody
in relation to their organs, and the absolutely amazing difference that
that generosity after life can make to people. No doubt Natalie is a
very fine example of that, and no doubt she and her family are
profoundly grateful to the person who had the good sense to indicate
that they were willing that on their death their organs would be
donated. Then there is the great and often very emotional matter of the
family deciding that they are all content for this to happen. There is
nothing worse than when someone is taken from us when they die. It is
very difficult for anyone in the medical profession—we have
nurses who are specially trained in this—to approach the family
in those profoundly difficult times and discuss the possibility of
organ donation. The work of those nurses and other medical
professionals is one of the reasons we have seen an increase in organ
donation.</hs_Para>

the benefits of transplants and know that we need to do more to
increase the number of organs donated. That would give many more people
the opportunity to benefit from a transplant that could save their life
or significantly improve the quality of their life. About 8,000 people
are listed on the national transplant list waiting for a transplant.
Many more could be listed if more donated organs were available for
transplant. Many people wait months and years for a phone call telling
them that a suitable organ has been donated and calling them in for a
transplant. I am aware through my work as a Minister of some of those
families and their anguish as they literally sit around waiting for
that phone call, especially when it is a child who so desperately needs
the transplant to, in effect, save or improve the quality of their
life. For some, that phone call never comes and about three
people—adults and children—die every day waiting for a
transplant that could have saved their
lives.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307185000132" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0005.htm#1307185000132">Given
that the number of people needing organ transplants in the United
Kingdom is greater than the number of donor organs available, there has
to be a 
<?notus-xml column=1275?>system to ensure that patients are treated equitably and that donated
organs are allocated in a fair and unbiased way. Allocation is based on
the patient’s need and the importance of achieving the closest
possible match between donor and recipient, which is often very
difficult.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307185000133" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0005.htm#1307185000133">All
patients waiting for transplants are registered on the national
transplant database. Rules for allocating organs are determined by the
medical profession in consultation with other health professionals in
health departments and specialist solid organ advisory groups. The
blood group, age and size of both the donor and the recipient are all
taken into account to ensure the best possible match for each patient,
and the cardiothoracic advisory group is currently looking at improving
the allocation of donated lungs to help to ensure equity and better
outcomes for
patients.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307185000134" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0005.htm#1307185000134">At
present, lungs are allocated to the transplant centre based on the
location of the donor, as the hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston
said. The transplant centre will decide whether or not to accept the
lungs and will select the most appropriate recipient. NHS Blood and
Transplant is working with transplant centres to consider whether the
current allocation system can be improved. It is considering whether it
would be worth while implementing a national allocation scheme offering
lungs and other organs nationally, rather than by centre. Other models
are also being considered. NHS Blood and Transplant monitors the
current allocation system closely to ensure that there is equity of
access across the UK, and a recent analysis showed no statistical
differences in outcomes across the UK in relation to lung transplant
centres.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307185000135" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0005.htm#1307185000135"><B><Member ContinuationText="Kate Green" PimsId="5566" UID="1307185002250" xid="1207" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/debtext/130717-0005.htm#1307185002250">Kate

more than 80%—they are currently 57%—and transplant more
organs and increase the number of people receiving an organ. The
strategy calls for a revolution in public attitudes and behaviours, and
emphasises the importance of individuals and families agreeing to
donation. That important work needs to take place irrespective of
someone’s background, ethnicity, religion, faith or whatever
else. We need to ensure that more people in all parts of society sign

independent organ donation taskforce examined the case for moving to an
opt-out system in 2008 and its recommendation was against such a

rejected it. In any event, it no longer has an opt-out system. I know
that because I had a conversation with Spain’s Health Minister

learn from each other, which is extremely useful. Spain has one of the

that all I needed to do was go online. I went online and signed up

Hollobone. I will try to keep my remarks reasonably brief, to allow my
hon. Friends the opportunity to participate in this debate, but the
number who wish to do so is evidence of the growing concern in our
constituencies about planning matters and the need to ensure that we
strike the right balance between providing housing and ensuring that
the countryside can be protected and that we keep the promises that we
made to local people. I am therefore grateful for securing this

welcome his securing this debate and the fact that so many colleagues
wish to take part. I have made it clear to the Prime Minister on the
Floor of the House that the national policy planning framework is not
working to protect the green belt. There is greenfield development in
the green belt designated for my constituency at the behest of a
planning inspector, rather than local people, which is evidence that
our system is not working. I am delighted that my right hon. Friend is

the Member for Reigate (Mr Blunt). Protected landscapes, including the
green belt, are specifically singled out in the national framework to
ensure that they are not subject to these pressures. My concern is for
the wider countryside, which does not have such designation, yet he

district councils in my constituency, and I believe elsewhere, do not
believe that the targets have really disappeared. There is considerable
danger that because of the way the process has been set up—with
a requirement to conduct a strategic housing market assessment that may
not properly take into account the downturn that we have had—and
other pressures, which I will address, what those councils are really
being told is that they have little choice but to reimpose the target
that we said we were taking away. That damages confidence and removes
the freedom that local authorities should have to deliver
housing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071756000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0001.htm#13071756000014">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T09:39:43"></hs_TimeCode>
whole theory of the localist approach is that, if we move to a system
of incentives and encourage responsibility from councils, they will
plan for additional houses in a way that does not set up conflict.
Indeed, in my own area, whereas 51,000 houses were allocated to the
four district councils that cover my constituency under the south-east
plan, the current proposed plans of the four councils suggest that they
will build nearly 40,000 houses, which is well over three quarters of
the target originally set by the previous Government.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13071756000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0001.htm#13071756000015">We must
reject the false dichotomy that there is either a highest housing
number or zero houses, with my constituents or councils rejecting the
prospect of any house building. The councils are not doing that; they
are actually planning for a very responsible level of housing, but it
is important that they do that by consent and can carry their
communities with them, which is the principle that we set out. If the
emerging plans that they published are overturned by the Planning
Inspectorate, or if the councils set a higher number than they want to
build because they fear that some plans will be overturned by the
inspectorate, that freedom has effectively been taken away. So my first
key point is that we must not chase the target that we said we would
abolish. If we chase that target, we will undermine confidence in the
system that we said we would set
up<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T09:36:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071756000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0001.htm#13071756000016">Secondly,
although planning authorities are required to assess housing needs in
their area—it is right that they should be able to do
so—it is important that they also weigh up the availability of
infrastructure to support those housing needs. We have a serious
infrastructure deficit in West Sussex. We have an inadequacy of water
and real pressure on unprotected countryside, which is important for
agricultural use. We have pressure on school places and rural roads.
The system will be failing if district councils are not able to adjust
their figure to reflect that and say, “This is what is
realistically deliverable in our area.” Again, district councils
feel under huge pressure to adhere to the original high housing target
with little regard to such infrastructure considerations, which should
be material and allow councils to set a reasonable level of
housing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T09:37:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071756000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0001.htm#13071756000017">Thirdly—this
is the real point that I wish to make—there is now a growing
risk that we will return to the bad old days of planning by appeal,
under which the plans put 
<?notus-xml column=237?>together by local authorities are effectively overturned by the
inspectorate. More to the point, before plans are fully in place, the
inspectorate might be allowed to uphold appeals from speculative
developers that are charging into my constituency—I understand
that they are all over the countryside—and putting in
applications in the hope that, in the climate that has now been set,
the inspectorate will uphold them. I believe that those developers are
responding to a signal that has been sent to
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T09:38:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071756000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0001.htm#13071756000018"><Member ContinuationText="Sir Alan Haselhurst" PimsId="874" UID="13071756000193" xid="258" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0001.htm#13071756000193"><B>Sir

Friend probably knows the district of Uttlesford as well as he knows
his own constituency. Does he not think it is particularly iniquitous
if the Planning Inspectorate makes the kind of decisions to which he
has just referred when the district plan is not in place, not because
of the planning authority’s idleness or unwillingness, but
because it is being held up by waiting for confirmation from the

dangers of returning to planning by appeal are multiple. First, such a
return is founded on the mistaken belief that the way to get house
building moving is to send some kind of signal through the system and
the Planning Inspectorate that such speculative applications are to be
rewarded. That is not the way to get house building moving. We need a
correct analysis of the real reason for the slow rate of housing
starts, which is the economic downturn. In so far as the rate is
increasing again, that is due to the upturn in the

Friend for not being able to stay for all this debate, as I warned him.
The process that he describes is exactly what is happening in
Gloucestershire. There is evidence that developers are trying to submit
applications under the wire before the democratically approved joint
core strategy can be implemented—again, not due to any laziness
in local councils. Local politicians are trying to distinguish between
real housing need and demand, whereas the inspectorate appears just to
be backing demand, and in areas such as his and mine, demand is
virtually

first mistake is to believe that sending a signal and using the
inspectorate in that way to reward speculative applications will
contribute to getting construction going. It will not, because what is
happening frequently is that developers are simply land banking
permissions. They are not necessarily building. When they choose to
build, it will be when they think that they can make a return and when
there is demand for the houses that they wish to sell. What they are
doing at the moment in many cases, in my constituency and elsewhere, is
taking an opportunity to obtain a permission where they have absolutely
no intention to build immediately.</hs_Para>

rewarding those developers by having insufficient regard to permissions
that have already been granted. That is the second key concern. Given 
<?notus-xml column=238?>how the rules are set up in relation to the five-year land supply, the
calculations that local authorities are required to undertake mean that
they cannot include swathes of existing permissions that they have
allocated, which places completely unrealistic targets on
them.</hs_Para>

district council in my constituency—Horsham—a rate of
house building is now being required that has never been achieved in
the area, even in the boom years. It is good news for the developers,
who will not be developing for years but will secure planning
permissions on greenfield sites. By setting up a formula that fails to
give weight to unbuilt planning permissions, many of which are on
brownfield sites, we are effectively moving not to the brownfield-first

there is strong support in local areas for that housing to be provided,
to maintain the character of villages and ensure that communities
remain strong. No one disagrees that more housing is needed,
particularly more affordable housing, but as the policy is constructed
with a five-year land supply requirement that pays insufficient
attention to unbuilt planning permission and is effectively a
greenfield-first policy, it will not deliver the affordable housing

is disagreement about the number of unbuilt planning permissions
nationally; the Minister has had an exchange about it. It would be
helpful to have some up-to-date, reliable national figures. According
to the four district councils covering my constituency and beyond, the
total number of unbuilt planning permissions granted is well over
16,000 and the number of houses proposed to be built is 39,000. The
number of unbuilt planning permissions granted is getting on for half
the number of houses wanted, yet the councils are being told that those
unbuilt permissions cannot really be taken into account when they set
the number. That is the problem.</hs_Para>

effect of the policy is damaging to a principle that I know that the
Minister adheres to strongly, as do I—neighbourhood planning

feature of the Localism Act 2011: neighbourhoods would be given the

constituency, some parish councils have stuck their necks out to
prepare responsible neighbourhood plans, saying what amount of housing

dreamed of, and are now feeling considerably undermined. I cannot

particular, where applications are not supported by parish and district

we need a brownfield-first policy, not a greenfield-first policy, which
means clarifying the issue of deliverability set out in the national
policy framework. Unused permissions should not be discounted simply
because developers say, “Oh, well, we can’t build
there”. That should not be the definition of deliverability,
entirely to suit the developers. Of course they will say that, because
that is how they can secure planning permission for their greenfield

we need to take proper regard of infrastructure, and guidance due to be

tabled an amendment to the Growth and Infrastructure Bill and made my
points about the inadequacy of infrastructure. I accept that there is
no impropriety and that Lord Taylor has properly registered his
interests with the authorities, but I am concerned that not only is he
producing the guidance on infrastructure, but he is a director of a
company that is seeking to build a new town in my constituency. In
doing so, that company is trying to overturn the local plan, which has

further policy development is concerned, we should look at what

for Bassetlaw (John Mann) also made a powerful point—about the
credibility of the scheme to which we gave our name. We campaigned
vigorously and local 
<?notus-xml column=243?>people signed up to it. They supported our party on the basis that it
would be a scheme that we would undertake. I am afraid that we are
falling woefully short of that target and ambition. I urge the Minister
to support the views of my right hon.

Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert). I agree
with much of what he said. We are looking at aims that should be
complementary, but are contradictory at the moment: protecting the
countryside and green spaces, and providing much-needed housing through
local decision making. Given the time constraints, I will give a brief
report.</hs_Para>

points that have scored highly for the coalition Government include
scrapping the regional top-down spatial strategies, listening on the
national planning policy framework, introducing brownfield-first,
having three pillars of sustainability, and in theory not letting
economic growth trump protection for the green belt, landscapes and
urban green spaces. I am also keen on neighbourhood plans, which score
high marks. However, the downside is that the numbers from the regional
spatial strategies are retained. Core strategies are out of kilter
timewise with neighbourhood plans. Local people should be able to say,
“We don’t want the houses there. We know we need them. We
want them here.” But there is not time. Inspectors are
overturning.</hs_Para>

important to know when we will get plan guidance and whether there will
be consultation. Five-year plans must put brownfield sites first and

should work proactively to bring more brownfield land forward and to
stop interference with local democracy. Result: can do

Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert) on a
fantastic opening speech. I cannot disagree with a single word of it. I
served for 12 years on Test Valley borough council and I commend anyone
to serve an apprenticeship on a local planning authority, which can
show how vexed the world of planning and politics can
be.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071756000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0001.htm#13071756000062">I
want to make some basic points as briefly as I can. The first is about
a brownfield-first policy. In Romsey, we have waited since 1983 for the
brewery site, the only major brownfield site in the town, to be
developed. At last, there is some real progress, but it has taken 30
years. There must be a far more robust mechanism than the local
authority considering compulsory purchase time and again to try to
bring it forward, at which point the developer simply suggests more
enthusiastically that he was going to build something. It has taken 30
years to get the site developed while greenfield sites on the edge of
the town and in surrounding parts of the borough come under immense
pressure.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071756000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0001.htm#13071756000063">The
five-year land supply is incredibly important. In Test Valley borough,
developers have competed against one another at appeal to prove that
for some reason or 
<?notus-xml column=244?>other their site will be developable but their competitor’s site
will not. At the moment, we have the spectacle of a developer competing
against himself to prove that site No. 1, for which planning permission
was granted on appeal, needless to say, is not developable so he is
bringing forward another one. There is no guarantee that either site
will be built on until prices are right and the developer believes he
will maximise his profit, so there is an ever-growing land bank. My
right hon. Friend may have mentioned that planning permission has been
granted for 1 million houses throughout the country, but they are not
being built. We must find ways to encourage developers to build on
sites with existing planning
permission.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071756000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0001.htm#13071756000064">The
problem is not restricted to rural areas. In Bassett in Southampton,
there is no town or parish council, but just a city council and
residents’ associations, which work hard to introduce
neighbourhood planning. My constituent, Jean Wawman, recently wrote to
me saying that developers constantly have the upper hand, and that
article 4 directions to control houses in multiple occupation are
clunky, cumbersome, time-consuming, and prevent local people from
having real control over the character of their
neighbourhoods.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071756000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0001.htm#13071756000065">Finally—I
have only 30 seconds—there is no green belt in Hampshire, save
for a small corner in the south-west, which is preventing the spread of
the Bournemouth conurbation, which is not even in the same county. In
my constituency, greenfield sites without the additional protection of
being green belt invariably come under pressure for development,
particularly for Traveller sites. That is a huge concern in villages
such as Timsbury.</hs_Para>

Andrew</B> (Pudsey) (Con):</Member> Over the past 10 or 20 years, every
part of my constituency has been affected by overdevelopment. The old
mills and industrial sites have been replaced with massive new housing,
which has put huge pressure and strain on the local infrastructure. Our
roads are congested and our schools are bursting. We now have a massive
issue in the Guiseley area, where the council is desperately trying to
find places for schoolchildren for the coming
year.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071756000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0001.htm#13071756000068">Local
anger and frustration with the local planning system cannot be
overstated. Too many people believe that planning is something that
happens to them, and when localism came in there was a feeling of hope
that they would be able to have some input. Local communities’
ability to develop neighbourhood plans is welcome, and I am fortunate
that in my constituency rafts of people have come together to try to
face the challenges head on and to take advantage of the opportunities
to shape the future of their towns and villages. In Aireborough,
Jennifer Kirby is leading a group that has provided workshops and
involved children in the future that they want for their town. Parish
councils in Horsforth and Rawdon are engaging actively with residents
and their
views.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071756000069" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0001.htm#13071756000069">The
feedback I am receiving is united. People complain that despite their
work, the local authority’s five-year land supply supersedes
everything they are doing. It has sent applications for thousands of
new houses to the 
<?notus-xml column=245?>inspector for approval. If that plan did not have to be approved by the
inspector, I wonder what the real figure would be. I suggest that it
would probably be far more realistic.</hs_Para>

speak to are anxious about the green belt in our area. An urban
constituency such as mine values its green belt, which helps us to
identify our separate towns and villages. We are in danger of creating
urban sprawl. We have heard from other hon. Members that developers are
going to the inspector, and that is happening in my constituency.
Developers have taken applications for some of our precious green areas
to the inspector, and I hope that they will be turned down so that
local people have time to determine where houses should
be.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071756000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0001.htm#13071756000071">One
parish councillor said to me that he is worried that nothing decided at
parish level can change the decision made by those at unitary level,

need to address the problem urgently, because local people are rightly
getting angry. Let us give local people the real power that we
promised. Let us stop the developers thinking that they can do what
they like, and let us seriously look at abolishing the inspectorate, so
that we can even the playing field and tip planning towards having far
more
localism.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13071756000180" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0001.htm#13071756000180">10.10

because it had not realised that dementia patients might need nursing
care and there was no provision for any nurses. The application
reassured us that we could be relaxed about the flooding issue
because—I am not making this up—it was a high-rise
building, and therefore, in case of flooding, residents would be able
to reach higher ground. The application was dismissed locally but
overturned by the inspectorate. I give that example not only because it

is not what the process should be about. It completely devalues the
faith that people have in the planning system.</hs_Para>

want to highlight a particular area called Harpur Hill on the outskirts
of Buxton. Harpur Hill has approximately 900 to 1,000 houses, and
applications are swirling around to more or less double the size of
that small area. The residents association, which is headed up by a
couple of my constituents, Ken Greenway and Pam Reddy, is really
concerned. It sees the applications being refused, and then granted by
the Planning Inspectorate, and it is wondering how some sense of
proportion can be introduced. It is not saying “No
houses”, it just wants a proportionate number of houses in the
area, because the infrastructure cannot cope with those huge
numbers.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert) made some
excellent suggestions, and I would agree with all of them, but we have
a gap, which is not being helped with in High Peak. I grant that the
local council has delayed the introduction of its local
plan—wrongly, in my view—and a window of opportunity has
been created. Developers are jumping through that window with great
enthusiasm. They are putting in speculative applications for greenfield
sites that are being granted by the inspectorate. That is creating what
many people see as a free-for-all in the High Peak. The residents
association in Harpur Hill has seen that going off, and it is concerned
that the problem will come knocking on its
door.</hs_Para>

am asking for a sense of proportion, which is what a local plan should
bring, using local people and local councillors. However, it is not
there in High Peak, and developers are making the best of that. Giving
parish councils more say is an excellent idea. In Chapel-en-le-Frith,
the parish council has now said that it will object to all applications
because it is the only voice it has, even though it is not being
listened to. I would like the Minister to give me some assurance that I
can go back to my residents and say, “Yes, we are listening, we
do understand this.” The way it is at the moment, it is just not
working. The High Peak is a fantastically beautiful area and I can
understand that people want to live there, but at the moment it seems
to be open season on development on greenfield sites, which I do not
think is
right.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-17?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_17_PT_1/B21EB31AB5A4F156B64E59557126B84163E3C554" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="17 July 2013">Wednesday

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T10:18:53"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Minister for listening to concerns raised by many colleagues about
proposals to reform the laws on permitted development. It would have
been absolutely wrong for the Government to remove people’s
right to object to plans that would have an impact on their homes, and
I am very pleased that he managed to find an alternative that would
both encourage non-contentious extensions and preserve the
all-important right to object. I wanted to put that on the
record.</hs_Para>

debate today because I fear that we are losing sight of the huge
emphasis that many of us in Parliament placed on localism before the
election. Local authorities have been stripped of authority over such a
long time and to such an extent that more often than not, even on
absolutely local issues, they are simply overruled by the
centre.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T10:13:09"></hs_TimeCode>

recognise that there has been some rowing back on that since the
election. As has been said, there is great potential in neighbourhood
plans, for instance. However, we cannot say with any real conviction
that our planning system is genuinely local, despite the noises that we
all made to our constituents before the
election<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T10:19:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071756000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0001.htm#13071756000089">I
know that the Minister will make the point that there is a real and
urgent need for new homes, and that is obviously right—I do not
think that anyone will argue with that—but before we give up for
ever our precious green spaces, I would simply encourage him to
acknowledge that the reason why we are not seeing new homes is not the
planning system. Vast tracts of land are available for development but
lying idle. There are 250,000 plots in the south-east alone. That is in
addition to 31,000 acres of brownfield land. All could be developed
now. It is worth pointing out also that roughly 90% of applications are
successful; they go through. The problem is not a lack of permissions.
It is more likely to be, as we have heard, a lack of access to finance.
Therefore, even if we were simply to rip up the planning system, we
probably would not see a net increase in development. We would simply
see more development in the wrong places—in the most
unneighbourly
places<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T10:20:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071756000090" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0001.htm#13071756000090">As
a rule, it must make sense to have a strong brownfield-first approach,
and that should be crystal clear in planning law. We might even want to
look at the 
<?notus-xml column=249?>US, where there is a tax bias in favour of developing brownfield sites
and against developing greenfield sites. That is the case in a country
that is far less compressed than our

Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs. If I were asked to
design a body with the specific goal of alienating and enraging
communities, I do not think I could do better. It is a remote,
virtually invisible, unelected body that simply tramples over local
wishes and opinion. Even where local people are absolutely united and
backed up by their councillors, they are still routinely overruled. I

Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert) said, not
least about abolition of the Planning Inspectorate, which seems to be
one of the biggest excuses that I have come across in my term as a
Member. Currently, Warwick district council is consulting on a proposed
local plan, which has met with widespread disapproval from local
residents, and for valid reasons—whether pollution, gridlock or
infrastructure—that need to be taken into account. I appreciate
that planning is difficult, but we need to engage more with our local
residents on planning and collaborate with them and local parishes and
town councils to ensure that they feel ownership of a plan in the

have a particularly difficult constituency in terms of planning: 80% of
it is an area of outstanding natural beauty; I have 10 historic market
towns that are absolute gems—if there were a listed town status,
all 10 would qualify—and I have the highest number of listed
houses as a proportion of the housing stock of anywhere outside London.
I therefore want to make three specific points to my hon. Friend the
Minister<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T10:24:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071756000098" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0001.htm#13071756000098">First,
I did praise the national planning policy framework when it came out,
but I had one specific reservation, which has come back to bite our
communities. As the Minister knows, one case in my constituency is now
to be reviewed in the courts. It concerns the 20% historical
under-provision. This is grossly unfair. It is quite reasonable to have
a five-year land bank, but my council has a very good record of
bringing forward developments. It has a very good new homes bonus rate.
To impose an additional 20%, on top of the five-year land supply, is
completely unreasonable and unsustainable. If we are not careful, we
will lose those 10 historic market towns—we will lose those
little gems that we have in this
country<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T10:24:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071756000099" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0001.htm#13071756000099">Secondly,
we must have a mechanism by which infrastructure is provided before
large-scale developments are built. There is a lot of sewage flooding
in my constituency. Thames Water’s performance in my
constituency is woeful. We had a case in which sewage flooded an
existing community, and because the system could not put sufficient
weight on Thames Water’s representations, another 150 houses
were given permission right next to where there was already sewage
flooding<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T10:25:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071756000100" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0001.htm#13071756000100">My
third point relates to solar farms. We have been assailed in the
Cotswolds by applications for solar farms recently. I do not object to
that necessarily, although there is no guidance to say what the impact
should be on an area of outstanding natural beauty. Suffice it to say
that there is no mechanism in the planning system for the community to
benefit from these solar farms. They would be classed as large
developments if they were housing developments. They are between 20 and
50 acres and involve many millions of pounds for the developer. If it
were a residential development, the local community would get
considerable benefit through the infrastructure levy, yet there is no
such mechanism in relation to solar
farms<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T10:26:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071756000101" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0001.htm#13071756000101">I
therefore say this to the Minister. Let localism work. Let the local
councils decide where to put these houses. In the Cotswolds, the number
of permissions granted is now three times the historical 10-year rate.

this have taken into account where the thing is going and have gone

same is happening with neighbourhood planning. We want to build on
neighbourhood planning, integrating it more clearly into the planning
system and building on the success of places such as Thame in
Oxfordshire, where 775 new homes have been planned for. We would like

the points he raised in his previous interventions, it is not the case
that our housing need chiefly derives from the levels of immigration
over the past decade, of which I am as critical as he. Immigration
explains only about 40% of the formation of new households; the
remainder is explained by the fact that we are all getting older and
not dying as quickly as we used to.

in a constrained urban borough such as Cheltenham, almost all the

other things for which people have a need. Green space is good for
local food production, physical and mental health, and for

Does he agree that the duty to co-operate is significant not only
because it is the first time we have sought to have such a duty on a

will move on to trying to persuade my right hon. and hon.
Friends—I seek not to persuade the hon. Lady—that
localism is not dead but in gestation. At the heart of the Localism Act
is the idea that control is gained from having a plan. A plan that
fulfils the criteria of the national planning policy framework puts
those with the plan in charge, and their decisions will not be
overturned. Decisions might be challenged, but no challenge will be
supported by the Planning Inspectorate. It all rests on having a plan,
and the difficulty faced by many hon. Members and their communities is
where no plan is in place. That is why so much of the discussion has
focused on the question of what weight can be attached to emerging
plans<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T10:50:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071756000146" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0001.htm#13071756000146">I
want to share with my right hon. and hon. Friends the difficulty of the
position that some of them want the Government to take, which is the
suggestion that an emerging plan should immediately be given
substantial weight in any decision on a planning application. That
could simply create the problem that every community in the country
that wanted to oppose a development might start the process of working
up a neighbourhood or local plan and then take their own sweet time
about 
<?notus-xml column=257?>it. That would immediately create an opportunity for communities to
block all development by simply saying that they were engaged in a
plan-making
process.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071756000147" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0001.htm#13071756000147">That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T10:51:01"></hs_TimeCode>
is why there must be a sense that a plan has reached a relatively
advanced stage before it can be given substantial weight. Such a
position has not been established by policy or Government, but over
many years in the courts, as has been pointed out. I know that many
people here think that an easy solution would be simply to abolish the
inspectorate, but I say to them that all such decisions would then be
taken by judges in courts. Developers will not stop challenging local
decisions that they think do not accord with local or national
policies. They will simply challenge them in the courts, at much
greater cost to the taxpayer and, I suspect, to the not much greater
contentment of

local plan to the Secretary of State. Some 800 communities in this
country are now engaged in some stage of neighbourhood planning, and
several hundred of them have already had their plan areas registered.

my concern is that he seems to be giving the impression that everything

so important for people to embrace—he believes in that as much
as I do—are being undermined, because people will walk away if
they think that the inspectorate will overturn those plans. It is
therefore a mistake entirely to dismiss the idea of giving stronger
guidance. Unless people have confidence that they can take such

Brooks Newmark</B> (Braintree) (Con):</Member> I am grateful for the
opportunity to speak on the important issue of UK policy on the
International Commission on Missing Persons. The debate is particularly
timely as last week we commemorated the 18th anniversary of the
Srebrenica massacre, in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were killed in what
was declared to be the worst crime on European soil since the second
world war. At the memorial service of that anniversary, 409 newly
identified bodies were buried, giving families some closure on the
grief that they have been living with for almost two
decades<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T11:00:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071759000003" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0001.htm#13071759000003">Last
year, I travelled to Bosnia on Project Maja with Baroness Warsi and,
while in Sarajevo, I visited the International Commission on Missing
Persons. I was struck by that unique and highly effective organisation,
which has revolutionised the international community’s approach
to addressing the issue of missing persons. In doing so, it has made a
genuine contribution to justice and peace building in the Balkans and
elsewhere in the world. Since that visit, I have wondered what the UK
Government can do to support its vital work, and I am grateful for this
opportunity to put some questions to the Minister directly
today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T11:01:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071759000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0001.htm#13071759000004">By
way of background, it may be helpful if I first offer Members a brief
introduction to the organisation. President Clinton founded the ICMP in
1996 as an organisation to clarify the fate of missing persons
following the Balkans war. Confronting the scale of the problem, the
ICMP developed state-of-the-art DNA identification technology and has
helped to resolve 70% of missing persons cases from the 1990s conflict,
including 7,000 of the 8,100 missing from Srebrenica. Such
unparalleled results provide the means to end the desperate uncertainty
that families have endured. The ICMP has also provided irrefutable
evidence to the domestic and international courts that heard war crimes
cases, including those of Karadzic and Mladic. For the first time in
history, DNA evidence is being used to convict the architects of
genocide.</hs_Para>

distinctive expertise that the ICMP brings to this field is reflected
in the growing contribution that it is making beyond the Balkans. This
year, having just opened up offices in Libya, the ICMP received funds
from the UK, which were announced by the Prime Minister during his
visit to Tripoli. The organisation has already started DNA testing, and
within just one month it identified 100 victims of Gaddafi’s
forces.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13071759000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0001.htm#13071759000006"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T11:03:19"></hs_TimeCode>The
ICMP has also been working in Iraq for several years. Sadly, it is
clear that, in the future, Syria will also require similar assistance.
Indeed, as the conflict in Syria continues to rage on, it should be
noted that according to information received by the ICMP, at least
28,000 people are thought to be missing. As we look to the future and
hope for a peace settlement, I would like to ensure that the issue of
missing persons is addressed in the context of any future peace
agreement, just as it was in the Dayton peace accords that ended the
conflicts in the former Yugoslavia. Furthermore, it is important that
action is taken now to work with the thousands of families who are
displaced in Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon and Iraq because of the conflict
and who have missing relatives, so that when the conflict ends,
measures will 
<?notus-xml column=261?>already have been taken to address an issue that will figure prominently
in rebuilding Syria and restoring peace to the
region<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T11:04:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071759000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0001.htm#13071759000007">In
addition to its post-conflict work, the ICMP has assisted Chile,
Colombia and South Africa with addressing missing persons cases
following human rights violations, and it has also assisted in the
aftermath of natural disasters in Thailand and the Philippines and
Hurricane Katrina in the United States. In total, the ICMP has
identified the remains of more than 19,000 individuals in the past
decade<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T11:04:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071759000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0001.htm#13071759000008">Having
learned about the widespread and vital work of this organisation, I now
come to the crux of the matter, which is that the future of this
important organisation is in jeopardy. I believe that the UK Government
can do more to support its future. However, this is a matter not of
funding but of diplomatic support. Having achieved what it was
established to do in the western Balkans, the ICMP is gradually winding
down its assistance in that region. Yet all of its programmes worldwide
rely, with varied effectiveness, on a legal status recognised in a few
states in the Balkans and a headquarters in Sarajevo. That is not a
sustainable basis for its
future<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T11:05:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071759000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0001.htm#13071759000009">The
ICMP is not incorporated under the domestic law of any one country, and
it is not a non-governmental organisation. Its lack of formal
international legal status hampers its ability to carry out its work
and, as a result, it was forced to close its office in Colombia and its
efforts in Libya and Iraq are being put at unnecessary risk. A draft
legal framework was negotiated by the US, the UK, the Netherlands and
Denmark in 2004, within which ICMP could operate, but the document was
never concluded, leaving the ICMP without a permanent, internationally
recognised
status<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T11:06:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13071759000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0001.htm#13071759000010">So<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T11:04:33"></hs_TimeCode>
what can the UK do? I was initially keen for the UK to take the lead on
supporting the ICMP and for the organisation to be based in the UK, but
I have been persuaded that the logical place for it to have a
sustainable headquarters would be in The Hague, which is keen to
provide the ICMP with a home. As the seat of many international justice
institutions, including the International Criminal Court, The Hague
would be an ideal permanent base for the ICMP. However, the Dutch
condition is that the ICMP’s legal status is put on a more
sustainable footing, allowing it to operate in the Netherlands, and in
the often dangerous countries in which it works, with the immunities it
needs to protect its database of genetic information, some of which is
voluntarily provided by family members of the missing.</hs_Para>

Dutch Foreign Minister is prepared to lead a process aimed at securing
that status, but only if he has reassurance that the other partner
countries will support his efforts. This is where the UK Government
could do more. To assure the future of the ICMP and to secure its work,
it is vital that the UK gives a clear signal of support for the Dutch
initiative. I therefore urge the Minister to make the UK’s
support clear, thereby making a decisive contribution to securing the
organisation’s future for the benefit of
all<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T11:08:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071759000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0001.htm#13071759000012">The
Foreign Secretary visited the ICMP last October, which was an excellent
signal of support, and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has been
actively working with the Netherlands ever since to resolve questions 
<?notus-xml column=262?>over the ICMP’s future status. As a matter of principle, I am no
advocate of tying the UK to permanent financial commitments with
international organisations, but the fact that ICMP has not had the
luxury of permanent funding, and that it has innovated and managed
costs effectively at every stage in its history, underscores another
critical reason for me to support the organisation. Furthermore, having
developed a broad range of programmes and the world’s largest
human identification laboratory, the ICMP has a budget of a mere
£5 million, which means that its endeavours to alleviate
suffering around the
world<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T11:09:21"></hs_TimeCode> are very
cost-effective. It does not seek any permanent funding commitments.
Instead, a permanent legal status will enable it to build on an
exceptional track record of success in raising voluntary
contributions.</hs_Para>

is clear that an effective response to the tragedy of missing persons
caused by conflict is, and will remain, a fundamental element of
successful conflict prevention and post-conflict resolution. The UK has
a direct interest in ensuring that present and future international
peace-building strategies include missing persons as an integral
element. To assure the ICMP’s future, it is now time for the UK
to take a leadership role in encouraging other states to support the
Dutch initiative to give the ICMP a permanent
status<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T11:10:10"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T11:10:04"></hs_TimeCode>.

idea of giving the ICMP a permanent legal status and on what the FCO

Missing Persons. I know that it is an issue in which he takes a very
keen interest, and with my colleague Baroness Warsi he has visited
Sarajevo to see the ICMP’s incredible operation at first hand. I

know that my hon. Friend shares my view that often when conflict and
violence end, our attention is drawn away too quickly to another crisis
and other parts of the world. However, for many people a conflict
cannot truly end until they know the fate of their missing loved ones.
Those loved ones are parents, wives, husbands or 
<?notus-xml column=263?>children, who are often civilians and not combatants and who were
separated from their families by the chaos of war,
who disappeared while in detention or who simply did not return home

the House may be aware, this week saw the burials of another 409 newly

than 6,000 victims of that massacre have been identified and 6,000

longing—at last have a chance to mourn their dead and to give
them the dignity of a decent

as my hon. Friend quite rightly pointed out, those events, while
solemn, could not have taken place without the ceaseless and vital work
of the ICMP. As he also rightly said, the ICMP has identified
approximately 16,000 people from the conflicts in the former
Yugoslavia, including 85% of those reported missing after the fall of
Srebrenica. The ICMP has also responded to requests for documentation
and expert testimony from international and domestic courts on matters
relating to serious international
crimes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T11:13:37"></hs_TimeCode>. Without
the ICMP, many families in the former Yugoslavia would have been unable
to gain any form of
closure<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T11:13:48"></hs_TimeCode>, and
without that vital closure the feelings of injustice and resentment
would continue to build, fuelling ethnic tensions and making
reconciliation all but impossible, particularly for

is why the Government have played an active role in championing the
ICMP’s work, alongside our broader conflict prevention,
peace-building and international justice policies. We are firmly
committed to the ICMP, just as we are committed to challenging impunity
and ensuring accountability for the most serious international crimes.
We are clear that where there is no accountability, there is no

peace, reconciliation or

it is of course saddening that the ICMP’s work continues to be

played, and will continue to play, in identifying many missing people
in places such as Iraq, Kosovo, Libya and—my hon. Friend made
this point forcibly—in Syria. It is clear that in the aftermath
of the terrible conflict that is raging in Syria, Syria will face many
challenges to achieving peaceful transition, recovery and
reconstruction.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T11:15:27"></hs_TimeCode> UK will

Friend will accept that it is for the Syrian people to agree the
make-up of a transitional Government who can win the consent of all
Syrians, and to decide how transition will take place,
including—importantly—the future role of the ICMP in
Syria. However, we believe that the ICMP’s expertise will be

is in recognition of its work that the Government have provided
consistent political and financial support to the ICMP for a number of

addition to contributions made through the European Union, the UK
Government have directly provided more than £3 million in

the Minister for everything that he is saying. However, it is not only
a financial commitment that the ICMP seeks, because frankly I could go
round to a bunch of my friends and raise £5 million to keep the
ICMP going. The ICMP’s frustration is at the lack of political
will by the major countries—including even the United States,
which originally formed the ICMP—to give it permanent legal
status. That is what the ICMP needs, and I wonder what the Government
will do to assist it in giving it the permanent legal status it needs,
because that is what its future depends on. The clock is ticking, the
ICMP’s centre will close down this year and if the ICMP does not
gain permanent legal status we will not be able to help families, for
example in Syria, who will have missing persons and who will need the
support that the ICMP provides.</hs_Para>

Friend; he is not only visionary but prescient, because I am about to
address exactly the point that he has just raised. He is absolutely
right that it is important to fund the future work of the ICMP through
projects, but the ICMP does not just need financial support. The ICMP
is keen to secure a legal status and move its headquarters. Despite the
success of its projects, we also understand—again, this was a
point that he correctly made—that ICMP programmes have been
thwarted because of its current legal status. That is why it is all the

am delighted to have secured this debate on the provision of money
transfer account services by banks and their impact on Britain’s
ethnic minority communities in particular. Remittance plays a vital and
complementary role in helping to lift millions of people out of poverty
across the world, and it plays a vital role in ensuring that, as well
as our commitment to aid, we engage the public in giving to their loved
ones, who are often on the verge of poverty and would not qualify for
development aid. This is a vital debate because we need to consider how
we support individuals to give to family members across the

in remote areas of the world. It helps save lives in the Indian

other places, especially during times of crisis such as Cyclone Sidr in
Bangladesh a few years ago and the earthquake and floods in Pakistan.

will focus on the recent decision that has propelled us into calling
for this debate. Barclays made the decision to withdraw banking
facilities from small and medium-sized community-based money transfer
agencies, which provide low-cost, legitimate routes for sending money

difficult for mainstream money exchange and money transfer companies
that do not have networks, agents or structures to get assistance to

signed a letter, and I know that the all-party group on Somaliland and
Somalia has also made representations to the Government. MPs and 
<?notus-xml column=267?>parliamentarians from both sides of the House, and many other people,
have raised the alarm bell with the Government. That highlights our
deep concern about how decisions that have been made in the past, not
just by Barclays but by other banks such as HSBC, to remove banking
facilities that are affordable for hard-pressed families who are trying
to get support to other parts of the world, have been supported rather
than punished. We should encourage people to give, and I hope that the

to the <I>Financial Times</I>, more than 250 money transfer companies
are now facing closure following the decision by Barclays to withdraw
the service. Other banks have already withdrawn it, so the suggestion
that those small and medium-sized companies could go elsewhere is
nonsense. We need to ensure that the decision of those banks does not
send a signal to other banks that there is something wrong with such
businesses and that other banks should not do business with them, which
is essentially what has happened. That is the insidious conclusion that
is being drawn at the moment. Allegations are being made that those
businesses, many of which are in our constituencies, are engaged in
activity that is not
legal.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071766000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0001.htm#13071766000012">Barclays<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T14:35:44"></hs_TimeCode>

should consider how to assist Barclays and other companies that need to
clean up operations where there are problems. If that 1% is a problem,
assistance should be provided to address that problem rather than
involving the 99%, in the case of Barclays, that do not pose a problem.
If that logic were applied to the banking sector, for instance, we
would not have a banking sector left. I ask the banking sector to have
some empathy and to think about what the consequences would have been
for it if, during the financial crisis, all companies in the sector had
had to be shut down just because there were certain bad

asking Barclays—I do not believe this is an unreasonable
request—to extend the date from August by another six months to
give the Government, the regulatory authorities and the Minister the
breathing space to bring people together, including the British Bankers
Association, the banks and interested parties such as the money

than $3.2 billion of remittance a year is sent from the UK, and

more than the total global international development budget. We must
act internationally in concert with our American partners. The decision

<?notus-xml column=268?>the decision by UK banks such as Barclays to stop remittance facilities.
Frankly, the companies have nothing to do with what has happened in the

we do not find a way to address the problem, the risk is enormous,
because there will be no legitimate ways for people to send money to
remote parts of the world. Of course, there is virtually no way for
people to get assistance to countries such as Somalia through a
legitimate route. We need a constructive way forward, and I hope the
Minister can explain how his Department and officials will work with
the banking sector to develop an industry-wide solution so that we can
ensure that the remittance and money transfer industries are
strengthened in light of the crisis, rather than
destroyed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071766000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0001.htm#13071766000017">I
also hope that the Minister will consider that if banking facilities to
money transfer agencies end, what is likely to happen is what used to
happen before a regulated mechanism was in place. On the whole, people
who are not wealthy want cheap and affordable means to get assistance
to their loved ones, particularly in times of desperation and crisis,
such as when a family member has died and money needs to be sent
quickly for burials and associated costs, or when there is an urgent
health care emergency, likely or actual conflict or a humanitarian
emergency, as was the case in Somalia and the rest of east Africa in
2011 and as is likely to happen in future. If there is no legitimate
route to send money, there is a major risk that the industry will be
driven underground and that clandestine mechanisms will be used to get
money to family members. If that happens in the billions of pounds, we
will not be providing remitters with the back-up, support and legal
mechanisms to send money safely to their loved ones. It will also mean
that some countries are unlikely to be able to monitor the amount of
money flowing into their economy, leading to inflationary
pressures.</hs_Para>

absolutely right. The amounts of money are often small. People work
hard to make a living and provide a bit of support. I know that because
many of my constituents tell me stories about how they are supporting
the education of distant relatives or immediate family members by
sending them money every month. During Ramadan, which we are in right
now, people have a duty to give charity, or zakat. They want to give it
to people they know who are poorer, and not through charitable
organisations, where administration costs are high compared with direct
giving. There are many occasions on which people give small amounts of
money. For example, the Muslim

giving during the month of Ramadan alone.</hs_Para>

about profit as much as it is about anything else. We need clarity on
the criteria that Barclays and other banks have used to stop providing
banking facilities.</hs_Para>

depressing that, unfortunately, the banking sector seems to have
learned nothing from the past few years. Small community-based
businesses are being hurt while they are trying to run decent
businesses and support people. They should come together to consider
how to address some of the underlying problems. We understand that
there are grave concerns in the banking system about being fined by the
US authorities. It is right that we should support the banking sector
in ensuring that their due diligence processes are done, but that
cannot be an excuse to shut down smaller companies just because they
provide competition.</hs_Para>

on quickly to a few final points so that others can speak. Somalia
presents a unique problem: it does not have a banking sector. That
means not only that Somalia will be affected when remittance flows
stop, but that humanitarian aid organisations such as Oxfam will lose
the ability to send money to the region. Some 40% of people in Somalia
who depend on remittance would be affected by that decision. Last year,
the Somali 
<?notus-xml column=270?>authorities said that about $2 billion, or one third of the
country’s GDP, is channelled to Somalia through small money
transfer agencies.</hs_Para>

has come out of a conflict that went on for a long time and cost many
lives. It relies on the Somali diaspora around the world, who are
working hard to rebuild Somalia and Somaliland. This decision would
cripple the country. We cannot afford to let that happen, not least
because it is in our interest to have a stable, prosperous and
effective state in Somalia and Somaliland. That is what my
constituents, many of whom are from Somaliland, want. I hope that the
Minister will see the connection between this decision and its effect
on undermining our aid and peace-building efforts in countries such as
Somalia.</hs_Para>

could be said, and the Minister may have been told, that this is not as
much of a problem for other countries that have a banking sector, the
reality is—as he will know from his experience and background,
as I do—that in remote places such as the Indian subcontinent,
where we have our origins, during floods and in areas where there is no
proper infrastructure and no proper roads, getting money to people is
difficult. The banking sector is not localised enough. Banks such as
HSBC might call themselves the world’s local bank, but they are
not local enough. Our response must address the fact that it is
impossible to get money to people, in particular at times of crisis, in
countries throughout Africa, where there are still major infrastructure
problems, and in many Asian countries, so that the banking
sector—Barclays in particular—does not fob the Government
off by saying, “Well, there are plenty of other operators
available,” or, “The Government own a couple of banks,
why don’t they to do it?” We need an industry-wide
solution that is constructive and that safeguards the remittance
industry and companies providing remittance services at low
cost<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T14:50:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071766000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0001.htm#13071766000030">I
have a few final points. On competition, I hope that the Government and
the regulatory authorities will look closely at what is really going
on. To what extent is this about trying to respond to the fact that
these organisations are giving—to use a metaphor—the
larger money transfer agencies a run for their money? To what extent is
this about the regulatory pressures? I believe that to some extent it
is. Where the regulatory concerns are legitimate and genuine, what can
the Government and the regulatory authorities do so that we have a set
of criteria for those companies to fulfil? Barclays and the regulators
certainly have not provided any criteria or explained why banking
facilities are being withdrawn. That is the least that these businesses
should expect when they employ more than 3,500 people here in the UK
and provide desperately needed assistance, not to mention trading
opportunities between our country and developing
countries<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T14:51:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071766000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0001.htm#13071766000031">I
hope that the Minister will be able to look broadly at those
interconnected issues. I have been told by his fellow Minister in the
House of Lords that Barclays is merely making a commercial decision,
but we have a responsibility to developing countries, where remittances
support millions of people, taking pressure off our international aid
budget. We also have a responsibility, if the sector is pretty much
eliminated through those decisions, to ensure that money transfers and
flows are not driven underground. How do the Minister and his
colleagues in the Department for International Development 
<?notus-xml column=271?>intend to address this? Will he work with our American allies on an
international solution, because we recognise that they are calling the
shots on fines<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T14:52:53"></hs_TimeCode>?

we speak, thousands of people are signing petitions; the diaspora

him—because we do not want to return to a debate in years to
come and hear that, because of the decision today, many of the agencies
stopped operating and people ended up being exploited. In some cases,
money might be stolen—we have seen past examples of
that—because the sector is not regulated at all, and in some
cases remittances might end up in the hands of the wrong people, such
as terrorists, and that would be a dereliction of duty on our part. The

a money service business called Sterling Currency Exchange Ltd and is
the general secretary of the remittance association of the United

it no longer wished to operate in the sector. I worked with Shamshad to
get the bank to change its mind, but to no avail. He and I then worked
together to find an account with another bank, again to no avail. As
Shamshad pointed out, we tried the Royal Bank of Scotland and NatWest,
both funded through the public purse and in receipt of much public
money, but they too refused him. He now has to operate his business in

our own Department for International Development and aid departments in

investment in small businesses, self-employed projects and other areas.

any action taken by the banks in the UK in closing accounts of money
transfer agents will have a disproportionate effect on the UK. We are
facing a serious problem. I do not want to underline too heavily any
criticism of Barclays and HSBC. It has not been said so far that
Barclays was fined $300 million in the United States earlier this year

people, but it could be forced underground and people would have to pay
much higher rates. Furthermore, consolidation may be sensible in some

with higher charges and a worse service. I urge the Minister to take

are also a complement to aid. There are two crucial issues. This is not
only about my constituents; it is also very much in the UK national
interest to find  a solution to this problem. Remittances play
a crucial alongside our aid moneys. In the end, we want to graduate
countries out of aid and ensure that they can stand on their own two

the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow said, Somaliland and Somalia face

do not think that anyone would disagree that we want safe and secure
transfer methods for senders and recipients. There are also legitimate
concerns about money laundering, terrorist financing and other issues,
although only a small amount of remittances are affected by such
activities, and the vast majority end up in  the destinations
where they belong.
However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T15:14:09"></hs_TimeCode>, we
really could be jumping from the frying pan into the fire. We could up
the security risk and end up with channels for transferring money that
are not policed or regulated in the same way as existing channels.
Individual constituents could be ripped off, as they are forced to use
more expensive or less secure methods of sending
remittances —indeed, there is the possibility of theft
increasing  and money going missing—rather than the
reputable organisations that already operate in this field.

the Member for Brent North (Barry Gardiner) and I secured a meeting

notwithstanding the criticisms and concerns that have been raised, a
number of which Barclays must answer further questions on. To be fair,
however, Barclays was constructive, and it did not just want to shrug

was therefore concerned when Barclays told us that it had written to

if Western Union were to benefit from the decision to withdraw services

not beautiful in this case; small is vulnerable, and small businesses

international co-operation, to exert pressure back from the European
side. Britain is more significant than many European countries in such
matters, but we should not ignore the potential to raise with the US
authorities, at all levels, the effect of their behaviour globally on
communities in the UK, in the wider European context and worldwide.

hard-working people who earn very ordinary amounts of money. They send
very ordinary amounts: £50, £100 or £150. They do

People<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T15:30:04"></hs_TimeCode> are right
to feel that way, because it appears on the one hand that Barclays and
on the other that the Government do not care. The Minister says,
“This is a commercial matter and we are not going to get
involved.” However, Barclays, without giving reasons to people
in small money exchange firms, is simply saying, “Sorry, we are
no longer prepared to deal with you.” It is not saying that
those people have done anything irregular or illegal; it is saying only
that the facility is no longer available. That is terrible.</hs_Para>

a wider context, we have been criticising the banks for their failure
to support small and medium-sized enterprises; yet it seems in this
context that the Government are not prepared to get off their seat and
do anything to help the poorest communities globally and the people in
Britain who are trying to transfer money, which, as has been said, is a
larger amount than the international development assistance that is
transferred from states to countries and people in the poorest
countries in the world. Instead, the Government say, “This is
nothing to do with us. This is simply a commercial arrangement.”
I am sorry, but that is not good enough.</hs_Para>

congratulating
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T15:31:22"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Rushanara Ali) on securing this
important and very timely debate: we are coming up to a period when the
clock is ticking and those who might be affected are facing the
prospect of significant anxiety and a change in the circumstances. It
is an incredibly important point that she and others who have

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T15:32:19"></hs_TimeCode> realities of
internationalism these days and the crises that some families can
encounter, the ability for people to support their family is part and
parcel of the warp and weft of much of society. The role that
legitimate small and medium-sized remittance and money transfer
companies play should not be ignored; it is absolutely crucial.
However, it is no surprise, given what has been happening in financial
services in the past couple of years, that a lot of the agenda of the
anti-money laundering reforms to deal with particular concerns is 
<?notus-xml column=281?>beginning now to bite. As
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T15:32:50"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Cardiff West (Kevin Brennan) commented, it is more than
ironic that it tends to be the smaller firms that end up being punished
most of all, when the anti-money laundering reforms that we require and
some of the changes need to be made particularly by the larger
organisations. They are the ones where, in my view, there is a
significant risk.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Ilford South (Mike Gapes) made a pertinent
point in the speech preceding mine about the fact that we should not
see this only as a commercial matter—we should not take a
laissez-faire approach and let the market decide—because
ultimately, regulators and public policy are very much part and parcel
of what is happening here. It is also not only a UK question, but a
global matter, which requires leadership from UK Government authorities
to do something now to sort out the problem.</hs_Para>

course, it is vital that strong steps are taken to deal with the risks
of money laundering. Nobody is arguing against that, but we cannot turn
a blind eye to the impact that crude, blanket attitudes to these issues
might have on real lives and businesses. We do not want to find
ourselves with perverse consequences occurring in the endeavour to
solve a very real problem. As
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T15:34:20"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow said, particularly in this month
of Ramadan, when so many of my constituents and hers are making

points that many hon. Members have made about Somalia and Somaliland
are very relevant. There is the need to ensure that this is not seen
only as a Treasury concern, but as one that touches on policy questions
in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for
International Development. We need to see all those branches of
Government working together in co-ordination on the issue.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T15:35:07"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Rochdale (Simon Danczuk) made a number of strong points,
particularly on the dangers of ending up with a less competitive market
here, especially where fees and exchange rates would be higher for the
consumer and where access to those services is potentially at
risk.</hs_Para>

would be the last person to voice concern for some of the big banks on
this one. They can and should do much more, but it would not be right
simply to pin this on one banking institution, which might be at the
end of a queue on this issue. However, I would like the Minister to say
what conversations he has been having with Barclays bank, in
particular, about the imminent decision. To me, it seems not only that
a long-term problem must be resolved, but that we are facing an
immediate short-term crisis. Will the Minister address the discussions
with Barclays, in particular, about the grace period and the extent to
which there needs to be a different time frame to the approach being
taken?</hs_Para>

have to focus on solutions now, and it is important that we give the
Minister ample time to address those, so that we can cross-examine him
and scrutinise the Government’s attitude. I just want to raise a
number of points with him. Does he agree that it should be incumbent on
the banks, as well as the regulators, to tell the 
<?notus-xml column=282?>industry—those small firms—what due diligence,
improvements and audit checks they feel are necessary to overcome some
of the hurdles and concerns? They would be the first to want to put
beyond doubt any concerns that might exist about them.</hs_Para>

well as the Minister saying whether he has been able to talk to
Barclays, will he address the questions that go beyond the United
Kingdom? Clearly, the United States has a slightly different regulatory
attitude, which is impinging very much on the larger banks and Barclays
in particular. Therefore, we need to know what conversations have
happened so far and ought to be happening with the American regulators
and with the US Treasury Department and the State Department. Can we
have some co-ordination with those other authorities? We do not want to
see money laundering risks any more than the Americans do, but they
will also be facing their own problems internally in the United States
on some of these questions, because they are also a diverse society and
a diverse community. Can we align ourselves to ensure not only that we
have a gold standard of anti-money laundering practices, but that we do
not throw the baby out with the bathwater?</hs_Para>

conversations has the Minister had with the Department for
International Development and the Financial Conduct Authority? The FCA
is a brand-new regulator, which has been operating for several months.
It has a consumer remit and a competition remit. It seems to me that
the FCA needs to be firmly involved in the issue and that it may have
some expertise to bring to bear.</hs_Para>

solutions have involved guarantees from the state or some sort of
underwriting. Should the state-owned banks take that on their

do that in the short term. I am a little wary about the taxpayer ending

clearly, as my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T15:39:03"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow pointed out, the issue
cuts across our international aid and development policies in another
bit of the Government. We do not want to see Somalia, for example,
retrench in development terms because of something that has been
happening in another branch of the Government. I wonder what the
Minister’s attitude is to those aspects and, in particular, to
whether some aid agencies might be part and parcel of a solution in the
interim, until we get some of the regulatory issues ironed
out.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T15:33:15"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071766000105" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0002.htm#13071766000105">Can

I said, I want to give the Minister time to respond, so that we can
question him on policy. In summary, this cannot just be left as a
commercial decision. We cannot say, “We are walking away from

particular call on this matter.” It is not just a market
question. 
<?notus-xml column=283?>There is a downstream consequence from public policy, and it is

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T15:41:25"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Bethnal Green and Bow (Rushanara Ali) for securing this important
debate. We have had a number of discussions on this issue already, and
I look forward to continuing to have those discussions with her. I know
that this is a very important issue for her and for all of us in this
Chamber and beyond, and I welcome this opportunity to
respond.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071766000108" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0002.htm#13071766000108">This
issue is of concern to Ministers across Government and to hon. Members
on both sides of the House, because a healthy, functioning remittance
sector is crucial for the thousands of our constituents up and down the
country who use such services to send money
abroad<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T15:42:01"></hs_TimeCode>. If you
will allow me, Mr Bayley, I would like to speak for a moment about my
gran. My gran—my mother’s mother—has been
receiving remittances regularly for more than 50 years, since my
parents first arrived in our great country and settled, first, in
Rochdale. She continues to receive the benefit of remittances. When I
first visited her while I was growing up, one of the things that I
noticed was that she lives in a very remote village in Pakistan that
has no bank. I think that the nearest bank is at least 10 miles away.
She is unbanked. There were only a few remitters, at least to begin
with, many years ago, that could get money to my gran. I mention that
only to show that, at a very personal level, I do understand this issue
and how important it is in Britain and particularly to British
individuals such as myself, who are from an ethnic minority
background<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T15:42:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071766000109" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0002.htm#13071766000109">The
sector plays a crucial role in supporting the economies of all the
developing countries that have been mentioned today that receive these
funds. We all want to see a healthy remittance sector, but we also want
to see a legitimate remittance sector. Our banks and regulators have a
real responsibility to ensure that they are not inadvertently
facilitating any kind of criminal activity. That could be money
laundering, drug trafficking or the financing of terrorism, some of
which we have heard about today. All are activities that pose real
threats not just to UK citizens, but to global
security<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T15:43:36"></hs_TimeCode>. Of
course, there is a fine balance to be struck between managing those
risks and ensuring that essential services are still available to
families in the UK. I would like to reassure hon. Members that we are
committed to getting the balance right. This afternoon, I will set out
some of the steps that this Government are taking towards ensuring a
robust and sustainable remittance
sector<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T15:43:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071766000110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0002.htm#13071766000110">We
recognise the role of Government in effectively supervising and
regulating the money service business sector to help to drive up
standards in this area. Last year, we strengthened the Money Laundering
Regulations 2007, with a particular view to helping Her
Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, as the relevant regulator, to 
<?notus-xml column=284?>strengthen its supervision, and HMRC is making every attempt to close
down those businesses that are engaging in criminal activity and
tarnishing the sector as a whole. Last month, it worked closely with
the Metropolitan police and the Serious Organised Crime Agency to
target organised criminals operating in this sector. However, in the
longer term, proactive solutions must be found to avoid the need for
such action in the
future<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T15:44:47"></hs_TimeCode>. The best
way to achieve that is by creating a remittance sector in the UK that
is trusted by all stakeholders and with which all banks can feel

have spoken with several of the leading high street
banks—including, of course, Barclays—during the last few
days. Some have expressed important concerns on the structural features
of the sector and particularly on the issues surrounding transparency.
I can confirm that I am looking urgently into what measures the
Government might be able to take, and speaking to all relevant
authorities to look at what options are open to us to try to allay as
far as possible some of the concerns that those banks have
expressed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071766000112" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0002.htm#13071766000112"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T15:45:34"></hs_TimeCode>Separately,
work has already been under way for some time through Project Quaver,
led by HMRC and SOCA, on developing a healthy and sustainable sector.
That project brings together the Government, law enforcement,
regulators and industry to help banks and money service businesses to
understand the risks that come from abuse of this sector, and to
strengthen their
compliance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T15:46:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071766000113" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0002.htm#13071766000113">However,
we recognise that having effective anti-money laundering and
counter-terrorist financing procedures in place is not only essential
to preventing, detecting and disrupting illicit finance. They provide
the confidence for foreign investment and stable economic growth in
many of the developing countries that have been mentioned. Developing
effective regimes requires effective co-operation between the public
sector and the private sector to understand and mitigate the threat of
illicit finance, so under the UK presidency, the G8 has this year
committed to launch a public-private sector dialogue on illicit
finance, which will be held in Namibia in September of this year. That
will not only help to tackle the issue of robust regimes in the
traditional financial sectors, but address the opportunities and the
risks posed by new payment methods, such as mobile money services. By
bringing together private sector experts from around the world and
Ministers and officials, the dialogue will be a unique opportunity to
leverage expertise and drive reform that meets the specific needs that
countries face, particularly in sub-Saharan
Africa.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071766000114" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0002.htm#13071766000114"><B><Member ContinuationText="Stephen Doughty" PimsId="6001" UID="13071766000180" xid="1239" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0002.htm#13071766000180">Stephen

In the short term, the Government are committed to doing everything
that they can to minimise the impact on individuals and businesses in
the UK of any immediate changes in this market. I understand that
businesses in this sector will face challenges. That is why we are
committed to working with the banks, trade associations and money
service businesses to try to find solutions that do not mean extensive
business closures. However, the truth is that we do not know what the
full impact of some of the decisions that have been discussed here

that it is working with firms to manage the impact of its decision. He

from the large money transfer companies. I have not received any
representations from such companies. She also suggested—if I
understood her correctly—that the banks’ behaviour could
be anti-competitive. There is no evidence that banks are acting in
concert or are distorting competition. They appear to have acted in
accordance with their commercial interests and their desire to minimise
risk.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071766000140" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0002.htm#13071766000140">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T15:57:55"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T15:58:54"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Rochdale (Simon Danczuk) asked why larger
organisations, such as Western Union, are not affected by the decisions
of the banks and whether the banks would benefit from the withdrawal of
some services. The short answer to why some larger institutions are not
affected is that their internal compliance procedures are in many cases
similar to what the banks themselves adopt internally; in many cases,
they spend more resources on compliance and transparency issues, which
they are clearly in a better position to afford than smaller operators;
and in many cases they are regulated differently. All companies are
supervised by HMRC, but there is a difference between a company
registered with the FCA and one fully authorised with it, and banks
take that into
account<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T15:58:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071766000141" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0002.htm#13071766000141">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T15:58:54"></hs_TimeCode>

18,000 GW. We export approximately 4,000 GWh to England, but that
figure is due to grow because of the abundant opportunities provided by

Opportunities for green tourism in places such as Wales, which has a

political debate is the balance between growth and cuts to get down the
deficit, and we need to focus on growth, which means investment in
infrastructure. We need to get the right gauges for freight—from
Milford Haven, Swansea, Cardiff or Newport—and we need to move
around universal freight modules, which are ship-carried in many
instances, and energy from power stations, as my hon.
Friend<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T16:03:19"></hs_TimeCode>

future income from new energy sources in Wales.
There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T16:03:26"></hs_TimeCode> has been
some discussion of a barrage that might generate up to 16,500 GWh,
which would be 5% of UK energy, but the idea has clearly been kicked
into touch, partly by the European habitats directive.</hs_Para>

the Swansea Lagoon is a big issue in the local press. It could generate
some 400 GWh, which would be 0.1% of UK consumption and 2% of what the
barrage could produce. That is a relatively small level of production,
but it is big scheme in that it would take £650 million to
build, with its footprint extending from Swansea docks halfway to
Mumbles pier. The electricity produced would be enough for about
121,000 households, but it would be for the UK grid and not for Swansea
itself, which has about that many households. I am concerned,
therefore, that on balance the development is at least neutral in
tourism terms. We hope to become the UK city of culture in
2017—we are on the shortlist of four—and next year we
celebrate the 100th anniversary of Dylan Thomas’s birth. We have
high hopes for prosperity from cultural tourism in the emerging Swansea

well that there needs to be a balance between the value of the

that England is relatively densely populated and Wales relatively
sparsely, and that will be a key asset for our environmental tourism.
We want to think strategically, therefore, about where our energy
production is. With wind, there needs to be access up the Severn
estuary to the grid at Hinkley Point or Port Talbot, but there is less
of a case for pylons right into the centre of
Wales<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T16:06:13"></hs_TimeCode>. I respect
the fact that some of these issues are devolved, but we need a balance
because we are talking about a once-and-for-all change to our views and
to the value of our tourism. Once the infrastructure goes up it will

Wales produces about 27,300 GWh of energy, but that nets down to about
22,000 GWh because of inefficiencies in transmission. The issue of
energy loss is very important. We need to run a sophisticated and 
<?notus-xml column=291?>effective network, which pays due regard to environmental impacts and
therefore to the economic impacts on tourism. I am not putting to one
side the important subjective impacts on people’s everyday

back to the Swansea Lagoon, the Minister might want to comment on
whether an evaluation of the impacts on tourism has been done. The
construction phase would create discontinuity for retail and tourism.
If the sea bed was dug up—which it would be—to provide
some of the material for the wall, would that generate a lot of
contamination from industrial waste brought up with it? Is the visual
impact shown on the promotional literature accurate or slightly
misleading?</hs_Para>

local opinion makers, such as me, are under a lot of pressure from
people who have put the £800 down. All the risks are taken by
local people.

that when the tide went down there would be an unsightly view which
would block the iconic view from the town centre, Town Hill and the
Uplands. In addition, given that in future years we want to pursue the
idea of a Dylan Thomas festival on a scale more akin to that of Hay,
there is a question as to whether the perimeter of the

Cardiff—would impede future cruise-borne tourism in Swansea

know, is a bold and imaginative opportunity to have wind turbines
offshore. They would be about 12 km offshore, but the National Trust
has told me that the Germans normally want them 35 km offshore, so that
is an issue. This may sound strange, but, importantly, the biggest
harbour porpoise population in Britain is in that vicinity; one of a
similar size is in Cardigan bay. Apart from not wanting to disturb that
habitat, there is a question mark in relation to future environmental
tourism over whether that habitat might be so disturbed by the erection
of pylons that those breeding grounds move for ever. I want to make it

committed to putting frameworks in place to ensure that the much-needed
investment in infrastructure takes place, which is key to getting our
economy moving in the short term. The energy sector has the biggest
infrastructure programme in the UK, and many such projects are ready to

energy demand across the UK. The most recent figures—for
2011—show that it exported 13% of electricity generation to the
rest of Great Britain, and it has been even higher in recent years.

Paul Beresford</B> (Mole Valley) (Con):</Member> I am raising the
anonymous case of a small group of
parents—potentially—who started an adoption procedure
with Surrey county council at the same time. I am not happy with the
procedure, and nor are the individual set of parents who I will talk
about. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T16:30:30"></hs_TimeCode>I must
say at the very beginning that I am very supportive of the
Government’s moves to speed up and sort out the adoption
procedures. Perhaps they ought to be grabbing Surrey county council by
the back of the neck and shaking it.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13071780000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0002.htm#13071780000050"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T16:30:46"></hs_TimeCode>This
case—the one I am choosing to talk about—involves a
married couple in my constituency. They are professional people, they
own their own home in a small village in the constituency and they are
near an excellent primary school, which feeds one of the best secondary
schools. The mother has become a full-time mum for the two little
sisters they have adopted. Put bluntly, after an appalling start in
life things are looking good for those two little girls.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13071780000051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0002.htm#13071780000051"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T16:31:10"></hs_TimeCode>The
adoptive parents expressed an interest in adopting to Surrey county
council at an adoption meeting in November 2010. They submitted a
formal application. A meeting was held with a social worker in January
2011. Prior to approval to progress, the couple attended an initial
four-day training course in 2011 with seven other couples. So we are
talking about eight couples, potentially—this is not a
single-couple case.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13071780000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0002.htm#13071780000052"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T16:31:30"></hs_TimeCode>On
the fourth day of the four-day training course, the couple I am talking
about were shown details of some children who were available for
adoption. However, it soon became apparent that Surrey county council
should not have done that, as its procedures had another eight months
to run before approval. My constituents—this
couple—looked at the list of children’s details in late
March 2011, as produced by Surrey county council, and were attracted
towards adopting two young sisters. One was aged five, going on six,
and the other was aged two, going on three. At that stage, the two
little girls had been in care for two years. On that final day of the
training course, all the couples were told that Surrey county council
would fast-track an application, as we would wish, if a suitable match
was identified during the preparation for adoption.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T16:32:18"></hs_TimeCode>However, in my
opinion, or at least in the opinion of the couple, Surrey county
council seemed incapable of speeding up any progress at all. In fact,
looking at the case in retrospect, the council did the
opposite.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13071780000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0002.htm#13071780000053"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T16:32:27"></hs_TimeCode>At
the end of the first stage, the couple were assigned a social worker to
take them through the preparation stage; that was in late March 2011.
They first met their assigned social worker at the start of May
2011—two months’ delay. By early summer, the couple had
started to express serious interest in adopting the two little girls,
having seen their child permanence reports and later a short DVD of the
children. As a result of that, the social worker agreed to start to run
the adoption approval process, so as to approve the couple as adopters.
It was agreed that the matching panel process would run in parallel.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T16:33:04"></hs_TimeCode>In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T16:33:07"></hs_TimeCode>
October 2011, six months later, the couple met the children’s
social worker for the first time, and reconfirmed their wish to proceed
to adopt these two little girls, so that the processes could continue
in 
<?notus-xml column=298?>parallel. At that stage, there seemed to be mutual agreement that, given
the girls’ age and the length of time they had spent in care,
the process should be moved quickly.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13071780000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0002.htm#13071780000054"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T16:33:24"></hs_TimeCode>The
adoption panel was set for early November 2011—12 months’
delay. The matching panel was expected to take place in late November
2011, but no date was set. The couple were deeply concerned that, at
that time, their social worker had still not interviewed the required
three referees from the six who had written reports about them as
potential adoptive parents. In October 2011, as the distance between
the meetings got longer, the social worker realised that she could not
complete the work in the time required and the adoption panel meeting
was slid back another 10 days.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13071780000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0002.htm#13071780000055"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T16:33:50"></hs_TimeCode>After
14 separate daytime meetings, each one lasting between two and three
hours, the social worker prepared a report and took the potential
parents and the report to the panel in late November 2011. Appallingly,
the panel decided that there were some basic deficiencies in the
report. For example, the social worker was required to interview three
referees but she had only interviewed two and, to make matters worse,
still presented the report.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13071780000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0002.htm#13071780000056">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T16:34:24"></hs_TimeCode>
panel therefore felt that it had to defer the case. To make matters
even worse, the panel felt that, among other things, the social
worker’s report contained too many references to the specific
children—the two girls—instead of fictitious ones, which
apparently was the normal procedure. Again, that was a Surrey county
council
problem<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T16:34:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071780000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0002.htm#13071780000057">As
a result of that, the panel was apparently not confident that the
couple were a suitable match, but that was entirely based on the
inadequate report, and so we went backwards. As I am sure the Minister
will understand, the adoptive couple were slightly upset—to put
it mildly—as the panel was supposed to be judging their
suitability as generic adopters, but in fact the couple had been led
down the road of considering specific individual girls.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13071780000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0002.htm#13071780000058"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T16:34:55"></hs_TimeCode>Things
got worse. First, the social worker went off sick with stress and
disappeared for nine months. A week after the social worker went off
sick, the couple met the social worker’s manager, who apologised
for the inadequate report. I find that somewhat strange, because the
manager is ultimately responsible for the report before it is
progressed with. However, the manager did not appear to notice
that.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13071780000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0002.htm#13071780000059"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T16:35:19"></hs_TimeCode>The
couple were told to drop the match prospects with the two little girls,
which was very upsetting. There were three further meetings with the
manager, written submissions from the couple and so on. The matter
proceeded on, so that the panel decision was brought forward to late
January 2012 and was positive.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13071780000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0002.htm#13071780000060"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T16:35:38"></hs_TimeCode>I
find it extraordinary, but at that stage the couple had difficulty
persuading the manager working with them that it was appropriate for
them to adopt siblings. The couple were assigned a new social worker
and told to look for a new potential match. In March 2012, they
discovered from other potential adopters that the two little

March 2012, the adoptive couple discovered that their potential
adoptees—the two little girls—were still on the list for
adoption. They had been offered to other potential adopters but not
accepted, for some reason. On that understanding, the couple approached
the manager. They were told by the manager, once again, to forget the
match and move on, even though Surrey county council had no alternative
options for the children. Thanks to delays, at this stage the eldest

April 2012, my constituents ran out of patience with Surrey county

discovered that it would be helpful to bring along a short biography to
give out. This they prepared themselves, only to discover on arrival at
the event that it should have been prepared with the assistance of
Surrey county council. They still attended. Different Surrey county
council staff were present, to whom they explained this long
difficulty. They were assured that the staff were somewhat
appalled<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T16:44:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071780000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0002.htm#13071780000067">Fortunately,
on a Friday evening in April, the same manager—the one who had
been there all along and who originally took them through the adoption
panel—rang to say that she had had further discussions with
colleagues. She said that Surrey county council now supported placing
the two youngsters with them. The next matching panel took place in
June 2012, which was a further delay of two months. Introductions were
to commence in early July, but there was another two-week delay. To
save the Minister the arithmetic, that was some 16 months
after the first possible approach, after having first seen the details
of the little girls.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T16:45:13"></hs_TimeCode> two sisters
latterly moved in with the adoptive parents, because of success, in
August 2012. By this stage, the two girls had been in care for more

though that is, there is more. Firstly, there was a shambolic lack of
clarity over the contact arrangements with the birth parents. In broad
summary, there were two differing opinions from two social workers. One
social worker wanted up to six contacts a year for the birth parents
with the girls, the other wanted no contact. Decisions were made,
undone and remade. Confusion and upset reigned for the wee girls, for
the adopting parents and for the birth mother. The final decision was
no contact, which was backed by the court but opposed by the birth
mother<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T16:46:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071780000069" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0002.htm#13071780000069">Surrey
social workers decided at this stage that they needed to support the
new combined family once the children had moved in with their adoptive
parents-to-be. In September, the two girls were about to start at their
new school. The elder of the sisters was going through a difficult
settling-in stage. In its wisdom, children’s services 
<?notus-xml column=300?>decided that the mother would need more help, which was accepted. A
social worker was allocated to the new family on a weekly basis, after
school. She was, I understand, young and clearly inexperienced.
Whatever advice was sought, or when changes were suggested  in
the strategy for caring for the children, she had to rush back to the
manager, again, and return with the advice the following week. This
support was so pathetic  and inadequate that, by mutual
consent, these support arrangements were
shelved.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071780000070" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0002.htm#13071780000070">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T16:46:47"></hs_TimeCode>
addition to this inadequate support, the adoptive mother received
visits every three weeks from the children’s social worker and
from the parents’ own social worker—not together, but
separately. The two social workers did not agree with each
other’s approach. This, of course, made life challenging and
every visit from the children’s social worker resulted in a
period of unsettled behaviour from the children, who blamed the
adoptive mother for the move.
Fortunately,<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T16:47:13"></hs_TimeCode>
Surrey did something right. It bought in SafeBase, an external

January 2013, when the children were quite settled—they had got
through their first Christmas with their new parents and the adoption
process was about to begin—for some unknown reason, the
children’s social worker decided that she needed to start
visiting once a week to work on the children’s life story books.
Why she needed to do this in conjunction, and in close proximity, with
the children, I cannot fathom, and the timing was bad. Of course,
predictably, that weekly visit, including pulling information together
for the life story, had the immediate effect of unsettling the children
yet again, as the social worker raked up their past on a weekly basis.
That persisted for more than a month, until the social worker was
signed off sick with a broken wrist—so they could not inflict
other visits.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T16:48:06"></hs_TimeCode> frequency of
visits reduced and a semblance of normality started to return, and
there was progress through to what one would consider proper
normality.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071780000072" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0002.htm#13071780000072">To<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T16:48:18"></hs_TimeCode>
add to the problems, the children’s social worker delayed the
commencement of the court process for the adoption by almost four
weeks, by failing to provide the parents with the address of the birth
parents. This was only resolved by going back to the manager again. To
further aggravate the situation, the first court hearing was adjourned
because the judge was not satisfied that adequate efforts had been made
by Surrey county council to contact the birth parents, and he delayed
the adoption by another six
weeks.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071780000073" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0002.htm#13071780000073">In

hon. Friend the Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford) on securing
this important debate. I know from his contributions to the Commons

is a shame that this debate has come about because of the catalogue of

despite those problems, his constituents have persevered and are now
the proud parents of two little girls who now have the stable, loving
family home that they so desperately needed. I am sure that he will
understand that I am unable to comment or intervene on an individual
case—such cases are always best dealt with locally, where the
circumstances are well known. I can assure him, however, that if his
constituents want to provide my officials with permission, I am more
than happy to write to the chief executive of Surrey county council to
inquire about whether the director of children’s services is

can very much relate to the many challenges and joys of adoption and
the care system that my hon. Friend describes. As he knows, I have two
adoptive brothers who are among the more than 80 children, many from
incredibly difficult backgrounds, that my family have fostered over 30
years. That clearly was not always easy, but I came to treasure seeing
how love, stability and routine helped my brothers lay down roots, grow
and eventually thrive. I know first hand just how life changing
adoption can
be<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T16:52:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071780000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0002.htm#13071780000080">We

my hon. Friend’s constituents found, the existing system is
clearly far too often failing to deliver for many people. Chronic
delays mean that children in care wait on average two years—in
the worst cases, three years—to be adopted, and some children
are never adopted. Currently, just over 4,500 children are waiting to
move in with their new family, and we need around 2,000 more adopters
than are currently approved to meet that demand, with an extra 700
adopters needed each year to meet future demand, which is a 25% growth
in the system’s capacity. 
<?notus-xml column=302?>We need not only more adopters but more adopters such as his
constituents who can welcome older children and pairs or groups of

significant challenge on adopter

hopes of children waiting for a family are draining away all the time.
Evidence shows that a child’s chances of adoption are reduced by
almost 20% for every year that they spend in care. I am determined to
do whatever it takes to change that situation, which is why we are
taking action on a number of fronts to speed up and simplify the
adoption system. I assure my hon. Friend that that includes significant
measures to drive up performance
locally<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T16:54:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071780000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0002.htm#13071780000083">We
have made £150 million available to councils to boost adoption
rates, and through adoption scorecards we have strengthened
accountability by publishing information on how long it takes each
local authority to place children for adoption. Nationally, some local
authorities are doing excellent work on adoption, which we must
recognise. That work is reflected in the 12% rise in adoptions last
year, compared with the year before. Although that is very welcome,
performance across the country is still too patchy, which is why we
will continue to closely monitor local authorities, including Surrey,
through the adoption scorecard and other available data. Where progress
gives cause for concern, we will not hesitate to take the appropriate
and necessary
action<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-17T16:55:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071780000084" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0002.htm#13071780000084">As
well as getting local authorities to raise their game on adoption,
there is also increased support for prospective adopters, backed up by
the excellent training available from adoption agencies. When I talk to
adopters and prospective adopters, one of the many questions that they
have, as well as those on the assessment process, is on what happens
next. Where does the support come from? What role will the local
authority or voluntary adoption agency play in ensuring that the
adoption will be successful? The worst thing that can happen to the
child is that the adoption is not successful because  the right
support was not provided at the right time.  We need to ensure
that we work closely with local authorities, voluntary adoption
agencies and other national adoption organisations, so that we can make
really good progress by implementing the adoption action plan, by
creating the adoption gateway, by reforming regulations to create more
streamlined approval processes and by publishing transparent scorecard
data on timeliness, so not only officials and politicians but the
public and prospective adopters can see the performance of local
authorities and so that others can also have a chance to understand how
good or bad the performance of their local authority

therefore on the standard and quality of social workers who work with

regime that Ofsted is introducing, which will bind together both child
protection and looked-after children, including adoption, so that there
is a much brighter light and a much deeper look at what is happening
within children’s services. We owe it to the children whose best
future we have decided lies in adoption to provide them with the best
opportunity at the earliest opportunity to make those all important
attachments with their new family and to ensure that any delay is

local authority to get that information and support, because it is
provided in one place by many people who have personal experience of
adoption and who are therefore in a good position to provide a better
understanding of what prospective adopters are letting themselves in

we have the new, fast, two-stage adopter approval process that started
on 1 July. In most cases, prospective adopters can expect to wait no
more than six months to be approved from when they register their
interest. I was recently told of a couple who started the process in
about October 2012, and twin babies were placed with them on an
adoptive placement by February 2013. That is a fantastic example of how
we can speed up the process but still ensure that we get a good match

Timpson:</Member></B> What I am talking about relates to the adopter
approval process. The twin-track approach is sometimes called
concurrent planning. In the Bill, we are trying to promote fostering
for adoption, so that rather than waiting until the final decision is
made about whether the birth family is capable of caring for a child in
the long term, moves can start to be made to establish the child in the
placement most likely to be their permanent one. The aim is to avoid
situations in which a child planned for adoption is still within the
care system, moving from one foster placement to another.</hs_Para>

fostering for adoption, which some authorities, such as East Sussex,
already carry out, is that the risk falls fairly and squarely on the
prospective adopters. There is no risk to the child, who can be placed
much earlier with their prospective adopters, so that the family can
start to create the bonds that will stabilise their future hugely and
avoid unnecessary delay, which we know only causes more problems rather
than more solutions.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=304?><hs_Para UID="13071780000093" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0002.htm#13071780000093">The two-stage
process involves the initial two-month preparation period, during which
the prospective adopters gather the information that they need to
understand adoption in greater detail and the relevant checks and
references are carried out. Those who successfully complete it then go
on to the second stage—a more detailed and more appropriately
focused four-month assessment. The beauty, as I said, is that it
focuses on the essentials to ensure that prospective adopters can give
what is necessary for a child to be placed with them
successfully.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13071780000094" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/halltext/130717h0002.htm#13071780000094">It is also
worth noting that, since 1 July, a fast-track approval process has been
introduced for those who have already adopted and fostered and are
looking to adopt again. They do not need to start the whole process
again, as they currently do; they can be fast-tracked, which will help
reduce delay. The approach will dramatically reduce the amount of time
that children must wait before they can move into their permanent home
and their number of temporary placements. Stability is a key factor of
a successful outcome for a child in care moving on to a permanent
placement. The more we can reduce the number of placements, the more
likely the child will have a successful childhood.</hs_Para>

be able to take a much more active role in identifying children through
the measures in the Bill to allow approved prospective adopters to
access the adoption register directly, which they have not been able to
do before now. Again, we expect that that will drive up speed and the
number of matches made, as well as increasing the pool of potential
matches available directly to prospective adopters. We will pilot the
new register in a number of local authorities before deciding whether
it should be rolled out nationally, but we believe that that is the
right approach, and it is supported by many excellent adoption
charities.</hs_Para>

change contact arrangements through the Bill, so that they are
demonstrably more in the best interests of the child than anybody
else’s. There have been dramatic reductions in delays since we
introduced the new clause on the 26-week time limit for care
proceedings. The time has gone from an average of 57 weeks
to about 40 weeks, and it is falling fast. That will also help to solve

outlined, a great deal of work is under way to overhaul the adoption
system fundamentally and tackle head-on many of the issues that my hon.
Friend rightly raised, but we need to go further and faster, especially
with regard to adopter recruitment. The backlog of 4,500 children in
care waiting to be adopted needs to fall rapidly, and the system needs
to sustain the ability to cope with increased future demand for
prospective adopters. We know from the recent research carried out that
hundreds of thousands of people out there would love the opportunity to
adopt and consider it an aspect of their lives that they would like the
opportunity to fulfil.</hs_Para>

grab that opportunity and make people feel welcome when they approach a
local authority or voluntary adoption agency, so that they feel that
the whole system is not set against them but there to support and
encourage them and provide them with the advice and guidance that they
need to feel equipped and confident when the great day comes and that
child or those children end up in the bosom of their family. We will
take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that we 
<?notus-xml column=305?>have a system that is deserved by our most vulnerable children, as well
as by the thousands of generous, loving people like my hon.

always be alive to the fact that the system that we have created is
never perfect, but we do know that for too long the adoption system has
failed to deliver for too many children. That is why it remains a high
priority not just for me or the Secretary of State, who has his own
personal experience of adoption, but 
<?notus-xml column=306?>for the Prime Minister, who from the start of this Government has
championed adoption as one of the best ways to give children, some of
them with the most difficult start in life, the best possible chance of
the brightest future. It is therefore incumbent on us all to ensure
that we achieve that, and I believe that the work that we are doing
will go a long way to address many of the concerns that my hon.
Friend’s constituents have rightly raised and that he raised on
their behalf. We will not take our foot off the

guidance for prosecutors in cases where criminal investigations have
been commenced in more than one jurisdiction and involve suspected

responses to the consultation highlighted the potential anti-fraud

evidence was provided on beer fiscal marks to show that, although it
could be a useful tool to counter trade in illicit products, the costs
of affixing stamps to goods could be significant for the UK brewing

of beer fiscal marks at this time to allow exploration of other, less

not therefore intend to legislate for this measure at this time, but
wishes to continue to explore available and emerging technologies that

Government note the positive response across all sectors towards the
option to register alcohol wholesalers and can also see that there
could be benefits in authorising this part of the supply chain, which
is frequently the point at which illicit products are distributed. The
Government wish to consult further with relevant sectors informally
over the summer of 2013 to refine the design of a registration scheme,
and fully understand the costs, benefits and implications if it were
introduced. This will also include seeking views on the specific powers
and sanctions that would be essential if the scheme is to be effective.

Chief Secretary to the Treasury (Danny Alexander):</Member></B> Today
the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) published its
third fiscal sustainability report (FSR). This document meets its
requirement to prepare an analysis of the sustainability of the public
finances each financial year, and provides an important insight into
the state of the public finances taking into account the significant
impact of demographic change. The report was laid before Parliament
earlier today and copies are available in the Vote Office and Printed

OBR/FSR projections show that public sector net debt is expected to
fall to a trough of 66% of GDP in the early 2030s, before rising to
reach 99% of GDP in 2062-63 in the absence of further policy change.
The FSR shows that, without additional policy change, an ageing
population is projected to increase age-related spending by 4.4% of GDP
between 2017-18 and 2062-63, as health, social care and pension
expenditure become an ever larger proportion of total public spending
and the
economy.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13071774000084" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/wmstext/130717m0001.htm#13071774000084">The
FSR also examines the long-term sustainability of Government revenues.
As in previous years, the OBR projects that oil and gas revenues will
decline markedly over the coming decades. Updated projections show
revenues declining from 0.4% of GDP this year to 0.03% of GDP in
2040-41, with total revenues over the projection period revised down by
£11 billion. The OBR consider the impact of alternative
scenarios for oil and gas prices and for production and conclude that
revenues will fall below 0.1% of GDP in the coming decades, even in
these more optimistic
scenarios.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13071774000085" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/wmstext/130717m0001.htm#13071774000085">The
Government are committed both to strengthening our fiscal position now
and making it sustainable for the long term. The OBR analysis makes it
clear that the Government’s medium-term consolidation plan is
essential to restoring long-term sustainability of the public finances.
A deterioration in the primary balance in 2017-18 worth 
<?notus-xml column=102?>1% of GDP could increase projected public sector net debt in 2062-63 to
around 150% of GDP. The OBR discusses the impact of changes to policy
on their long-term projections. They show that excluding policy changes
announced since the 2012 FSR, public sector net debt would have been
projected to be around 50% of GDP higher by 2062-63. They identify the
additional spending reductions announced for 2017-18 as one of the key
factors in containing the growth of spending over the long-term,
demonstrating the importance of the Government’s programme of
fiscal consolidation for the long-term health of the public
finances.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13071774000086" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/wmstext/130717m0001.htm#13071774000086">The

single tier reforms will complement the bold measures already taken by
this Government to improve the sustainability of UK pension systems.
Bringing forward the increase in the state pension age to 66 to 2020 is
expected to deliver savings of around £30 billion while bringing
forward the increase to 67 to 2028 is expected to deliver savings of
around £70 billion. Further, the Government have set out their
plans to consider future changes to the state pension age in a more

OBR’s report also focuses on the pressures of an ageing
population on social care spending, and the projections reflect for the
first time the impact of the historic reforms to social care funding
announced earlier this year. The Government will introduce a cap on
lifetime care costs, greater means-tested support for residential care
and deferred payments, so that nobody faces unlimited care costs, more
people get support with their residential care costs sooner, and nobody
is forced to sell their home in their lifetime to pay for residential
care. The Government are also taking action to deliver better, more
efficient care. For example, the spending round set out radical plans
to create a £3.8 billion pooled budget shared across health and
care, to deliver more integrated services, which we expect to manage
down pressures across both services.</hs_Para>

believe it is crucial that as many children as possible should leave
primary school having reached a level that leaves them ready to
progress and achieve their full potential at secondary school. Our

want to see a step change in attainment at the end of primary school.
In the past, the achievement bar was set too low and too few pupils
cleared this bar. Our ambition is that all pupils, excepting some of
those with particular learning needs, should be secondary ready at age
11—that means using a higher measure of what success looks like.
We are already raising the threshold for the percentage of pupils to be
ready for secondary school to 65%. But we know that schools and
teachers have already raised their game way beyond this. For that
reason, we will expect a very high proportion of
pupils—85%—to reach the new, higher secondary readiness
threshold for a school to be above the bar. Since we know that both
children and schools can achieve this, it is right that we set this as
a minimum
standard.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13071774000101" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/wmstext/130717m0001.htm#13071774000101">Our
new national curriculum is designed to give schools genuine
opportunities to take ownership of the curriculum. The new programmes
of study, published on 8 July, set out what pupils should be taught by
the end of primary education. Teachers will be able to develop a school
curriculum that delivers the core content in a way that is challenging
and relevant for their
pupils.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13071774000102" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/wmstext/130717m0001.htm#13071774000102">Statutory
assessment in core subjects at the end of key stages is designed
primarily to enable robust external accountability. We will continue to
prescribe statutory assessment arrangements in English, mathematics and
science. National curriculum tests in English and mathematics will
continue, and will show whether pupils have met a demanding secondary
readiness standard, which will remain the same from year to year. We
propose to report pupils’ test results as a scaled score, such
as those used in international surveys, to make sure that test outcomes
are comparable over time. We will report each pupil’s ranking in
the national cohort by decile to show their performance relative to
their peers
nationally.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13071774000103" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/wmstext/130717m0001.htm#13071774000103">It
is vital that we set high aspirations for all schools and pupils. Our
new targets will prepare children for success. At the moment, pupils
are being asked to reach a bar that too often sets them up to fail. So
that all children—whatever their circumstances—can arrive
in secondary school ready to succeed, we are giving significantly more
money to primary school pupils eligible for the pupil premium. This
will support this step change in
ambition.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13071774000104" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/wmstext/130717m0001.htm#13071774000104">We
introduced the pupil premium in 2011 to help schools close the
attainment gap for disadvantaged pupils. In 2014-15, total funding
through the pupil premium will increase by an extra £625 million
to a total of £2.5 billion. We will use the extra funding to
increase the level of the pupil premium for primary schools to
£1,300 per pupil compared with £900 in the current year.
This 44% rise in the pupil premium is the largest cash rise so far.
This should enable more targeted interventions to support disadvantaged
pupils to be “secondary ready” and achieve our ambitious
expectations for what pupils should know and be able to do by the 
<?notus-xml column=105?>end of primary education. We believe in early intervention because the
greater the numbers of disadvantaged pupils that leave primary school
with basic literacy and numeracy, the greater their chances of

also want to treat schools fairly by acknowledging the performance of
schools whose pupils achieve well despite a low starting point. We will
therefore look at how we can introduce a reliable, robust measure of
progress that we can take into consideration when holding schools to
account. A school that does not achieve the attainment threshold will
not be judged to be below the floor standard if its pupils are making
good progress. The progress measure will also help identify coasting
schools, whose pupils do not achieve their full potential. Ofsted will
focus its inspections more closely on schools below and just above
floor standards, and inspect schools with good performance on these
measures less
frequently.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13071774000106" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/wmstext/130717m0001.htm#13071774000106">We
will continue to report on the progress pupils make during primary
education. In order to measure pupils’ progress, we need to
measure how each pupil’s end of key stage 2 test results compare
with the results of pupils with similar prior attainment. Currently the
baseline against which we measure progress is at the end of key stage
1. We could continue to keep the baseline at this stage. Alternatively,
we could introduce a similar teacher-led baseline check early in
reception, which would help teachers understand the stage the child has
reached and allow the crucial progress made in reception, year 1 and
year 2 to be reflected in the accountability system. Our consultation
seeks views on which is the best
option.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13071774000107" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/wmstext/130717m0001.htm#13071774000107">Finally,
we recognise that teachers are professionals, and we want to give
schools more freedom over the way they measure assessment. We have
already announced that we will remove the current system of national
curriculum levels and level descriptions, which imposes a single system
for ongoing assessment and prescribes the detailed sequence for what
pupils should be taught. This will leave schools free to decide how to
track pupils’ progress. Ofsted will expect to see evidence of
pupils’ progress, but inspections will be informed by the pupil

this year. They will keep a share of the business rates paid in their
area, and also keep a share of any increase in business rates, subject
to payment of any levy that might be due. Authorities hosting new
nuclear power stations will therefore benefit significantly from the
increase in revenues that will arise from the development of those
facilities. They will get the reward from these increased revenues for
up to 10
years.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13071774000115" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/wmstext/130717m0001.htm#13071774000115">The
second phase is intended to deliver the remainder of the package over
the period 2030-60 which will be an annual payment of equivalent
amounts, funded by DECC. These funds are specifically intended to
benefit the local communities who are hosting new nuclear power
stations and the Government fully expect that the local authorities
will involve their communities in developing their spending plans, with
Government also providing assistance and support in its development.
Given the amount of time before this phase of funding will be issued
and recognising the differences between communities, DECC will
extensively discuss the implementation of this funding with each local
area to determine how the needs of the community may best be
served.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13071774000116" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/wmstext/130717m0001.htm#13071774000116">Business

preference to receive it in electronic form, the public authority must
(if FOIA requires the dataset to be released) provide the dataset in an

Friend the Justice Secretary announced the publication of

This set out the Government’s plans for transforming the

more diverse range of providers, drawing from the best of the
voluntary, community and private sectors, equipped with the flexibility
and incentives to reduce reoffending, extending statutory support to
some 50,000 offenders who receive prison sentences of under 12 months

service.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13071774000176" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/wmstext/130717m0001.htm#13071774000176">As
an integral part of developing the strategy, we looked in detail at the
full-range of probation trust functions and at how we could organise

requirement of a triennial review to look at the function and form of
an NDPB and to consider the best delivery model, options for which
would include moving delivery from an arm’s length body to an
in-house provision. On that basis, we will create a new national
probation service, working to protect the public and building upon the
expertise and professionalism already in place.</hs_Para>

expertise of a more diverse market of providers to reduce reoffending,
making use of new payment incentives and protecting the public from the
most serious offenders through a strong public sector which is
organised in the more efficient way for the delivery of its new
functions. By sharing back-office functions within the public sector we
can release efficiency savings to invest in rehabilitation, and by MOJ
through National Offender Management Service (NOMS) managing the new
public sector probation service directly, we can ensure that contract
managers can effectively oversee the work of both the public sector
probation service and competed providers, and how they interact. In

sophisticated attacks, including two failed attempts to use mortars
against PSNI stations. Many more attacks were prevented and disrupted

when two PSNI officers were shot at when responding to a reported

under the three pillars: better monitoring of social policies, better
co-ordination of social policies, and better involvement of social
partners. The United Kingdom highlighted that spill-over was not so
relevant to member states outside of the eurozone. The UK stressed the
importance of respecting subsidiarity and proportionality, and that
primary competence in this area lay with member states and the
Commission.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment></System><System type="Petitions" ColStart="11"><?date 2013-07-17?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_17_PT_1/A107C4655E371167AE77AD590D4C7C6B60047EFB" __version__="1.2"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="17 July 2013">Wednesday

Government are aware of the harm the behaviour of some rough sleepers
can have on local areas. Where an individual is engaging in criminal
behaviour, then this is a matter for the police. There is legislation
available to tackle offences such as littering, defecating in public,
aggressive begging or street drinking. There is also a range of powers
and practices available to both the police and local authorities that
can disrupt and reduce antisocial behaviour, including that caused by
rough sleepers. These powers are currently being streamlined by the

through
Parliament.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1307183000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/petntext/130717p0001.htm#1307183000024">However,
the Government believe local problems need local solutions, involving
not just the police, but the local council and the voluntary sector.

behaviour are foreign nationals. Immigration enforcement teams are
working with the Metropolitan Police and Westminster Council, with the

behaviour (in particular begging, rough sleeping and illegal gambling).
Since the beginning of this joint effort, arrests for begging in the

Royal Mail in April 2012, the Chief Executive of Royal Mail told
Parliament that it was "unthinkable" that the two companies would not
always have a close relationship. In January 2012, the two companies
signed a long-term inter-business agreement. This agreement ensures
that Royal Mail products and services, which account for around a third
of Post Office Ltd's revenues, will continue to be available at post
office branches. The Government, as shareholder in the respective

this the Government is providing £1.34 billion to
maintain and modernise the Post Office network, making it a stronger
partner for the Royal Mail. The ongoing Network Transformation
programme is seeing post offices offering customers greater access to

retail environments. This is enabling Post Office Ltd to pursue a

reinstated in April 2008 and licences issued from then until April 2011

to vary this condition and defer reburial for a longer or indefinite

the prosecution already has a role in assisting the court. The Code for
Crown Prosecutors requires the prosecutors to draw to the court's
attention factors which might reasonably be expected to affect
sentence. This includes: any aggravating or mitigating factors relevant
to the case; any victim personal statement or other information
available to the prosecution as to the impact of the offence on the
victim; where appropriate, evidence of the impact of the offending on a
community; and any relevant sentencing guidelines or guideline cases.
The prosecutor may also offer assistance to the court by making
submissions, in the light of all these factors, as to the appropriate
sentencing range. The prosecution also has a duty to apply for
appropriate ancillary
orders.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130717101000250" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/text/130717w0002.htm#130717101000250">The

military involvement in Syria. It is prolonging the Assad regime's
brutal repression of the Syrian people and, by undermining Lebanon's
agreed policy of disassociation from the Syria conflict, risks
destabilising Lebanon. We also remain very concerned by continued
reports of transfers of conventional weapons from Syria and Iran to
Hezbollah in Lebanon, including Hezbollah’s own claims that it
possesses significant military capabilities. Any such transfers would
be in violation of Security Council resolution 1701 and would pose a
threat to Lebanese and regional stability.</hs_Para>

Heath</Member></B> <I>[holding answer 24 June 2013]:</I> The
‘Central finance ongoing activity—CAP’ figures
relate to ‘Disallowance’ payments. These arise as a
result of financial corrections applied by the European Commission
where it takes the view that EU regulations for payments funded through
European schemes, including the common agricultural policy (CAP), have
not been applied
correctly.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130717101000583" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/text/130717w0003.htm#130717101000583">Following
the introduction of the new common agricultural policy, EU compliance
audits across all member states had stalled for a number of years. This
resulted in decisions, for example covering the single payment scheme
(SPS) 2005 through to 2009, not being made until 2009-10 and 2010-11.
This led to Disallowance penalties for four schemes years being
accounted for in two years 2009-11. However in 2011-12, the opposite
happened where further delays were experienced with the EU audit and
decision making process for SPS schemes, resulting in a fall in
expenditure recorded against CAP Disallowance.</hs_Para>

bio-security measures, I hope that DEFRA's consultation on a draft TB
strategy will generate innovative ideas on how Government and industry
can work in partnership to eradicate this devastating disease. No

biosecurity controls against TB are also in place—for example,
cattle herds are regularly tested for the disease and if a herd owner

Heath:</Member></B> DEFRA undertakes routine scanning surveillance for
the detection of new or re-emerging animal diseases that may pose a
threat to animal health or public health. The Animal Health and
Veterinary Laboratories Agency led Pig Species Expert Group (SEG) are
aware of porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) and the emergence of a new
virulent strain in the USA and China. The SEG routinely looks for
changes in trends of disease diagnosed in Great Britain and also
consider samples where it is has not been possible to reach a diagnosis
through routine testing. Threats identified are then escalated to the
Veterinary Risk Group for consideration and to the UK's four Chief
Veterinary Officers. In this way, we can identify new diseases like PED
that are not notifiable and do not require specific legislative control
measures.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130717101000611" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130717/text/130717w0003.htm#130717101000611">As
PED is not a notifiable disease, nor is it listed by the OIE (the
animal equivalent of the WHO), DEFRA is not required to carry out an
assessment of its impact. Working with the pig industry, the SEG can
raise awareness of this disease to enable industry to ensure best
practice biosecurity measures are in place. Indeed, the

needs of rural communities is important. Local authorities are best

concerns that people have about the possible impacts of sky lanterns,
we have encouraged the farming industry to gather evidence. In order to
further improve the evidence-base DEFRA and the Welsh Government
commissioned an independent report on sky lanterns. Published in May
2013, this report brings together and evaluates the available evidence,
including evidence presented by the farming sector and through
stakeholder surveys. While farmers have lost livestock due to ingested
wire from sky lanterns, the evidence from this independent report
suggests that any widespread risk of injury and death to livestock is
