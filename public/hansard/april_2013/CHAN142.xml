took part in the survey, about half had actually received an increase
in their funding. We continue to support new writing, and theatre cuts
amount to less than about 3% overall, so theatre has been well
protected. The report concentrated on a few theatres whose funding had
been 
<?notus-xml column=467?>impacted and did not concentrate on those that had had their funding

standard procedure to have the NAO run the ruler over the 4G auction. I
happen to believe that Ofcom did a fantastic job in running it. I went
personally last night to congratulate the 92 men and women who worked
on that auction and delivered a fantastic result. In the 3G auction,
telecom companies paid far too much and it took too long to roll out

causes of the gender pay gap are varied: roughly a third can be

permitted development rights, to give people an opportunity—this
carries through the principle of localism—to develop their own

those points. He will have noted that, in a debate yesterday, the
general anti-abuse provision was discussed, which is a very important
provision. What I would say reflects what the Chancellor of the
Exchequer said earlier in the year. We are concerned to pursue a twin
track: to continue to reduce corporation tax, as the Chancellor set out
in the Budget, so that we are highly competitive among international
economies; and to promote and support enterprise and growth. We
recognise that one of the most important ways to make the corporation
tax reduction possible is to minimise evasion, 
<?notus-xml column=493?>reduce avoidance and tackle abuse. That is what the Government are
doing. The more we can achieve that, the more we can ensure that the

for Wellingborough (Mr Bone) is naughty because he knows perfectly well
that this is not the mother of Parliaments. He is, however, right on
one point: because of the Government’s jiggery-pokery, the Prime
Minister will answer Prime Minister’s questions only four times
in 12 weeks. Even worse, the Chancellor will probably not
answer Treasury questions until three whole months have passed since
the Budget. The first Treasury questions is likely to be on 18 or 25
June. We could solve all that if the Government fulfilled their promise
to bring in a House business committee by the third year of this
Parliament. We were generous and allowed that not to be by the
beginning of the third year—that is what we all thought the
logic meant—but we are now at the end of the third year. I

understand the position. The NHS quite properly recorded a surplus for
the previous year, amounting to about £1.6 billion.
However, there is a distinction to be drawn between the availability of
resources within the NHS and Government financial accounting for the
Department of Health as a whole. What happened—and I think it is
reflected in what has happened this year—was that a surplus in
the Department was not spent during the financial year and was
therefore once more available to the Treasury; but that does not mean
that the Department did not ensure that the NHS organisations with the

Cunningham</B> (Stockton North) (Lab):</Member> On a point of order, Mr
Speaker. I would welcome your advice and guidance on a matter relating
to the answering of questions by the Education Secretary. You will
probably know that he has one of the poorest records in the House for
doing so. I believe that he has been officially chastised for his poor
failures, but sadly that appears to have had little effect. I tabled a
number of named day questions to the Secretary of State on 21 March
with a named day of the 26th. I received four answers on the due day,
but I note that the three Ministers
concerned—the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T11:27:18"></hs_TimeCode>
Under-Secretary of State responsible for further education, skills and
lifelong learning, the hon. Member for West Suffolk (Matthew
Hancock<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T11:27:18"></hs_TimeCode>); the
Minister for children and families,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T11:27:23"></hs_TimeCode>
Under-Secretary of State for Education, the hon. Member for Crewe and
Nantwich (Mr Timpson); and
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T11:27:27"></hs_TimeCode> Minister for
Schools—have demonstrated their ability to work as a team and
collaborate on answers, as they all gave me exactly the same answer to
four very different questions. They all said, “I will reply as
soon as possible.” It is now four weeks since I tabled the
questions and more than three since I received the holding replies. I
received one answer today. I am sure that you will agree that it is
unacceptable for Ministers to ignore questions and I would be obliged
if you helped me in extracting some proper ones

Opposition believe that politics is about priorities—about
providing support to those who need it most, rather than to those with
the broadest shoulders. This has never been more the case than in the
country’s current economic climate—a parlous economic
climate which, let us remind ourselves, has seen just 0.8% growth since
autumn 2010, compared with the 5.3% that was forecast at the time. The
economy continues to stagnate under this Government, leading to the

the Member for Stockton North (Alex Cunningham) noted, unemployment is

Labour’s jobs guarantee, using money raised from the tax on 
<?notus-xml column=508?>bank bonuses to fund a guaranteed job—a real job—for every
young person who has been out of work for a year or more. I am not sure
whether Government Members have had a chance to analyse the long-term
unemployment figures published yesterday, but I can tell them that in
March this year 167,345 adults over the age of 25 had been claiming
jobseeker’s allowance for more than 24 months. Let me
repeat that figure: 167,345 adults had been out of work for more than
two years, compared with 84,765 in February 2012 and 52,895 in February
2011. That is a disturbing rise of 97% since February 2012 and 216%

problem is not restricted to high streets. In small rural
constituencies, there may be one village shop, where the local post
office is located. The post 
<?notus-xml column=516?>office network is also being put at risk as such
small village shops are unable to make a profit. Therefore, we risk
losing post office services. We are facing that now in East Lothian.

seems almost too simplistic to make this point, but Government Members
have boasted about the fact that the Government are hurting the richest
10% the most. However, if the Government choose to take £25 a
week from a rich family, it will have a lot less impact than taking
£17 a week from a hard-working family. Taking that from the
richest will not mean they will present themselves at food banks
looking for assistance to put food on the table, but that is what the
Government are forcing working families increasingly to do. We look
forward—look forward is perhaps the wrong term—to hearing
the Trussell Trust’s latest figures on the number of people it
has fed over the past year. All the indications are that the number has
increased significantly; it may be over 500,000. That is a matter of

Members will visit food banks in their communities to understand the
causes of food insecurity. As my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle
upon Tyne North said, it is about the choices the Government are making
and their priorities. Earlier we heard the most uncomfortable and
distorted logic: when the economy was growing, unemployment was
falling, we were investing in health and helping young people into
employment, the Labour Government should have taken more money from the
rich through a 50p tax rate, just for the sake of it; but when the
economy is flat-lining, unemployment has just risen again, poverty and
the gap between rich and poor are increasing, it is the right time for
this Government to give a tax break to people earning over
£150,000. I cannot follow that
logic.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041826000399" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130418/debtext/130418-0002.htm#13041826000399">The
Joseph Rowntree Foundation has estimated that almost 2.5 million
families on low incomes will pay £130 more in council tax this
year, adding further to the squeeze that working families are
suffering. This Government have made their choice, and I think that, as
they drive towards the next general election, if they glance in the
rear-view mirror, two hazards will make them fail the electoral test.
The first is their decision to scrap the 50p rate of tax. The second is
their choice to introduce a bedroom tax at the same time. There is a
family in Wallyford in my constituency, the Anderson family. Mr
Anderson is a full-time carer for his wife, who has a severe form of
epilepsy. He is saving this country a small fortune by caring for his
wife, but he does it because he wants to, not because he has to. There
are times when he needs not to sleep in the same room as his
wife—I have his permission to discuss his case in this amount of
detail—and he needs to be able to make that choice. He also has
a son with spina bifida, who is now enjoying a degree of independence
and 
<?notus-xml column=517?>living away from his family, but he can maintain that independence only
by returning home for about three days a week when the weather is bad.
Recently, he has been at home for longer—so that bedroom is
needed for Mark and his equipment.</hs_Para>

feel ashamed that Mr Anderson should have to come to see me to ask why
the Government are choosing to give money to people who are not even
asking for it, when he is going to be taxed for having that bedroom.
And it is a tax; when the Government take money out of people’s
pockets, that is a tax. This Government are choosing to make life much
more difficult for a man who has given up work to care for his wife and
to support his disabled son and enable him to live as independent a
life as possible. That says a lot about the Government’s
approach, and it does not surprise me that Government Members are not

want to come back to the amendment, which is about getting back to the
50p rate. We already have a situation in which the top 1% of taxpayers
pay nearly 28% of the total income tax receipts—that is,
£50 billion. If the rate of tax is put up to too high
a level, people will change their behaviour to alter the amount of tax
they pay. That is very straightforward, and they can do a number of
things. Some people leave the country, so that their tax is paid
overseas. Some work less hard, reducing their earnings to reduce their
tax payments.

Gilmore:</Member></B> The point is constantly made that the top 1% pay
a very high proportion of income tax and that that makes this measure
okay, but presumably they pay that because their income is high. The
gap in this country between low-income people and high-income people
has widened considerably. That happened under the Government of the
late Baroness Thatcher, but, admittedly, not enough was done to address

In 1979, that hallowed year in which the great lady to whom she
referred came to office, the highest rate of income tax was 98%, and
the proportion of income tax revenues paid by the top 1% was about 10%.
When the rate fell, the proportion paid by the top 1% went up, so more
money came from the richest in society when rates were lower. Lower
rates of taxation therefore resulted in the advantage of an increase in
revenue for the Government and the ability to spend more on the
services deemed necessary.</hs_Para>

people, but that is not the end point of the economic cycle. There need
to be deposits in banks so that money can be lent to
businesses—small businesses as well as large—and so that

will address the amendment directly. The lowering of the top rate of
income tax to 45p will benefit 267,000 people who earn more than
£150,000. In my view, it cannot be right that those who earn
more than £1 million a year will receive a tax cut of
more than £100,000. Families across the country will be
£891 worse off on average as a result of the Chancellor’s
changes to tax, tax credits and benefits since 2010. I am at a loss as
to how that fits with the concept that we are all in it together. The
1% cap on tax credits and working-age benefits means a cut in real
terms. At the bottom, inflation outstrips increases in earnings,

inflation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041826000457" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130418/debtext/130418-0002.htm#13041826000457">Acres
of copy have been written about Baroness Thatcher over the past week,
but one of her utterances that has not received the attention that it
deserves is her expression of disappointment that, despite having made
it possible for a small minority of people to gain control of the
majority of the wealth of this country, that has not given rise to a
greater degree of charity or generosity. Interestingly, it is often
those who have the least who give the most. Two examples of such
generosity are imprinted on my mind. The first was in 1984, when people
from my community made regular trips up to Easington colliery with bags
and boxes of food to assist families in County Durham who were finding
life such a
struggle<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T12:38:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041826000458" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130418/debtext/130418-0002.htm#13041826000458">The
second example is from recent weeks, when I visited one of the five
food banks in my constituency run by the Trussell Trust. It was
heartbreaking to hear from the local director of the trust, Nigel
Perrott, that food parcels were being sent to my town of Middlesbrough
from places such as York and Thirsk. He hails from the home counties
and credits people in that part of the country with tremendous
generosity. However, he said that he had been surprised and overwhelmed
by the generosity of the people of Middlesbrough. When they come out of
the supermarkets, they do not donate the occasional tin of beans or
packet of rice, but bags and bags of food. It seems that everything
changes, but nothing changes. It is perhaps no coincidence that such
desperate need arises when the Conservative party is in
power.</hs_Para>

that the richest will arrange their affairs, especially when such a

our society, and the amount of tax they pay is proportionately more
than their numbers, but proportionately less than their wealth.

gone through the House this week that has deprived the Treasury of
significant funds that could be much more wisely invested and directed.
The Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill was discussed in the Chamber
some days ago, and I asked myself whether any conversation had taken
place between the Treasury and other ministerial colleagues. As a
result of that Bill, many people who have sustained catastrophic
injuries will not be able to secure the compensation that they deserve
or need. We 
<?notus-xml column=526?>are talking about hundreds of millions of pounds, and that is further
evidence of the Government’s direction of travel that punishes
and penalises those in greatest need. This is not about lottery wins

ability to secure those services from such funds, those with traumatic
brain injuries and spinal cord injuries will have to look to the
statutory services as there is nowhere else for them to go. As everyone
in this Committee is aware, those services are under incredible
pressure, and the Bill means that those innocent people will not be
able to go out and purchase the services that they need. Somebody
suffering from a spinal cord injury must rely on when the district
nurse can get to their home to attend to their intimate and personal
needs, rather than use funds that would otherwise be available to get
on with their lives.</hs_Para>

the insurance industry, which will no doubt be delighted that it will
no longer have to pay compensation to people in the circumstances I
have described. I strongly suspect that the measure will not help our
industries one jot—I do not foresee any massive reduction in the
employers’ liability premiums that will be charged as a result
of the measure—and, frankly, the insurance industry is laughing
all the way to the bank. I do not know whether it is laughing with or
at the Government, but in any event, it is has received a
fabulous return at the country’s
expense.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041826000474" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130418/debtext/130418-0002.htm#13041826000474">All

make no apology for Labour’s firm commitment to the
redistribution of wealth through the taxation system. The majority of
citizens in western European democracies share that view. The taxation
system is not the only redistribution mechanism. Other mechanisms
include the minimum wage, which the Labour Government introduced. I
hope the Government retain the minimum wage and increase it year on
year in line with inflation. It worries me that it is going up by only
1.9% this year, while inflation races ahead. It is important that we
have such mechanisms, but taxation is an important mechanism in the
redistribution of wealth. The vast majority of people in this country
recognise the need for all to contribute to the many public services we
enjoy, and the need for some redistribution through the taxation

lowest incomes tend to spend money immediately, so it goes immediately
back into the local economy and helps the local high street. Local
businesses are going bust because people simply do not have the money
to spend. They are struggling. They are turning to food

economies are struggling enormously. We have heard from many wise
sources that the Chancellor needs to get his act together on
stimulating the economy, and putting the money in the pockets of people
who have the lowest incomes, who will then use it immediately in the
local economy, is one way of doing so. That is not happening, which is
why the Opposition are so angry about the cut in tax from 50% to 45%

incomes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041826000483" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130418/debtext/130418-0002.htm#13041826000483">One
of the most insidious changes is the change to tax credits. They are
difficult to explain because they have been designed to suit each
individual household, which makes it more difficult to speak about them
in a more general sense. Nevertheless, let us look at the changes.
First, there has been an increase in the tax credit clawback. The whole
point of tax credits is that they are an incentive for people to work
if they can find it. Many who are on low incomes cannot get more hours,
and the maximum amount that many can be paid for the hours they work in
a full-time week still qualifies them for tax credit. Any reduction in
that tax credit is therefore counter-productive—it does not help
people at
all.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041826000484" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130418/debtext/130418-0002.htm#13041826000484">The
child care tax credit has also been reduced. That is another seemingly
mad policy. The money is desperately needed to help people to work. The
family element of tax credit has been abolished, as has the 50-plus
element, and the working tax credit has been frozen. Given current
inflation, the proposed cap of 1% on increases in working tax credit
and child tax credit is effectively another cut—it is a cut in
what lower-income families can buy with the money they have, with the
catastrophic effect that all hon. Members see in our local economies
and high
streets.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041826000485" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130418/debtext/130418-0002.htm#13041826000485">In
Wales alone, the tax credit measures will suck some £794

iniquity of the cut from 50% to 45%. Effectively, a cut in one place
unfortunately means that people suffer in other places. Those on the
highest incomes can afford to cushion themselves and do not need to
spend money straight away. Even someone who earns just £10,000
above the £150,000 mark will benefit significantly. Instead of
paying £5,000 in tax, they will 
<?notus-xml column=529?>pay £4,500. They will have a gain after tax
of £500. Most people do not see anything like that increase in
their income—incomes are frozen. If someone earning
£50,000 has even a 1% increase, they will not get that
£500 because it would be taxed. With all the different changes
that are being imposed on them, families are losing far

I find most worrying is the amount of destitution. We all know that

a compromise. This year’s decision to raise benefits only by
1%—less than the rate of inflation—is absolutely
unprecedented. Not even in Thatcher’s time was that done. We are

list do not qualify. With two adults and two children under
10—or two children of the same sex under 16—families do
not qualify for a three-bedroom house. As I say, it is just a cut.

the personal allowance does little for the lowest-paid workers, many of
whom do not pay tax anyway. Over 682,000 working families receiving
child tax credit earn less than £6,420, so I am afraid that they

in conjunction with the welfare cuts they are now facing, the lowest
earning taxpayers will receive an income boost of 32p a week or
£16.80 a year as compared with those not claiming housing
benefit or council tax benefit of up to £112 a year. That does
not take into account the impact of the 20% VAT hike back in 2011, the
additional 26% rise in food prices since 2009 or the 20% increase in
energy costs that households face on their household bills. Nearly

Chancellor said in last year’s autumn statement that we needed a
welfare system that we could afford. Tax credits and benefits form part
of the “automatic stabilisers” that help dampen economies

model of social welfare, born out of the second world war when we
literally were “all in it together”. I want to retain
this model with its principles of inclusion, support and security for
all, protecting any one of us, should we fall on hard times, assuring
our dignity and the basics of life, and helping us all back on our

care for our most vulnerable. It is a mark of this Government, their

Davies:</Member></B> Every week during Prime Minister’s Question
Time the Leader of the Opposition asks why, at a time when there is so
much poverty and a need for austerity, the richest in society are
benefiting from a cut in the 50p income tax rate, and the Prime
Minister replies, “We will raise more money from the 45p rate
than from the 50p rate.” We all know why that is, and the
Minister knows why it is. It is because rich people are able to manage
their affairs and can move their income between tax years, and in this
instance they will simply move it into the 45p year. The Minister knows
that, and he also knows that if we retained the 50p rate on a sustained
basis, we would gather more money.</hs_Para>

shakes his head with a smug expression, but he knows that, and he also
knows that many people already pay 52p in the pound. Those with incomes
of £32,000 or £42,000 are paying 40% in tax plus 12% in
national insurance. The Minister’s claim that we could not
possibly have a 50p rate because all those rich people would get on
their yachts and leave Britain is absolute
rubbish.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041826000508" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130418/debtext/130418-0002.htm#13041826000508"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Gauke" PimsId="4777" UID="13041826001994" xid="850" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130418/debtext/130418-0002.htm#13041826001994">Mr
Gauke:</Member></B> Let me make two points. First, I do not know
whether the hon. Gentleman has read the HMRC report on the 50p rate,
but if he has, he will have seen that a large element of the loss is
due to a reduction in economic activity, and has nothing to do with tax
avoidance. Secondly, I am afraid that he has got his facts wrong:
people stop paying 12% in national insurance contributions as soon as
they reach the higher-rate
threshold.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041826000509" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130418/debtext/130418-0002.htm#13041826000509"><B><Member ContinuationText="Geraint Davies" PimsId="2869" UID="13041826001995" xid="1174" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130418/debtext/130418-0002.htm#13041826001995">Geraint
Davies:</Member></B> That is not my understanding. According to the
Minister’s own analysis of economic activity, which he
mentioned, the yield from a 50p rate would be greater over a
period. The analysis factors in the behavioural change to which I have
referred, namely rich people moving their incomes around. It is
also the case that people are paying the rates to which I
referred. I have commissioned research from the House of Commons
Library. It is all very well for the Minister to sit there nodding
away, but that is the fact of the matter. It is completely
unjustifiable that, at a time when the incomes of some of my
constituents are being reduced to about £11 a week and they are
on a starvation diet, his rich friends should be enabled to have this
extra
money.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041826000510" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130418/debtext/130418-0002.htm#13041826000510">The
Minister continues to resist calls for a bankers’ bonus tax. At
one moment he claims that bankers should be taxed in that way, and at
the next moment he gives them 5p back. It is absolutely preposterous.
The Minister hopes that the food banks that are now emerging in their
thousands will help to cope with the Dickensian circumstances that he
is causing, in which people are starving in their own homes, but, as I
have already pointed out, unless a supplement to the social security
system is introduced such people will not be able to survive.</hs_Para>

is pushing us into a situation in which the state is withdrawing in the
hope that the charitable sector will help to sustain certain very poor
communities. It is absolutely appalling. We have a dementor Government

not want a future of fear; we want a future of hope. We do not want a

the Minister will think again about the need for those with the
broadest shoulders to make the highest contribution, rather
than just smirking with his colleagues. I would guess that
they—in their richer communities in the divided Britain whose

changes in the Budget are completely unnecessary. The bedroom tax was
originally expected to raise £490 million. The figure has just
been revised to £400 million, but in fact the tax will raise no
money at all. It was supposedly intended to confront the problem of
rising housing benefit costs, which have doubled over the last 10
years, but we know that 70% of that rise was due to the fact that not
enough houses were being built and private-sector rents were going up.
The displacement into the private sector of people who are being
punished because their children have grown up will simply increase
housing benefit costs
further.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041826000515" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130418/debtext/130418-0002.htm#13041826000515">The
Minister knows in his heart, and from the analysis, that such changes
are unnecessary. They will not raise money, so why make them? Why not
let the rich pay a little bit more towards the public good? Even if the
bedroom tax does raise £400 million, the Minister is spending
£12 billion on ever-increasing tax thresholds. While that in
itself is welcome, the fact remains that these changes are about
choices. If the Minister’s choice is to give the richest more

taking the wrong direction in terms of the prosperous and united

Gauke:</Member></B> Let me say something about clauses 1 and 16. Clause
1 deals with the income tax charge for 2013-14, which requires
legislation every year. I assume that Labour Members will not oppose
the clause, given that the legislation raises £154 billion a
year. However, a few weeks ago they did oppose the income tax charge in
the Budget resolutions. If they had been successful, the deficit would
have increased by more than £150 billion a year. Moreover,
whereas the Government have taken some 2.7 million people out of income
tax, Labour would have taken about 30 million people out of it,

section of her speech was followed by a part opposing the abolition of
the 50p rate of

measure which was not helping the United Kingdom to grow, which was

committed to supporting such activity, but that support should not be
limitless, especially at a time when the priority is to balance the
public finances. In the past, some individuals have been able to offset
unlimited reliefs against their income to reduce their income tax bills

a lower tax rate than the people they employ to clean their offices.

limiting uncapped reliefs. That is what clause 16 and schedule 3 do:
they cap the use of previously unlimited income tax reliefs at
£50,000 or 25% of an individual’s income, whichever is
the greater. The cap came into effect on 6 April this year. The changes

subsidise businesses that have no chance of success. We have a generous
regime, but we do not believe that it should be without limit.
Unlimited reliefs mean that some people, often with high incomes, can
pay little or no income tax year on year. We do not believe that that

Gauke:</Member></B> Of course, we have consulted on this policy and
have listened very carefully to the representations we have received.
If we are serious about raising revenue in a way that does not damage
the economy, the cap on reliefs is a sensible approach. It is a matter
of fairness and I would have thought that hon. Members from all 
<?notus-xml column=536?>parties would agree that it is wrong for us to have a system whereby
people can drive down their tax bill year after year to very low rates
despite being high earners. That is exactly what this measure is
about.</hs_Para>

measure demonstrates that as a Government we are doing more to raise
money from the wealthy. In Budget 2010, we increased higher rate
capital gains tax; in Budget 2011, we tackled avoidance through
disguised remuneration, which was opposed by the Opposition; in Budget
2012, we raised stamp duty on high-value homes; in the autumn statement
2012, we took action to reduce the cost of pensions tax relief; and in
Budget 2013 we announced further measures to tackle offshore tax
evasion by high earners. Under this Government, the richest now pay
more in income tax than in any year under Labour.</hs_Para>

1 requests a review, and HMRC published a thorough and very
well-researched report at Budget 2012 that showed the effect of the
additional rate of income tax. Those matters were debated at
considerable length last year and the report shows that the rate was
not raising the money that the previous Government intended it to
raise. It is illogical to maintain a tax rate that is not effective at
raising revenue from high earners and that risks damaging growth. We
have found better ways of raising money from the wealthy that raise
more money but do less damage to the economy.</hs_Para>

always keep tax rates under review, but I note the inclusion of a
request for a review in the amendment. It seems to me that the purpose
of the amendment is not just to enable us to have another debate on the
50p rate today but to enable the Labour party to find an escape route
from its policy. Until a few days ago, it was against getting rid of
the 50p rate. Labour will not answer the question, however, of what it
will do at the next election. Its holding position is clearly that it
will have a review. The Labour party knows that to go into the next
election campaigning for an increase to the 50p rate would simply
underline that it is anti-enterprise. It knows such an increase would
damage the economy and is trying to find an escape route. Despite all
the bluster in all the speeches we have heard today, Labour will not
confirm that that is the policy it supports. It is all about posturing,
not about practicality. That is why they did not have a 50p rate when
they were in government and why they are trying to slip away from it
now, hoping that no one will notice. I recommend that clauses 1 and 16
and schedule three stand part of the Bill and we hope that they will
have all-party
support<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T13:27:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Jamieson:</Member></B> I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his
intervention. Given that I have not really got under way with all the
details of the new clause, I will come to those points later. However,
I will say that one thing we know is that the Office for Budget
Responsibility has halved the growth forecast for this year and
downgraded it again for next year, so we are not in a situation of
strong growth. The Government really have to take responsibility for
that, because since the Chancellor’s spending review in 2010 the
UK economy has grown by just 0.7%, compared with the 5.3% forecast at
the time. I do not think that anyone could suggest that that was
particularly successful. Last year, of course, the UK went through a
double-dip recession and the economy shrank by 0.3% in the last
quarter<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T13:46:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041826001027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130418/debtext/130418-0002.htm#13041826001027"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Redwood" PimsId="329" UID="13041826002485" xid="496" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130418/debtext/130418-0002.htm#13041826002485">Mr
Redwood:</Member></B> The hon. Lady is quite right that growth has been
very disappointing and that the forecasts have been revised downwards,
but we are debating her policy, which is that VAT should go up again
when the UK economy returns to “strong growth.” It is a
very simple question: can she tell us what strong growth would trigger
an increase in
VAT<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T13:47:16"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041826001028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130418/debtext/130418-0002.htm#13041826001028"><B><Member ContinuationText="Cathy Jamieson" PimsId="1152" UID="13041826002486" xid="1099" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130418/debtext/130418-0002.htm#13041826002486">Cathy
Jamieson:</Member></B> As I have indicated to the right hon. Gentleman,
whose views I listen to and who always raises pertinent questions, I
will come to that, but the Government must also take responsibility
for, as we heard in the previous debate, trying to give all sorts of
reasons why the economy has not recovered. As
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T13:47:40"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne North (Catherine McKinnell)
suggested, we were surprised to hear that the latest reason given seems
to be the issue of the 50p tax rate, rather than looking at the
situation in the round. I want to talk a little more about some of the
issues that the economy currently faces and why we think our proposal
is one way of stimulating the economy and looking to the future in
order to help local
businesses<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T13:48:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood) asks is valid. Does “strong
growth” mean consistently positive growth and, if so, at what
level and for how long, or would it require a return to trend growth of
about 2.5% and, if so, for how long, or would it require above-trend
growth and, if so, for how long? To have an open-ended commitment to
lose potentially £10 million a year for some years would be
quite a serious and significant thing, irrespective of the positive

has some sympathy with our proposal—I suspect that we might not
have the same agreement over some of the other issues up for debate
today. He raises important issues. That is why, through new clause 2,
we want to ensure that a report would be produced. We are calling on
the Government to do that now, rather than put it off into the future.
The Government could put in place monitoring measures now; that would
allow for a temporary VAT cut, which would help stimulate the
economy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041826001032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130418/debtext/130418-0002.htm#13041826001032">Borrowing
to pay for the cost of economic failure has risen—it is now
forecast to be £245 billion more than planned at the time of the

We argue that the new clause would be part of a package of measures. We
have heard about other initiatives that could be brought forward, and
it is important to recognise that others in industry and business are
also saying that one way to stimulate the economy would be to introduce
at least a temporary cut in VAT. There are serious questions to be
asked about the other issues, but if we could get unanimity about this
issue, it might be possible for the Government to consider it and bring
forward further
proposals.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041826001038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130418/debtext/130418-0002.htm#13041826001038">In
the Budget, the Government had the opportunity to change course, make
the necessary changes and kick-start the economy. Sadly, however, more
and more commentators are reflecting that all we got was more of the
same from the downgraded Chancellor. As a result, the cost of living
for people up and down the country is rising day by day. The economy is
flatlining, inflation remains high and food bills are rising. Energy
bills are soaring, thanks to the Government’s failure to break
the stranglehold of the big six energy companies. The Office for Budget
Responsibility’s most recent figures show that people will be
worse off in 2015 than when the Government came to office.</hs_Para>

for people is that real wages are now £17,000 a year smaller
than they were in 2010. To add to that hardship, any benefit
that hard-working people might have received from the
Government’s much trumpeted rise in the personal allowance has
been uniformly swept aside by the raft of tax and benefit
changes that the Government have made since 2010. Those changes mean
that families will be an average of £891 worse off in the new
financial year, according to the analysis of figures made by
the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies—even more money out

any benefit from the rise of the personal allowance would have been

election, families of all incomes will lose more from the VAT rise than
they will gain from the increase in the personal allowance and the

They are now under pressure from the flatlining economy. Consumer
spending has been constrained by high inflation and stagnant wages,
leading to a 6% fall in real disposable income in 2008, with a
devastating impact on our local high streets. Shops are lying empty,
with a threefold increase in that trend since 2008. Household names
such as HMV, JJB Sports, Blockbusters and Comet have been forced to
close a large number of stores or to shut up shop completely. It is
estimated that last year 1,800 shops were forced to close—a
staggering tenfold increase on the year before. We have heard about the
impact on the pub industry, and there has been a call for the VAT rate

people back to work and to get projects under way. Sadly, Project
Merlin did not deliver the new era of loans that it was supposed to. We
learned this week that lending to UK businesses fell by £2
billion in December alone, and it is down by £18.6 billion over
the past year, while businesses continue to suffer. The Business

boasted at his party conference that he would set up a
Government-backed bank to get billions of pounds to businesses that

Members the opportunity to raise issues on behalf of their constituents
and put the case to the Government. There are things we can do to help
businesses and individuals through these tough times. We could reform
the funding for lending scheme so that banks can access the lowest
rates of funding only if they increase lending to businesses as well as
overall lending, and extend it beyond the end of 2013, as currently
envisaged by the Government, to the end of 2014. Let us do what every
other G8 economy has done and set up a state-backed investment
institution to provide credit to small businesses where others will not
by establishing a proper British investment bank. As we 
<?notus-xml column=547?>have argued, that could be done through a new network of regional banks
like the German Sparkassen. That would also help to return SMEs to a
local relationship with banking, with managers who know what is needed
on the ground and have the discretion to make local lending decisions.
Regional banks are committed to their regions and in touch with local
business. We have called for, and will

Government accepted all those proposals and they were acted on today,
the benefits would take some time to come to the fore and to be felt.
However, the one step we could take now that would immediately make a
difference would be for the Government to agree to reduce VAT to 17.5%
to put money back into the pockets of hard-working people and give a
stimulus to local economies. That would put something back into the pot
to help the local businesses we have talked about, whether by reducing
fuel costs or stimulating the economy such that people feel that they
are able to spend again.

official forecasters at the Office for Budget Responsibility thought
there would be strong growth over the past three years, because they
knew that the official policy on the Royal Bank of Scotland, which is
largely state owned, was to push the bank through the most enormous

want to see 
<?notus-xml column=548?>the things that really make a difference to the economy. I submit that

itself—I am enough of a politician to realise the politics of
all this—but if we target one of our biggest and most successful
industries of the previous decade and force it into slimming down
measures and tax it more, we should expect a drop in output, and that
is what has happened. One of the reasons why we do not have much growth
in this country is that our lead sector of the previous decade has
taken such a big hit and is now so politically unpopular that pressures

pursue to stimulate more finds and exploitation, but some of the big,
successful reservoirs of previous years are now ageing, so whoever was
running the country was going to experience a reduction in output from

problem with the proposed new clause’s VAT measure is that it is
so expensive and I do not think we would get a big enough return for
the colossal loss of revenue that it would cause. We have already heard
an estimate of about £10 billion, but the Labour Opposition have
given us no figures whatsoever. They have not told us how much it would
cost, how long it would be a concessionary rate and on what conditions
they would return to the new rate. That weakens their case, because if
they wish to make this a serious policy, they need to cost it and
explain by how much the deficit would rise in the early stages and at
what point the growth would accelerate enough to start to generate
serious revenues from increased

evidence seems to be that, whereas it is possible to do serious damage
to the revenues generated by income tax and capital gains tax if the
rates are put up too much—I fear that that is what has happened
under the Labour and coalition Governments in recent years—it is
more difficult to depress the revenues of VAT. Indeed, the increase
from 17.5% to 20% actually produced some increase in revenue, despite
the poor performance of the economy, so the argument that cutting the
rate generates more revenue—economists call it the Laffer curve
argument—does not apply in the same way as it does to 
<?notus-xml column=549?>taxes geared towards gains and income, whereby more realistic rates
would do two good things, namely generate more growth and, therefore,
more tax revenue. I fear that the problem with the VAT proposal is that
this short-term measure would definitely increase the deficit and that
the stimulus from VAT would not be sufficient to replace the lost
revenue in any serious period of time over which this experiment might
be tried.</hs_Para>

is evidence that along with other measures—it cannot be seen in
isolation—the previous Government’s VAT reduction from
17.5% to 15% actually helped the economy at a difficult time. The car
scrappage and other short-term schemes were also introduced to boost
the economy. The Government should be considering those sorts of
things, rather than just blaming others. The economy is at a difficult
juncture. Unemployment is rising again, after temporarily falling: 2.54
million people are on the dole—that is mass
unemployment—and are not spending. Helping them, with their
small incomes, by reducing VAT would have a big impact on the economy.

There is flexibility when it comes to reducing the rate, but the
difficulty is that if one plucks a particular item, such as petrol, and
reduces VAT on that alone, as his party advocated, it would need to be
consistent with the VAT directives and that would require a derogation,
which would take some years. The concerns we raised related to the

accept that the poorest in the country, on the lowest wages, will
benefit from the change to income tax thresholds, but they will lose
out overall. The TUC is not alone in making this point. The Institute
for Fiscal Studies has said that the combined tax increases, of which
there have been several, both direct and indirect, will make the
average family £900 worse off. If families are worse off in this
country, spending is reduced and the economy is bound to contract. That
is basic economics. We need to stimulate the economy, and one way of
doing it correctly is to reduce VAT temporarily from 20% to 17.5%. Let

living is one of the defining issues of this Parliament not only
because of what the Government are doing but because of what they are
not doing. Following the announcement yesterday of a huge increase in
unemployment—12,000 in the north-east of England—in the

Chancellor’s VAT hike has been shown to be a mistake and it is
hitting the vulnerable and those on the lower end of the income scale
the hardest. Yes, one of the millionaires who uses his £100,000
tax cut under this Government will pay more VAT than the vast majority
of other people when he buys himself a luxury car, but that will not
make the difference to whether or not he can buy an extra loaf
of bread or a pound of mince for his family’s evening
meal. A cut in VAT of 2.5% may just buy some extra peanuts when the
banker buys his champagne to celebrate his latest million-pound bonus,
but it is the people earning peanuts for working hard to support their
families who can put the extra pound or two from a cut to good
use.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041826001117" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130418/debtext/130418-0003.htm#13041826001117">The
previous Labour Government showed that that works when they temporarily
reduced VAT to 15%. The reduced tax on sales provided an effective

hard.</hs_Para>

have news for the Chancellor. Contrary to his blinkered view,
solicitors and captains of industry do not encompass the full
imaginable spectrum of socio-economic status. Not everyone out there
can absorb VAT increases and not notice the difference. One has to add
teachers, police, social workers, canteen cleaners, domestic staff,
joiners, bricklayers, call centre staff, health care assistants and so
many more to one’s list of acquaintances if one is really to
understand the impact of his policies on
people.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041826001122" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130418/debtext/130418-0003.htm#13041826001122">The
statistics speak for themselves. The impact of the VAT increase will
cost the lowest-paid workers four times more than any gain from the
£10,000 personal allowance, when it is introduced in 2014. Like
other Labour Members, I approve of the allowance being at that level.
It is good that hard-working families can get extra money, but when the
Government take it away with the other hand and people end up paying
more, that is not a good thing.</hs_Para>

are also up. I know it has probably been a long time since the
Chancellor has nipped around the supermarket to do his weekly shop, if
he ever has done so, but if he did so regularly he would see that food
and other grocery shop prices are somewhat higher than he imagined and,
for many items, way ahead of what his inflation figures are suggesting.
Whether it is the price of caulies or a budget chicken, my constituents
tell me they are having to pay more, or sadly just do without. Families
at the bottom of the income scale—on average, on £53.81 a
week—will suffer a 6.3% drop in their overall income following
the VAT rise, personal allowance increase and other minor tax
changes.</hs_Para>

am unsure why the Government would oppose reducing this regressive
burden, and I very much support my Front-Bench colleagues in arguing
for a temporary cut, which would put extra pounds and pennies in
people’s pockets, which they would spend in our economy.
However, it is not just VAT that is making life more expensive for
those without well paid jobs, investment portfolios, or savings to
support them, like the Chancellor’s solicitor friends in
Kew.</hs_Para>

Housing Federation estimates that, across Stockton borough, there are
2,806 losers from the imposition of the bedroom tax. There is a
shortage of one-bedroom properties for tenants to move to, so they have
nowhere to go. Why are the Government penalising my constituents for
choosing not to move to properties that do not exist? How can that be
fair? Any reduction in VAT, if not used to put a better meal on the
table, could at least contribute a little to that extra rent
burden.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041826001126" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130418/debtext/130418-0003.htm#13041826001126">Again,
I say that it is not only VAT and the bedroom tax. Changes to council
tax benefit are adding yet more to the cost of living in areas such as
my own. Hundreds of my constituents will see their council tax rise by
around £3 per week, or £156 a year—money taken
away by the Government.</hs_Para>

man who suffers from a degenerative condition came to my advice surgery
to tell me that he had a choice: either he paid the council tax
contribution, or he bought his prescription certificate, which provided
best value for money for his medication. As he buys medicine, food and
little else, I know that any cut in VAT would put only a few extra
pence in his pocket, but he is simply desperate. Ministers—I
nearly said monsters—will be delighted that he blamed the local
council for that new expense, but rest assured that he is now in no
doubt about who is responsible for taking the very medicine out of his
mouth, and I am looking across the Chamber at
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041826001128" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130418/debtext/130418-0003.htm#13041826001128">We
are also feeling the impact of the 1% increase in annual benefit rates,
which as hon. Members will know is a real-terms cut. There are 7,900
people in my constituency claiming working tax credit, and 15,000
across Stockton borough as a whole. Each of those people will see a
real-terms cut thanks to higher inflation, which has been caused, in
part, by the VAT
rise.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041826001129" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130418/debtext/130418-0003.htm#13041826001129">The
same goes for the minimum wage. Although the Government have talked
about an increase, this is a real cut in the value of the wage of some
of the hardest working and poorest paid in our society. Cutting VAT
would allow us to increase the spending power of those on the minimum
wage, although I for one would rather see the wage index-linked at
least as we move towards a real living
wage.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041826001130" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130418/debtext/130418-0003.htm#13041826001130">In
my constituency, people on very low incomes will be asked to pay sums
of money they simply cannot afford. Like the VAT rise, these policies
impact on those least able to bear the burden of their weight, and
combine to place near unbearable pressure on them. I support the new
clause because I recognise the immense strain that the sky-rocketing
cost of living is imposing on people across the country.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13041826001131" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130418/debtext/130418-0003.htm#13041826001131">A lower VAT
rate would not just ease the strain on families and individuals
buckling under the weight of the cost of living; it would also help to
lower the cost of those things that contribute to that weight.
I know VAT is at a lower rate on domestic fuel bills, but I return yet
again to the fact that a cut in VAT for everything else, including
petrol and diesel, would make life easier for energy customers who have
never needed it more than they do now. Everyone is aware of the
rocketing cost of energy. Electricity and gas bills have risen by 145%
over the past decade, and at £1,653 a year they account for
almost one fifth of household costs and represent the second
biggest share of household expenses, having overtaken council tax. Yet
even this week, we read in <I>The Observer</I> that the big six energy
companies are making more profit per household than ever
before.</hs_Para>

recent survey by uSwitch found that 14% of households were in debt to
their energy supplier, with the average amount owed standing at 4%
higher than last year at £131. This is pushing people into fuel
poverty. Department of Energy and Climate Change projections for 2012
show that the number of people in fuel poverty across the country is
likely to rise to 3.9 million, a situation that is fuelled by increases
in energy prices.</hs_Para>

Stockton borough, my local council has pioneered a unique external
cladding and insulation project that has focused on private sector
homes and helped to bring energy bills down. Unfortunately, the

only cancelled out the council’s good work but reversed any
progress that has been
made.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041826001134" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130418/debtext/130418-0003.htm#13041826001134">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T14:49:35"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T14:49:46"></hs_TimeCode>
same goes for vehicle fuel. The Chancellor has repeatedly made great
play in his Budgets of freezing fuel duty, but he has increased the
cost with the increase in VAT. A temporary cut would put money in the
pockets of motorists and help to stimulate our economy, making it
easier for people in rural areas and commuter towns to get to and from
work. More than that, it would reduce costs for haulage companies who
would charge less for transporting the goods that we need in our shops,
again helping to cut

urge all Members to support the amendment to reduce VAT, which would

is blatantly obvious that families up and down the country are paying
the price of the Government’s failure to come to terms with the
economy and to create growth and prosperity for all. The cost of living
has never been higher. I speak as someone who brought up a family in
the 1980s, and I thought that times were hard then. I am now seeing
those circumstances repeated in my constituency. My constituents,

of the indicators is the rise in unemployment, yet again, across the
country. That illustrates that times are doubly hard for those who can
least afford it and who are struggling to get employment. In my
constituency, we have been fortunate in keeping unemployment down.
Before Government Members jump to their feet saying, “We did it
for Inverclyde”, however, let me advise them that they did not.
The reason that we have been so successful in reducing youth
unemployment is that my Labour-led council has put its money where its
mouth is and continued with the future jobs fund for the past two
years, to ensure that our young people have a future. It has ensured
that they have employment not just for a few weeks or months, and it
has gone back to the employers and the young people to ensure that
their employment is sustainable for years. Now, 80% of those given
employment places have remained in them for more than a year, and we
are glad that that success is doing something to alleviate unemployment
among young people in Inverclyde.</hs_Para>

however, there has been little impact on those who have been unemployed
for more than two years, and the Government have offered them no
assistance other than shipping them off to a private firm to be placed
in employment somewhere for a week or
two<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T14:52:42"></hs_TimeCode>. It is clear

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T14:53:20"></hs_TimeCode>The cost of
living has never been higher, and that is partly due to increased food

trolley, and more and more going into the till at the end of my
shopping trip. Even those families who are thrifty and who shop around

proposal to cut VAT. Even with the best will in the world, investment
in infrastructure can take a long time to get through all the
resistance, which is why even now, after up to three years of trying,
we are still not seeing the full benefits of that, whereas a cut in VAT
would have an immediate effect on the high street, and on construction

McKenzie:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. I visited
some of the employers in my area in the Easter recess. Time and again
they told me they needed a stimulus to the local economy from a VAT
cut, to get people spending and buying things. My local construction
firms in particular said they needed a reduction in VAT to get people
to consider going ahead with smaller projects such as house
improvements, thus creating employment locally. They felt a VAT cut
would serve to stimulate that local growth and get things moving;
otherwise, they could see only a bleak future, if any future at all,
for the construction industry. They also brought up the continuing
difficulty of being closed out of local and national Government
contracts. The procurement process still seems to be far too complex
and to exclude the small and medium-sized businesses that could
stimulate the local
economy.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13041826001653" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130418/debtext/130418-0003.htm#13041826001653">3

key part of that has been to increase the personal allowance. Clause 3
will ensure that the benefits of that increase are shared fairly. In
2010, when the coalition was formed, individuals could earn just
£6,475 before they began to pay income tax. Thanks to the
actions of this Government, from April next year, the figure will be
£10,000. That is an increase of £3,525, which means 
<?notus-xml column=561?>that the personal allowance will have risen by more than 50% in just
four years, thereby helping our constituents with the cost of living.

been to help those on low and middle incomes, and we have. The changes

Friend the Member for Peterborough (Mr Jackson)? Will it be through
higher taxes, a reduction in spending or—as we believe—an
increase in borrowing? What consideration has been given to the impact
on the cost of borrowing? A 1% increase in Government bond yields would
add around £8 billion to annual debt interest payments by
2017-18 and result in an increase of £12 billion in
households’ mortgage interest payments—the equivalent of
£1,000 for a household with an average mortgage in its first
year. Has the Labour party considered the consequences of that
discretionary fiscal stimulus?</hs_Para>

is Labour’s view on the profile of deficit reduction? We believe
that over the whole deficit reduction period, 80% should be achieved
through spending cuts and 20% through tax increases. The Darling plan
had two thirds on spending cuts and one third on tax increases. What is
the view of the Labour party, given that it has put in front of the
Committee a proposal for a £12 billion or £13 billion tax
cut? Does it suggest that the ratio should lean more towards public
spending cuts rather than tax rises? What assessment has Labour made of
the impact of different taxes on the economy?

however welcome they are and regardless of the difficulties raised
concerning those who will not necessarily benefit, will in part be

do not want to repeat the points we made in the earlier debate, but
extensive mention has been made of the fact that the Opposition will
welcome any steps that will help families and hard-working people
through these tough economic times. However, we do not believe that
these measures go nearly far enough to make up for what many basic rate
taxpayers have already lost thanks to the tax and benefit changes made
by this Government. Those measures have indisputably taken money out of
the pockets of people who need it.</hs_Para>

is important that we consider the changes in the round rather than
focusing on individual measures. That is why we, through a fairly
mild-mannered amendment, are calling on the Government to produce a
report that would comprehensively assess the impact of changes to
taxation on the living standards of basic rate taxpayers. As we all
know, times are incredibly tough for families up and down the country,

people will lose an average of £728 a year or £14 a week
as a result of the “bedroom tax”, according to figures

brought forward to 2014 the date at which the threshold will reach the
magic number of £10,000. However, today we should open a debate
about that number. The figure of £10,000 was not worked out by
economists or in careful consultation with employers and workers, nor

the Conservative party missed out by not making that promise ourselves.

is part of the issue, but we certainly did not see things in terms of

is all very well for the Government to say, “We’re
leaving you your own money so that is fine,” but the bottom line
is that people have less money in their pockets. What has been
suggested is a give-away in income tax is more than balanced, for many
low-paid workers, by the reduction in tax credits and other provision.
What matters to those people is how much they have to spend. Saying,
“Oh, it’s wonderful that you’re getting to keep

with child care is similar. The hon. Member for Worcester was right to

only that, but there are changes to the restrictions and conditions put
on to single parents when they go back into work. Under the previous
Government, they had real flexibility and an understanding that the
kind of work they could do had to tie in with their family and caring
responsibilities. Those flexibilities are going to be swept aside under
universal credit. The regulations now contain only one from a whole

other respects, strangely, the Government are not so keen on people
keeping their own money. Some changes have actually punished people for
saving and being careful. One of those was the restriction on the
receipt of employment and support allowance to a year. That means that
at the end of that year, people who have savings, or have an early
retirement pension because they retired sick, or have a partner in work
but often only part-time work, no longer receive the benefit, so

Gauke:</Member></B> Clause 3 sets the basic rate limit for income tax
for the 2013-14 tax year. Let me make it clear at the outset, as I did
in the previous debate, that we understand the financial pressures
faced by households. As a Government, we have taken action to reward
employment and to support hard-working families. That is why we have
increased the personal allowance. I endorse the remarks made by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T15:47:53"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Worcester (Mr Walker) in support of the policy we have
pursued. Budget 2013 announced that we will go further, with the
personal allowance increasing by a further £560 to reach
£10,000 in 2014-15, meeting the Government’s commitment a
whole year early. These changes will benefit 25 million individuals and
will take 2.7 million people out of income tax altogether by April
2014<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T15:48:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041832000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130418/debtext/130418-0003.htm#13041832000060">Clause
3 reduces the basic rate limit by £2,360 to £32,010 in
2013-14. When combined with the £1,335 increase in the personal
allowance provided for by clause 2, the higher rate tax threshold for
2013-14 will be reduced to £41,450. This allowance increase will
benefit all taxpayers with incomes below £116,000 by £200
a year on average in real terms. About 30% of the gains from the
personal allowance increase for 2013-14 will be shared with most
higher-rate taxpayers. The national insurance upper earnings and
profits limits remain aligned with the higher rate tax
threshold<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T15:49:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041832000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130418/debtext/130418-0003.htm#13041832000061">It
might be helpful if I set out the reasons for this change. I have
explained that this coalition Government are committed to creating a
fairer tax system that rewards work, with real-terms progress every
year towards increasing the personal allowance to £10,000. We
are meeting that target one year ahead of schedule and the final step
towards it will be legislated on in next year’s Finance Bill.
For now, the £1,335 increase in the personal allowance,
introduced by clause 2, represents a major milestone on the journey to
£10,000<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T15:49:59"></hs_TimeCode>.
The changes that we are making for the 2013-14 tax year will lift an
additional 1.1 million individuals out of income tax altogether and
give 24 million taxpayers an average real-terms gain of more than
£200 a year. For the typical basic rate taxpayer, that will mean
an extra £267 of cash in their pocket for 2013-14, which
is an extra £5 a week since the start of the new tax
year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T15:50:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041832000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130418/debtext/130418-0003.htm#13041832000062">On
the specific issue of gains for higher rate taxpayers, when increasing
the personal allowance by £10,000 in 2011-12 we also had to make
sure it was consistent with bringing the public finances under control.
Therefore, higher rate taxpayers did not benefit from that increase.
However, we decided that the benefits of later increases 
<?notus-xml column=574?>should be shared with higher rate taxpayers. This supports growth by
increasing the rewards to work for a wide range of
individuals.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041832000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130418/debtext/130418-0003.htm#13041832000063">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T15:51:01"></hs_TimeCode>

the fair implementation of the child benefit reforms. However, gains

be cash increases, the first in this Parliament, and they will ensure
that higher rate taxpayers will gain equally from future increases to
the personal allowance. The Government recognise that these are
below-inflation increases, so they also raise about £1 billion
in revenue to support our efforts to deal with the large deficit we

published at the Budget shows that the top 20% of households continue

will give four reasons why APD should be devolved to Scotland. First,
APD is making Scottish airports uncompetitive in their efforts to
attract new direct international routes. It is needlessly restricting

that direct air connections
bring.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041832000571" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130418/debtext/130418-0003.htm#13041832000571">Secondly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T16:23:39"></hs_TimeCode>,
APD is designed for the circumstances in the south-east of England, not
the rest of the UK. It is, at best, a demand-management tool for
Heathrow—a stretched airport that will have no further runways
until one is built in a panic in a few years’ time, as
Ryanair’s Michael O’Leary predicts. Heathrow needs demand
to be limited because it is at capacity and the Chancellor therefore
has a coincidental fiscal cash cow. Scottish airports have the capacity
for growth and this tax 
<?notus-xml column=587?>blocks it. Independent control over APD through devolved powers would
give Scotland the ability to meet its own needs rather than
Heathrow’s<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T16:24:01"></hs_TimeCode>.
My view of demand management is supported by the chief executive of the
Scottish Chambers of Commerce, Liz Cameron, who

rates of APD seem more suited to controlling capacity constraints at
Heathrow than they do with the needs of regional airports, and
devolution of this tax would afford the Scottish Government the
opportunity to create an air transport package for Scotland designed to
improve our direct international

a Scottish aviation tax regime would incentivise the introduction of
new direct international services, which is important for business
connectivity and in-bound tourism. We could do that by reducing the
rate of duty, or indeed exempting it, in the early years of a new
service—the most challenging financial period—until a
route is established.</hs_Para>

the Treasury said that it is devolving “aspects” of APD

has specific and long-running competitive disadvantages that need to be

is important to put on the record that Northern Ireland has an

operates from Dublin, which is 90 miles down the road, to Newark. In
the last number of years, the business in Northern Ireland was put
under threat for one reason only: the airport authority and
the carrier had to subsidise one another to the tune of
£1.5 million. Had they not done so, the business would not
exist, and people would be forced to travel 90 miles down the road and

the revenue gathered from the minor taxes, although not insignificant,
is relatively small in comparison with the revenue that would be
available through the income tax-sharing arrangement recommended by the

10p in every pound of income tax raised in Wales. It would enable the
Welsh Government to increase their borrowing capacity substantially,
and would strengthen the accountability test. My intention is to return
to that at a later stage of the Bill’s progress. It would also
undoubtedly incentivise the Welsh Government to grow the economy in
Wales and provide responsibility for its expenditure. It is also clear
that fair funding and the proper resolution of the blatant inadequacies

interesting point. In that debate in November, a number of hon. Members
from different parts of the UK acknowledged that there were concerns
and there needed to be a fresh look at the issue of APD, not only to
tackle congestion in the south-east, but to recognise some of the
representations made not only by Scottish and Welsh airports, but by
those in the north-east—specifically, Newcastle and Manchester

stage, the general view of those representations was that the issue did
not affect only Scotland and Wales; it affected the wider UK. Air
passenger duty puts a significant amount of funding into the Treasury

of the questions raised is, “Why have the Government devolved
elements of APD to Northern Ireland, but not to Scotland and
Wales?” The Finance Act 2012 devolved to the Northern Ireland
Assembly the power to set rates on direct long-haul flights. The rate
on short-haul flights remains the same as for those from the rest of
the UK. The decision to devolve direct long-haul rates to Northern
Ireland was a reflection of the unique challenges faced there. As we

is the only part of the UK to share a land border with another EU
member state with a lower rate of aviation tax. The UK Government are
committed to devolving tax powers where it is to the benefit of the UK
as a whole. This is evident from the devolution to Scotland of the
stamp duty land tax and the landfill tax, which amounts to the biggest
transfer of fiscal powers from London to Scotland in 300

are working closely with the Northern Ireland Executive to consider
options for rebalancing the Northern Ireland economy, and we are
carefully considering the recommendations of the Silk commission in
Wales. Any devolution of APD, however, must take into account the broad
range of views on this subject. In response to the 2011 consultation on
APD, a substantial number of stakeholders raised concerns about
devolution complicating the APD system and creating distortions in the
markets for flights. This concern was reinforced in a recent
report by HMRC suggesting that the devolution of APD could
lead to market distortion as a result of passenger redistributions
between UK airports, without substantially increasing demand for
aviation overall.</hs_Para>

considering whether to devolve APD, hon. Members will surely agree that
we must assess the risk of replicating the same problems that Northern
Ireland faced from lower aviation taxes in the Republic of Ireland.
There is clearly a concern about an immediate cut in APD rates for
direct long-haul flights from Wales. The Government therefore believe
that the devolution of APD is a subject that requires continued and
careful evaluation, if we are to be confident about its potential
effects across the country as a whole. In undertaking this evaluation,
we should take note of recent data showing that passenger numbers are
growing at Scottish airports. Between 2010 and 2011, numbers grew by
5.5% and continued to grow last year as well. In fact, Glasgow airport
achieved growth of 4% in 2012, Aberdeen airport recently achieved 24
months of consecutive growth and Edinburgh airport will provide more

Member for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (Jonathan Edwards) made a very
strong speech—a star speech, in fact. He mentioned the Silk
commission and Labour’s immediate need to devolve APD—it
was the other week, but of course there is no sign of Welsh Labour in
this place today. The word “immediate” has a different
meaning for Labour Welsh Members from its meaning for the rest of the
English-speaking world. The hon. Gentleman certainly gave us a scary
update of the economic situation in Wales, where people face the double
whammy of Labour in 
<?notus-xml column=604?>Cardiff and the Tories in London, with their wee pals in Westminster,
the Liberals, giving them a hand. He reminded my colleagues just how
fortunate we are to have the SNP Government in Scotland, led by
luminaries such as Michael Russell, Kenny MacAskill, Nicola Sturgeon,
Alex Neil, John Swinney and, of course, Alex Salmond, the First
Minister.</hs_Para>

does not want to give powers to the Labour Cardiff branch. Clearly, the
Labour brothers in Wales are as happy a band as those in Scotland. We

failed to answer the question. He was even offered the policy free by
the SNP, but he would not adopt it, just in case, such was the level of
uncertainty. He is a nice fellow but his politics are sadly lacking.
The arms are open—if he wants to cross the Floor and join the

seems to be unable to make the case himself for APD to be

more growth in Scotland benefits us all, as more growth in the Republic
of Ireland and France surely benefits us all? We should be moving with
a big heart to ensure that that can happen everywhere and not be
stifling growth. The hon. Lady is a sensible woman and in her heart of

unfortunately is employing again the Bain principle: no matter what the

independence for Scotland. We have seen that time after time,

caused a competitive disadvantage to the UK compared with other

as I will now call it, attempted to downgrade maternity services once
before, in 2007, but East Sussex county council’s health
overview and scrutiny committee, or HOSC, had severe reservations and
duly referred the plans to the then Secretary of State, the right hon.
Member for Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle (Alan Johnson), who

the Minister will be all too aware, the IRP is the independent expert

contested reconfiguration proposals in England. In 2008, it finally
published its recommendations, which were that consultant-led
maternity, special care baby, in-patient gynaecology and related
services must be retained on both sites—at Eastbourne district
general hospital and Conquest hospital at

IRP felt that the trust did not make a clear case for safer and more
sustainable services for the people of East Sussex and specifically
that the proposals reduced accessibility compared with current service
provision and that the journey from the DGH to the Conquest hospital
posed a risk of incidents for women, especially during unexpected
transfers.</hs_Para>

clear guidance from the IRP on how the hospital trust must remedy the
problem, four years later a report from the national clinical advisory
team, or NCAT, has deemed maternity services in East Sussex unsafe.
That has given ESHT the opportunity to downgrade Eastbourne’s
maternity from a consultant-led department to a midwife-led department
almost immediately and, because safety is involved, without
consultation.

found ourselves back where we were, with my hospital losing its

fought and won all those years ago, only now it seems it was a pyrrhic
victory and that in fact we have lost. Eastbourne is to forgo its
consultant-led maternity after all. Frankly, I think that is

me move<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T18:08:59"></hs_TimeCode> to the
current proposals. The main incidents that led to the safety issues,
according to the NCAT report, were problems related to staffing. For
instance, emergency measures were required in September 2012 owing to
the vacancies for middle-grade doctors and the absence of two
consultants, as well as midwifery absences running at about 13%.
However, on drilling down into the data, I discovered that the absence
of one of the two consultants was due to retirement, and approximately
half the midwifery absences were due to maternity leave, all of which,
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T18:10:23"></hs_TimeCode>obviously, would
have been known in advance. Importantly, other than that,
the turnover of midwives was reported as
low<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T18:10:07"></hs_TimeCode>. This
clearly shows an acute lack of planning and poor senior leadership.

what are, naturally, incredibly important concerns to my constituents.
For instance, I wrote to the Secretary of State twice on 15 March when
the shock news about consultant-led maternity services being switched

before the maternity and paediatric downgrade, the hospital trust also

Secretary of State. We made it clear to him that the
proposals to remove orthopaedics and general surgery from
Eastbourne DGH did not meet all the Government’s four
reconfiguration tests. I showed him the meeting papers which clearly
state that our local GP commissioners did not support the move. The

trusts properly implement IRP recommendations, as it is clear in my
view and that of others that the trust never sincerely implemented the
series of recommendations made by the IRP, which were to maintain two
sustainable and consultant-led maternity units. This obvious lack of
commitment properly to implement the IRP recommendations was made
crystal clear, as I said earlier in my speech, by the

I would like the Minister to arrange for me and the cross-party Save
the DGH campaign team, which is ably led by the tenacious campaigner

Eastbourne will have the worst population access factor in the UK. The

during their pregnancy. Although I accept that expectant mothers will
be screened and those found to be at increased risk will be directed to
have their babies at a consultant-led unit in Hastings or Brighton, the
original IRP report concluded that the risk to mothers was
unquantifiable, and the very nature of birth means that there will be
examples of mothers who have been screened with no problems detected
going on to experience complications. With around 2,000 births in
Eastbourne last year, that is an awful lot of pregnant mothers having
to be shipped, by blue-light services, across to Conquest

the FMU to arrival in the receiving bed at the obstetrics unit,
incorporating the time for the ambulance to arrive, park, load, travel

baby will then need to be retrieved by the neonatal transfer team to

30 miles to the west, bypassing the DGH. The mother will
also require transfer to the post-natal unit in Brighton in order to be

is not only the downgrade of our maternity services that angers me;
there is also the decision to close in-patient paediatrics at the DGH.
By bundling everything under the “safety” umbrella, the
trust has been able to bypass due process on the basis that NCAT
recommends that maternity and paediatric services be co-located. In
fact, horrifyingly, the NCAT report also states that all core services
should be co-located on one site. Will the trust be able to bypass

are profoundly fearful about going public. That puts me, their elected
representative, in a very difficult position. I will not breach their
confidentiality without permission and they do not give their

then able to pooh-pooh my concerns and public statements as not being

that not only prevents staff members from bringing their concerns to

they can be replaced with a more capable leadership team. The issue

four key points. First, how have maternity services at the DGH been
allowed to get to the current “unsafe” position despite
the 2008 IRP recommendations being utterly emphatic that consultant-led
maternity must remain on both sites? Secondly, were the 2008 IRP
recommendations ever properly implemented by ESHT? My constituents and
I have lost so much trust as a result of this sorry episode that we
would insist, reasonably, that the whole process should be
independently audited by medical experts. Was the 2008 IRP-recommended
report ever properly

general terms, we attach importance to the UNFCCC process. It is the
international route for trying to reach agreement on how to tackle
climate change. It is clearly—evidence shows this—a
tortuous route, so while we affirm our belief in its vital importance,
we should not feel dismayed or frustrated by the lack of progress.
There is a danger in thinking that unless we reach a global agreement,
nothing much will have come out of this. I believe that the existence
of the UNFCCC process is a valuable spur to countries doing things
individually.

pleased that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office is supporting GLOBE;
it should continue to do so, because of the beneficial impact it has
had. Interestingly, there is also some correlation between the location
of the conference of the parties meetings and progress by individual
countries. The progress made in Mexico and South Africa was encouraged
by the fact that they hosted COP meetings, and the selection of venues
for future COPs will have a bearing on further progress. When South
Korea was in the frame to host the COP last year, I was disappointed
that it was not chosen. South Korea is another high energy user with a
rapidly growing economy, and it has shown a lot of interest in wanting
to address the need for low-carbon technology.

think that the Government broadly share our view, but we are all aware
of the enormous practical obstacles. Nevertheless, I hope that we face
something of a critical moment in emissions trading, particularly after
this week’s vote in the European Parliament. It is much to be
regretted that the enormous impact of the recession on emissions in the
EU—reducing them to well below the pathway that would have been
realistically forecast five years ago—is not in any way
recognised through tightening of the limits in phase 3. We have seen
the effect of that on the carbon price. Alongside that, however, we can
take encouragement from the commencement of emissions trading in
California at the start of this year, where there seems to be real
commitment from the state, and the governor in particular, to making it
work, and from the emissions trading pilots under way in China, which
we will focus on in the second of the afternoon’s
debates.</hs_Para>

underlines the damage that the UK Treasury’s unilateral
imposition of a floor price for carbon could do to some sections of
British industry. That should now be seen and acknowledged for what it
is: a straightforward tax, introduced by the Treasury for
revenue-raising purposes. It will do nothing to reduce carbon
emissions; it might divert some emissions from this country to the rest
of the EU, and it might put British business at a competitive
disadvantage compared with the EU, just for the Treasury to collect
another few billion pounds a year. If the Treasury says,
“We’re going to have a tax,” that is fine, but do
not dress it up as an environmental measure, which, I am afraid, tends

happened with the carbon price and the announcement in the Finance Bill
about raising the carbon floor price will act as a direct subsidy to
nuclear production companies in this country, such as EDF, in a way
that will distort the market? Like him, I support nuclear, but we must

Friend has raised that point. I was suggesting a 30% target for the EU,
rather than for just the UK. I believe it is highly probable that
global concern about climate change will intensify substantially in the
next 15 to 20 years, and that by the mid-2020s large areas of the globe
will be covered by emissions trading and have carbon pricing
mechanisms. It is also likely that that will be supplemented, in many
countries, by carbon taxes. If that turns out to be the case—of
course, I cannot be sure it will—I believe that countries that
have moved more quickly towards low-carbon transport systems and
electricity generation, and energy-efficient low-carbon buildings of
all kinds, will have an economic advantage, as well as their having
done the right thing environmentally.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T14:03:00"></hs_TimeCode> probability
is that in that situation the costs attached to fossil fuel consumption
will become very
high.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041821000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130418/halltext/130418h0001.htm#13041821000033">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T14:03:00"></hs_TimeCode>
entirely accept that if my expectation is wrong, and if concern about
climate change decreases rather than increases, with the world being
quite happy to burn huge quantities of coal and gas, my judgment will
turn out to have been wrong and a fairly small competitive disadvantage
will have been suffered by countries that chose to diversify their
energy mix in the way I

in the past five or six years, the International Energy Agency
projections for gas consumption, particularly in Asia, and the
possibility of planning difficulties with the uncontrolled roll-out of
shale gas developments in this country, and I think that in policy
terms it is rash to believe, “We have a secure energy future by
saying it’s all going to come from gas.” I strongly
favour a diverse mix, with nuclear, low-carbon renewables and much more
emphasis on energy efficiency—a true “no regrets”

that, but the terms of trade in the debate have clearly shifted a lot
in the past year or so. The two big factors are, first, that the
recession seems to be longer and worse that we had thought—not
just in this country, but across the EU, although perhaps for slightly
different reasons, and, secondly, the extent of the competitive
advantage that shale gas now gives the US. Despite all that, if we say,
“Okay, that’s fine. Let’s not bother with nuclear
or low-carbon renewables, it’s all going to be gas,” we
might find that we are buying gas expensively from a variety of places,

and perhaps north America generally, enjoying a very low price, western
Europe enjoying perhaps a middle price and Asia possibly an even higher
price, depending on how discoveries go. At any rate, there is
absolutely no reason why the US should not sell its gas to the highest

There has always been a nation or some kind of empire leading the way
in development. In the UK, that happened during the industrial
revolution, which I do not think we should apologise for, because it
was an evolutionary step between what went before and what came after.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T14:11:41"></hs_TimeCode> have moved on
from there, and the next evolutionary step is to start to look after
our climate. I believe that, with the work that can be done and with

admit that I was not a member of the Select Committee when it drew up
the two reports that we are considering, so I cannot claim credit for
them or share in any blame. I put myself forward for the Committee
precisely because I was concerned about the rather over-cosy
relationship between it and the Government, which has allowed them
both, and the whole intellectual establishment in this country, to live
in a dream world on energy and climate change issues. Mercifully,
through the operation of a secret ballot, I was elected to the

whom the gods wish to destroy they first make mad. One of the early
signs of madness is an indulgence in compulsive displacement activity,
which could not be a better description of the whole COP process. Tens
of thousands of people are displaced across the globe to an environment
where they are cut off from reality and the rest of the world, where
they can indulge themselves in demonstrating their lack of realism and
reality, and where the original objective of obtaining a legally
binding agreement between nations to reduce worldwide emissions has
itself been displaced by the alternative objective of reaching an
agreement to meet again—and to agree to reach an agreement at
some distant future
time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T14:16:10"></hs_TimeCode>. That is
displacement activity on a massive scale, and it involves a massive
degree of hypocrisy, given the huge emissions incurred by these
eco-warriors as they swan across the globe in jets and hire fleets of
limousines, so emitting more CO<Sub>2 </Sub>than a small African

aim of displacement activity is of course to avoid facing up to
reality, so I will just point out a few facts that have not found their
way into the report or into 
<?notus-xml column=149?>discussions of such matters, but seem to me to be rather pertinent. The
original aim of the Kyoto protocol and the agreement in 1992 was to
reduce emissions by the contracting parties by 5% by now—or by
last year, but world emissions have actually gone up by nearer 50%. By
happy chance, the rise in the world temperature over that period was
much less than anticipated, despite the fact that the supposed cause of
that rise in temperature was even greater and more powerful than
anticipated<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T14:17:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041821000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130418/halltext/130418h0001.htm#13041821000057">Since
the Kyoto agreement was signed, Canada, Japan and Russia have resiled
from it. Far from making progress in getting countries to sign up, we
have lost three very important world players. The US will not sign up
to Kyoto or its successor, or to any legally binding agreement, as long
as developing countries are allowed to continue to increase their
emissions unconstrained. It was not President Bush who prevented
America signing up, but the Senate. Senators refused to sign up to
Kyoto by  98 votes to
zero.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041821000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130418/halltext/130418h0001.htm#13041821000058">That

emissions as long as developing countries are not also bound by them.

growth requires energy—it is almost synonymous with the rise in
the use of energy—and the growth in energy use needed to raise

completely ridiculous and will not result in any agreement. We have
this unrealistic agreement between the two Front-Bench speakers that
the matter will be solved by installing a few wind turbines and solar
panels in villages in Tanzania. India and China, in which effectively
half the world’s population live, are industrialising. They are
industrialising not by building a few windmills and solar panels, but
by building nuclear—sometimes, but that is very
expensive—coal above all and gas where they have it. Of course
they will sometimes use renewables where it is appropriate and where an
area is a long way from the grid, but let us not kid ourselves that
because we have seen one windmill in Africa, the whole developing world
will develop by means of renewables. If the two Front-Bench speakers,
who are united in their lunacy, would like to tell me that that is
seriously their belief and that they think the developing countries

debate, are planning to produce, by 2030, 11% of their energy from
renewables. The bulk of it will be hydroelectric, which is a
conventional source of electricity; no one would argue against that.
Where countries have hydro power and they can harness it, they should
go ahead and do so. That has always been happening and it will happen
anyway. It is happening regardless of whether CO<Sub>2 </Sub>is a
serious problem for them. Hon. Members must recognise that the world is
developing using fossil fuels. We can wish that that was not the case.
We can finance great jamborees every year or two. We can all get
together and pretend to ignore it, but as long as those in the
developing world are free to exploit fossil fuels and any renewables
they find economic or choose to inflict on themselves, America will not
sign up either. If America, China, India, Canada, Russia and Japan will
not sign up, it seems slightly perverse of us to assume that by

will focus my remarks more clearly on the UNFCCC itself and the process
of the UNFCCC. I begin by outlining why a change in climate should
matter at  all. The UNFCCC is the United Nations framework
convention on climate change and the world has occupied itself with
this problem of climate change for a very long time now; why should we?
It is certainly the most complex and intractable question of justice
that the world has ever seen, in that it is not simply about justice
between peoples separated by geography and wealth but about justice
between peoples separated in time, across the generations. It has
proved a singularly intractable problem to reconcile those competing
interests.</hs_Para>

does a change in climate matter? In and of itself it should not, were
it not for the fact that species—biodiversity—find it
difficult to keep pace with the rate of climate change. What we have
seen is a change in the rate of extinctions in the modern era that has
gathered pace to such an extent that we now have, in comparison with
the fossil record, a 1,000% increase in the rate of 
<?notus-xml column=154?>extinctions. That is higher than in any other period in the whole of the
fossil record. We are living in the midst of that, and sometimes when
living in the midst of things it is difficult to see the wood for the
trees; but that is what is going on. The rate of extinctions that we
are experiencing is really quite
remarkable.</hs_Para>

in the fossil record; he has not disputed that. What he has sought to
dispute is whether it is in any way linked to a change in climate, and
therefore whether it is in any way linked to the rise in the use of
fossil fuels. I think that if he looks at the way in which species are
migrating—he talked about a loss of habitat, but the reason that
there is a loss of habitat in many parts of the world is, of course,
because of the change in climate, which has actually destroyed the
habitat that used to be there. So I do not think that he can separate
out, in the way that he seeks to, the effects of climate change from
the effects of habitat destruction. To do so is precisely to ignore

do point out that he has conceded that climate change is real, and that
it will have a differential effect in different parts of the globe. It
is difficult to predict what that differential effect will be, but one
of the core predictions is that there is every expectation that parts
of Russia that are now tundra and unfarmable will gradually be released
as good agricultural land. Therefore, from the Russian point of view,
climate change, if and when it happens, will not be a significant
problem. However, the problem is that with the release of that land
into farmable condition, a lot of methane will be released into the
atmosphere, which will turbo-charge the
process<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T14:47:10"></hs_TimeCode>. But the

we have been invited this afternoon to justify why the COP process is
important. There are those who say that it is all a complete waste of
time—we will burn all the fossil fuel that we can get our hands
on—and ask why we are concerning ourselves with the process.
Most simply, the Earth is very good at storing stuff and does not need
over million of years to balance how it works as a planet. Humans, with
the great gift of consciousness, are also very good at finding all that
stuff, digging it up and burning it within a few hundred years,
compared with the millions of years that the Earth has taken to store
and balance it in the first
place<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T14:58:42"></hs_TimeCode>.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T14:59:36"></hs_TimeCode> assume that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T14:58:50"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr Lilley) also agrees with this, but
if, over the next 100 years or so, clever humans find and burn all the
fossil fuel, the outlook for the world would be very poor
indeed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041821000157" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130418/halltext/130418h0001.htm#13041821000157">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T14:59:36"></hs_TimeCode>
world simply cannot do that over the next 100 or 150 years. That seems
to me to be a fairly self-evident fact, assuming that people agree that
there is some relation between what we do—burning fossil fuels
in particular, and human activity in general—and the state of
the world’s atmosphere and the extent to which the Earth will
warm up as result. Someone who thinks that there is no connection
whatever would presumably not be concerned about finding all the fossil
fuel in the world and burning it all. Someone who thinks that there is
a connection, and an urgent one, would presumably wish to do something
about it fairly urgently. Since climate change and, in particular, the
results of the burning of fossil fuels know no boundaries, the only way
that we can do something about the situation over the medium term is
through interaction and discussion between states throughout the world
about achieving an outcome that is not as disastrous as it would be if
every country went its own way
individually.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041821000158" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130418/halltext/130418h0001.htm#13041821000158">That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T15:00:48"></hs_TimeCode>
seems to be the basic point about the COP process, and although I shall
come to a caveat in a moment, that cannot be replicated by people doing
what they feel like individually in different countries around the
world, partly for the reasons that have been rehearsed this afternoon:
people want to go their own way in how to develop their economies.
Realising the 
<?notus-xml column=159?>extent to which that is not an option for any of us over the next 100
years or so is part of the process of recognition that international
agreements are important. Indeed, under certain circumstances some
consequences have been turned back by international agreements. The
Montreal protocol and the action on chlorofluorocarbons was a global
agreement to the disadvantage of certain places resulting in a
substantial change; what would otherwise have been a difficult outcome
for at least parts of our climate has apparently been substantially
mitigated and possibly reversed. The COP process is important in that
respect<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T15:01:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041821000159" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130418/halltext/130418h0001.htm#13041821000159">For
the record, one of the immediate consequences of deciding to go off in
a different direction can be seen in the 2013 Budget: the carbon floor
price is a unilateral tax introduced in the UK, the operation of which
does not directly save a single tonne of carbon. It was supposed to be
introduced on the basis of a £1 rider on the EU ETS—an
inter-country co-operation on carbon cap and trade—but that
turned into a £4.94 rider on the ETS when it comes in this year.
From next year, it will be £9.55 on top and, in 2015,
£18.08 on top, compared with what would have been £7.28
and £9.86, respectively, under the original proposals. That is
not mission creep but mission gallop, and often in an entirely
different direction. The result is an £18 differential between a
power station introducing energy to the UK from the Netherlands and a
power station producing energy within the UK. A power station developer
might now think, “I will go and put one up in The Hague now
because, for my power station developments, that will save me
£18 per tonne of CO<Sub>2</Sub> over the next few
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T15:03:35"></hs_TimeCode>.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041821000160" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130418/halltext/130418h0001.htm#13041821000160">As

hon. Friend the Member for Brent North (Barry Gardiner) outlined, the
free money—not for new nuclear, but for existing
nuclear—turns out to be not only for all the nuclear power
stations in place, but for the two extensions agreed last year and this
year. Calculations based on what the carbon floor price would have been
when it was first introduced make that £44 billion over the life
of the extensions for the four power stations; the new figures are
about 30% more. Frankly, I will be surprised if EDF does not go ahead
with a new power station on the back of that free money, although I
know those are two slightly different things. My point is about the
distorting effects of a one-country go at such a scheme, even if that
was the intention, rather than its being a dash for money by 
the Treasury. That illustrates, as other things might not immediately,
how important it is to go ahead with international negotiations and to
get collective action. Every one would then be in the same place and on
the same level playing

the Member for Brent North mentioned the extent to which, almost under
the radar internationally, countries are beginning to take the sort of
action that we in this country have already taken with climate change
legislation. One of the ongoing processes recorded in the Select
Committee report is that countries, even those that might be advantaged
by global warming, are undertaking their own climate change
legislation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041821000164" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130418/halltext/130418h0001.htm#13041821000164">It
is vital the UK does everything that it can over the next few years to
support countries to develop their own climate change targets and to
join us in ours, so that progress towards a level playing field can be
considerably advantaged as the negotiations take place. One thing that
we should resolve today not to do is to indulge in any tinkering with
our climate change targets, as we try to move towards international
agreement on other people’s climate change targets, given that
that would send a very bad signal indeed to other countries, some of
which are beginning to take their climate change legislation directly
from what we have done in the UK.</hs_Para>

is a call not for action, but for us to defend what this country has
done. Our actions have not just made a contribution to what will
subsequently be the international level playing field, but are a beacon
that shows how these things can be done. Our duty now is not just to
say, “We’ve done it, so you should do it, too,”
but to stick with what we have done and to ensure that the process that
we are working to is not revised way, wished away, downgraded or put in
a cupboard by others, while some take what we consider a more
appropriate direction on international

substantially at the Doha discussions. It may be a mark of our
contribution over future years that the steps that I have described are
among those that we take to move discussions forward in a way that
produces international agreements, which are vital to any hope of
ensuring that our planet lasts in a fit state for the next few hundred
years. Of course, it will last, but perhaps not in a fit state for us,
although it might be in a fit state for somebody else. Whether our
planet will be in a fit state for us over the next few hundred years,
however, will be very much determined by whether people from around the
world gather to discuss these issues. The issue is whether we make the
planet fit for purpose, fit for us and fit for the future; that is what
we have to concentrate our minds
on.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-04-18?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_04_18_PT_1/B14486991A48EFCAA2468087E4800EC758EA752B" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="18 April 2013">Thursday

of the reason why we are seeing politicians show, at national
leadership level, a willingness to return to the subject from which
President Obama and the Chinese leadership were severely
scorched—from the experience of Copenhagen in 2009—is
that they are driven not only by the science, but by the economic
reality of the imperative of diversifying energy sources away from
fossil fuels and the recognition that the low-carbon goods and services

terms of the narrow subsection of wind or subsidised renewable energy,
as the low-carbon sector runs much more broadly than that and includes
energy efficiency and a range of

are most efficient, and the most efficient will be those that drive

Friend’s point. The cost of fossil fuels in the developing world
in the past two years has largely increased—in some cases, very
substantially. The cost 
<?notus-xml column=168?>of renewables<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T15:48:30"></hs_TimeCode> is
coming down. That is why India has launched its national solar mission
and why it is investing in wind. It is using the subsidy not simply to
subsidise consumers for a product that they cannot afford, but as an
investment to bring down the cost to the point that they can afford it.
When the counterfactual is distributed diesel generators, often no
subsidy at all is needed.</hs_Para>

generation is not some piffling irrelevance, as my right hon. Friend

people in the developing world. Hundreds of millions in Africa and

economic imperative; it is a moral one as well. They are not sitting

been around for centuries. They have had plenty of time to develop, as
I think my right hon. Friend will agree. I think that he may have
worked, as I have, in the oil and gas industry before coming into
politics. The
fact<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T15:52:51"></hs_TimeCode> is that
continuing to supply oil and gas, LPG, petroleum and kerosene at scale
to the Indian population requires a structural subsidy. We are not
proposing a structural subsidy for renewables; subsidy is justifiable
only in any circumstance if there is a chance of getting to a
non-subsidised point. We should not subsidise any technology, whether
renewable or fossil fuel, if all we are doing is pouring good money
after bad. Subsidy for renewables can only be a short-term or at best a

failure. It is almost impossible to justify a subsidy on that basis to
fossil fuels, which have had more than enough time to establish
themselves, whereas there is a failure in the renewables market. We
need to get renewables to the point where they become a full-scale

to the COP negotiations, particularly the UK Government’s
position and our priorities in respect of getting a global deal. Before
I do so, I remind the House what we agreed in Doha. The 17th COP in
Durban in 2011 was another step in the development of the UNFCCC, as
was the Cancun conference the year before, but it was also a
significant turning point. At that point, all the countries committed
to agree a new global deal by 2015 and increase efforts to reduce

conferences should be seen not as major breakthrough points, but as
steps forward. Even the annual conference in 2015, where we hope to
agree the new global deal, will also include ongoing implementation
decisions and perhaps further steps in the period to 2020 on how the
new global deal will be implemented in detail. In that regard, our
objectives at the Doha conference last year were largely achieved. We
agreed a high-level work plan to negotiate the new agreement by 2015,
and we rationalised the negotiation process to give space to deliver
the work plan and take forward work to increase the emissions reduction
effort in the meantime. Hon. Members might think that that sounds like
process. It is. To negotiate a new global deal with 194 countries in

thing that we know for certain is that there is no silver bullet for
the agenda, and we cannot afford to ignore any strand. This week, I had
hoped to be in Delhi for the clean energy ministerial, which considers
a range of technological solutions outside the constraints of the
UNFCCC negotiating process and, to my mind, is becoming an increasingly
important forum for driving the technological innovation that we need
and giving the agenda much more positive spin—forgive the word.
People can see tangible things to invest in that are themselves a
natural good. Abatement falls into the category of things that we need
to do more to consider. I do not suggest for a moment that the UNFCCC
is a universal panacea, nor that risks do not attach to it, but it is
our best hope of getting an overarching international framework, which

key thing—we are good at this globally, and we have a strong

contribution. Public finance, like subsidy, is there to catalyse
private sector interventions. We are seeing increasing private sector
interest in scaling up investments, so I think there is a realistic
possibility of meeting the pledge made at Copenhagen to mobilise the
$100 billion a year from developed economies into climate measures in
developing economies, not principally from the public sector or the
pockets of taxpayers in developed economies, but from mobilised private

Committee believes that China’s response to the challenge of
climate change is crucial for the whole world. Having been a regular
visitor to China over the past few years, I am extremely impressed and
encouraged by the greater engagement it has shown over climate change
and the efforts it is making to transform its economy to a low-carbon
one, though we all understand that it has a long way to go. The 12th
five-year plan, which is soon to be at its midpoint, contains a wide
range of measures designed to accelerate the introduction of low-carbon
technology<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T16:11:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

regard to the Committee’s key recommendations, we argued that
low-carbon leadership in the UK would encourage major emitters, such as
China, to move down the low-carbon pathway. We also believe that
low-carbon growth in China provides new markets and business
opportunities for Britain. Every assistance should be offered to the
Chinese to develop their emissions trading scheme. The type of system
they are choosing is rather more complex than the EU one, but they
start with the benefit of fewer, and perhaps less accurate, data than
we and most EU countries enjoyed at the outset of our schemes, which
are reasons to be more helpful, rather than
less.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041824000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130418/halltext/130418h0001.htm#13041824000042">The
UK should offer assistance on the measurement of data and the design of
a legal infrastructure for emissions trading—areas in which the

is also possible to assist with the integration of pilot emissions
trading systems with broader national systems. Emissions trading will
face a crisis as a result partly of the vote in the European
Parliament, which was referred to in the previous debate, and partly of
the collapse of the price in the EU ETS, so it is worth mentioning at
this point the fact that the concept has traction around the world. Not
only is China seriously piloting such schemes, but California’s
state ETS started operating in January this year, and it is clear that
the governor, his staff and the state are committed to its
success.</hs_Para>

We on the Committee were encouraged by the work already being carried
out by our officials in China, but we were disappointed that the
intention is to cut the rather limited project funding there. The UK
Government need to set high-level objectives for co-operation with
China on low carbon. Decisions about the design and delivery of
programmes are best made by staff on the ground with an understanding

the opportunity for us presented by shale gas. I hope that Britain will
exploit its shale gas resources and develop its expertise, which could

last week to the state grid in China, the customer base of which is a

the question of progress in China, emissions are obviously rising
because of the growth in the economy, but the goal that it has set to
reduce the carbon intensity of its economy is having an impact in
slowing down the growth of emissions. In 2012, the growth was down to
only 3.2%, compared with 9.3% in the previous year. Last year, the
carbon intensity of the Chinese economy appeared to decline by at least
4%. The 12th five-year plan has a target to reduce carbon intensity by
17%, and during my recent visit it was interesting to find senior
advisers to the Chinese Government talking openly not 
<?notus-xml column=174?>only about the prospect of setting an absolute target for carbon
emissions by 2020, but about expecting it to be a declining target as
soon as possible thereafter. I do not think that advisers would have

pilot emissions trading system is clearly still in its infancy. During
the next three years, we expect to see the pilots operating on a small
scale, with the first one probably in Shenzhen. Their scope is
significant; they cover about a quarter of China’s GDP across
six energy-intensive industries and some of the country’s most
important provinces and cities. There is potentially a big
prize—not just for Britain, but for the world—if we can
encourage China’s engagement in the low-carbon agenda. I am
confident that the new Chinese leadership will be at least as committed
to progress as its predecessors. China does not, perhaps, have the same
obstacles to land use planning decisions that occur in democracies,
particularly in crowded countries such as the UK. The Chinese decide to
do something and can get on and do it in a way that we might sometimes
envy. The energy and transport infrastructure roll-out in China is

Alan Whitehead</B> (Southampton, Test) (Lab):</Member> I do not want to
detain hon. Members for long; indeed, I cannot, because I only have
four minutes. Just as an aside, I draw hon. Members’ attention
to an Asterix comic of a long time ago, entitled “La
Zizanie”, which was about a person who went into
Asterix’s camp and annoyed everyone so much, setting people
against each other, that they lost track of what it was they were
trying to talk about. I merely want to leave that on the
table.</hs_Para>

Select Committee report is not about whether Britain has an
imperialistic relationship with China and wishes to influence the whole
of Chinese development. It is a modest effort to look at how the
UK’s climate change and energy considerations might be attached
to relations with the largest emitter of CO<Sub>2 </Sub>in the world. I
am talking about a country that is developing rapidly economically, and
changing equally rapidly its position as regards its stance on climate
change. The report tried to consider how those two things might be
matched. Unless we do not believe that there is any merit whatever in
having any sort of international dialogue with anybody, we should take
that Select Committee view at face value and welcome it for what it
is.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13041827000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130418/halltext/130418h0001.htm#13041827000042">The report is
not a view that all is rosy in the world of China, but a timely
reminder that China is changing its view on climate change. A number of
things are happening in China that underline that view. Indeed, just
yesterday, the Minister in charge of climate policies, Xie Zhenhua,
indicated that the aim for the Chinese economy now is a reduction in
the 2011 levels of carbon intensity by 40% to 45% by 2020. It also
wants to boost its non-fossil fuel use to 15% of energy consumption by
2020. He talked about the beginning of the carbon market in Shenzhen in
June and then later in the year in Shanghai. Significantly, 
<?notus-xml column=180?>he said that instruments will be included in the Shanghai carbon trading
market that will take credits off the market when supplies are too high
and prices are too low. He said that China would learn from the
difficulties that are taking place in Europe and that it was committed
to the development of a carbon trading market.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T16:47:52"></hs_TimeCode> the 11th
five-year plan, China had attempted to reach some targets. Among other
things, it closed down factories for a number of weeks towards the end
of the five-year period for each region to reach its target.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13041827000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130418/halltext/130418h0001.htm#13041827000043">China
understands the situation now and has developed its way of doing things
enormously, so that its measures on carbon trading arrangements begin
to coincide with other countries around the world. Therefore, there
could be international co-operation on these matters, built on the
basis of everyone following similar practices. We should not dismiss
that on the grounds that the UK has a population of 65 million or 70
million and that China has a population of many billions, thus making
us insignificant. Actually, we have a role to play in this matter and
in a dialogue with China, along with other countries in the EU and
across the world. That takes us back to that multilateral discussion
that we were concerned about in the previous debate. This is not about
Britain being imperialistic and trying to tell China what to do; it is
a question of the UK’s contribution to a country that appears to
be changing many of its assumptions about its own growth and how it
goes
forward.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041827000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130418/halltext/130418h0001.htm#13041827000044">Whatever
we may think about elements of the political and economic situation in
China and how they are dealt with, it is worth while collaborating with
China to a far greater extent for the greater good, not only of China
or this country but of the wider world. If the Committee’s
report has been able to emphasise and underpin that process, it has
achieved a good purpose.
However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T16:49:55"></hs_TimeCode>, hon.
Members should not read into the report something that is not there. It
is an honest attempt to consider how UK advances and UK positions may
be aligned more closely with other countries and with China in
particular. China is indeed changing its stance on climate
change—it is not a delusion to say that—and for its own
purposes, as well as for international purposes, beginning to make
substantial changes in how it goes about its economic activity,

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T16:51:21"></hs_TimeCode> Chairman of

many hon. Members have noted in their contributions, China is key to
the fight against climate change. China’s carbon emissions have
risen rapidly during the past decade; they are up by more than 171%
since the year 2000, growing to be 48% larger than the USA’s
output of carbon emissions. As China is now responsible for 29% of the
world’s carbon emissions and, on current trajectories, is
predicted to become responsible for 50% of global emissions by 2030, so
it is clear that no effort to tackle climate change will be successful
without its  
<?notus-xml column=181?>engagement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T16:51:21"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-18T16:51:21"></hs_TimeCode>.

yet.</hs_Para>

hon. Friends the Members for Brent North (Barry Gardiner) and for
Southampton, Test (Dr Whitehead) gave a number of examples that showed
the investment and support that China is extending to its wind power
sector, as well as its general commitment to increase renewable
generation, which is happening alongside plans to draft a new climate
law and to trial a carbon trading scheme.</hs_Para>

Committee’s report highlights the huge opportunities that this
Chinese low-carbon transition could provide for British business.
According to the latest report from the Department for Business,
Innovation and Skills on this sector, “Low Carbon and
Environmental Goods and Services”, UK exports to China are
currently worth £795 million, which makes China by far our
largest export market in this sector; it can be compared with our next
largest export market in the sector, Hong Kong, which is currently
worth £595 million.</hs_Para>

opportunity to increase trade links, but says that that opportunity

energy has fallen by half since this Government came to power, and
figures published in November 2012 by Ernst and Young on attractiveness
for investment in renewable energy showed that the UK has fallen to
sixth place, slipping below France, which, as has been pointed out in
the two debates this afternoon, is a country that generates nearly 80%

will draw my remarks to a close. The Committee’s report
underlines the key strategic importance of China in efforts to reduce
global carbon emissions. It reminds us of the importance of China as
Britain’s largest overseas market for low-carbon goods and
services, and it highlights the numerous opportunities that
China’s low-carbon transition presents for the UK to develop
these links further. However, the report warns that, as a result of the
Government’s lack of progress in securing investment in this
country and in progressing towards our carbon reduction commitments,
these opportunities may slip away from us. The Committee recommends
that to prevent that from happening the Government’s work in
China needs to improve its strategic focus, as well as shifting its
attention to areas where Britain has experience to offer, such as
carbon capture and storage and carbon pricing and accounting. The
report makes sensible and practical suggestions that I hope the
Government will act on, and I look forward to hearing the
Minister’s response to the
debate.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-04-18?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_04_18_PT_1/BAD769A3F6FEC7188BEF036D756087D4D62A3FF2" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="18 April 2013">Thursday

the real drive behind China’s emissions growth is urbanisation,
which is continuing apace. It will reach a peak, however, and there
will inevitably be emissions growth while that
extraordinary—indeed, unprecedented—urbanisation happens.
However, the key point is that China can put in place the policies that
will enable its emissions to peak and fall, and our technical policy
co-operation, however modest, is playing a part, even if it is small,
in helping that process in areas such as emissions trading, gas market
regulation, low-carbon product policy standards and so

additional emissions reductions before 2020. Achieving that is critical
to meeting the goal of limiting global temperature increase and keeping
below 2° C, and the UK is playing its part in that. Our strategy

be taking a more proactive stance. For example, the Ministry of Science
and Technology has recently issued its 12th five-year plan, which lays
out its priorities for research, development and demonstration of CCS
use and storage. The UK will continue to share its experience with
China and to use our influential climate financing to advance that

We will not fund those programmes or projects, but we must not

investment in staff, better crisis response, building regional
structures and the start of transferring passport work. By 2016, the
FCO will have a modern, efficient service supporting British nationals
overseas. We will do more to help those who need it most; those who are
most at risk because of who they are, where they are or what has
happened to them. We will deliver more services through expert

commitment over the lifetime of this Parliament to make the UK a
leading market for ultra-low carbon vehicles; which includes electric
vehicles. This includes providing support for collaborative research

infrastructure and demonstration projects. The Office for Low Emission
Vehicles (OLEV) is a team working across Government with staff and

Willetts:</Member></B> Data from the Higher Education Statistics Agency
suggests that part-time entrant numbers at HEFCE-fundable providers
have declined by 25% in 2012/13. We have updated our student finance
forecasts to account for this and have assumed no change in entrant
numbers in subsequent years. We are still monitoring the take-up rate
of loans as the academic year continues. While it appears the take-up
rate could be much lower than our assumption of 90% we have not yet
revised our forecasts to account for that factor. The change in our
forecasts caused by the decline in participation is as

announced on 14 December 2012, Sir Ken Knight is undertaking a review
into the operational efficiency of the services delivered by fire and
rescue authorities in England. The review will seek to identify ways
fire and rescue authorities can pinpoint sensible savings and
improvements without reducing the quality life-saving services that the
country's fire firefighters are known for. I look forward to Sir Ken
Knight's forthcoming report; after considering his findings, and
hearing views from the sector, the Government will publish a formal

considerable opportunities available to them. The Localism Act 2011
allows local communities to decide how best to meet their needs while
the General Power of Competence gives local authorities power to do
anything an individual might. The Local Government Finance Act 2012
provides a direct financial incentive for local authorities to drive
economic growth in their area. I look to local authorities to exercise

decision whether to offer a caution is an operational matter for the
police and in some circumstances the CPS depending on the circumstances

public or the victim's
interest.</hs_Para><TableWrapper Columns="1" Size="7"><table tabstyle="headft"><tgroup cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="36*"></colspec><colspec colname="2" colwidth="32*"></colspec><colspec colname="3" colwidth="32*"></colspec><thead><row><entry nameend="3" namest="1" rowsep="1"><hs_TableTitle Justify="centre"><I>Table
