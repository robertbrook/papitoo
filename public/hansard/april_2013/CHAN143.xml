consensus on this from both Front-Bench teams—that students who
have not secured a GCSE pass at English or maths at the age of 16 must

the technical baccalaureate—a new and explicitly demanding

the influence of Britain on India. It is also the case that the period

people during their school holidays. Does my right hon. Friend agree
that charitable organisations such as Free the Children, which now
exists in Britain, add value to children’s primary and secondary
education throughout the year, and are an excellent example of the big

already made one change, whereby Ofsted must now report to police the

that there were gaping holes in understanding not only of the mechanics

inference of the hon. Lady’s question is that head teachers or
principals in academies will be neglectful of the welfare of children,
particularly with respect to sex and relationships education. As I have
said, this is a uniquely serious matter. Given changes in technology
and family formation, it requires the attention of all us if we are to
get it right. One thing my Department has done is conduct a survey of
best practice. Sometimes, best practice occurs in faith schools and
academies and not in maintained schools. Simply prescribing something
in the national curriculum does not mean that best

the Bill left this House, the Opposition were concerned about the wide
scope of powers to make retrospective changes and to amend primary
legislation. The Government understand that concern. Pensions are an
important part of scheme members’ future income in retirement.
We therefore tabled amendments in the other place to give members or
their representatives a complete veto over any significant adverse
retrospective change to their pensions and to restrict the powers to
amend primary legislation. Furthermore, any Treasury orders for
negative revaluation of scheme benefits will now need to be made by the
affirmative Commons procedure.</hs_Para>

requirement for national scheme advisory

hand is the appropriate treatment of those work forces’
pensions. The amendments would actively reduce the normal pension age
for individuals joining them. It would not be a minor reduction, but a
reduction of five years from the pension age put in place for those
work forces by the Labour Government in 2007. It would also be a
reduction of seven years from the pension age that they would otherwise
see when the new scheme comes into force in 2015. That approach would
run counter to the need to control the risks associated with increased
longevity, which all parties agree must be addressed. I believe that
all parties in this House support the aim of controlling those risks.
The amendments would make those work forces unique in the public
sector, with their pension age falling at a time when everyone
else’s is rising.</hs_Para>

the issue being highlighted, the Government have taken measured and
appropriate action. Rather than making a knee-jerk response to fit with
the legislative time scale of the Public Service Pensions Bill,
the Ministry of Defence has written to the forces. Its letter states
that the MOD is willing to consider how the current pension age
of 65 might be maintained for those individuals when the new pension
schemes are introduced in 2015. I believe that is a reasonable offer by
the Government, and we will of course stand by it. It is our duty as
parliamentarians to look at the whole picture. Pensions are only one
part of the remuneration and employment package of those work
forces.</hs_Para>

approximately 12 million employees and their pensions in the public

concerned will continue to have access to the civil service pension
scheme, which is an excellent scheme that many in the private sector,
including those doing the most arduous or specialist work, would envy.
They are significant because some early indications suggest that they
could be as high as £10 million a year for the lifetime of the
schemes. This expenditure would take money away from front-line

Leslie:</Member></B> Although the Minister had quite a long preamble,
not necessarily on these amendments, all I would say is that, clearly,
with life expectancies increasing, it is in general reasonable to ask
people to work for longer before retirement. There is no disagreement
on that general principle. We need to adjust the public service pension
schemes so that they remain sustainable, which is why we support so
many of the changes Lord Hutton recommended. However, as hon. Members
know, there are certain categories of workers for whom having longer
careers is not realistic because of the physical 
<?notus-xml column=654?>demands of their professions. There are some physical tasks that it is
not reasonable to expect a 67 or 68-year-old to undertake.</hs_Para>

acknowledges that in part, by excluding three categories of
worker— firefighters, police officers and members of the armed
forces—and fixing their normal pension age at 60. That is a
rational position, but there are other professions that we believe the
Government should keep under review because they also can be
exceptionally physically demanding, such as NHS paramedics and care
workers. There is clearly a need for some flexibility to accommodate
scheme-specific capability reviews for these associated professions,
and it is a great shame that the Government have not allowed the
latitude for that in the Bill. We debated that in

amendments 78 and 79 are aimed at correcting what most people thought

Hutton, in his detailed inquiry, was not aware of the 350 or so
affected individuals, because it was a new scheme that started in 2007,

before the normal retirement age because of issues of
physicality—the sheer effort involved in undertaking such
physical tasks. It is entirely unreasonable and unfair that there is
such a discrepancy between public service workers who carry out the
same job. They are all called on to put their lives on the line. The
burden of justifying the anomaly now rests with the Government, but
other than some rather unconvincing arguments, which the Minister
barely touched on, they have failed to discharge their burden and to

is the cost to the public purse argument, but as I understand it, only
56 people have joined the Ministry of Defence police, and fewer than
300 have joined the defence fire and rescue service since 2007. So the
anomaly could be easily corrected by bringing a small minority of
pensioners back into line with the pre-2007 entrants’ normal
pension age of 60. We are not talking about a large number of
firefighters or police officers here. Sadly, we have had to get to the
Floor of the House of Commons to put the pressure on the Government.
What the Government have tried to present as a cost is in reality a
reduction in the predicted saving from this overall package of changes.
They overestimated the 
<?notus-xml column=659?>savings to be made by overlooking the existence of this particular group
of fire and police officers and failed to include them in the

might put up various arguments, but the question of physical burden
cannot be overlooked. A worker for the Ministry of Defence police may
be required to wear 11 stone-worth of kit, and a normal shift will
involve wearing 5 or 6 stone-worth of equipment for up to 11 hours.
Workers in the Ministry of Defence fire service carry out the already
difficult and dangerous job of firefighters, but do so in war zones and
other extremely hazardous conditions around the world.</hs_Para>

these workers are labelled civil servants should not blind us to the
reality of what their jobs entail. Along with the police and the armed
forces, they are the only public service workers who have to undergo
regular fitness tests. In fact, the majority retire before 60 because
they are unable to meet the high demands their jobs entail. They are
also recognised as uniformed forces in the civil service pension
scheme, and there is a small reflection of that already. Unlike
civilian police forces, there is no option in the MOD police for
officers to move to unarmed work if they struggle to cope physically.
Even when mainstream police officers are armed, they are not expected
routinely to carry guns around beyond the age of
55.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304228000313" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0001.htm#1304228000313">Another
point that has been brought to my attention today—I imagine that
this is something none of us is massively familiar with—is that
many MOD firefighters have to work alongside colleagues who will
qualify for retirement at 60. Royal Air Force firefighters—I
think that they are called Trade Group 8—will often be on
similar operations with service colleagues, working in the field
together. One colleague will retire at 60, whereas another standing
next to him will be required to work to 65, 66, 67 or beyond. The same
applies for Royal Navy firefighters, who are regarded in their
classification as armed forces. This is riddled with anomalies, and it
would be very simple for Ministers to overcome them. They really ought
not to have allowed this to become such a large point of
debate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304228000314" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0001.htm#1304228000314"><B><Member ContinuationText="Ian Paisley" PimsId="2246" UID="1304228001218" xid="1216" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0001.htm#1304228001218">Ian

the Government, by holding out in this way, are letting down those
serving in our armed forces. They are giving the impression that they
think they can sweep the issue under the carpet and let it ride. There
are already concerns that they might be increasing the risk to national

number of personnel involved is very small—fewer than 5,000 in
total out of a civil service work force of about 700,000. Defence
police and firefighters do a vital job. It involves putting themselves

uniformed services, defence firefighters and police have to be ready to
go instantly from a state of rest to 100% alertness and very high
physical exertion. That puts a heavy strain on the body and, as someone
nearing 60 myself, I know we all have to accept that age takes its toll
on us. What makes the uniformed services different is the need to go to
a 100% level of alertness and effort. Many other manual jobs involve
hard work, but it is done at a steady state for several hours, whereas
the uniformed services have to go to their 100% physical and mental
peak at once, and I think that that top level of fitness decays once we
are over 60. A report produced for the Ministry of Defence by Dr P.
Griffin, a civilian consultant adviser in occupational medicine, makes
clear that a person’s ability to function with peak physical and
mental alertness declines once they get over 60. That has to be taken

to work beyond 60, many of them will fail these tests before they reach

firefighting. That is why I believe that the cost of reducing the
retirement age to 60 will not necessarily be as large as the figure the
Minister has been given by his civil servants. I suspect that a large
number of personnel will retire on health grounds before they are 65.

Members of all parties are concerned about the emotive nature of the
Bill’s effects on a small group of people. I would like to put
it on record that I am proud of the public sector. Many members of my
family work in it, and they show great commitment to the services in
which they work on a day-to-day basis. Some of them risk their lives,

Ministry of Defence police and firefighters is incredibly important,
and it would be disingenuous of Members to try to identify
whether the job of one set of police officers in the Home Office is
more dangerous than that of another set in the Ministry of Defence.
Some police officers in the Home Office do a great deal of work in
difficult circumstances in some of our areas on a Friday and Saturday
night, and some have jobs that are predominantly focused around the
desk and paperwork. Those jobs are also very important in the attempt
to reduce crime and provide police

I said, this is an emotive issue, and the real problem is the knee-jerk
reaction that we are seeing on the Floor of the House to the attempt to
resolve it. The shadow Minister said honestly that a mistake was made
in 2007 that went through by ministerial order. There was no debate in
the Chamber on the retirement age of the forces in question
being raised from 60 to 65. I understand, as the hon. Member

particular size, weight and age would not be the best at resolving the

Government with debts of more than £1 trillion—or moving

It is not that I do not trust the shadow Minister, but he is trying to
pull me into a political trap. I am not interested in politics in that
sense; I am interested in representing my constituents and I do not
want to accept an amendment that could technically make those fire and

mentioned a figure of around 8% that could be a reduction in net pay.
If we accept such an amendment, and the mistake made by the previous
Government in 2007 is reversed, I think we should negotiate with trade
unions and fire and police officers so that we fully understand what
its impact will be on their take-home salary at the end of each month,
and how it will affect decisions in their careers and moving forward. I
want everybody to have a fair opportunity, and as I have said, I am
proud of the public sector and the work it does. Although the amendment
seems fair, I do not feel that I can support it because of the
broad-brush approach that could lead to MOD police officers and fire
service personnel having a worse set of circumstances in a year or two,
just so that party political points can be scored. Unfortunately, I
will not be able to support the amendment, but I urge the Minister to
provide us with more detail in his winding-up speech about how he will
encourage the MOD to sit down with the unions and ensure that the
pension age will not rise above 65, and that any decision on the
pension age will be about 65 and downwards.</hs_Para>

a few brief points in support of Lords amendments 78 and 79, which seem
eminently sensible and seek simply to bring the normal pension age for
MOD police and defence fire and rescue personnel in line with
arrangements for other fire and police personnel who do broadly similar
jobs. As others have pointed out, when the amendments were first
debated in the other place, Lord Hutton seems to have acknowledged that
the omission of MOD police and firefighters from his original

Hutton’s conclusion in recommendation 14 of his report was by no
means arbitrary. In recommending a normal pension age of 60 for
uniformed services personnel, the Hutton report drew on a wide evidence
base. It recognised that the nature of the job places intense physical
demands on officers and requires them to maintain levels of health and
fitness that are not necessary in other day-to-day jobs. That
acknowledgment has underpinned the design of terms and conditions for
police and firefighters for many years, and remains as pertinent and
relevant as it ever was, even if the age at which those personnel will
be eligible for retirement has
shifted.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304228000354" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0002.htm#1304228000354">It
is useful to remember that changing demographics and increases in life
expectancy have underpinned the process of pension reform.
However, although life expectancy has increased significantly in recent
decades, the increase in healthy life expectancy has not kept pace.
People are living longer, but they are more likely to live with
debilitating health conditions or disabilities. I made general
observations on that in earlier stages of the Bill, 
<?notus-xml column=666?>but it is particularly relevant to the uniformed services, because it is
imperative that officers are physically capable of meeting the demands
of the job. Hutton implicitly acknowledged that when he called for the
increase in normal pension age for the uniformed services to be kept
under regular
review.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304228000355" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0002.htm#1304228000355">We
must be realistic about the physical limitations of mere mortals. Hard
physical work takes its toll on human bodies. It is clear that people
who work in heavier, more demanding jobs suffer more physical strain as
they get older. Like the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr Reid), I
was struck by the briefing ahead of the debate from the Defence Fire
Risk Management Organisation, which set out in some detail not only the
physical demands placed on defence fire and rescue personnel, but the
risks to officers, which increase with age—they rise
exponentially for officers aged 50 and over. We must be realistic about
what we ask people to do. We should not do the sums on paper
without thinking of the real
cost.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304228000356" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0002.htm#1304228000356">We
need to be careful when we talk about the monetary cost. The Minister
relied on the argument that the measure will cost too much, but we need
to be careful if we assume that the higher pension age will save us
money. All hon. Members know that staff retiring on health grounds can
be an expensive business. It is all the more expensive when the reasons
for a person leaving their job are linked to their occupation. That is
an extremely expensive way to do things. We need to look at both sides
of the balance sheet before we jump to the conclusion that treating MOD
police and firefighters differently from other police and firefighters
will save us
money.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304228000357" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0002.htm#1304228000357">At
the end of the day, this comes down to the fact that MOD police and the
defence fire and rescue officers are, to all intents and purposes,
uniformed service personnel. They need to be fit and strong, and
physically and mentally capable of carrying out their duties in an
emergency. We need to recognise that and treat them in exactly the same
way—as far as possible—as we treat other police and
firefighters.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304228000358" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0002.htm#1304228000358">Another
important part of the context is that morale in those services has been
put under considerable strain in recent times owing to changes to terms
and conditions and proposed reductions to services. Like the hon.
Member for Colchester (Sir Bob Russell), who intervened earlier, I have
MOD police in my constituency—they look after the St Fergus gas
terminal. I am therefore very much aware of the great uncertainty that
has overshadowed the service because of MOD reviews. I am also aware
that a proposed voluntary early release scheme, for which, I believe,
600 officers applied, has been subject to a rethink. I am glad that the
MOD has recognised the folly of rushing in with ill-thought-through
cuts, but officers who had applied for early release have been left in
a kind of limbo. The service needs to ensure that younger officers come
up through the ranks, but the uncertainties of the past few years have
undermined morale and the good will of officers, who take substantial
risks in their day-to-day working lives, and who we expect to be on the
front line during any crisis.</hs_Para>

do not have confidence in the solution set out by the Minister. I know
that some of his Liberal Democrat colleagues in the coalition have
accepted it—if I had not seen officers being mucked about by the
MOD’s prevarication over the early release scheme,  
<?notus-xml column=667?>I would have more confidence in the Government’s proposals.
However, having witnessed that, and seeing that the issue is still
unresolved, I really do not have that confidence. In that context, I

Liberal Democrats to come through the Lobby and make their voices heard

believe the Government when they say that they want to keep the
retirement age at 65, instead of increasing it progressively to 68 when
the state pension age goes up. The Government have made that offer. My
argument was that the retirement age should be 60, because
of the decline in their physical ability to perform at peak

Whiteford:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. Like
me, he has constituents who have applied for the early release scheme
and been mucked about. That is why we should settle the matter today on
the Floor of the House, instead of allowing it to be sent off into the
long grass where we can prevaricate some more before failing to reach

question of consistency underpins everything. There is recognition that
other police and firefighters need a lower normal pension age than
those in less physically demanding roles. People who do the same jobs,
but for the MOD, need to be recognised in exactly the same way. I urge
the Government to observe the spirit of the Hutton report, accept that
this was an oversight, and do the right thing by our MOD police and
firefighters by accepting the Lords amendments. I hope, even at
this very late stage, that the Minister will
capitulate.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-04-22?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_04_22_PT_1/AB57FE6C417225024EC79A3956AEF5607DEDDD9F" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="22 April 2013">Monday

Government’s policy on pensions was twofold: they wanted to
bring together a consistent retirement age across the services, while,
as part of public service reform, ensuring a process of modernisation,
with retirement schemes reflecting the requirements of service
delivery. From what we have received today, I think we are
reintroducing an element of chaos into the retirement age. Far from
ensuring consistency, we seem to be building anomaly upon anomaly. Far
from pragmatically reflecting the reality of delivering a service, we

delivery, we should learn the lessons of 2007. I did not support the
increase in the retirement age for firefighters in 2007, just as I have
not supported this legislation. The lesson that the Fire Brigades Union
taught us was that once we increase the retirement age in such a
physically demanding job, apart from having a physical effect on those
workers and their lives—and on their families, too—we do
not save money, because people take ill-health retirement, as others
have said. At the end of the day, this is not part of a modernisation
process; it is a step
backwards.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304228000380" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0002.htm#1304228000380">The
other issue raised was consistency—this argument that there will
be consistency across the uniformed services. However, that was never
the case anyway, because we argued for the Prison Service and uniformed
services in the health service to be included, but they were excluded.
The issue of consistency is drawn even more sharply by the exclusion of
the group of staff we are discussing in this debate, who are clearly
part of a uniformed service. They are being discriminated against
purely on the basis of who employs them. Firefighters who are employed
by local government via a fire authority are within the scheme at age
60, whereas those employed by these other bodies are not. That is not
just policy making on the hoof; to be frank, it is incompetent policy
making.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304228000381" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0002.htm#1304228000381">As

this group of workers—the MOD police force and
firefighters—have an additional requirement placed on them by
us, the taxpayers, whereby we ask them as part of their
responsibilities potentially to put their lives at risk, or at least to
put the safety and interests of the public ahead of themselves. If I
may say so, that is a far more appropriate basis for our looking at
this particular issue. People may wish to make the case for
physicality, but there is a special case here that goes above and

did his party colleague, the hon. Member for Hayes and

said was wrong, because there would be consequences. We would have to
think about who would pay for these changes, and if there were a change
in the retirement age we clearly could not have a situation where, for
instance, the civilian firefighters and the MOD firefighters had the
same retirement age but paid different pension contributions. We would

asking the Minister to see whether there would be any movement, and one
issue raised was the time frame for any potential negotiation on
movement. I happen to think we should hold out for 60—that that
should be the decision today—but I do want to ask the
Minister: is he sure there is the potential for going to 60 for
MOD firefighters and civilian firefighters without primary legislation?
I am worried that, if we let this matter pass today, we might not be
able to deal with it through regulations and secondary legislation, and
that we will instead require primary legislation if we are to
have the potential to get parity. Can the Minister confirm that we

Friend the Member for Bedford (Richard Fuller) and the hon. Member for

it. I will say a bit about the MOD process, but first let me repeat an
important point: this is a broad-ranging Bill to deal with all public
sector pensions, affecting approximately 12 million individuals, by
addressing the issue of increasing life expectancy and seeking to find
the necessary savings in a fair way from employees, employers and the
taxpayer. It is framework legislation: it sets the general framework
for individual schemes, but that is all it does. It is for the
individual employer organisations and the employees to negotiate the
terms of each
scheme.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304228000426" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0002.htm#1304228000426">We
deliberately set up the legislation to provide significant flexibility,
so that if the MOD, and therefore the Government, decide at a later
date that the retirement age needs to change, it would not require
further legislation. The MOD can make the decision in discussion with

all public sector employee organisations flexibility to deal with the
particular circumstances of their schemes.</hs_Para>

back to the other place, could the Minister write to us explicitly
about the generality of the Bill—about its being a framework
Bill? It seems curious that a framework Bill lists a number of
categories of worker whose retirement age will be at 60. That is why
many people felt they needed to be included in that list if they were
to be protected. It seems odd that the Minister is now saying,

public sector workers, and there is a link to the state pension age.
The Government must address the issue; it was something the previous
Government ducked, but it is vital for making the public finances more
secure. That situation has not changed. What I am outlining today, with
regard to the issue relating to MOD firefighters and police officers,
is that there is flexibility within the MOD scheme for it to come up

Miller:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is right that that point has
exercised many individuals both within the Chamber and outside. It was
clear from Lord Justice Leveson’s report that it was his
intention for the local press to be part of the new self-regulatory
regime. Equally, he understood that there are clear financial pressures
on the local press, as there have been for many years, and that
provisions might be needed within the self-regulatory regime that treat
them differently. That is something for the press to deal with and I
understand that they are looking at it. It is important, however, that
the local press are part of the opportunity to have self-regulation. I
reiterate to my hon. Friend that it is exactly
that—self-regulation—and that there is no compulsion. I
hope that that provides the reassurance that he is
seeking.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042238000542" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0002.htm#13042238000542">Exemplary
damages and costs are designed to cover what might be termed more
sophisticated news publishers, and will act as a key incentive to join
the new press regulator. It is therefore essential that the definition
of “relevant publisher” equates to the publications that
we expect to be part of the
regulator.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042238000543" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0002.htm#13042238000543">Equally,
the definition is not intended to capture a host of activities,
including small-scale activity online. It is not intended to capture
the news aggregation services of operators such as Yahoo! or MSN, or
social networking sites. Nor is it aimed at sites that simply moderate
the comments of others or aggregate a series of blogs without any
active consideration of the content. By that I mean blog hosting
services such as WordPress or
Tumblr.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042238000544" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0002.htm#13042238000544">I
want to be really clear about the matter, because I know that
many hon. Members have examined it in detail. To the extent that a
website such as Mumsnet runs an online blog forum, that activity is
clearly not covered by the definition of “relevant
publisher”, as forums are not covered. The provisions may be
relevant to a site such as Mumsnet only if it is in the business of
commissioning articles and publishing news stories. Such businesses
undertake different activities, one of which may well be publishing
news, which would bring them into the scope of self-regulation.
However, forums such as the one run by Mumsnet would not be
covered.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042238000545" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0002.htm#13042238000545">I
also wish to clarify again the effects of the definition of
“relevant publisher” on news aggregators. It is not our
intention that the provisions should capture news aggregators such as
Yahoo!, MSN or Google. News and content aggregators who license or
otherwise acquire news-related content from third parties control that
content only in as far as they decide how to present it in its
totality, and to that extent they are not subjecting the material to
editorial control. It is therefore not intended that services providing
a platform for bloggers to post content are captured. Again, the
control exercised by aggregators is limited to the high-level
presentation of content, so news aggregators are not captured by our
definition.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042238000546" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0002.htm#13042238000546">We
have, however, acknowledged the need for clarity, particularly with
regard to small-scale blogs. When the provisions were last discussed in
the other place, we undertook to have a period of reflection to assess 
<?notus-xml column=688?>whether any further clarity would be helpful and could be provided. My
officials have since held a number of round-table discussions with
small-scale blog sites to understand their concerns further. The
amendments that we have tabled, with cross-party agreement, seek to
provide that further
clarification.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042238000547" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0002.htm#13042238000547">Amendment
(a) will add to the list of exemptions micro-businesses where they are
a blog or where their publications are merely incidental to their other
business. For organisations that publish news-related material
incidentally to their main activity, that exemption will cover both
online and traditional print. We use a definition of a micro-business
commonly used by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills,
which captures any business with fewer than 10 employees and a turnover
of less than £2 million. The amendment will ensure that a
micro-business that is either a small-scale blog or a website whose
publication of news-related material is only incidental to its wider
business is not included. That should place many blogs and other small
web publishers squarely outside the incentives
framework.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042238000548" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0002.htm#13042238000548">Amendment
(b) will allow those not captured to get the benefit of the costs
incentives if they choose to join the recognised regulator, even though
they are not a relevant publisher. That means that those exempted by
virtue of the fact that they are a micro-business can choose to gain
the benefits of the costs clauses by joining the regulator, providing
an incentive for them to join if they so wish and a choice to small
organisations, perhaps before they grow in size and inevitably become a
relevant publisher. That is an important addition that will help
support that part of the
market.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042238000549" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0002.htm#13042238000549">I
can deal briefly with Lords amendments 17A and 17B. In short, the
objective of the new costs regime is to incentive publishers
financially to join the regulator. The intention behind subsection
(2)(a) of the new clause “Awards of costs”, originally
inserted in the Commons, is to allow costs to be awarded against a
regulated publisher only if the claim before the courts is not capable
of being resolved through the self-regulator’s arbitration
scheme. However, to achieve that effect, the word “not”
needs to be inserted into that subsection to avoid the opposite being
the case. That was a simple drafting error that is corrected by Lords
amendment
17A.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042238000550" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0002.htm#13042238000550">Lords

clauses to which the Lords amendments relate have been carefully
constructed to enable a system of incentivisation, which will form the
basis of a new, tough self-regulator for the press in line with Leveson
principles. The amendments are far removed from those that the noble
Lords Skidelsky and Puttnam, among others, proposed for consideration
in this House. Let us be clear that had we not successfully negotiated
a cross-party royal charter, the House could well be debating a system
of full statutory regulation that would have undermined the freedom of

Goodman</B> (Bishop Auckland) (Lab):</Member> I am pleased to be able
to take part in this debate, which nails down the final details of the
recommendations that Lord Justice Leveson made about setting up a new
self-regulatory system for the press. When the Bill was introduced into
the House a year ago, Lord Justice Leveson had not even reported, so we
were fortunate to be able to thumb a lift with the
Bill.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042238000559" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0002.htm#13042238000559">On
18 March, on Third Reading, the House agreed to insert new clauses
providing for new rules on exemplary damages and costs. They are an
essential part of the cross-party agreement on a royal charter, which
is part of the new framework of independent self-regulation guaranteed
by
law.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042238000560" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0002.htm#13042238000560">As
the Secretary of State said, the Bill aims to provide publishers with
incentives to sign up to the new system of self-regulation that should
meet the criteria set out in the royal charter. Publishers that join
the recognised regulator will receive protection from the award of
exemplary damages in media disputes, the opportunity to use an
arbitration service, and cost benefits from having access to the
arbitration service—that is one 
<?notus-xml column=690?>reason why it would benefit local as well as
national newspapers. If a complainant chooses not to use the
arbitration service, they can still be liable for costs even if they
win.</hs_Para>

Leveson’s report was about the press, but the original drafting
had the unintended effect of catching blogs in the net—a point
noted in this House by my hon. Friend the indefatigable Member for West
Bromwich East (Mr Watson). That said, Lord Justice Leveson expressed
the hope in recommendation 73 of his report that online publishers
would also join a regulator. The Bill therefore needed to be amended to
ensure that exemplary damages did not apply to blogs, but that they
could receive the benefits of joining a recognised regulator. The Lords
agreed a number of amendments, including a placeholder amendment, on 25
March.</hs_Para>

Government’s decision to hold a
“mini-consultation”—as I think the Secretary of
State called it—to pause for reflection and consider the
blogosphere was sensible. With the best will in the world, middle-aged
Members of Parliament in both Houses are perhaps not absolutely
up to speed with the way in which the blogosphere operates among the
next generation, but I think we have now got it right. The Labour party
agrees with the policy objectives that the Government are seeking to
address: to exempt micro-businesses from the definition of
“relevant publisher” where they are a blog or their
publications are merely incidental to their other business; and to
enable such micro-businesses to receive the benefits and cost
incentives if they join a recognised regulator. The amendments use the
micro-business definition for a small blog as one whose turnover is
below £2 million and has up to 10 employees. It exempts such
businesses from exemplary damages and enables them to benefit from the
cost advantages of an arbitration service if they join a
regulator—that last point will be particularly welcome in that
community.</hs_Para>

supports Lords amendments 17A and 17B and amendments (a) and (b) in
lieu of amendment 131, and we will not divide the House in this debate.
However, there is a thicket of double negatives, and for those outside
the House who are following proceedings closely I ask the Secretary of
State to provide assurances and clarity on a couple of points. Will she
tell the House whether this approach minimises the risk of gaming, in
particular by groups of companies? What is the position of campaigning
groups’ newsletters—the right hon. Member for Wokingham
(Mr Redwood) raised that point? I thought that Mumsnet would be
excluded because its primary purpose is not to publish news—it
is clear that motherhood is not a hobby, so it is not excluded on those
grounds—or, indeed, UK Feminista. Neither of those is a charity
and it might help if the Secretary of State said a little more about
the newsletters of campaigning groups.</hs_Para>

confirm that access to the arbitration system for those outside the
regulatory body is limited to small-scale blogs, and say why she chose
that approach? The hon. Member for Cambridge (Dr Huppert) asked about
the definition of “blog”, and I assume that the Secretary
of State has received legal advice that the word will be properly
interpreted. She has already explained why she is addressing only the
number of employees, and not those who are self-employed, but if she
could elucidate a little on those points it would be helpful and we
will be happy to support her this evening.</hs_Para>

Huppert:</Member></B> I do not wish to detain the House long but I am
pleased that we have finally reached this point and that important
details of Leveson are agreed. If I had been asked when I first looked
at the Crime and Courts Bill which part I thought would keep us in
ping-pong, it would not have been this provision or anything to do with
blogs. I do not know whether the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland (Helen
Goodman) was referring to me as a middle-aged man. I am the proud
holder of a Liberal Democrat Voice “blogger of the year”
award, but even I would have struggled desperately to write this
provision or make all the definitions. I hope that the Secretary of
State has been able to be clear. There will be people who try to game
this, but that is true of all legislation. I hope that the Bill has
been made as game-proof as possible, while preserving the pleasure of
the games that people play on blogs. I am delighted that we are at this
point and I will not take up any more of the House’s time. I
look forward to the Bill being enacted and I hope that the Secretary of
State will clarify those few remaining
points.</hs_Para>

Miller:</Member></B> I thank the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland (Helen
Goodman) for her helpful support as we try to resolve the final details
of the Bill. Hon. Members have raised a number of issues in the short
period that we have to debate the Bill, and hopefully I can resolve
them to everybody’s satisfaction.</hs_Para>

by “gaming” the hon. Lady meant the ability of companies
to try to buck the system we have set up. It is always difficult to
give a categorical assurance on that, but I think our approach
minimises the risk of organisations taking such an approach. We have
minimised the risk by using the definition of a micro-business, which
does not just consider one element—staff—but staff and
turnover. Therefore, if an organisation decided to ensure that all its
staff were freelancers, it could not then play with its turnover in a
way that would make it a micro-business. Equally, individual businesses
will find it difficult to disaggregate their businesses in a way that
would leave them registered as micro-businesses, and then duck the
system without compromising the way in which they operate on a
day-to-day basis. Furthermore, a court will be capable of looking at
the facts of a case to see whether an organisation has attempted to get
around the rules, and that would be a material consideration. If an
organisation was trying to circumvent the rules in the way it
structured itself, the usual sanctions would be available.</hs_Para>

interested in many different organisations, but particularly
campaigning groups. A number of other exemptions already exist in the
definition of “relevant publisher” that deal with
campaigning newsletters—a point that the right hon. and learned
Member for Camberwell and Peckham (Ms Harman) and I have discussed on a
number of occasions. A public body or charity that publishes
news-related material in connection 
<?notus-xml column=692?>with carrying out its functions, or a person who publishes a newsletter,
circular or other document relating to their business that contains
news-related material only incidentally, will not be caught by the
self-regulatory approach. Such things will be exempt from these
measures, which is important. News, and the delivery and publication of
news, is not central to a company’s business, and I underline
that point for all questions raised by hon. Members. Hopefully, that
will provide some certainty on campaigning groups.</hs_Para>

point raised by the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland was access to
arbitration for those that may not be termed as “relevant
publishers”, other than those that are
micro-businesses—excuse me, Mr Deputy Speaker, for
getting into the weeds with this, but it is necessary to answer the
hon. Lady’s questions. Our consideration of micro-businesses in
connection with blogging was to ensure that we did not unintentionally
capture those businesses within the self-regulatory system, and also to
ensure that those businesses were able—should they
choose—to opt in to the self-regulatory part of the framework if
they felt that was beneficial. It was never our intention more broadly
to allow people to become a “relevant publisher”, not
least because that would be outside the scope of today’s
discussions. It is not our intention to allow people who are not
relevant publishers in that way to have access to that status over and
above the exemption we have outlined. Anything to do with the running
of the self-regulatory regime is for the press to consider in more
detail. We did not intend to cover that in our proposals
today—the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland has raised that matter
with
me.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13042238000714" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0002.htm#13042238000714">6.30

hon. Member for Cambridge (Dr Huppert), speaking for the Liberal
Democrats, raised the final issue of the definition of
“blog”. We are comfortable that there is a clear
articulation of “blog” and “news”. Blogs
are to do with the expression of the point of view of an individual or
group of individuals. That is pretty straightforward, although, as with
everything else, it will be subject to the courts’ deliberations
at the appropriate
time.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042238000571" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0002.htm#13042238000571">Finally,
the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland implied that the Government
believed an error had been made on micro-blogs, which therefore
required an amendment. I should gently tell her that we feel that the
measure was reasonably clear to start with, but that the amendment adds
extra clarity. In that spirit, I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for

Following the fire, the partnership dissolved. The partnership, as

in this area. That consultation led directly to the Bill before the
House this evening.</hs_Para>

important principle of commercial law that the legal personality of a
company or partnership differs from that of the directors or partners.
It is possible to prosecute a partnership in Scotland quite separately
from the individual partners under Scots criminal law. Indeed, it is
vital that we uphold the concept that legal persons, as well as the
individual partners in their own right, can be subject to liability for
actions deemed to be breaches of the criminal law.</hs_Para>

principle of the law of partnerships in Scotland is that of joint and
several liability for civil and criminal obligations incurred by the
partnership. Should a partnership be convicted of an offence following
prosecution and be subject to a fine, then any or all of the partners
may be held liable for payment of any such fine imposed by the courts.
That has been seen as critical in ensuring that the law can attach
responsibility for payment to at least one member of the partnership.
That partner then has the right to seek recompense for the outstanding
share of the financial liability thereby incurred from the other
partners, through a civil action under the partnership agreement and
the Partnership Act 1890.</hs_Para>

closes the loophole in the law that was exposed by the Rosepark
tragedy. It will permit a prosecution to be brought against a dissolved
partnership up to five years following the deemed dissolution in
respect of conduct that arose out of the partnership while it was still
in existence. Actions in criminal law may also be brought against
partnerships where the composition of partners or the membership
structure have altered, where partners have left, or new partners have
joined. Any member of a partnership may thus still be liable for any
criminal offences committed while a member of the partnership and
through any change in
composition.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042238000594" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0002.htm#13042238000594">Circumstances
that could give rise to prosecutions under the clause include:
potential breaches of section 36 of the Health and Safety at Work etc.
Act 1974; cases where an individual’s acts or omissions have
been a cause of the offence; cases where an individual is held guilty,
art and part, of a common-law or statutory offence; cases where an
individual has aided, abetted, counselled or procured the commission of
an offence under statute law; or cases where an individual has
committed an offence with their consent or connivance, or even through
neglect. The range of offences potentially liable for commission by
individual members of a partnership was significantly widened by the
Scottish Parliament, through section 53 of the Criminal Justice and
Licensing (Scotland) Act
2010.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042238000595" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0002.htm#13042238000595">Should
a partnership be convicted of an offence, any legal rule, whether in
statute or common law, relating to the liability of the partners,
applies as if the partnership had not been dissolved. This permits
joint and several

prosecution, in line with sections 4 and 9 of the Partnership Act 1890
and subject to the provisions in clause 3 of the Bill. Any fine imposed
following a conviction may be recovered against the assets of the
partnership, or any or all of the individual partners, each of whom
would have a right to claim a remedy for the other shares from assets
of the partnership, or from the other partners’ personal assets.
In some statutes, such as the Health Act 2006, the law restricts the
payment of fines to the partnership assets only, but for a dissolved
partnership under the Bill that rule will not apply, because if a
partnership is dissolved there will be no partnership assets and any
fine might otherwise prove to be unenforceable—that would be
unacceptable.</hs_Para>

element of contention that arose during the passage of the Bill, in
this House and in the other place, stemmed from clause 4, under which
it is possible for someone to have joined a partnership after the
commission of a potentially prosecutable offence and then face
liability for some or all of any penalty applied by the court following
a finding of guilt, despite the fact that that person was not involved
at the partnership at the time of commission of the offence. That was a
significant concern for the Law Society and others in Scotland, as many
businesses are organised through the partnership model.</hs_Para>

probing amendment in Committee, following similar amendments that had
been moved in the other place, to test the arguments as to whether an
exemption could be created for innocent partners who become members of
a firm, but are unaware of any potential criminal liability that could
give rise to conviction and the imposition of a fine, who then face
demands to meet a share or even the entirety of a fine from personal
assets in the absence of partnership assets or personal assets from the
pre-existing members of the firm. We were reassured by the Commission
that it is likely to keep the operation of this provision under review,
and that a more comprehensive analysis of the potential reform of
partnership law remains a possibility. In that spirit, we were happy to
withdraw the amendment.</hs_Para>

conclusion, the Bill closes an important loophole that the unsuccessful
attempts to prosecute the owners of Rosepark nursing home, following
the fatal fire, brought to light. We cannot remove the suffering that
the families and loved ones of the deceased have experienced in these
past nine years, but we can ensure that, by enacting these reforms,
other people affected by the conduct of partnerships are never put in a
similar position again. That is the best tribute we in this Parliament
can make to the 14 people who so tragically and unnecessarily lost
their lives. For those reasons, the Opposition strongly support the

declare a tangential interest as I used to be a member—regarding
its impact on partnerships. We went into this in some detail, and I
think none of us could come up with a way of dealing with this
particular issue. However, it is important to make the change,
irrespective of slight concerns. I hope the Bill proceeds. As the hon.

organisation, to ensure that its rules were fair for all members and to
allow power to flow from the EU to its members and not just the other
way around. He also said that the EU had to improve its democratic
accountability and to re-engage with voters across Europe. It is

Leslie:</Member></B> The Minister can ask me the same question as many
times as he likes, but I will give him exactly the same answer. There
are a number of reflections and metrics for judging economic
performance, but in these particularly stagnant economic circumstances,
I do not think that he should wear as a badge of honour those ultra-low
bond yields because they actually reflect low and depressed
expectations about the future performance of the economy. He knows that
that is true. It is also a reason why not just Moody’s but Fitch
have taken out the legs from beneath the UK’s triple A credit
rating after three years of stagnation, rising unemployment and
billions more borrowing to pay for economic failure. It is time that
the Treasury woke up and realised that its plan is causing long-term
damage not just to the public finances, but to British families and
businesses as they pay the price. When even their biggest
allies—the IMF and the credit rating agencies—abandon the
Government, it is time to put political pride aside and finally act to
kick-start the economy.</hs_Para>

independent forecasts suggest that on Thursday the GDP figures will
show small positive growth, but growth of just 0.3% would simply mean
that the economy was back to where it was six months ago. After three
years of stagnation, we need to see decisive evidence this week that a
strong and sustained recovery is finally under way—otherwise the
Chancellor will definitely be in real trouble. We cannot seriously be

that the genesis of much of this can be traced back to the time of the

Statistics Authority that the level of debt—which at one time
was, astonishingly, described as being “merely” £1
trillion—will go up to £1.5 trillion. However, under the
previous Government the real level of debt—taking into account
public pensions, Network Rail, nuclear decommissioning and several
other factors, which we cannot ignore—was actually up at about
£3.25 trillion, as I argued at the time, and if we include those

together, and poorer countries would become rich countries. That has
all been washed away; it is all complete nonsense. It seems the only
convergence we seek now is with an area that might be in terminal

Surplus,” which was quickly suppressed because it was too
explosive. The whole political establishment was moving towards a
pro-euro, “Let’s join the single currency and the
exchange rate mechanism at the wrong time” approach. I still
have a copy of the document and I think it can still be found on the
internet. It said that Germany had built an economy around itself, such
that it could sustain low parity for its currency against all the
others. Building that low parity for their currency into the euro meant
that the Germans would always have a competitive edge over the other
countries and could export to them freely. What they did not appreciate
was that over time those countries would run out of money and Germany
would have to lend them money to buy German products, which is what has
been happening. Germany either has to dissolve the whole arrangement or
carry on giving vast sums of money to other members of the eurozone to
help them buy German

American economy started off as the strongest economy in the world,

look at what the Government are trying to do, they are getting spending
down from 47.4% of GDP to about 40% of GDP. We know from our history
that about 40% of GDP is a sustainable level of Government spending. It
is a level that I personally would like to see reduced further, but it
is none the less a level that has 
<?notus-xml column=718?>been consistently affordable over the long run, certainly going back to
the early 1970s, based on taxation revenues going up to 38.3% of GDP.
Now, 38.3% of GDP for tax revenues is very near the peak level that has
ever been achieved. It is rare for tax revenues to go above 38% of GDP

period.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042242000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0003.htm#13042242000066">So
what is being done with the public finances is an extraordinarily
effective consolidation on both sides, with taxes being pushed up and
expenditure being cut, with most of the burden being taken by
expenditure cutting and with a small amount of it on tax raising. That
is setting the basis for a long-term recovery of the economy. Where I
think the hon. Member for Nottingham East was perhaps unduly party
political in what he said—uncharacteristically so, because he is
normally a man of such consensus, support for the middle way and so

hon. and hon. Members to page 15. The key difference between the UK

Absolutely right. It is the printing of money that is allowing the
deficit to be sustainable and is allowing businesses and individuals to
carry on borrowing and work through a consolidation of their finances,
which is also in the document—the consolidation of individual
finances—to take place in a way that is not crippling. On the
continent that is not happening, which is shown up in the gilt yield
figures. The latest gilt yield figure is 1.65%. That is the lowest in
our history. In Italy it is at 4.05% and in Spain just under 4.5%,
which shows the much tighter monetary situation in Spain and Italy as
compared with the United Kingdom. That is why the austerity programmes
in those countries are causing such extraordinary pain, whereas in this
country it is
manageable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042242000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0003.htm#13042242000068">That

trumpeters, with Garter King of Arms leading the way, to say to them,
“Look, this is how you do it. This is how you restore a country
to fiscal sense, and you do it through monetary easing.”
Although I loathe the fact that we have to report to a multinational

to set out why I oppose, as so many have, this annual charade of going
through the 
<?notus-xml column=719?>process of submitting a document entitled “Convergence Programme
for the United Kingdom”. As always, the question is: what on
earth are we converging with? Why would this country want to converge
in any way, shape or form with the other countries of the European
Union, when our growth, as judged by the EU’s own statistical
body, EUROSTAT, is forecast to be 0.9%, the EU average to be 0.1% and
the eurozone to be minus 0.3%? It is forecast not to grow at all. Why
on earth would we want to try to converge with it? What is the point of
submitting this convergence report every
year?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042242000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0003.htm#13042242000071">I
do wonder whether we ever get any feedback. Every year, the eurozone
stumbles from crisis to crisis. It does not appear to take any notice
of this document in which, since 2010 when the Government took over the
nation’s finances, we have set out for the benefit of our
European partners the way in which we manage our affairs in this
country. We may have our political differences in this Chamber as to
the right way forward for our economy, but those arguments are solely
for this Chamber and for the other place, for this Parliament, to
determine. We should in no way be beholden to the Brussels bureaucrats
when it comes to British
finances.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042242000072" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0003.htm#13042242000072">The
Minister referred to the convergence programme document, saying that no
time was spent in producing it. Nevertheless, there is a document.
Someone has spent some time putting together this weighty tome, which
this year runs to some 235 pages. It is a bespoke document, submitted
in accordance with the European treaties. This evening, time does not
permit us to go through the long process as to how we got to the state
that we are in today, but the question remains as to why we go through
this annual charade. Surely it would be much better if, as I have said
in previous years, we simply said to the bureaucrats in Brussels,
“Look, if you are that interested in finding out what we in the
UK are doing, just log on to the internet and have a look at all the
documents on the Treasury’s website. You will see the Budget
statement and the Red Book. That is what we are doing, and if you want
to comment on it, go ahead and do so. But why on earth should we waste
our time and money in submitting this convergence document to
you?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042242000073" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0003.htm#13042242000073">What
really matters is not what the Brussels bureaucrats think, but what the
British people think. At the next general election, the British people
will have a crucial choice to make. Should they vote for the party that
has led this country through the most difficult of times and put it
back on the road to recovery, taking very difficult decisions that may
well have adversely affected them? They will know in their heart of
hearts that the decisions were right; they were right for the British
economy and ultimately they will be right for them and their families.
Should they vote for the party that has put us on the road to recovery

Greatrex</B> (Rutherglen and Hamilton West) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> I am
pleased to have secured this debate. I know from the number of letters,
e-mails and, indeed, tweets I have received in the past few days that
there is concern about the prevalence of fixed-odds betting
terminals—or FOBTs, as they are commonly known—primarily
in high street betting shops. A number of hon. and right hon. Members,
some of whom are present, have also expressed concerns. Given that we
have more time available than anticipated they will be able to make
contributions, or if they want to intervene I will seek to accommodate
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042261000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0003.htm#13042261000023">I
will begin by clarifying my own position on gambling. Participants in
debates such as this are often portrayed as being either pro or
anti-gambling. I am not anti-gambling, nor do I seek to persuade the
Minister of State to prevent people from being able to gamble in
betting shops if they so choose. There are 32 such shops in my
constituency—they exist across the whole country—and I
received a briefing earlier today that informed me that they employ 152
people. Many people gamble for entertainment and in their own
time—some occasionally, some regularly—on sport, in the
casino, at bingo and in other forms, and they do so without any
problems. Indeed, most years I place a bet on Fulham winning the FA
cup. That one has not come in yet, and my annual visit to the
bookmakers seems to be as much for their amusement as for mine.
<I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I> My hon. Friend the Member for
Ealing North (Stephen Pound), a fellow Fulham supporter, reminds me
that in 1975 we came quite close. I was about eight months old at the
time, so I do not really remember it, but I am sure that he had a bet
that
day.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042261000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0003.htm#13042261000024">The
serious point is that my inclination and that of many Members of this
House is to be very cautious about regulating how people choose legally
to spend their money. That should be a matter for them and
in most cases it is. There is also a danger in seeking to extrapolate
policy from the worst cases of problem gambling. That does not mean,
however, that the Government should simply ignore the issues and
concerns that arise from the fact that between 2007 and last year, the
number of FOBTs on high streets throughout Britain near enough doubled
from 16,380 to some
32,000.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042261000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0003.htm#13042261000025">My
interest in this issue began late in 2011, when I was approached by a
constituent who in one month had gambled more than £25,000 on a
single machine in a betting shop in my constituency. He approached me
not because he had accepted that he had a gambling problem caused by
the use of the roulette game that he played, but because he was
convinced that that game was rigged. At that point, he had not thought
that he had a problem. I am pleased to say that he has now accepted
that he has a problem and is involved in a number of groups to deal
with it. A feeling that the game is rigged is often the first
indication that somebody has a problem that is getting out of
control.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042261000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0003.htm#13042261000026">When

at the local betting shop during the day on a single machine. What I
had not appreciated is that we are not talking about machines with a
£1 or £2 spin like the fruit machines in a pub, on a
ferry or in a chip shop. B2 machines, as they are known, are
casino-content terminals with high stakes, fast play and randomly
generated results. The maximum stake is £100 per spin. It is
possible, therefore, to stake £300 in a minute. In the extreme,
that means that it is possible to stake up to £18,000 in an
hour.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042261000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0003.htm#13042261000027"><Member ContinuationText="Ian Lavery" PimsId="5675" UID="13042261000121" xid="1227" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0003.htm#13042261000121"><B>Ian

Greatrex:</Member></B> My hon. Friend anticipates my next point. Even
if somebody played at the maximum speed for an hour, it would be highly
unlikely that they would lose every single time. I suspect that the
odds of losing £18,000 in an hour are pretty long. However, this
is not just an idle way to use up some spare change, with the
anticipation of winning a few pounds. Many people who use these
machines lose a significant amount of money in a relatively short
period.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042261000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0003.htm#13042261000029">I
am sure that many Members have received cards via betting shops from
the “Back your local bookie” campaign, which has made
points about the economic value that bookmakers contribute.
Betting shops often invite Members to go along and have a go on one of
these machines. They will put it in demo mode and one can press a
button and see that it is all very straightforward and fine. However, I
have chosen to be an unannounced visitor to betting shops in London and
in my constituency. What I have seen is quite alarming. People sit on
the machines for a prolonged period, playing continuously and obviously
staking significant amounts of money. Other than on weekends such as
the grand national weekend or the Scottish grand national weekend,
there is next to nobody betting over the counter. Many shops are
staffed by a single individual. Other than overseeing the premises, it
appears that there is relatively little for that individual to
do. The machines do the work, take a lot of the money and, as the
published figures demonstrate, deliver half the profit of high street
betting shop
chains.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042261000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0003.htm#13042261000030">I
also recently spent a morning with the Hamilton Gamblers Anonymous
group, who by definition are people with a gambling problem. I would
not seek to suggest that everybody who gambles from time to time, or
even a significant proportion of them, develop a problem, but from
meeting that group, it struck me that there was a clear divide between
the younger and older members. Many of the older members had developed
a problem associated with gambling on horses or sometimes dog racing,
or in casinos or on cards. All the younger members of the group had bet
significant amounts of money on betting shop machines. Either that had
been their way into gambling, from which they had developed a problem,
or they had moved on to it from other forms of gambling in betting
shops. I am sure that we have all heard stories about the impact on
homes, families and children, with relationships breaking down because
of a compulsive habit that people can indulge every day from 8
o’clock in the morning in the betting shop around the
corner.</hs_Para>

the profits of a lot of internet gambling go, but I would have more
sympathy with his argument about high street betting shops if I could
be more confident about the supposed self-regulation for people who
have a problem. People have to sign themselves in and suggest that they
have a problem, which misses out many people who have not yet accepted
that they have a problem. That is related to a point that I will make
later about the clustering of betting shops in particular parts of high
streets, which suggests that the idea is to maximise the number of
machines in close proximity so that people go from one to another. It
is hard for betting shops and the big chains to deal with problem
gambling as they encounter it when so much activity is automated; it is
much harder than in the case of traditional, over-the-counter
gambling.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042261000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0003.htm#13042261000035"><Member ContinuationText="Tracey Crouch" PimsId="5551" UID="13042261000127" xid="1041" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0003.htm#13042261000127"><B>Tracey

conveniently, to walk off the high street and into a betting shop and
gamble large sums of money. I popped into my local Ladbrokes last

the limit, I am sure that the Minister will refer to the consultation,
which recently closed. A range of organisations made submissions. The
ABB briefing makes the case for the economic impact of changing the
stake, but there is a social and economic impact in favour of such a
change. I hope the Minister considers that carefully along with other
representations. My hon. Friend was right to describe the stake as an
anomaly. The machines are different from the fruit machines that we
find in pubs, clubs and other places, and different from other gaming
machines. I am not suggesting that everybody would stake that amount of
money each time, but people can do so. They might have access to that
amount of money for only a short period and it could be better used in
other ways. If people have developed or are in the process of
developing a problem, they might well stake that amount. I do not claim
that every single machine user will bet £100 a go or £300
a minute. As I said in response to my hon. Friend the Member for
Wansbeck (Ian Lavery), I suspect that people doing so would win as well
as lose. Suggesting that someone could lose £18,000 in an hour
is extreme—it is possible but highly
unlikely.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042261000051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0003.htm#13042261000051">I
am concerned both by what I have seen and by the research that I asked
my member of staff to carry out ahead of the debate. It is very easy to
gamble a lot of money very quickly. People almost do not realise the
amount they are gambling and the speed with which they are doing it.
The nature of the machines is that they encourage people both to chase
their losses and to try to increase their wins. It is impossible to
deny that people can play roulette on an FOBT in the bookies at four
and half times the speed they can play roulette in  
<?notus-xml column=730?>a casino. The ability to get hooked, even for a short period, is
apparent. That is the experience of those I have met who have gambled
on FOBTs, partly because they are perceived by punters to be a good
bet. Why would people not believe that? The machines tell people that
there is a 97% payback, which is not that far from 100%. People
therefore believe they have a good chance of winning. Why would they
play a £70 jackpot machine in the pub when they can nip next
door to the bookies and play for a £500 jackpot on a machine
that they believe has 97%
payout?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042261000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0003.htm#13042261000052">However,
people only believe that there is a 97% payback. I asked
representatives of one of the large bookmakers how those figures were
calculated. They told me that the 97% payback is not what an individual
will win, and that it is unlikely that someone playing for 10 minutes
or half an hour will win at that rate. The 97% is an average taken from
the cash inputted into all machines against the return as a whole. That
confusion could be addressed relatively easily. Will the Minister
therefore press representatives of the gambling industry to use a more
appropriate and straightforward figure? The Gambling Act 2005 states
that gambling should be “fair and open”. Surely
explaining the chances of winning in a much clearer way, and in a way
that is much less likely to be misunderstood, is the least we can
expect.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042261000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0003.htm#13042261000053">Another
aspect of the debate—this has been mentioned in
interventions—is high streets. Those of us who live close to
high streets and main streets throughout the UK have seen a number of
betting shops opening in recent years. The most recent ABB briefing to
MPs and its press release boast of the number of shops in the high
street and their employment impact. A cluster of betting shops in one
street or one part of a street has become a common sight. Sometimes,
branches of the same firm are in very close proximity. My right hon.
Friend the Member for Tottenham (Mr Lammy) has highlighted that
previously. The Government’s review of the high
street—the Portas review—drew attention to that point
with a proposal for betting shops to be put in a distinct category. As
I am sure many hon. Members are aware, betting shops are currently in
the same bracket as banks and building societies, and there is no need
to apply for change of use through the planning
processes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042261000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0003.htm#13042261000054">Many
retail businesses, including estate agents and coffee shops, cluster
together, and retailers will always seek to locate where they believe
there is a market—supermarkets are notoriously focused on, and

shops?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042261000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0003.htm#13042261000055">The
Minister is of course aware of the increase in the number of these
machines in the past five years. As I have said, there are almost twice
as many as there were just five years ago. I am sure he also knows that
half the profits of high street bookmakers come from the machines and
that there is a limit of four machines per betting shop. It is
increasingly apparent that the opening of new betting shops is driven
by the ability to have more machines. From the figures available, it is
also apparent that clustering tends to occur in places with more social
deprivation and lower overall incomes.</hs_Para>

believe that the Government should seek to determine on a national
level whether there is over-provision of businesses in a particular
area, but it should be open to local authorities and licensing
authorities to do so. 
<?notus-xml column=731?>The case being pursued by Newham council is indicative not just of a
community that feels it has enough betting shops and machines already,
but of a wider frustration that all too often local authorities feel
there is very little they can do to address their concern. I do not
expect the Minister to comment in detail on that case as it is in the
process of going through the courts, but does he think that it should
be possible for local councils and licensing boards to have the
flexibility to determine whether there is a need for further betting
shops in particular communities and how many machines should be
available in each betting shop?</hs_Para>

the campaign postcards we have been receiving in recent weeks is that
machines make a contribution to the economy, keeping betting shops
going and employing people in constituencies across the UK. The
economic impact of betting shops is important, but it needs to be
assessed in the context of the total impact on local economies. As the
Minister may be aware, a recent study by Landman Economics found that
the £1 billion in FOBT spend supports 7,000 jobs in
the gambling sector, compared to 20,000 jobs if that
expenditure were used elsewhere. Put another way, there could be 13,000
fewer jobs for every £1 billion spent through the
machines. Money being used to gamble in local high streets may be good
for the big chains and their overall profit margins, but the local
impact can be less beneficial. More and more betting shops are
employing fewer staff, as gambling through machines has less need for
personal interaction.</hs_Para>

industry groups are robust and sometimes dismissive in their response
to those concerns. Their perspective can be summarised thus: something
being popular means that it does not cause problems; look at all the
people employed in betting shops and the shops’ contribution to
the local economy; and everybody knows exactly what they are doing
because lots of them have A-levels. That type of attitude highlights
precisely why the Government should keep the impact of the machines
under review and not leave the industry to act under its own
initiative.</hs_Para>

industry argues that there is no evidence to suggest that FOBTs are
addictive, anecdotal evidence suggests that there is a problem. The
confusion in the Government’s own statements is
apparent. In the consultation document I referred to earlier, they say
that the causal link “remains poorly understood”.
However, they also say that the association between high stake, high
price machines and gambling-related harm is widely accepted, which
makes the decision to end the gambling prevalence study all the more
concerning. Will the Minister respond, in particular, to the point that
research is required to determine the evidence on the likelihood of
problem gambling? I am conscious that the people I have spoken to in my
constituency are those with problems and that there are many who do not
have problems, but the level of concern suggests that much closer
attention should be paid.</hs_Para>

but it needs to be constantly monitored and updated. In 2007, when the
Department for Culture, Media and Sport commissioned a scoping study on

because, as he said, 40% of their profits come from the machines. But
how would that address the computer issue, which I believe is a
big problem? There is no regulation there at all. If we want to resolve

betting shops. He will be aware of the relatively recent increase in
the number of betting shops in certain areas, which I contend is due,
at least in part, to the ability to have more machines. The benefit of
that is to the betting shops and chains—they are nearly all
chains, and in some cases there is more than one branch of the same
chain, but there will certainly tend to be one of each in close
proximity. An assessment of their economic impact and their benefit to
the local community, including from the jobs they provide, must be set

the point that these new machines, which have been put in over time,
are attracting people in off the streets and allowing them to make
massive bets that they could not make before. If we took out the
machines, or reverted to what is acceptable in clubs, pubs or other
gambling establishments, where much less money can be spent, the
logical outcome would be fewer betting shops. These are not betting
shops as we know them, with betting on horse racing and football, if,
as he says, people are going in to use the machines. If we eliminated
the machines and reverted to what used to be the case, would we not
reduce the number of betting
shops?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042261000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0003.htm#13042261000067"><B><Member ContinuationText="Tom Greatrex" PimsId="5564" UID="13042261000142" xid="1134" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0003.htm#13042261000142">Tom
Greatrex:</Member></B> Certainly, most activity in betting shops takes
place on the machines, rather than on over-the-counter betting, and
that seems to have led to a change in the number of people being
employed. Not in all chains, but certainly in some, there used always
to be at least two people, with people betting at the counter, but now
there is often only one person. So these machines might already have
had an impact on jobs. We need to look at the issue carefully, because
these machines have a significant impact. That is not good for any
community, no matter how many betting shops there are there, nor does
the number in a particular area necessarily justify a high prevalence
of machines or the high stakes that can be gambled each time.</hs_Para>

British Bookmakers is on the Responsible Gambling Strategy
Board’s machines expert panel or that a special partner in a
company that owns an FOBT supplier is also a member of the board? If

came across—that is, as those of a concerned constituency Member
of Parliament, not someone who is anti-gambling, who has the intent to
close down every bookmaker or who would suggest that people should not
gamble. People can gamble if they wish—I do occasionally, as do
others. There is nothing wrong with that: it is a legitimate
entertainment and leisure pursuit for many people—sometimes
occasionally, sometimes regularly, as I have outlined. However, if we
get into a situation where very many people have serious problems as a
result of being able to gamble large amounts of money in a short period
on such machines, that is something that the Government should address,
as I hope the Minister will.</hs_Para>

Crouch</B> (Chatham and Aylesford) (Con):</Member> I rise briefly to
offer some cross-party support for the hon. Member for Rutherglen and
Hamilton West (Tom Greatrex) and the concerns he has raised. I am not
anti-gambling; in fact, I like more than a regular flutter, normally on
the horses, not the football—I have much better sense than that.
However, I have concerns about the proliferation not just of betting
shops, but of the number of FOBTs in them. I am not one often to engage
in tribal politics and I certainly do not want to do so on this
occasion, but that is clearly a consequence of the liberalisation of
gambling that we saw under the previous Government.</hs_Para>

is incumbent on us as a responsible Government to try to reach a
solution to the problem. I share the hon. Gentleman’s
view about giving local authorities the opportunity to provide part of
the solution. A cross-party working group on Medway council has
recently produced a paper, to try to ensure that it can have a role to
play in reducing the number of bookmakers on the high street.
Bizarrely, Chatham high street is not in the Chatham and Aylesford
constituency, but that is where the heart of some of these problems
lies.</hs_Para>

benefits of having fixed-odds betting terminals in betting shops, but I
have concerns about the number of such machines in those shops and
about the amount of money that can very quickly be staked, lost and won
on them. That creates an incentive to people to go in and use the
machines. I long for the day when I can go into my local bookies and
queue up to place a bet on a horse, but, as the hon. Gentleman said,
more people are playing on the machines than are filling out the card.
In fact, I quite enjoy going into a bookies and shocking people when I
place a bet on a horse. I do not think they expect a woman, let alone
the local Member of Parliament, to walk into a
bookies.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042261000077" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0003.htm#13042261000077">I

have heard many distressing tales of where people have run into
problems using the type of machines that the hon. Member for Rutherglen

stories is, of course, a personal tragedy not just for the individual,
but for their friends and colleagues—and indeed, for the wider
society. As was pointed out earlier, however, we also have to balance
such matters with a recognition that for the majority of people,
gambling does not develop into a problem. As I think the hon.

the Gambling Commission’s industry statistics for the period
April 2011 to March 2012, the gambling industry employed almost 110,000
people—a considerable number—with the betting sector
making up the largest component, employing nearly 55,000
people in full or part-time posts. That makes the gambling industry a
significant contributor to the UK economy. The Office for National
Statistics estimated that in 2009 it was directly worth £4.9
billion in gross value added terms. What I think I am saying to the
hon. Gentleman is not one thing or the other, but that there is a
balance to be struck here. To be fair, he recognises
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042261000084" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0003.htm#13042261000084">Let
me say a few words about betting shops. The hon. Gentleman mentioned
what has been a recurrent theme during recent times, about which
concerns have been raised by a large number of stakeholders: the
clustering of betting shops within certain local areas. The key
concern—it has been raised tonight—often relates to the
B2 machines and their impact on local communities in respect of problem
gambling.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042261000085" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0003.htm#13042261000085">The
overall number of betting shops has remained reasonably stable in
recent years. In 2009, there were 8,862 and by September 2012 there
were 9,049—not a huge difference. Those figures are well down on
the peak of 16,000 during the 1960s. The hon. Gentleman is absolutely
right, however, that more betting shops are relocating to the high
street, which makes them more
visible.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042261000086" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0003.htm#13042261000086">I
am not entirely shrugging my shoulders when I say that planning policy
is, of course, an issue for the Department for Communities and Local
Government. It is relevant to the debate to note that local authorities
have a range of enforcement powers—I appreciate that the hon.
Gentleman would like them to have more—that can be used to
manage the overall retail diversity and the viability of town centres.

Robertson:</Member></B> That is a very good question. I have to tread a
little carefully because of the consultation. As a Minister who has
already been judicially reviewed once, over a football stadium, I am
not in hurry to go through that joyous process again, to be honest, so
I will tread reasonably carefully here. Many of the factors mentioned
tonight may be behind this particular development. It is pretty clear
where betting shops are making their money at the moment. As my hon.
Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Tracey Crouch) mentioned,
the pattern of betting has changed quite a lot over recent years.
Betting shops are sometimes able to pay rents that other retail outlets
cannot afford, there have been changes in shopping patterns and there
is also the changing nature of the high street. All those things are
factors, but I will not go a great deal further than that until we have
had the chance to analyse the responses to the
consultation.</hs_Para>

Slaughter:</Member></B> Let me try to push the Minister a little
further. It is perhaps not so much the absolute numbers or even
necessarily the clustering itself that is the issue, but where the
clustering is taking place. In my relatively poor constituency, there
are two or three times the number of betting shops as there are in
neighbouring more prosperous constituencies. In Chelsea or Richmond, a
third or half the number of betting shops will be found than in an area
such as Shepherd’s Bush. That is the
concern.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042261000090" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0003.htm#13042261000090"><B><Member ContinuationText="Hugh Robertson" PimsId="400" UID="13042261000152" xid="503" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/debtext/130422-0003.htm#13042261000152">Hugh
Robertson:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman made his point very well.
The rent that betting shops with machines of this kind are able to pay
is crucial. Presumably, if they move to Chelsea the retail rents will
rise, and that may price them out of the area. There is almost
certainly a social element in all this, and I suspect that that is the
answer that the hon. Gentleman hoped I would give him. We will consider
all the evidence in the course of this review and the review that will
be undertaken in due course by the Remote Gambling Association. I shall

reviews are taking place. The triennial review of stakes and prizes

Gambling Commission’s statistics show that between March 2011
and April 2012, an average of just over 35,500 machines were capable of
offering B2 category games in betting shops in Great Britain. The
number has remained relatively stable since 2009, but, as was pointed
out by the hon. Member for Rutherglen and Hamilton West, that stability
has occurred at a time when machine numbers elsewhere have declined.
For example, according to Gambling Commission figures, the overall
number of gaming machines fell by 10% between 2011 and 2012, and the
number of B2 machines increased by 1% during the same period. That
would appear to show that B2 machines are popular consumer products,
which may give rise to some of the problems identified by the hon.

in particular. In dealing with the problem, for reasons that I have
already given, I must proceed on the basis of evidence. I hope
that the combination of the two reviews that I have mentioned will give
us the evidential base that we need in order to work out exactly what
is happening and what needs to be done as a consequence. We want to

most vulnerable in society. Like every other Member who is present
tonight, I recognise that that is the case and that there is a problem
with these machines. We need a fair and balanced review. We need people
to be honest about this. People cannot lose £18,000 in an hour

£100,000 in one minute on one bet; they can put £250,000

bingo halls also have machines, but not machines of such an infectious
nature, perhaps because they cannot afford the licence. The comparison
that has to be made is this: are people more likely to go to the

hall where the sums they can put in are limited to 10p, 20p or
£1, which is the highest

£15, which is seven or eight times the maximum on a B3 machine.
That, rather than the

concerns to me. This is an anomaly, because these are off-site betting
opportunities, where the server is off-site, and suddenly people can
gamble a much higher sum. I am sure the Minister is aware of that,

discussed, in recent weeks, about EU and non-EU migration. In many
ways, Bulgarian and Romanian migration from inside the EU cannot be
fully contextualised unless it is placed in the wider immigration
debate about those who want to settle in Britain from outside the EU.
In all such discussions and debates, I believe that tone, accuracy and
objectivity, rather than subjectivity, must be our goal as policy
makers—to articulate fact rather than fiction, to be pragmatic
rather than ideological, and to seek out solutions rather than
scapegoats. As legislators, our responsibility lies not only in what we
enact, but in what we articulate. Words still have power in politics,
especially in the sensitive area of immigration. I am sure that this
afternoon, the tone and content of Members’ contributions will
show that the House of Commons is in touch with all the communities it
represents while ensuring that the debate attracts more light than
heat.</hs_Para>

is true that there is little trust between the public and mainstream
parties on immigration. Is that any surprise? So often, the public have
been misinformed and misled about the true impact of immigration. That
is something that the Labour party has recently recognised and
admitted, which is welcome, but it cannot right the wrongs of the past
decade. Labour’s open-door policy broke the trust between
politicians and the public on an issue where public trust is
vital.</hs_Para>

is part of our ongoing national narrative and it needs trust from all
communities, including immigrant and migrant communities. Whatever
politicians say, no politician—however clever, however
insistent, however tough their rhetoric—can spin their way out
of people’s experience of the impact of immigration on their
everyday lives. Individuals, families and communities in rural and
urban areas have felt the rapid social change that mass migration and
immigration can bring. It is undeniable that EU migration impacts on
schools, hospitals, public transport and social housing queues. It is
real-life experience, not exaggerated politics.</hs_Para>

the record that immigration has brought many benefits to this country.
One only has to look at the national health service and the armed
forces and immigration’s benefits are clear. There are many
other  
<?notus-xml column=188?>examples, which colleagues will no doubt underscore this afternoon. In
my constituency, immigration has brought many economic benefits in the
rural industries, in local manufacturing and in other areas. It is also
right that Britain should remain attractive to genuine foreign students
and those who fill national skills gaps in so-called “shortage
occupations”, such as paediatricians, maths teachers, chemical
engineers and in other skills and professions. Again, international
students can be found in Shropshire—as they are found all over
the country—in for example, the Defence College of Aeronautical
Engineering or Harper Adams university.</hs_Para>

very much open for business, and may that always be the case. The
to-ing and fro-ing of foreign nationals coming here to work and study
is nothing new, but in recent years, the scale of those who have abused
their visa status and British hospitality and generosity has been
unprecedented. That is why mainstream political parties must be willing
to talk about it and take action. By doing so, we, as a Parliament,
isolate extremist and fringe parties. It is my view that the duty of
all legislators is to hold an open and honest debate about the benefits
of immigration and migration to Britain, while acknowledging that there
are some disbenefits, and that there can be real societal changes as a
result of uncontrolled immigration.</hs_Para>

2014, or a date to be agreed, and regularise their visa status, and is
subsequently caught, will be banned from re-entering the United Kingdom

be asked to leave, but could reapply to return to the UK on a future

means that over the last three years 250,000 fewer immigrants have come
into the UK than would have been the case under the last Government.
This Government deserve much credit for their record, not least for
rooting out 600-plus bogus language schools and colleges and for
doubling fines for unscrupulous employers—a subject that was
touched on earlier—for hiring illegal workers. Often, they are
hired for less than the minimum wage and exploited, with their rights
suspended. I hope that the hon. Member for Caerphilly (Wayne David)
will welcome the doubling of those
fines.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042225000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042225000028">I

in binding legislation rather than as guidance, as should the policy of
giving housing priority to our armed forces. There should be no
opt-outs. According to the Government, only half of all councils
currently set local residency tests. That needs to change. The reality
is that some councils, especially in some urban areas, may be tempted,
for political reasons, not to implement that
policy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042225000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042225000033">The

This is not isolated only to European migrants, but our focus today is
on Bulgaria and Romania, and a BBC poll, issued at five past midnight
today, suggests that no more than 4% of Bulgarians and 1% of Romanians
might consider coming to the UK in 2014. Given that 150,000 Bulgarians
and Romanians are already here, under the permitted work scheme and via
other routes, I suspect that the “Newsnight” poll is
somewhat timid in its estimate, but even if those percentages are
accurate, that would mean 350,000 people from each working-age
population, from each of the countries, arriving in the UK. I refer the

wider primary care demand, which is why the Government are right to try
to recoup millions from other European economic area Governments when
their citizens use the NHS. It should have been happening for years,
but it has not been. Hospitals might be required, through statute, to
do their bit, perhaps with financial incentives for trusts to
co-operate with the Government on the legal status of the patients they
look after. Surely NHS trust boards should have a duty to ensure that
those they treat, save in emergencies, are those who have the first
right to be treated. That is not lacking compassion, but recognising
that the NHS, even with record funding under the Conservative-led
Government, has finite and scarce resources—it is the national
health service, not the international health service. Britain must
remain an open and tolerant society, but we cannot be the hospital for
the world. Health tourism must end, and health trusts, not only the
Government, have a major role to play in delivering fairness in
treatment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042245000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000004"><B><Member ContinuationText="Chris Bryant" PimsId="2350" UID="13042245000255" xid="76" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000255">Chris

are based in Spain and have a problem getting NHS treatment there, so
many of them come back to the UK to use the service here. The real

first, those same GPs know that the NHS has scarce resources and,
secondly, whether GPs are prepared to deal with health tourism or not,
let us at least discuss it with the General Medical Council, the
British Medical Association, GPs and acute trusts and primary care
trusts—now clinical commissioning groups. We need a grown-up

credit to Migration Watch UK, which arguably has the best and most
consistent record on immigration data. It estimates that 250,000
Bulgarians and Romanians will move to the UK between 2014 and 2019 and,
as we heard earlier, the figure could be higher. Such an influx will
reshape communities, affect public services and strain social

need to bear down on racism and xenophobia, but one of the best ways of
doing that, as policy makers, is not through reactive policies but
through preventive and proactive ones that make a difference to

The British people are tolerant people, but they want an immigration
system they can trust, that is fair and that helps the most vulnerable,
not one that takes advantage of British generosity of heart and British
hospitality. The Government are making genuine progress in achieving
that, but there is still much to

Although I do not think that we will get a solution in this Chamber
today to the problems he has raised, I hope that by having the debate

Parliament is prepared to discuss this very important issue openly and

enlargement—the enlargement arrangements went through the House
with no one voting against them. I declare my interest as Minister for
Europe when the enlargement of the EU began in earnest, and I well
remember visiting Bucharest and Sofia, and the other eastern European
countries, and telling them that Government and Opposition were united
in ensuring that Romania and Bulgaria, and indeed the other countries,
should enter the EU, so that for the first time in many decades we
would have a united Europe.</hs_Para>

enlargement. It has provided enormous benefits for our country, and in
a discussion of this kind we should recognise that it has been an

had signed the e-petition by 2 pm today, and unless we discuss the
matter, and unless the Government are prepared to come up with some
solutions to the issues that have been raised, I fear that this will
become a dominant issue as we approach the next general election. It is

On 21 October 2008, the then shadow Immigration Minister, the right

really take into consideration the numbers who would eventually come.
The question was never really put properly and never really answered,

on future numbers”. However, on the BBC on 13 January, the
Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government said there
would be an “influx” of Romanians and Bulgarians,
increasing pressure in terms of existing housing shortages. Only last
Thursday, when the Home Secretary appeared before the Select Committee,
she could provide us with no further information. On 20 February, the
Deputy Prime Minister said on his weekly LBC show that there were
“guesstimates”. He added that he would not “lend
too much credence to estimates which may well go on to prove to be
inaccurate”.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042245000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000053">At
the heart of this is the need for us to have clear estimates and
predictions, and we can, because we all acknowledge that this is an

number of other countries will also lift their restrictions on 31
December—a point the Home Secretary made to the Select
Committee. Even given that, however, it is still important to have the
information at hand so that we can have an informed debate and make an
informed judgment. We need that information when we look at local
services, which I think are at the kernel of local people’s

operating in silos and the inability of the best of our civil service

whether there was much cross-departmental working on reports in the

the point about benefits, it is worth noting that at the time of the A8
enlargement, the number of Poles claiming JSA was less than 7,000 out
of the 500,000 who came here. However, I recall a parliamentary reply
about the number of people from EU countries who claim benefits for
children who are not resident here; I think that that came to
£50 million a year. I think that it is not so much the right of
people to claim benefits if they pay taxes and contribute to the
economy, as the fact that some people claim benefits when their
children are not even resident, that upsets the British people, who, as
the hon. Member for The Wrekin has said, are a very tolerant and
understanding lot. However, they will not stand for abuse of the
system, and people taking advantage of a system to which they have not
contributed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042245000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000059">I
accept the point made by the hon. Member for The Wrekin, whom I have
known for many years, that there are jobs that are difficult to fill,
such as fruit-picking—I cannot quite imagine him picking
strawberries in Shropshire, but am trying to fix that in my
mind—but the Romanian and Bulgarian communities in this country
are making a contribution to the economy and paying tax, even though
the majority of them are self-employed. We have 6,000 students; we have
doctors, nurses, professionals and people in all walks of life. The
hon. Gentleman need only go to certain parts of north and west London
to see the contribution that those people make. Of course there are
certain jobs that cannot be filled, but those people already contribute
to the operation of the
country.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042245000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000060">One
way in which we can deal with the issue is by beginning an effective
dialogue with the Governments of Romania and Bulgaria. For some reason
known only to the Home Secretary, for six months she resisted telling
me whether she had ever visited Romania. Eventually, when she gave
evidence last Thursday to the Home Affairs Committee, she admitted that
she had not; it is all right—we shall not ask the Minister the
same question tomorrow. I can suggest a way of dealing with the issue,
with a friendly EU country with which we do business every day, and
with which we want to keep friendly relations, not least because we
have begun our negotiation process with countries such as Romania and
Bulgaria to try to put a package towards the British people for the
referendum that is going to come—and as the hon. Member for The
Wrekin and other hon. Members know, I fully support a referendum on
whether we stay in the EU or come out. It would be helpful if the Home
Secretary or the Minister for Immigration would go to Bucharest or
Sophia and speak to their opposite numbers to see what can be done to
make the transition as smooth as possible, and find out the root causes
of migration from those countries—and not just rely on a BBC
poll. Helpful though that is—and I am sure that
“Newsnight” will present a good programme
tonight—it is such personal contacts that are important. I hope
that the Minister will take the opportunity to do that in the next few
months.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042245000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000061">The
Home Affairs Committee is, as I have said, conducting an inquiry on the
matter. We are also considering the effect of the European arrest
warrant and the Government’s proposals. We tagged on a visit to
Romania before our visit to Poland, and we shall 
<?notus-xml column=201?>produce a report, thanks to work done by the hon. Members for Hertsmere
(Mr Clappison) and for Rochester and Strood (Mark Reckless), who have
driven the issue in the Committee. We hope that we can come up with a

been expressed in the debate today, but also the views of outside

UK.</hs_Para>

us not lose sight of one important fact: we have good relations with
Romania and Bulgaria. I pay tribute to the Romanian ambassador, Ion
Jinga, and to Ambassador Konstantin Dimitrov, who throughout the debate
have been balanced in what they have said. I pay tribute also to Martin
Harris, our ambassador in Bucharest, who recently won an award for
excellence in communication in the relationship between our two
countries. What I have to say is directed not at hon. Members, who are
not those responsible, but at those in other political parties not
represented in Parliament, who put out election leaflets that are
simply not true. Let us have a debate about the issue, and a report
based on facts. More than anything else, let us have the estimates and
predictions. It will make our task, at the beginning of next year, much
easier.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-04-22?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_04_22_PT_1/ED7ECC0AED75FC85E37C98663D982813DA25AE20" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="22 April 2013">Monday

congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard)
on a first-class speech. I cannot say that I agreed with all of it, but
I agreed with a great part of it, and he reflected well the grave
concern that is felt outside this Chamber. I am sorry to say that I
cannot follow the Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, the right
hon. Member for Leicester East (Keith Vaz). I think that we all
remember the rather lowering period when he was a Minister at the

moderation, consulting and all the rest of it, but I think that the

hon. Friend the Member for The Wrekin said, has, together with the Home
Secretary, pushed the debate forward and taken important steps. They
have so far succeeded in driving down the numbers significantly. I am
grateful to him for several meetings. He knows that is important for
the credibility of government—not party Government but
government of the country—that the Government should be seen to
reflect the great concern about the question of immigration and the way
it has been allowed to run riot. I agree with everything that my hon.
Friend said about the debt that this country owes to immigrants, who
have played, and will continue to play, an important role; but that is
not what we are talking about
today.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042245000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000066">As
my hon. Friend the Minister knows, there is a serious risk of a
significant inflow of Romanian and Bulgarian immigrants. There is no
shadow of doubt about it. The unbelievable cupidity and foolishness of 
<?notus-xml column=202?>the last Labour Government in not dealing with the matter beforehand is
shaming to the Government of this country and shows how feeble they
were. The problem lies, as they should have understood, in the huge
difference in the standard of living between those countries and the
United Kingdom. The reaction is an entirely understandable one to the
opportunity to come. People will take that opportunity—I am not
in any doubt about that.</hs_Para>

wild cards that have not been mentioned this afternoon. First, there
are nearly 1 million Romanians and Bulgarians in Spain, and a similar
number in Italy. There must be a serious risk that some will relocate
to northern Europe—perhaps to Germany, France, the Netherlands
or the United Kingdom. Secondly, there is the possibility that
minorities who are heavily discriminated against in their own countries
will seek a better life in the United Kingdom. That is most clearly a
possibility in relation to the Roma.</hs_Para>

easy solutions. The cross-party group on balanced migration has
suggested that consideration should be given to whether EU members
should have powers, during periods of high unemployment, to restrict
the free movement of labour, which is at present guaranteed by EU law.
To me, that is one of the fundamental reforms that the European Union
needs to look at without fear. If Europe is to survive as an entity, it
must be able to move forward and break out of the silos in which it
currently runs itself. It is folly not to consider that kind of
suggestion: it may find very good reason to shoot it down, but it
should look at
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042245000069" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000069">The
role of the welfare state needs the most careful consideration. The
payment of in-work benefits, such as tax credits, to low-paid workers
contributes substantially to the financial incentive to migrate. There
is again no doubt whatever about that. Access to the UK benefit system
is primarily based on residence. An EU national who moves to the UK and
is considered habitually resident has the same entitlement to benefits
as a UK national, regardless of their previous tax or national
insurance contributions. Currently, habitual residence is automatic for
workers and the self-employed, and qualification is easy for
jobseekers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042245000070" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000070">The
cross-party group recommends that there should be a requirement of a
period of time—or contributions—of, say, six months
before in-work benefits are paid. On jobseekers, there seems to be no
reason why EU citizens who do not find work should be entitled to
benefits in the United Kingdom when they have the simple option of
getting on a bus and going home. We should encourage that, perhaps even
by going so far as to offer them a ticket. To implement those policies
successfully the habitual residence test needs to be tightened and
centrally administered by the Department for Work and
Pensions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042245000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000071">Many
other Members have more to say than me. I simply conclude by earnestly
and truly congratulating the Minister and the Home Secretary on the
progress made so far on this fiendishly difficult issue. One thing on
which I most congratulate him is the very sane way in which he has
approached the debate, making the point about the importance of keeping
the vocabulary and language moderate and sensible. This is not a war;
this is a national problem for this country that must be addressed. We
will only be able to deal with it probably—possibly
even—at the margins, but deal with it we must in a frank way, in
the interests of our
country.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-04-22?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_04_22_PT_1/67E6B75A9A167B96DAAADF14EF5B90B9968A0F90" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="22 April 2013">Monday

about immigration, it has never been about the colour of
somebody’s skin or about the culture or country they come from;
it has always been just about the numbers. Our country is one of the
most crowded in the world, and we simply cannot cope with another
large-scale wave of immigration into this country, especially from
countries with which we have very little in common, such as Romania and
Bulgaria.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042245000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000075">Let

we should control that with a work permit or visa system. With our

right hon. Member for Leicester East (Keith Vaz) made a valid point in
saying that Her Majesty’s Government needs to provide a sensible

is sensible to start by seeing how many came to our shores from the A8
accession countries—the first wave of immigration from eastern
Europe. We now have just over 1.1 million eastern Europeans from those
A8 countries, which have a combined population of just under
73 million. That is a rate of 1.5%. That is a known—a
fact—and it is indisputable. If we apply that same rate to the
entry of Romania, with 21 million people, and Bulgaria with
7 million, the 155,000 from those two countries presently
resident in the UK would climb to some 425,000. That means that we can,

currently resident in this

400,000 Romanians and Bulgarians in this country. I hope I am

leads to another difficulty, because hon. Members have spoken about the
habitual residency test. People can now come to this country from
another EU country, claim to be self-employed and automatically get
themselves on the benefit entitlement list. The idea that EU nationals
are excluded from benefits until they have made a certain level of
contributions over a certain period of time is simply not the case. The
Roma community from Bulgaria and Romania has accessed that loophole,
which makes British people extremely cross, as does giving child
benefit to families whose children remain in their country of origin.

we are to stay in the European Union, which I do not favour, the very
least that should be done on benefit entitlement is to introduce a
reciprocal arrangement so that people who come to this country from
another EU nation state are entitled to claim only the level of benefit
they would have obtained in their country of origin. That would act as
a big disincentive to benefit tourists, who come to us because of our
relatively generous benefits system. One of the reasons why such
immigration from EU nation states has become more of a problem as the
EU has expanded is that the EU has been expanding into countries that
are far, far poorer than our own. National income levels in Romania and
Bulgaria are only about a fifth of the United Kingdom’s level,
so there is a huge economic incentive, especially for young people, to
come to this
country.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042245000100" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000100"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Ward" PimsId="5541" UID="13042245000302" xid="1015" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000302">Mr

receive full entitlement to all benefits as soon as they arrive. They
are obviously not entitled to income-related benefits until they have
an income record, although what the hon. Gentleman says about child
benefit is true. The growing number of Roma in particular who are now

The Prime Minister spoke earlier this year about a cross-Government
immigration system, and he picked up on a couple of issues. He talked
about stopping a benefits system that people perceived as a soft touch
and ensuring that the entitlement to public services was something that
migrants earned, rather than had an absolute right to straight away,
which is important. He also talked about cracking down on illegal
working, and there was a significant amount of that in the district I
represented. There is a grey economy that is unchecked and needs to be
challenged.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042245000110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000110">As
a consequence of the Conservative-led coalition, immigration has been
checked and reduced by a third. That is a huge figure that will give
many of my constituents confidence that we take the issue seriously. We
are beginning to take control of migration and we are, with some more
structural challenges, challenging the border control agency as well.
The other points that the Prime Minister made were about cutting
benefits for non-EU nationals after six months, which is important, and
stopping the “something for nothing” social housing
access.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042245000111" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000111">My

Field) commented on health tourism, which we need to address. We get a
significant number of people coming to our district with genuine health
problems, and there is an issue with repeat prescriptions and people
sending them back home. We need to understand and challenge that and,
if we are going to offer that service, we need to charge for it, as
other hon. Members have said. There is an issue that health
professionals need to debate, because when someone arrives unconscious
at A and E, they are not going to check their passport to see whether
the person is eligible to be cared for. I would not want a system that
did not ensure that people with that need were cared for first, before
we started talking about their nationality.</hs_Para>

will become increasingly ratcheted up in a race for crescendo, for the
ideal hard-line rhetoric associated with immigration, but that would be
self-defeating and, if we are not careful, it will play to the
advantage of the far right. We want the right language and

speak as someone who quite likes the multicultural nature of Great
Britain and who has benefited from it in many ways in my previous life
outside this place and then as a Member of the European Parliament,
when I came to experience and know some of the wonderful institutions
with which the Minister now deals regularly to solve the problem we
have. Immigration is probably the thorniest political issue of our
time, if not of all time. We only need to look at the United States of
America to see Republicans and Democrats working on a solution to how
they can deal with those people in the United States who should not be
there, whether with an amnesty process or whatever. It is a tough topic
across the
globe.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042245000119" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000119">The
Government are beginning to get some things right, with net migration
down a third since May 2010. In June 2011, the number of people coming
in was 247,000 to 250,000, but in June 2012, 163,000—a fall of a
third, welcome to my constituents. It is also interesting to see where
immigration comes from: pre 31 December this year, 55% consists of
nationals from outside the European economic area, 30% EU nationals and
15% Brits returning from abroad, where the sun on the costas might not
be as nice as it used to be, with other issues elsewhere. The net
migration statistics are welcome because they show that the Government
are looking at immigration seriously—the first time in a long
time for a British Government. I come with some heart to the debate,
therefore, because the Minister completely understands that my
constituents and those of all right hon. and hon. Members who have
spoken before me, on either side of the political divide, are truly
concerned about what might happen after 31 December this year with
potential migration from Romania and Bulgaria.</hs_Para>

on the door of a constituent, the first thing that he or she has to say
to me when I ask about their concerns is, “I am not a racist
but…”, and I hate that, because such people have genuine
concerns about what their country looks like and how it feels. They are
not racist at all and welcome the fact, as I do, that we have a much
more multicultural Britain nowadays than we did before. Nevertheless,
they feel that a big issue is coming down the line: Romanian and
Bulgarian migration. We are talking not about the stuff, discussed by
my hon. Friend the Member for Keighley (Kris Hopkins), that the far
right is trying to engender—I saw leaflets circulated during the
county council elections that were unpleasant to say the least, as well
as factually impossible or incorrect—but about concerns in

ones.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042245000121" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000121">Some
members of the Public Accounts Committee are present, and not so long
ago a number of us went on a Committee visit to our Chair’s
constituency in Barking. We were examining pressure on primary school
places, and we went to the fantastic Gascoigne primary
school—now the largest in the country, they believe—where
a huge number of languages is spoken, some of which I have never heard
of. The school is situated beside the Gascoigne estate, which includes
a number—nine, I think—of large, horrible tower blocks,
which were due to be taken down not so long ago. If someone migrates to
this country, legally or otherwise, or crosses the border and registers
with the authorities, one of the places that they will put
people—most of whom  come to London to start with, which
is completely understandable—is the Gascoigne estate. The
Gascoigne primary school, therefore, has at least eight to 10 pupils
coming in new and eight to 10 pupils leaving every week throughout the
school year, according to the head teacher, an excellent gentleman; one
class last year had an 82% turnover in
pupils.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042245000122" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000122">Dealing
with such a flow is difficult for any teaching establishment, and in
the Gascoigne school it was all down to migration, some of which is
good, with people coming to this country to work as hard as they can.
The current pressure on our public services in general,
however—on that school, or the hospitals around it—cannot
be overestimated, and my constituents are concerned that, as of 1
January next year, the pressures on our public services will get
greater and we need to plan for that. We cannot blame
people—anyone—for wanting to come to this fantastic
country of ours to work, to study or to do anything, because it is a
wonderful place to do all those things. If I were in the situation of a
Bulgarian person struggling to find work in my home country and with
mouths to feed, I would absolutely up sticks and try to find work
elsewhere. We cannot blame individuals for doing that, but we need a
policy whereby it is slightly more difficult for mass migration to take
place in future
circumstances.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042245000123" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000123">We
should therefore look at how to predict better because, as many Members
have said, we have some issues on numbers. The Minister has formed a
cross-departmental committee to look at that and some of the other
issues mentioned in the debate, and I would like to hear how that
committee is going. As we have recognised in our contributions so far,
the subject is of interest not only to people interested in Europe or
in the wonderful Home Department but for its effect on education, the
health service, transport networks and the whole

understand that benefits available to EU migrants in the UK are being
compared with migrant benefits in other EU member states. EU law
requires that people who move from one member state to another, with a
right of residence in the host state, should not be discriminated
against in their access to benefits simply on the basis of nationality.
The provisions of EU law, however, do not harmonise the rules governing
entitlement to each type of benefit throughout the member states.
Anyone who has travelled in the EU knows that each individual country
has different types of benefit: some have generous out-of-work
benefits, some limited ones. Reciprocal arrangements are agreed,
therefore—probably across the political divide—but the
type of benefit is not
agreed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042245000125" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000125"><B><Member ContinuationText="Chris Bryant" PimsId="2350" UID="13042245000308" xid="76" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000308">Chris
Bryant:</Member></B> I think the biggest difference that matters
legally in the EU is whether a benefit is contributory or
non-contributory. If it is non-contributory, everyone—Belgian,
French, Romanian and so on—must be treated exactly the same as a
Brit, but if it is contributory, different British people are treated
differently. My worry is that the UK is moving further down a route
towards non-contributory benefits which might have significant
financial implications for us in relation to other
countries.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042245000126" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000126"><B><Member ContinuationText="Chris Heaton-Harris" PimsId="914" UID="13042245000309" xid="1067" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000309">Chris
Heaton-Harris:</Member></B> I welcome the hon. Gentleman’s
intervention, and I understand exactly what he is saying. I was coming
to the specific point about contributory benefits. In the United
Kingdom, most people’s worries, founded or unfounded, are that a
group of people will head here and, without contributing anything to
our society, take a lot from it. Everyone is trying to articulate those
fears as generously as possible, and I know that the Minister
understands them. To fix the issue beyond doubt, we need to change the
way this country gives benefits in general. That is a bigger debate
than today’s, but we must head more down the contributory route.
That will cause political issues elsewhere across the political
spectrum, but if we stay within EU rules and deal with the potential
problem of migration from Romania and Bulgaria, the basis of
contributory benefits and enlarging that portfolio is one
solution.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042245000127" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000127"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Ward" PimsId="5541" UID="13042245000310" xid="1015" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000310">Mr

that that should not be a matter of concern, that it would not happen
often, and that the checks to find out how many children are living
abroad are expensive so the Government were just going to hand out

everything is going fantastically well and everyone can police
everything adequately so third-country access to the European Union can
be loosened or extended. I know that the Minister is well aware of the
draft EU directive on entry and residence of third-country nationals

Government predictions are constantly wrong and, rather like predicting
the weather, no one can do it properly from day to day. A long-term
prediction of the number of people who might come to this country
without knowing the economic circumstances of where they are coming
from, where they travel through or where they are coming to must be
very difficult, but other organisations do that. The European
Commission presents statistics and we have heard that Migration Watch

right hon. Friend the Member for Mid Sussex (Nicholas Soames) spoke for
many when he referred to the great concern and the need for a more

Peterborough (Mr Jackson) gave a good example of the sheer scale of new
national insurance numbers that are being applied. I represent the
adjacent constituency in the fens, and can attest to the pace and scale
of migration that he highlighted and how that was not mirrored in
census data or the funding formula under the previous or current
Governments to address school funding for those for whom English is a
second language. That backdrop frames our debate today and generates
the concern that has led many to sign the petition.</hs_Para>

recognise that in those renegotiations we need to be cognisant of the
fact that many British people are benefiting from the rules allowing
them to work elsewhere in Europe—even though that is not, in
most cases, in Bulgaria and Romania—and that often, welfare
reform issues are mixed up with immigration issues. Many in the farming
community rely on seasonal workers and say that without them, the rural
economy would suffer seriously. In other areas and in other debates, we
need to address why such businesses are so reliant on labour from
elsewhere in the EU at a time when others are not working. Sometimes we
conflate different issues within the subject matter of the petition

underlying concern behind the petition is one that I very much share,
but I would like to broaden the discussion a little. Today’s
debate has focused very much on low-skilled workers, but the
difficulties with the free movement of labour and the automatic right
to work are not confined to such workers. For example, it was in my
constituency that David Gray was unlawfully killed by Dr Ubani, an
EU-qualified doctor who could not speak English. He gave Mr Gray an
overdose that killed him, and yet, as a doctor, he had the automatic
right to work in the UK without passing any language test. For five
years, we have been told that we can do nothing about that loophole, as
the General Medical Council now calls it, because of EU law. When I
raised the matter after being elected to the House—one of the
first things that I did was campaign on the issue—I was
constantly told that nothing could be done because of EU law, even
though the French managed to have a workable system that generated
language tests.</hs_Para>

highlight that case because I welcome the fact that the Government are
fixing the problem, but also because it illustrates that the issue is
not only confined to low-skilled workers. It is not just low-skilled

issues, for example, with doctors and their ability to speak English,
those should be addressed. 
<?notus-xml column=215?>That case also highlights the risk-averse nature of much of the legal

Barclay:</Member></B> I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. In
terms of veterinary science, I was not aware of that pertinent point.
Of course, all Members welcome people with skills joining the UK
economy and the benefits that they bring, but the specific point is
about the speed with which officials are willing to react to the
regulatory risks that arise—whether from a vet, a doctor or from
others—and their willingness as part of the renegotiation to
take on some of the sacred cows  of EU law and what it is
alleged that treaties require us to do.</hs_Para>

record my thanks to the Minister for the specific action that he is
taking on the pull factors. A tremendous amount of work, on which he is
leading, is being undertaken across Departments, and it is particularly
important. The issue is often discussed through the prism of the
British perspective. In common with my hon. Friend the Member for
Daventry (Chris Heaton-Harris), as a member of the Public Accounts
Committee, I am concerned about the impact that much of that inward
migration has on taxpayers—a burden is placed on the taxpayer,
on our benefits system, or on our NHS, particularly from those who have
not contributed.</hs_Para>

reason why I think the Government’s action on pull factors is so
important is that, often, the most vulnerable people in the community
that I represent have been misled—they have been mis-sold too. A
ruse that operates in an area such as Wisbech involves people being
promised a job and accommodation if they come and work in the farming
community. When they arrive, the gangmasters, who are often illegal,
say, “This week, we only have work for two days, and next week,
we only have work for three days. The week after, we only have one
day.” What modest savings people might have are exhausted very
quickly. The gangmasters will then lend them money, because it is very
difficult for someone who perhaps has borrowed money from family
members to face the embarrassment or even the immediate financial
difficulty of going home. Therefore, these illegal gangmasters get
people into the UK on a false promise, then abuse them by getting them
into debt, and from there, they have control—“You must
buy our counterfeit goods. You must come in the minibus and pay a high
daily fee.”</hs_Para>

scandalous is that many of the most vulnerable people in our community
are affected. They are not voters, nor are they visible, and often,
where they are subject to crime, it is not reported, so the police then
have difficulty, saying “Should we take action and fund 
<?notus-xml column=216?>work on this? It is not reported crime.” I note that the Chair of
the Home Affairs Committee is here, and I hope that he and his
Committee might address the issue of known crime that is not reported
and is affecting many of the most vulnerable, and how resources are
used, because that is a tension in
itself.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042245000144" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000144">The
pull factors are bringing people here who are then being abused. The
debate is focused through a British prism—travelling to Bulgaria
and Romania and telling people that they should not come here because
they will not be eligible for some of the benefits that they think they
might be is very much about defending the taxpayer. It is right and
proper that we do that, but I put the case that such intervention is
often in the interests of those who might be persuaded to come here,
because they are misled into doing so and then are subject to the
illegal gangmasters who abuse the process.</hs_Para>

welcome tighter action and controls within the scope of the
law—I commend the Minister’s work on the pull
factors—the main thrust of my remarks relates to those who are
here. In a sense, that may be slightly counter-intuitive, because the
Bulgarians and Romanians are not yet here, but we know that they will
be. If one looks at what has happened so far, there has been a failure
across agencies to take action on the abuses to which people are
subject once they are here.</hs_Para>

reason, I have been working closely, as the Minister will be aware,
with the Home Secretary and Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs on
the multi-agency task force that we have now set up in the fens. The
issues apply not only to Wisbech, which I represent, but to Boston and
Peterborough, where my hon. Friend the Member for Peterborough faces
such problems, and to Spalding, King’s Lynn and other places
across the fens. The issues are so often seen as urban, as city issues,
when the concentration in certain rural communities is out of scale and
out of proportion with the communities that are absorbing them. The
work of the multi-agency task force is extremely important. It is at an
early stage—I ask the Minister to meet me in a couple of months
for us to review progress—but I would like to draw three
specific points to his attention and that of
Chamber.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042245000147" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000147">The
first relates to houses in multiple occupation. The automatic
registering of HMOs only applies if there are three storeys. That may
be an issue in London, but in the fens, most of the accommodation is
not on three storeys. In one example, 22 people were living in a
bungalow. The census just does not reflect that, and that then feeds
into many of the issues about antisocial behaviour, because if lots of
people are living in one house, where do they go? They tend to go and
have a drink on the street. That upsets neighbours. It creates problems
such as that of urinating in public places. It just is intimidating to
many people to see gangs of people, even if they are acting
lawfully.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042245000148" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000148">In
my view, there has been a failure by agencies to take on the issue of
houses in multiple occupation. There has been a licence system more
recently in Peterborough. We do not still have one in fenland; I
believe that we should. This is not just an issue for London and other
cities; it is an issue that is acute in North East Cambridgeshire, and
the sums of money involved are not inconsiderable. Some hon. Members
might think that the more people there are in a
house, 
<?notus-xml column=217?>the less the landlord will get, but that is not the case. The going rate
in Wisbech is £50 per person; the more they have in, the more
they
get.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042245000149" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000149">Sometimes
the landlord does not even know what is happening. Sometimes the
landlord has rented the house to a couple of people and is living away
and is not aware that it is being used as an HMO. Some of the letting
agencies are breaking the law, because they are under a duty to conduct
a review every six months, but they do not do so; and again, officials
tend not to act. There is also an abuse in relation to council tax.
There is an abuse in relation to the tax on that revenue that is being
paid. However, Government tend to see this as a rural issue. It is a
bit too far from the desks in Whitehall. There are not too many
national journalists reporting
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042245000150" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000150"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr George Howarth (in the Chair)" InTheChair="True" PimsId="1031" UID="13042245000315" xid="290" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000315">Mr

Barclay:</Member></B> Mr Howarth, you bring me on to the crux of the
point. We already have a concentration of HMOs in Wisbech and the fens.
That situation will only become more acute when Bulgarian and Romanian
people come into those areas. We know that there is already a
concentration within certain communities that are ill equipped to deal
with it. I welcome what the Minister is doing to try to prevent people
from coming in and to persuade, in relation to the pull factors, those
who are coming in with, perhaps, a misguided view. I would love him to
be 100% successful, but we know that despite his best efforts there
will be an inflow of people from those countries and we are still not
taking action on the problem that is here now, so let us get on with
it. Let us attack it now in order to ease the pressure when those from
Bulgaria and Romania come
in.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042245000152" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000152">I
come now to my second point. Many people from Bulgaria and Romania will
come in with vehicles that are registered in their country. Under the
law, they have six months in which they can drive on our roads before
the vehicles have to be registered. The House may not be aware of how
many people were prosecuted last year for not registering their vehicle
after six months. It was zero—not one. The Government seem to be
under the impression—I note this for the Chair of the Home
Affairs Committee—that every single person from eastern Europe
who came in under the previous accession registered their vehicle after
six months and not one of them continued to drive on the roads without
doing that. Surgery cases that frequently come before me suggest that
that might not be the case in my constituency, and logic would suggest
that it is not the case. My point is this. There are constraints on
what we can do under EU law and what we can renegotiate, but in terms
of Bulgarians and Romanians coming into the country, we can at least
show their neighbours, the British people, that the laws have been
applied equally to them, because if my constituents have to MOT,
license and insure their car but they see a rickety vehicle that does
not look roadworthy and that they strongly suspect is not registered
and they see a Government who never take action to prosecute someone
for that, that feeds into the sense of grievance that all are not being
treated equally. That is an issue 
<?notus-xml column=218?>that the Government need to tackle ahead of further migration from
Bulgaria and Romania. It is not a big point, but I make it for
illustrative
purposes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042245000153" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000153"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Hollobone" PimsId="4744" UID="13042245000317" xid="858" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000317">Mr
Hollobone:</Member></B> I congratulate my hon. Friend on raising that
point. I think that actually it is a big point and it is one that I
have raised myself on the Floor of the House. We are potentially
talking about tens of thousands of vehicles on our roads illegally. The
purpose of the rules is to ensure that a vehicle is taxed, insured and
roadworthy so that the driver can be prosecuted for any speeding or
parking offences. All the rest of us have to comply with them. It is
quite clear that tens of thousands of EU nationals are getting away
with
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042245000154" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000154"><B><Member ContinuationText="Stephen Barclay" PimsId="5573" UID="13042245000318" xid="1182" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000318">Stephen
Barclay:</Member></B> I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. I
have raised the point repeatedly with Ministers; I certainly was not
trying to belittle it. The point that I was trying to make was that
where we have legal powers already, to what extent are we using them?
Are we using them to the full? My hon. Friend is right: the estimate
that I saw suggested that there are about 15,000 illegal vehicles
currently on the road. That has implications if they are in an
accident; are they traceable? There is a lost economy issue. Our
garages would be getting business from MOT-ing them. The insurers would
be generating revenue from them. I make the point for illustrative
purposes: it raises a wider point about unfairness within a community,
which is not conducive to
cohesion.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042245000155" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000155"><B><Member ContinuationText="Keith Vaz" PimsId="4426" UID="13042245000319" xid="614" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000319">Keith
Vaz:</Member></B> I have not come across that point before and I am

nationals?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042245000156" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000156"><B><Member ContinuationText="Stephen Barclay" PimsId="5573" UID="13042245000320" xid="1182" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000320">Stephen
Barclay:</Member></B> I thank the right hon. Gentleman for the
opportunity to clarify my remarks. It is a wider point. If someone
brings a vehicle into the United Kingdom from the European Union, they
can drive it for six months without it being licensed in the United
Kingdom, but after six months it has to be licensed. The difficulty is
that the police will say, “We don’t know when the six
months started,” yet in the case of a British driver taking
their car to Spain, where the same law applies, the burden is on them
to prove when the six months started—for example, by showing
their tickets for the ferry when they took it across. Again, there is
no ownership of the issue, it seems. That is why I think that action is
needed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042245000157" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000157">My
third example is one that I have been in discussion with HMRC about,
but again it will apply to Bulgaria and Romania when people from those
countries migrate. I am referring to counterfeit goods. Often within
the migrant community, there is great pressure on those who have come
into the country and are in the low-skilled jobs to take, as part of a
bundled package of services, counterfeit goods. Again, I think that
there has been a tendency in Government to see that as pretty low-level
crime, but it is not; it is quite serious. Often there are health
consequences from the vodka and other products, such as cigarettes,
that are being sold, but also there is a revenue issue. With that in
mind, I very much welcome the multi-agency taskforce that the Minister
and his colleague the Home Secretary have set up.</hs_Para>

I welcome what the Minister and his colleagues are doing in terms of
renegotiation. I think that we need to take all the action that we can,
although I recognise that there are constraints. There is significant
success in his work on the pull factors. I think that there is a
cross-Government desire to grip that issue—that is
clear—but I urge him to look, in relation to those who are
already here, at whether we are using the full range of our legal
powers and to demonstrate that ahead of 2014, so that when we do have
people coming in from Bulgaria and Romania, we are on the front foot
and not simply making existing problems worse by increasing their

feel in some ways that I have been a voice crying in the wilderness
since 2004. I have been the Member of Parliament for Peterborough since
2005 and I have seen the impact of unplanned and unrestricted
migration. Let me say at the outset that I defer to no one in my
admiration of people who come from eastern Europe to make a better life
for themselves and their families. I had the privilege of serving for
eight years in the London borough of Ealing, from 1990 to 1998, which
has the largest Polish population in the UK. Polish people are decent,
hardworking and diligent; I have no problems with people based on their
ethnicity, race, culture or religion, as my hon. Friend the Member for

from eastern European countries, the next iteration of which will be
from Romania and Bulgaria from 1 January next
year.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042245000161" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000161">I
deeply regret the catastrophic decision of the previous Labour
Government to opt out of the moratorium on the free movement directive
from 2004. I can understand in some respects why the decision was
taken—the country at that stage was doing well, albeit fuelled
by a particular credit boom—but more should have been considered
and taken into account, such as the likely impact on not only the
labour market, but welfare and dependency. It pushed young people,
particularly men, who could have had the jobs that were taken by
others, into welfare dependency and unemployment. It was an error of
judgment, and the right hon. Member for Morley and Outwood (Ed Balls),

<?notus-xml column=220?>up on a minor aspect of the contribution of my hon. Friend the Member

residential amenity of neighbourhoods in central Peterborough. Too many
landlords, who should know better—grasping, greedy landlords,
who do not care about those neighbourhoods or the people who have
hitherto lived there—have put too many people into substandard
accommodation, to the extent that Peterborough had to apply for extra
funding to combat what they call “beds in sheds”. Whole
neighbourhoods have changed overnight. We are very fortunate that we
are a tolerant, decent and public-spirited people in Peterborough and
Cambridgeshire; the British National party and other extremists have
not prospered in that time and we have been largely welcoming, but
there is a limit to people’s hospitality, as my hon. Friend the

primary school in the centre of Peterborough is the second largest
primary school in England with between 700 and 800 children. It is
fortunate to be led by Iain Erskine—a fantastic head. More than
90 languages are spoken by the children. In my constituency, 41% of
primary school pupils do not speak English as their first language. In
itself, that is not a problem, but the churn is. Twenty-five per cent.
of primary school pupils are not at the school at the beginning of term

resource allocation, teaching time, educational attainment and standard

people—Bulgarians and Romanians—but because a perfect
storm of demographic and social factors have coincided. Due to the
previous Government’s regional spatial strategy, which has
continued, we have plans for organic growth in housing of 26,000 homes

in his swan song, was the only person who opposed it, with a passionate
speech. Only he would have the chutzpah, the day before the Standards
and Privileges Committee published its report, to oppose a Bill that
was largely supported. I shall not digress, Mr Howarth. The Bill
referred to Bulgaria and Romania and said that that the Government do
not need to gold-plate the free movement directive. There is sufficient
flexibility in respect of Romania and Bulgaria for us to invoke the key
parts of the directive, such as public good, public safety, public
health and the habitual residence test. We could do what Spain has
done, as has been mentioned, and have a registration regime when
someone arrives, when they get married, and when they change address or

Home Office officials advising the Minister have looked sufficiently
robustly at what we need to do to reassure our constituents that what

Aldeburgh or Chichester.” We are in government to take
decisions. Our Ministers are in government to work for the good of the
people who elected all of us, and part of that means using the
machinery of government to give people facts and data with which to
make decisions. I will not name the Government aide concerned, but I
was very patronisingly told last week by a Parliamentary Private

fantastic job in keeping the lid on what could have been a very

His last sentence, however, slightly antagonised me, because although
he commended the staff working in the local services in Peterborough
who, he said, did not foresee the deluge that was coming, I think that
quite a lot of the people who came ended up working in those same
public services. It is not, therefore, quite a dichotomy between them
and lots of people from outside the UK who have ended up doing nothing
for this country because, in many cases, those are the people who have

thing that I think everyone who has spoken thus far has said—and
I am sure the Minister will do the same—is that migration and
migrants have brought a great deal to this country, economically and
culturally, and not just in the generations that we have been part of
but in many before. The Rhondda would certainly not be the constituency
it is today, with rugby players with 
<?notus-xml column=223?>surnames such as Sidoli, if it were not for migration from Italy in the
19th century when people came to work in the mines. We actually allowed
an awful lot of people to come from England too, which was a moral

our
country.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042245000178" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000178"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Stewart Jackson" PimsId="4789" UID="13042245000327" xid="873" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000327">Mr

because someone is concerned about the levels of or the pace of
migration, does not make them a racist. There might be some people who
want to engage in the debate who have prejudiced views, but the vast
majority of ordinary decent people in this country who have expressed
concern do so from a position of no prejudice at all but simply because
they are worried about the society in which they live. Let us face it,
because of the now different travelling opportunities around the world,
many countries have had to face a complete change. Italy was always a
country that sent people abroad, and now it has had Bulgarians and
Romanians coming in in significant numbers. Greece is exactly the same.
It invented the word diaspora for all the Greeks who had gone all
around the world, but in the past 10 years it has been a country of
immigration, not emigration, completely changing the concept of what it
is to be
Greek.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042245000182" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000182">I
used to be a curate in High Wycombe, and there was a very large
community of Poles there, who had arrived during and after the second
world war and had become an integral part of the community. Similarly,
there are more people from St Vincent living in High Wycombe that there
are in St Vincent itself. They were deliberately brought to the United
Kingdom after the second world war because we did not have enough
people to make the chairs and keep the economy growing in such places.
I believe, therefore, that a hermetically sealed country would be a
mistake, leaving aside the fact that many British people have always
wanted to go elsewhere in the world to make their fortunes. One thing
that extending the European Union should have done is give British
business and British individuals a greater opportunity to make their
way in the world, in other countries, and many of them have done so in
Spain, France and Italy, and also in Bulgaria and Romania. I hope that
British industry will seize the opportunity of Bulgaria and Romania as
a means of making money and advancing British
business.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042245000183" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000183">I

thing I would say to him is that he could have made the point in 2004
if he had really believed that the Government had completely and
utterly got their figures on migration from eastern bloc countries
wrong. He could have tabled 
<?notus-xml column=224?>an amendment to the Act that implemented the treaty to say that there
should be further transitional controls. He could have made a speech
about it. He could have argued that Bulgaria and Romania should not be

have put in place the transitional controls for the maximum period that
was allowed under the treaty when the A8 countries joined the European
Union. As probably one of the most ludicrously pro-European Members of
the House, I would say that we were not pro-European enough. The irony
was that while France, Germany, Italy and Spain were saying,
“Polish people, Estonians and Latvians, you can come here to
live but not to work until seven years are over,” we decided to
go it alone, and that made the problem infinitely worse because there

important that we consider what drives where an EU migrant might go,

migrant, such as one from Bulgaria or Romania, goes to are, first, the
law—whether they are allowed to migrate there—which
explains the situation we have at the moment. Secondly, there are
personal connections. If a person already knows somebody in a country,

However, it is also true that one reason many Bulgarians and Romanians

Interestingly, a couple of Members have referred to the
“Newsnight” report coming out today and the different
ways it has been reported. We could read the figures in many different
ways, as hon. Members have, but one figure was quite interesting. When
asked whether the benefits system would make a difference to the
country they went to, 72% answered, “Not at all”, 8% said
it would to a small extent, 5% said it would to a great extent and 3%
said it would to a very great extent. We therefore need to be cautious
about stating that the benefits system drives whether somebody comes to
the United Kingdom, although, as several hon. Members have said, there
is a significant difficulty with family benefits provided on a
non-contributory basis. Those are tightly regulated by the EU, which is
very keen to enforce its directives and case law. That is something we
need to look at.</hs_Para>

Bryant:</Member></B> We tend to like opinion polls when we agree with
them; if they do not quite agree with us, we dismiss them or we try to
reread them in a different way that concurs with our opinion.
Sometimes, of course, people ask questions in opinion polls in such a
way as to get the answer they want. I am pretty certain the Government
have done significant research on this issue. The Foreign Office has
already admitted as much in response to a freedom of information
request from me, although it said that it is not yet prepared to
publish 
<?notus-xml column=226?>that research. The only reason it is not prepared to give it to me under
freedom of information provisions is that it will publish it in the
future. That is a somewhat bizarre way of proceeding. Different
Ministers have articulated their views about this, but it is a shame
that we are not all being treated as the adults we are and that we
cannot, therefore, see this material, as Ministers can.</hs_Para>

unscrupulous employers, we know there are employers who will bring
people from countries where labour is cheap, take exorbitant amounts
from their wages for substandard accommodation and
transport—their daily transport in the UK or their transport
from another place in the EU—and still not even pay them the
national minimum wage. Those workers are financially bound to their
employers and feel they cannot complain, which is one of the problems
we have with enforcing the national minimum wage. If there is one issue
we could tackle that would most dramatically affect that situation, it
is accommodation. Nobody should be living in substandard accommodation.
Such a situation leads to the exploitation of workers who come here,
and it unfairly undercuts workers here, who have no choice about how
much their housing costs will be. The hon. Member for North East
Cambridgeshire (Stephen Barclay) was absolutely right that we need to
address the issue of houses in multiple occupation, but I think we
should have a licensing system for all landlords. We should also extend
gangmaster legislation to other areas of employment.</hs_Para>

a national health service for those who have contributed. However, we

congratulate my hon. Friend not only on securing the debate, which was
in response to the petition—I will say a few words about its
specific terms in a moment— but on the moderate and reasonable
tone in which he introduced it, which clearly set a good example,
because that was the way in which all other Members debated the issue.
That is important if we are to have a sensible debate led by mainstream

also, because the e-petition received more than 100,000 signatures.
Once it passed that number it received a written Home Office response,

terms in detail. It contained two requests, and I can give a positive
response to one. One is that</hs_Para>

those requests relates to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member
for The Wrekin about the extent of our ability to do something now
about the ending of transitional controls at the end of the year. I
assure my hon. Friend and the other hon. Members who made the same
point that Ministers test the legal advice that we get from Government
lawyers and outside counsel. I particularly like doing that. I have had
legal advice in the past that I have challenged, and which turned out
to be just that—advice. It is worth testing it, and Ministers do
so. That is consistent throughout the Government from the Prime
Minister downward. My hon. Friend talked about restricting movement on
grounds of public policy, public security or public health, but the
free movement directive says in terms that those grounds shall not be
invoked to serve economic ends. I am not going to go into huge amounts
of detail, or I shall do nothing for the next 15 minutes but discuss
legal matters, but I do not think there is any possibility, under the
directive or the accession treaties for Bulgaria and Romania, of
complying with the request in the petition.</hs_Para>

we can be more positive about the second point in the petition, and my
hon. Friend the Member for The Wrekin and several other hon. Members
have referred to the Prime Minister’s clear commitment, in his
capacity as leader of the Conservative party, to renegotiate, if we win
the next election, the terms on which we are members of the European
Union. As my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr Hollobone) said,
we will put that to the people. Some hon. Members may take different
views on that, but we can all agree that the public will then get a
choice, and will be able  to make a clear decision. We can
deliver on that part of  the
petition.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042245000210" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000210">It
is also worth saying, in relation to the public debate, that the Prime
Minister made it clear in a recent speech that the Government
understand public concern about immigration and are not just willing
but keen to 
<?notus-xml column=228?>encourage sensible debate about it. Those points were made by the Select
Committee Chairman, the right hon. Member for Leicester East (Keith
Vaz), by my right hon. Friend the Member for Mid Sussex (Nicholas
Soames) and by my hon. Friend the Member for Keighley (Kris Hopkins).
The Government do not believe there should be no net migration; we just
think that it should be sustainable. We want to reduce it from the
unsustainable hundreds of thousands to the sustainable tens of
thousands. Various Members have talked about the benefits to be
obtained from some migration, and the Government agree with
them.</hs_Para>

1.4 million British people live in another EU country, either in
retirement or working. We should always remember that, when we are
engaged in this debate. Britain’s future, like its past, is as a
global trading nation, which means that many British people will work
and live abroad. We cannot expect other countries to allow us to do
that if we do not allow movement too. It is right, however, to take
account of public concern about free movement, and to deal with that. I
want to flesh out some of the points that my right hon. Friend the
Prime Minister has
made.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042245000212" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0001.htm#13042245000212">Several
hon. Members addressed the point that actions that the Government took
from the moment they took office have already reduced net migration by
a third since the general election. That is significant. Also, only a
third of the people coming to the United Kingdom are from the EU; 55%
come from outside it and 15% are British citizens returning home, so
the bulk of our net migration is from outside the EU. That is important
to remember in a debate about migration from Bulgaria and Romania, and
the point was well made by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry
(Chris Heaton-Harris), who has extensive European experience.</hs_Para>

lot of debate about Government attempts to forecast how many people
would come here from Bulgaria and Romania when transitional controls
ended. My hon. Friend the Member for Kettering referred to that in his
Westminster Hall debate, and the right hon. Member for Leicester East
asked whether the Government would commission advice. Of course they
did commission advice, and asked the independent Migration Advisory
Committee what we should do—whether it was possible to predict
the scale of future migration. The committee made it clear
that</hs_Para>

possible to come up with accurate figures. The reason is that, unlike
the previous experience, with the A8 countries of eastern Europe, eight
other countries have transitional controls. We are not likely to be
able to predict accurately how many people are likely to leave Bulgaria
and Romania to work overseas, and to which of the countries with
transitional controls they are likely to go.</hs_Para>

previous Westminster Hall debate, secured by my hon. Friend the Member
for Kettering, that the reason the Government did not want to forecast
was that we did not think we could do so accurately, and we wanted to
be straight with people and say so, rather than making up a number. We
could just make up a number, and use it for the rest of this year; but
that would probably be as accurate as what happened under the previous
Government. It would not be treating people as adults. We got clear
advice from the Migration

hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) talked about a mysterious
Foreign Office report, which the Department refused to publish. I think
that he meant the report by the National Institute of Economic and
Social Research, which was commissioned by the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office. That might not have been published when he asked his question,
so perhaps a reference was made to the fact that it was to be
published. Of course it has now been published, and it reached the
conclusion about predicting numbers that I have set out. It was
perfectly sensible for the Government to say what they did; that was
treating people with respect.</hs_Para>

access to benefits and public services. Rather than producing
speculative projections, we have been considering the work being done
across Government—I am pleased to say that all Departments
concerned with delivering public services are involved, along with the
Department for Work and Pensions, which deals with benefits—on
cutting out the abuse of free movement, and addressing the pull
factors. With reference to something that the hon. Member for Rhondda
said, it is worth pointing out that Germany is strongly opposed to
benefit tourism—the abuse of free movement. We have been working
with Germany and, indeed, the Home Secretary—along with her
German, Austrian and Dutch counterparts—recently signed a letter
to the European Commission to ask it urgently to review the current
arrangements on the availability of social security benefits to newly
arrived EU migrants, and stressed the need for more robust legal
measures, such as re-entry bands for individuals removed from the UK
for abusing their free movement
rights.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042245000219" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/halltext/130422h0002.htm#13042245000219">I
mention that because we are not of course alone in sharing such
concerns, and I am therefore quite hopeful about not only what we may
be able to achieve in this Parliament, but the seriousness with which
other European countries will take our views on changing our

me briefly set out some of the work that we are doing. We will tighten

intend to tighten access to social housing to insist that local
authorities have to consider the local rules. I have a little more
confidence than my hon. Friend  the Member for The Wrekin about
their ability to do that. Local authorities where there is an

<?notus-xml column=230?>example, in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for

final area is the national health service. Some Members have made the
point that it is a national, not an international, health service. My
hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mark

could implement that, given doctors’ Hippocratic oath. We do not
of course propose to remove access to emergency treatment or to
treatment required for public health reasons. My right hon. Friend the

the urgent question from the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr

us to take action: three quarters are confused or frustrated about the

half—52%—said that they believe that NHS provision for
migrants is too generous; and only 7% thought that it is not generous
enough. In addition, 38% said that they did not want to agree to
register people they think are illegal immigrants and 40% did not want
to register people who had failed in their asylum claims. Therefore, a

me turn, in my remaining two minutes, to criminality. That was raised
by several colleagues, including my hon. Friend the Member for

tribute. Several things are going on. In London, to which he drew
attention, there is the successful ongoing Operation Nexus between the
Home Office immigration enforcement teams and the Metropolitan police
to target high-harm foreign national offenders and immigration
offenders. It has removed more than 400 such people just since last
November, so it has been very successful, and we intend to roll it out

Baker:</Member></B> As at the end of December 2012, the Plugged in
Places (PIPs) Programme had delivered over 2,800 chargepoints, of which
some 70% were publically accessible. We are currently analysing the end
of financial year returns from the eight PIP schemes and early
assessment is that to the end of March 2013, 4000 chargepoints have
been installed of which approximately 65% are publically accessible and
over 50 are rapid chargers (greater than 43kW). The total spend across
the programme is estimated to be approximately £10.7m. It is
estimated that non-PIP public authorities and private sector
organisations may have installed around 5,000 chargepoints. We will be
reporting more accurate numbers

shows that the net impact of policies is to help households on average
save money on their energy bills, compared to what they would be paying
in the absence of these policies. The total monetary savings from
policies which help households save energy are expected to more than
offset the cost of investing in new capacity and efficiency.</hs_Para>

of policies on energy prices are presented in tables E1-E3 of Annex E
of the report. A number of government policies place the obligation of
financing the policies onto energy companies, which is then passed 
<?notus-xml column=598?>onto the consumer. It is up to individual energy companies to decide how
to share the costs among their customers. The simplifying assumption
used for DECC's analysis is that costs are spread evenly over each unit
of energy consumption that creates a liability for these costs for
energy suppliers.</hs_Para>

assumes that the total support costs of the renewables obligation,
small-scale feed-in tariffs and electricity market reform, and the
total costs of the EU ETS and carbon price floor are paid around
one-third by households and two-thirds by non-domestic
consumers—reflecting their respective shares of total
electricity consumption. The support costs of the energy company
obligation and warm home discount and the supplier costs of smart
meters and better billing are assumed to only be paid by household
energy consumes—reflecting that these policies are focused on
helping households improve their energy efficiency. The costs of the
climate change levy and the CRC energy efficiency scheme are only paid
by the relevant non-domestic consumers captured by the eligibility
criteria for these policies.</hs_Para>

this year, beaches applying for Blue Flag will be expected to have
water quality equivalent to the new ‘excellent’
classification under Directive 2006/7/EC (bathing waters). This is
approximately twice as stringent as the standard, which was required
last year. In the 2012 bathing season 50% of England's bathing waters
achieved the 'excellent' standard. The Government's aim is for all
bathing waters to achieve the directive's new minimum standard, which
itself is approximately twice as stringent as the old minimum standard.
This will ensure that resources are focused on ensuring the maximum
number of bathers benefit from improved health protection by the 2015

Forces Day is a day when we invite the whole nation to show support for
our military community both serving and retired, at home and abroad.
Each year the Chief of Defence Staff writes to each city and town
council across the country requesting that they show their support to
Armed Forces Day by flying the Armed Forces Day flag from the Monday
preceding Armed Forces Day. This year the ‘Fly the Flag’
date will be Monday 24 June 2013. It is left to the discretion of each
city or town council to decide if they wish to participate.</hs_Para>

Francois:</Member></B> I have no plans to do so. The service justice
system, of which the summary hearing system is one component part, is
subject to regular review, and I am satisfied that it appropriately
reflects the unique role and operating environments of the armed
forces. The summary hearing system provides a mechanism for dealing
both with minor criminal offences and minor examples of the
disciplinary offences which are specific to the armed forces and calls
to account those who are found, after a proper investigation, to have
fallen short of the high standards of behaviour we expect from service
personnel.</hs_Para>

are charged with an offence which is to be dealt with by a commanding
officer in a summary hearing have the right to choose trial by court
martial instead, with the court applying the same limited powers as a
commanding officer. Furthermore, those who are found guilty of an
offence in a summary hearing can appeal to the summary appeal court
against both the conviction and punishment, with the appeal taking the
form of a rehearing.</hs_Para>

an issue for occupants. The treatment of deep-rooted damp problems is

the armed forces are exempt from the provisions of the 1998 National
Minimum Wage (NMW) Act. Nevertheless, we aim to ensure that the armed
forces are in line with NMW provisions. As part of their work, the
independent Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB) makes a broad
assessment each year of whether there may be personnel earning below
NMW rates. In their most recent report, a copy of which is in the
Library of the House, the AFPRB noted that service personnel on average
worked 44.5 hours per week which, when applied to the basic pay of
junior ranks on the lowest level of pay, equated to an hourly rate of
£7.55, higher than the then NMW hourly rate of
£6.08.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042252000214" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/text/130422w0002.htm#13042252000214">Given
the hours that personnel have to work on operations, a similar
calculation could produce an hourly rate which is below the NMW for

Francois:</Member></B> The Sandhurst Foundation is a non-publicly
funded, registered charity, located at the Royal Military Academy,
Sandhurst. When departmental assets such as rooms and facilities are
hired out to third parties, the Ministry of Defence (MOD) is obliged
under Treasury repayment rules to recover an appropriate and consistent
level of cost, so that the taxpayer is not left out of pocket. This
will include insurance cover. Where services such as catering are
provided by a single contractor, they might also charge for service
provision that is over and above that provided under contract to the
MOD. Any further charging that the Sandhurst Foundation might wish to
apply is a matter for the
foundation.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13042252000029" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/text/130422w0002.htm#13042252000029">Staff</hs_8Question><Question><hs_Para UID="13042252000529" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/text/130422w0002.htm#13042252000529"><B><Member PimsId="5618" UID="13042252000925" xid="1153" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/text/130422w0002.htm#13042252000925">Priti

considering cases of intimidation or injury on a case by case basis.

Lidington:</Member></B> The right of the sovereign base areas to a
territorial sea is clear in the treaty of establishment—an
entitlement which the Republic of Cyprus has acknowledged. No other
state has the legitimate right to declare an exclusive economic zone
within the UK's territorial sea, nor has the Republic of Cyprus
indicated a wish to exploit any mineral resources within the
territorial sea of the sovereign base areas. The declaration made by
the Government in 1960 makes clear the UK's intention not to develop
the sovereign base areas for other than military purposes. The treaty
of establishment and associated maps and schedules are available for
consultation in the Library.</hs_Para>

Simmonds:</Member></B> The FCO works closely with UK companies,
particularly in the diamond, gold and jewellery sectors, to encourage
trade in conflict-free minerals. The FCO has contributed to the
development of guidance by the OECD for companies with gold, tin,
tantalum and tungsten supply chains (minerals that are used in mobile
phones) and by the World Gold Council, in order to provide UK companies
with the necessary tools to undertake effective due diligence checks on
their supply chains to ensure that the minerals and gold they purchase
does not fund conflict. The FCO encourages companies sourcing gold and
minerals from the Great Lakes Region of Africa to undertake such due
diligence. We also support the work done by the London Bullion Market
Association to create responsible gold supply chains. The FCO is also
working with the European Commission to ensure that the EU plays a more
active role in encouraging companies to implement the OECD
guidance.</hs_Para>

restrictions on movement and access in the West Bank and Gaza are the
single biggest obstacle to trade and economic development, and hence
one of the most important causes of the current financial difficulties
of the Palestinian Authority. This is in line with the assessment of
the World Bank's Economic Monitoring Report to the Ad Hoc Liaison
Committee (AHLC) on 19 March 2013. An easing of these restrictions is
vital for the Palestinian economy to flourish. As the International
Monetary Fund's report to the AHLC noted, the failure to make more
progress in reducing restrictions has led to a rise in unemployment (up
to 22.9% in the last quarter of 2012 from 21.0% during the same period
in 2011), a decline in public services and the halving of growth in the
West Bank and Gaza (from 12.2% in 2011 to 6.0% in 2012). Exports of

Torture (CAT). However, allegations of torture continue to be heard, in
particular from political activists accused of terrorist offences. We
judge the allegations, by virtue of their frequency and the variety of
sources, to be credible and it would
appear that the Saudi Arabian authorities attach some credence to the
allegations, because the Public Prosecution Office (part
of the Ministry of Interior) has been ordered to monitor and
inspect prisons. Officials are currently negotiating a Memorandum of
Understanding for cooperation in the Justice Sector. We are pressing
for a provision to work together to implement the
requirements of international obligations, in particular the
implementation of human rights conventions. This would include pressing
Saudi Arabia to ratify the CAT Optional Protocol, thus requiring the
establishment of National Preventive Mechanism and further practical
steps to eradicate
torture.</hs_Para><Question><hs_Para UID="13042252000740" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/text/130422w0003.htm#13042252000740"><B><Member PimsId="3629" UID="13042252001009" xid="7" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/text/130422w0003.htm#13042252001009">Mr

Gauke:</Member></B> Around 293,000 appeals made against the 2010 rating
list were resolved by the end of December 2012. While appeals continue
to be received, the number of outstanding 2010 rating appeals fell by
21% between 2011-12 Quarter 3 and 2012-13 Quarter 3. The VOA has
prioritised the clearance of appeals by improving efficiency, diverting
resources from other work areas, and recruiting additional frontline
staff.</hs_Para>

the current school funding system is unfair and out-of-date. Our aim is
to move towards a fairer and more transparent funding system and the
Secretary of State for Education, the right hon. Member for Surrey
Heath (Michael Gove) announced in March 2012 that we plan to introduce
a new national funding formula in the next spending review period. It

Building Programme (PSBP), the DFE invited responses from schools
wishing to apply for funding. Those applications were assessed
objectively as described in the letter which invited applications for
the programme. Applications had to be supported by a building condition
survey and qualified surveyors visited every school to validate the
accuracy of the data submitted. The prioritisation process compared the
cost of addressing the current condition of the school with the
rebuilding cost.</hs_Para>

condition need of some of the schools within the PSBP is so severe the
Secretary of State decided urgent action was necessary. We have
therefore made a limited amount of capital grant available to address
the needs of the highest priority schools in the programme. 42
schools—those in the very worst condition and all 
<?notus-xml column=690?>special schools included within the programme—were prioritised to
be delivered through capital grant. It is right that the condition
needs of special schools—where some of our most vulnerable

managers to ensure Jobcentre Plus staff provide claimants with the best
possible service, including accurate information, advice and guidance
tailored to individual need. Underpinning this is the Department's
Accuracy of Information framework and a range of operational products
to equip staff to provide claimants with relevant and accurate

McVey:</Member></B> The personal independence payment assessment will
not be a medical assessment—diagnosing a condition or its
severity and recommending treatment options. Instead it will look at
the impact of conditions and impairments on individuals' everyday
lives. This requires a very different skill set from those involved in
the treatment of individuals, with less need for specialist knowledge.
It is therefore not our intention to make assessors experts in every
condition, but that they will have a broad training in disability
analysis as well as training on specific impairments, including mental,
intellectual and cognitive
impairments.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304237000404" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130422/text/130422w0006.htm#1304237000404">Both

is provisional until finalised at the end of the year, when it is
checked against their final income for the year. The information
provided in the answer shows the number of awards, analysed by whether
payments for and issued in each year were lower or higher than the
finalised entitlement. Where payments are higher than the finalised
entitlement they are described as overpaid at 5 April of that year.
This is known only after awards are finalised. Overpaid tax credits are
recovered either through direct recovery, in the case of terminated or
ceased awards, or reduction of an ongoing
award.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>3. The figures provided in the
answer relate to the number of overpaid awards and not the number of
people. When a couple splits up or a single adult becomes part of a
couple the previous award ceases and either or both adults can choose
to apply for new awards. If an adult had more than one overpaid award
during the year they would therefore be represented more than once in
these data.</hs_TableFooter>

effect from 3 October 2011 when their functions were returned to the
core Department. With the exception of Health and Safety Executive, the
Department's non-departmental public bodies do not collect statistics
on how many days of work were carried out by officials. Total salary
