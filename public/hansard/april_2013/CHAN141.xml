Department for Education’s vision, which is shared on both sides
of the House, is for a highly educated society in which opportunity is
more equal for children and young people, no matter what their
background or family circumstances. I am presenting a Bill to take
forward that vision, and part of that is about a society that values
self-help, self-responsibility, democracy, equality, equity and
solidarity. These are the values of the co-operative movement and the
Co-operative party, which I am proud to represent in Parliament, and of

everyone—teachers, parents, pupils and the local
community—work together for their mutual benefit. Performance
improves, pupils learn and are more engaged in the life of the school,
and the best possible environment for young people to learn and develop
is created. Everyone is encouraged to take responsibility for
themselves, while the local community has a say in how the school is
run. With a commitment to equality and equity, everyone is helped to be

is no sign, however, that this has been attempted. Academies have
become the centrepiece of education policy. Nor has the free schools
policy led to a new generation of parent-owned co-operatives. To date,
just one of the free schools is expected to operate as a co-operative.
Much is said about choice in education, but if this is to become a
reality, we need to allow co-operative school trusts to flourish and
remove the hurdles that make that difficult.</hs_Para>

the legal forms of co-operatives are determined as industrial and
provident societies, or co-operative or community benefit societies,
and there is no provision in the relevant Acts for co-operative
schools. They have to work around the existing legislation in a clumsy
and confusing way. Clause 1 of my very short Bill would therefore seek
to amend Education Acts to include those legal forms and so ensure a
level playing field with other school
structures.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041737000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0001.htm#13041737000021">Despite
the legal difficulties, in just five years, co-operative schools have
become the third-largest grouping within the English education system,
with currently more than 450 operating. Thirty have become co-operative
converter academies, a few are co-operative sponsor academies and we
have seen the creation of the first co-operative multi-academy trust.
Those that have led the process are confident that growth will
continue. So far, numbers have doubled every year, and with many more
schools adopting this model, we can expect more than 1,000
schools to be using co-operative models by the time of the next general
election.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041737000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0001.htm#13041737000022">The
Co-operative college provides an effective support system, and the
Schools Co-operative Society has been established as the national
network of co-operative schools in England. Through the extensive
network they have built, co-operative schools have access to mutual and
targeted support to achieve the highest standards. They have developed
a distinct model that enables schools to embed co-operative values into
the ethos of the school. This also includes ethical values in keeping
with those of the founders of the co-operative
movement—openness, honesty, social responsibility and caring for
others.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041737000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0001.htm#13041737000023">In
Cornwall, a group of schools have joined together to protect their
sense of community. The head teachers from Sir James Smith’s
school, Helston community college and Upton Cross primary school have
all spoken about the importance of solidarity and letting local people
work towards a shared vision and mutual solutions in education. The
newly formed Multi-Academy Trust in Barnsley works with three other
schools and, through the establishment of the Pioneer Academies
Co-operative Trust, has ensured that the community is at the heart of
all it does. Lipson community college in Plymouth was an early
co-operative trust school and is now a co-operative academy. Its
arrangements for involving parents—Parent Voice—was
recognised as outstanding in an Ofsted survey on parental and community
engagement. Student Voice at da Vinci college in Derby gives pupils a
real role in school decisions, allowing them to sit in on interview
panels and join the staff on training
sessions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041737000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0001.htm#13041737000024">As
the Secretary of State for Education has recognised, when extending the
academies programme to primary schools, it is vital that children get
the best foundation at primary level to realise their potential at
secondary level. I agree, and I think we also need to get it right at
nursery level. Many co-operative networks and co-operative trusts are
based on strong geographical clusters. They wish to raise achievement
by supporting young people from nursery to school-leaving age, yet the
Education and Inspections Act 2006 prevents nurseries from setting up
as school trusts. Nursery schools are in many ways the most naturally
co-operative part of the education sector, with their engagement with
parents and carers. Enabling nursery schools to become full members of
trusts would strengthen that engagement in early years 
<?notus-xml column=331?>and help to develop the nursery-to-secondary vision of education that
best enables young people to realise their potential. Consequently,
clause 2 of my Bill would remove the relevant provisions in the 2006
Act and would enable nursery schools to be established as school
trusts.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041737000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0001.htm#13041737000025">I
believe that co-operative schools are well placed not only to ensure
high standards of education, but to teach children that the values of
co-operation have a great deal to offer. Pooling resources across
schools is something to be welcomed at a time of austerity, but doing
so at any time ensures a productive, collaborative approach and the
most effective use of resources. For young people, the experience of
supporting each other in school, along with seeing the support that the
community and other co-operatives give, helps to shape character and
inculcate a positive approach towards others. There is evidence that
young people brought up in that environment continue to contribute to
their communities long after they have left school. In the words of Pat
McGovern, head teacher at Helston community
college,</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13041737000812" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0001.htm#13041737000812">“The

it would remiss of any hon. Member not to recognise the volatility

has been developing our plans for house building and housing supply in
a number of different ways, and I will touch on those, if I may, after
having looked at the Government’s approach: the Help to Buy
scheme, which consists of two parts, the first being an equity loan
element. The Government have said that they want to extend what was
known as the First Buy scheme—there are so many names that it is
sometimes difficult to keep track—whereby people would purchase
new build homes up to a value of £600,000 and could borrow 20%
of the value of the property interest free for five years in return for
the Government taking a stake in the equity. The fee for that would
increase annually, but only in line with inflation, so the Government
are essentially committing, they say, up to £3.5 billion over
the next three years to this shared equity loan
scheme.</hs_Para>

Government say that they want to target 74,000 more home buyers. The
scheme has been available from the beginning of this month and we will
see how it operates. It is still early days, but as far as I can see it
has resulted in no massive change in the mortgage market in the past
week or so. It is intriguing that the previous help was available only
to first-time buyers with family incomes below £60,000. Now, the
Government are saying that they want to make help available to all
buyers of newly built homes on all incomes at that level. That is an
intriguing change in Government policy. It is as though the First Buy
scheme did not have enough to underpin it so, in a desperate move to
try to reflate it, they have broadened it out. We will see how that
goes.</hs_Para>

home ownership or that we are always against the notion of second home
ownership, given that many of us have two residences, one near
Westminster and one in our constituency. Notwithstanding the unusual
circumstances of Members of Parliament, it is important that public

those without a home to acquire one and on ensuring that we minimise
the diversion of taxpayer funds into an unintended subsidy for second

have to put direct support into housing supply. These rather opaque and
indirect attempts to manipulate the public accounts with complicated
and convoluted guarantees and underwriting arrangements do not
communicate to the wider public who might be consumers 
<?notus-xml column=338?>of housing—looking to buy their first home or to rent
differently. The Government must be far more direct about this

is clear that the Government’s ideological aversion to
supporting the construction of affordable housing still inhibits
recovery of the broader housing market. That is why housing starts fell
11% over the last year to 98,000 and why the number of private and
local authority home starts was down, and the number of housing
association home starts, at just over 19,000, was the lowest for eight
years. There are 136,000 fewer home owners than when the Government
came to power, and of course the youngest are hardest hit. Apparently,
the average age of a first-time buyer is now
37.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041737000078" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0001.htm#13041737000078">We

work. Have the Government thought it through sufficiently? There are
plenty of organisations focusing on housing policy. The first-time

absolutely true. However, there is a point about whether help should no
longer be targeted at lower and middle-income families, with the cap of
£60,000, and used to support first-time buyers. We need from

taxpayer, subsidising an element of activity that really should not be
a priority for the taxpayer at this moment. If people want to take
equity out of their property or remortgage, they may do so using
traditional solutions provided in the market at large; we have nothing
against home owners remortgaging in the traditional way. But the scheme
seeks to extend taxpayer guarantees unnecessarily. Effectively,
Ministers are saying that if people have a spare room in a social home,
they must pay the bedroom tax, but if they want a spare home and can
afford it, the Government will help them to buy one. No wonder people

My hon. Friends will remember that the Chief Secretary to the Treasury
astonished the House when he still could not rule out that the scheme

number of reasons for that. For example, if the scheme is supporting
remortgages, and a household decides to remortgage, how can the
Government have a covenant on how any equity withdrawn from that
remortgage process will be used by that home purchaser? That is
presumably the obstacle that Ministers are banging their heads against

Further to the intervention from my right hon. Friend the Member for

Minister could get a message from the civil servants to help him on
that. I understood that although the Help to Buy scheme applied only to

relating to property values of £2 million was a
well-worked-through basis on which we could build and develop a policy.
We even tabled a suggestion that the OBR should have some options for
how this mansion tax would work in detail. There are bound to be issues
on the margins that need to be resolved, and I accept we should
definitely be talking about those, but the principle could be
established. The Bill has 50 or 60 clauses relating to what are known
as enveloped dwellings. The Government do not dare call it a mansion
tax because Conservatives do not like it, but they have introduced a
scheme to enforce a certain number of stamp duty requirements where an
annual charge can be placed on properties worth more than £2
million, but only if they are owned by a company in a corporate tax
wrapper. It is therefore entirely feasible and plausible to consider
whether that scheme could be extended into a mansion tax proper, and
the Government have well-worked-through plans on the books, on which
they have been consulting, which could be the basis for a mansion tax.

referring to the Opposition motion on this issue that we debated five
or so weeks ago. The Government amendment to that motion made it
crystal clear that, in the context of the coalition, my Conservative
Front-Bench colleagues do not support the introduction of a mansion tax
in this Parliament; indeed, it is not in the coalition agreement
because we could not agree on it at that point. However, the Liberal
Democrat part of the coalition does believe that a mansion tax should
be introduced. We are happy to do the workings on it and happy to
espouse it at every opportunity. It will be in our manifesto at the
next general election, and subject to what happens in that election,
when I am sure that negotiations may well take place again, perhaps we
will have a different outcome. I welcome the fact that the Labour
party, which emphatically rejected the principle of a mansion tax in
the negotiations in 2010, now seems to be on the way towards conversion
to the long-term Liberal Democrat train of thought on this
issue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041737000142" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0001.htm#13041737000142">I

conversion between now and 2015. Some of them—in fact, a lot of

policy. That applies particularly to Conservative MPs from the north of
England—north of the line from the Severn to the Wash. Perhaps
there are not very many £2 million properties in those

finally, after three years, they have suggested a new policy, albeit
one pinched from my party, but they are still asking the Treasury to do

coalition Government came to office they had to make some quick
decisions about what was essentially an economic emergency. We were
left with a situation in which the last Government were borrowing
£1 for every £4 that they were spending. We simply could
not go on in that way, so we had to put forward an emergency Budget to
gain the confidence of the markets so that people would continue to
lend us enough money, on the triple A rating that we had at the time,
to keep all Government programmes going. It has been acknowledged by
the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and, I think, by the Deputy Prime
Minister that some of the cuts in capital expenditure that the
coalition implemented in its first two years in office perhaps should
not have been made, in hindsight. But those cuts in the capital
programme were in the last Budget of the last Government and were seen
through by this Government. The Government have had the wisdom to say
that investment in capital expenditure is a good way of getting growth
going in the economy, and that is why we have had the wealth of
initiatives that the shadow Minister mentioned earlier, and that is why
we have had the new package of proposals to help the
housing market.</hs_Para>

Williams:</Member></B> The mansion tax, as the name suggests, is a tax
on mansions. If a farmhouse on agricultural land was of mansion
proportions and, whether it was in Carmarthen or elsewhere, was valued
at more than £2 million, it would fall within the scope of a
mansion tax, but the agricultural land itself—whether it is in
the curtilage of the house or in the wider area of the
farm—would not fall within the remit of a mansion tax. However,
my party is currently reviewing all its tax policies, including the
taxation of land. I do not want to be diverted too far down this route,
although it is an issue on which my party has campaigned since the days
of Lloyd George, who, as I am sure hon. Members will agree, was
probably the most significant Prime Minister of the 20th century. I
will say no more on that on this particular
day.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041737000159" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0001.htm#13041737000159">I
will do my best to help the Labour party with some of the other details
of how the Liberal Democrats think that the mansion tax should work. A
criticism that is made of the mansion tax is what happens if a
pensioner or someone on a low income is living in a house valued at
more than £2 million—the so-called asset rich, but income
poor. Our answer is straightforward. Someone in those circumstances
would defer payment of the tax until the property was sold or their
income rose to a level at which they were able to pay it. The most
likely scenario is that when the property was sold, the deferred,
rolled-up tax liabilities would crystallise and be met out of the
proceeds of sale. That is the answer to the asset rich, income poor
conundrum.</hs_Para>

principle, which might help the Labour party, is that we see the
mansion tax as a national tax. There is a debate to be had about what
we do with our only existing property tax—the council
tax—such as introducing higher bands, but that is a debate for
another day. In any event, the council tax is a local tax and we are
clear that the mansion tax, as the Liberal Democrats propose it, should
be a national tax and form part of the rebalancing of the tax system
away from taxes on work and enterprise and on to income from wealth
speculation and
pollution.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041737000161" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0001.htm#13041737000161">Our

variant of the question asked by the hon. Member for Carmarthen East

is a residential property tax: a tax on the building that the
landowner—the farmer, the rich individual or
whoever—lives in. It would not include barns, pigsties and the
other agricultural buildings to which he referred, even if they have a
high value. This would simply be a tax on residential property occupied
by a person, not farm animals or anyone else: only the farmhouse
itself, or the estate house, would fall into the ambit of a mansion
tax.</hs_Para>

fund a reduction of the rate of income tax from 22% to 20%. However,
the coalition Government have made the principle of the 10p rate of
income tax completely redundant, because we have introduced not a 10p
rate on people with very low incomes, but a zero rate. I am sure that

We do not need anybody else to do a study for us—whether the

a great shame that after three years in opposition, at the first
opportunity that Labour has taken to say, just tentatively, what it is

the workings of the support given to the housing market, which new
clause 1 would provide, is necessary to ensure that there are no
abuses, but perhaps also to make it clear to all sides that the support
being provided is not necessarily for affordable homes, but for the
building sector—although it would be better if it was primarily
for affordable homes. I think it would be quite useful to have a report

that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041737000190" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0001.htm#13041737000190">On
new clause 5, I was initially intending to ask the hon. Member for
Nottingham East (Chris Leslie) to provide a little more detail, in the
way that the hon. Member for Bristol West did. There are a number of
reasons for that, but mainly it is because it might direct the Treasury
towards where it might want to look. If, 
<?notus-xml column=354?>for example, the mansion tax were to be based on council tax banding,
then, as we saw in Cardiff where a re-banding took place, it was not
necessarily the wealthiest who ended up paying more; 64% of households
ended up paying more, which was not a very good outcome. Secondly, if
it is paid on the basis of stamp duty land tax, as currently
configured, the Exchequer yield would be received only on the sale of
the property. Quite clearly, it would not capture all the excess wealth
from every property valued at over £2 million. If the mansion
tax is to be a new tax, duty or levy, it would have been useful to have
it explained.</hs_Para>

well be a perfectly sensible case to make for a mansion tax, and I
thought that that was what the hon. Member for Bristol West was trying
to do at the beginning of his speech. As he went on, however, things
became rather more confused. I paraphrase, but I think quite
accurately, that the hon. Gentleman said that the mansion tax would
apply only to a mansion or big house where a person or people lived. If
this mansion or big house has one or two rooms that are put out to let,
but perhaps not advertised particularly well, it could become a bed and
breakfast or a hotel—no longer necessarily remaining a
residential property where a person
lives.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041737000192" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0001.htm#13041737000192">A
number of interventions and discussions took place about farm houses or
estates that might breach the threshold. Again, a house where people
lived seemed to be the criterion, but one could easily imagine an
associated outbuilding converted to house a few chickens, which could
change the building from being a residential property. It was
interesting to hear that. The hon. Member for Bristol West also
referred to the building being the key, even within the curtilage of
land on which crops were grown. If an ornamental garden with fruit
trees that could be harvested lies inside the curtilage of land but the
property is worth £3 million or £4 million, it
could, according to the hon. Gentleman, be
exempt.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041737000193" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0001.htm#13041737000193"><B><Member ContinuationText="Stephen Williams" PimsId="4842" UID="13041737000941" xid="813" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0001.htm#13041737000941">Stephen

Wilson</B> (East Antrim) (DUP):</Member> One of the common themes that
has emerged on the Opposition Benches throughout the debates on the
Budget is that the Government can and should do something to stimulate
the economy by means of additional capital spending. One way of doing
that—and one way of rapidly stimulating the construction
industry—is to build houses; and, of course, many other social
benefits arise from house
building.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041737000199" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0001.htm#13041737000199">The
Government have chosen a particular path towards the stimulation of
house building, and I am not sure whether they have chosen it simply in
order to avoid the registration of additional borrowing as part of
Government debt. The means by which they have decided to stimulate the
housing market—this is significant, because it is stated in the
Red Book—will have no implications for central Government public
sector net borrowing; it will have an impact only on the central
Government net cash requirement. It seems that the Government may be
engaging in the contortions described by the hon. Member for Nottingham
East (Chris Leslie) in order to avoid certain Treasury accounting
arrangements, rather than considering what policy will prove
effective.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041737000200" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0001.htm#13041737000200">That
is the first thing that we should consider. The second was alluded to
by the hon. Member for Dundee East (Stewart Hosie). If the sole
intention is to stimulate the housing market and the construction
industry and it does not really matter who buys the houses or benefits
from the policies, the Government ought to make that clear. Such a move
would have various side effects, perhaps benefiting people who, in the
opinion of many Members, do not need help with housing. If the policy
is to provide a general stimulus across the board which is not relevant
to the size of people’s incomes, to whether they are first-time
or second-time buyers or to whether they are buying to let or buying to
live in their houses, that should be made clear to us.</hs_Para>

think that the Government should be afraid of new clause 1. One of its
two policy schemes, the guarantee scheme, does not involve any
expenditure, because it will come into operation only if a house has to
be sold at less than the price that was paid for it. There is evidence
that such schemes work. In the Irish Republic, the National Asset
Management Agency introduced its 80-20 scheme in an attempt to
stimulate demand for some of the properties that it had taken over, and
I hope that it will introduce the scheme in Northern Ireland as well.
It owns property there, and is currently putting it on the market.
There is evidence that the guarantee enabled people to secure loans
that would not normally have been available to them, because the
lenders had been relieved of some of the risk.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Delyn (Mr Hanson) asked whether such schemes
would apply throughout the United Kingdom and in all the devolved
Administrations. He mentioned the potential for distortion in the
housing 
<?notus-xml column=356?>market, suggesting that people might move from one country in the UK to
another in order to take advantage of them. I understand that the
guarantee scheme will apply throughout the United
Kingdom.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041737000203" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0001.htm#13041737000203">The
second scheme involves equity loans. I do not think that the Government
should be worried about scrutiny of its likely effectiveness. For some
time, Northern Ireland has operated a co-ownership scheme which enables
people to rent half a property and buy the other half. We were able to
negotiate that with the banks because all the risk was being taken by
Co-ownership Housing and the public purse, which would be responsible
for the first 50% of any loss. The banks have actually dropped the
requirement for a 20% deposit. The good thing is that there has been no
cost to the public purse; it has simply been borne by the banks not
requiring  the deposit, because the risk has been taken out of
the house
purchase.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13041737000822" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0001.htm#13041737000822">4.15

Steve Reed</B> (Croydon North) (Lab):</Member> Does the hon. Gentleman
also see scope for more stimulation of co-operative housing schemes in
the mix in the United Kingdom? In Germany and Canada, some 10% of
housing is co-operative. In parts of Scandinavia, the figure is 18%.
The figure is higher in those countries because their Governments act
to promote the development of co-operative housing. In the United
Kingdom, it accounts for just 0.6% of all housing. It offers a way for
people to get their foot on the housing ladder, without the need for
unaffordable deposits.</hs_Para>

Wilson:</Member></B> It does indeed. Let me illustrate the success of
co-ownership in Northern Ireland, which is similar to the co-operative
housing that the hon. Gentleman describes. More than 50% of new houses
in Northern Ireland are being sold through the co-ownership
arrangement. Importantly, because it is targeted at first-time buyers,
it has enabled them to get their foot on the housing market ladder,
stimulated demand in the economy and created the jobs in the
construction industry that are so sorely needed.</hs_Para>

therefore, are the reservations about this scheme? The first concerns
the way in which the spend will be dealt with. Of course, loans have to
be repaid, and the scheme has been financed through a DEL cut across
Departments of 1%. Secondly, it amounts to £4 billion over the
next three years. The question is, could that money, if it is spent on
housing, target the most needy, rather than being spent across the
board with no restriction on income, meaning that people can buy second
homes? Is there a better way of spending that £4 billion? Or, as
the hon. Member for Dundee East suggested, if the approach were less
prescriptive, are there other capital areas it could be spent on,
leading to a far greater multiplier effect and impact on the
infrastructure of the United Kingdom? Those are questions about the

is that although the dynamics of the housing market would suggest that
if someone moves from their home to a more expensive, bigger
home—I am sure that the Minister will make this
argument—it releases houses further down and starts the market
moving. My main priority for constituents who come to see me is those
who are not even in the housing market at all. Even though the dynamics
of getting people to move up the housing chain are important, it seems
to me that the priority ought to be those who cannot get social houses
and who cannot afford privately rented housing as rents, certainly in
Northern Ireland, are going up at a rate that prices many people out of
the market. The opportunity should be provided for them to get in at
the low end of the market through affordable housing. That is why we
need a much more targeted scheme. One reason why I think it would be
useful to examine the scheme within a short period of time is that it
would show whether the real objectives and priorities in the housing
market are being addressed by these
schemes.</hs_Para>

exercise across the UK and my concern is that once we have that
revaluation exercise, council tax revaluation will be a real problem
across the country. A huge number of people will be very concerned
about council tax increases if all their properties have been revalued.

Gilmore:</Member></B> The test of what is happening is whether the
economy will be stimulated. That is the real test that we should keep
under review. If we want collectively to stimulate the economy, the
most direct way of doing that would be to fund socially rented houses.
That would get people into jobs, who would then help to stimulate the
rest of the local economy. I do not know whether an ideological
aversion to that has brought about the proposals we have before us;
perhaps it has, because all the affordable housing the Government seem

shall now discuss the new clauses. New clause 1 proposes that the
Government provide a report to Parliament, three months after the
passing of the Bill, to ensure that the tax measures do not benefit
those who are purchasing a second home. The Government have already
taken steps, through the tax system, on the issue of second homes. We
have changed the discounts on council tax for second homes, through the
Local Government Finance Act 2012. From 1 April 2013, billing
authorities in England will be able to charge up to 100% council tax,
instead of between 50% and 90%, on properties that they consider to be
second homes. That corrects an imbalance permitted by the previous
Government, which allowed second home owners to pay less than those
with a single
property.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041737000235" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0001.htm#13041737000235">The
report suggested is wholly unnecessary, but in today’s debate
issues have been raised about the Help to Buy scheme, particularly
whether it will support those who wish to purchase a second home. We
have already made it very clear that second homes will not be eligible
for the Help to Buy equity loan scheme. The scheme builds on the
existing successful First Buy scheme, and is able to use existing
processes. In the new scheme the Government, through the Homes and
Communities Agency, have a more direct relationship with the purchaser,
and require a legal declaration by the purchaser’s solicitor
that the property will be the purchaser’s only and main
residence. The Chancellor has also been very clear that the intention
of the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme is to help people buy
their first home, or to move up the property ladder as their family
grows. But the mortgage guarantee scheme represents a major new
intervention, and we must ensure that we get it
right.</hs_Para>

that it is the Government’s duty to carefully consider what is

their net wealth was a lot lower than the actual value of the home. We
have concerns that any 
<?notus-xml column=362?>mansion tax would be administratively burdensome for HMRC to operate,
not to mention intrusive for the person having their home inspected.
But Opposition Members should be aware that we are taxing anyone

a further £560 to reach £10,000 in 2014-15, meeting the

£68,000 or more—will pay nearly half of total income tax.
As part of the Government’s commitment to create a fairer tax
system, since 2010 the Government have raised taxes on the rich in
every Budget. Budget 2010 introduced a higher rate of capital gains
tax, Budget 2011 tackled avoidance through disguised remuneration, and

and then scrapped once before, to the cost of many further down the
income scale—the people whom they claim they want to help.
Fortunately, the Government have a more coherent income tax policy, as
we heard from my hon. Friends the Members for Stevenage (Stephen
McPartland) and for Bristol West. Our increases to the personal
allowance have replaced the 10p rate, which Labour doubled; there have
been successive increases to the tax free personal allowance.
Effectively, we have introduced a 0%
band.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041737000251" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0001.htm#13041737000251"><Member ContinuationText="Geraint Davies" PimsId="2869" UID="13041737000968" xid="1174" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0001.htm#13041737000968"><B>Geraint

reality for as many households as possible. The housing measures
introduced in this Budget will tackle long-term problems in the housing
market, giving a much needed boost to housing supply and supporting
those who want to get on or move up the housing ladder. Introducing a
mansion tax would create real fairness issues by hitting asset rich but
potentially income-poor households. It would serve to create only

important that we continue to press Ministers for some firmer answers
on their Help to Buy scheme, which gives the impression of having been
written on the back of an envelope without much thought and without
looking in sufficient detail at some of the questions that have arisen
in the course of the last few hours, whether with regard to devolved
Administrations or second home purchases. Therefore, it is necessary to

against his own policy that he does not want us to look into the very

course, if we are to implement a mansion tax we want to make sure that
we get it right. We do not want the unthought-through approach taken by
the Treasury. We want to make sure that we have taxes that are fair and
will be sustainable for the population as a whole. Therefore, it is

Amendment 2 seeks to commission from the Chancellor a review of the
possibility of incorporating a bank payroll tax within the bank levy
and the publishing of a report, within six months of the passing of the
Finance Act, on how additional revenue raised would be
invested—in particular, to create new jobs and tackle
unemployment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041747000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0001.htm#13041747000006">Our
approach to bank taxation cannot be looked at in isolation from the
economic consequences caused by the banking crisis or from the deficit
left for the taxpayer as a result of the failures of the UK banking
system. Despite signs in 2012 that the recovery was under way, the
extreme-austerity path pursued by the Chancellor has led to stagnation
and falling living standards, as well as to growth of only 0.8%,
compared with the 5.3% that was promised at the 2010 spending review,
and to downgraded forecasts for this year and next year. On top of
that, wage levels are flatlining at a time of inflation, resulting in
real-terms wage cuts for millions of people, and millions more are
struggling to find work in the first place. The typical family is worse
off by £891 a year as a result of the cumulative effect of the
decisions taken since
2010.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13041747000123" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0001.htm#13041747000123">5

amendment offers a new route for the economy and a policy decision that
the Chancellor of the Exchequer should take, focusing in particular on
the bank bonus tax that ought to be implemented. Only today the
International Monetary Fund has warned the Chancellor that he should
change course and we have learned that unemployment levels are
soaring—70,000 more people are now on the dole compared with
last month, youth unemployment has risen by 20,000 and long-term
unemployment is up yet again. <I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I> The

all those problems, there was little attempt in the Budget to suggest
any solutions. The Office for Budget Responsibility considered the

the same time that this Government are presiding over a
millionaires’ tax cut, ordinary people are being hit from all
sides. Middle and low earners will be hit hardest, while those who need
it least will get the big payouts. According to the Institute for
Fiscal Studies, the average single parent in work will be worse off by
£1,225 and couples with children where both parents work will be
worse off by £1,869. At the same time, hundreds of bankers
earning more than £1 million will get an average £54,000

Government’s unfairness is not just about the
millionaires’ tax cut, so we felt it necessary to table this
amendment, which asks the Chancellor to reconsider his approach to bank
taxation. The Chancellor has been consistently weak and reluctant to
make banks pay their fair share. Despite their promise to the contrary,
the Government’s Financial Services (Banking Reform) Bill has
failed to implement fully the structural reforms recommended by the

interests.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041747000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0001.htm#13041747000012">On
top of that, the Government’s bank levy has raised far less than
the £2.5 billion they promised. In the financial year just
ended—2012-13—the bank levy raised just £1.6
billion, from which a further £200 million has to be deducted
because of the generosity of the corporation tax cut that the
Chancellor has lavished on the banks. All in all, the banks have paid
£1.1 billion less than they were supposed to pay in the last
financial year. This is a tremendously generous Chancellor, but only to
the
banks.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041747000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0001.htm#13041747000013"><B><Member ContinuationText="Andrew Gwynne" PimsId="4785" UID="13041747000129" xid="827" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0001.htm#13041747000129">Andrew

Government’s approach to the bank levy. They have consistently
said, “Don’t worry, we’ll set the
rate”—let us bear in mind that the levy is a charge on
the balance sheets and a proportion of a certain set of
liabilities—and said that it was designed to yield £2.5
billion, so it has taken some doing for the Treasury to have managed to
net only £1.6 billion in the past year and to get the bank levy
so wrong. If it had been my hon. Friend’s constituents who were
due to pay a certain level of tax through PAYE or national insurance,
does he imagine that the taxman or Treasury would have been so lax and
said, “Oh, don’t worry, we’ll let you off that
massive liability for the time being”? That is essentially what
the Minister and his colleagues in the Treasury have been doing and
saying to the banks.</hs_Para>

not the

Leslie:</Member></B> I am afraid that the situation is even worse than
my hon. Friend thinks. It is not only the past financial year in which
the Minister and his colleagues took their eye off the ball on the bank
levy: they did so in the financial year before that, too. In 2011-12,
the combined shortfall from the bank levy, netting in
£1.8 billion or so and added to the corporation tax
cut, was £800 million less than Ministers promised.
It is not good enough to say, “Oh well, this is an aberration,
and it is something that we can tweak and correct.” Ministers
are not going back as far as they should and correcting that shortfall
in the steps they are taking in the Budget. It is just not good enough.
They have not thought through the design of the bank levy carefully
enough.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041747000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0002.htm#13041747000017">It
is not as though Ministers were not warned. I am sorry that the
Exchequer Secretary is not in his place, as I warned him in a debate in
July 2010—it seems like only yesterday, but it was nearly three
years ago—when I said, “The bank levy is too weak. It
will not work and it will not have those yields.” It does not
give me any satisfaction to say, “I told you so”, but I
did tell them so, and Ministers cannot therefore claim that it was

Leslie:</Member></B> That is an option, and we certainly need to go
back to the drawing board and make sure that we design the bank levy in
a way that actually works. The proposition we have made in the
amendment is to repeat the bank bonus tax that worked very successfully
in 2009. That could be incorporated into the bank levy
process—that is one option—to ensure that we get a fair

ensuring that we net the right level of resource for the Treasury in
recompense for the deficit that the banks created. It is possible to
have a bank bonus tax that is more sustainable, but I am open to
discussion with the Treasury about how that might work. Even if we
netted less than the £3.5 billion that the first bank bonus tax
brought in, it would still be considerably more on top of the bank
levy, which clearly needs to be topped up. It is important that we look

still excessively generous to the very lucky few. There are a number of

Minister. This is the Minister who has tweaked and changed the rate, I
think, five or six times in various Finance Bills, all to fit the
£2.5 billion figure that he has totally failed to address. We
need to go back to the drawing board on the bank levy and find a way of
calculating it so that it properly yields the sums that we envisage. Of
course, the bank levy has to be thought through, so that we get that
resource in. It is totally unacceptable to have lost nearly £2
billion for the taxpayer in the past two financial years. Just think
what that £2 billion could have achieved in that
period. This is not small money. There is the classic chancellorial
phrase, “A billion here, a billion there and very soon it starts
to add up to real money”, but this is significant resource. It
is to the great shame of Ministers that they have allowed that money to
slip away from them.</hs_Para>

constraint on the lending capacity of banks? The hon. Gentleman seems
to be suggesting—this is the classic Conservative attitude to
banking—that the one inviolate part of a bank’s balance
sheet is remuneration, or “compensation” as they
sometimes like to call it: “Do what you like to the banks, but
for goodness’ sake don’t affect that bonus pool and
don’t change that compensation pool.” Well, I am sorry,
but we take a totally different point of view. In fact, if there is one
area of bank finance that needs a culture change, and which proves that
stronger capital adequacy is not anathema to bank lending, it is
management remuneration. It is too bloated and needs to
change.</hs_Para>

from banks, which then complain they do not have any money left, their

point, but can he answer a conundrum for me? He has helpfully said that
he wants to raise £2 billion this year through his payroll tax.

Leslie:</Member></B> I do not recognise that figure. <I>[Interruption.]
</I>The Minister is making various projections about the bonus pool,
but even if the changes meant that we did not manage in years to come
to yield what we now feel we can yield—he could equally make the
argument that said, “Well, the European Union is making changes
to limit bonuses,” which would obviously mean changes to
salaries and elsewhere—what we are proposing would add
considerably to the bank levy revenues that he has managed to generate.
As we have set out in the amendment before the Committee, we need to
incorporate a repeat of the bank payroll tax. It is important to
recognise that, although I am happy for the Treasury to commission
further research on the issue. If the Government are interested in this
agenda and are starting to move in that direction, that might be
useful.</hs_Para>

The problem is that if he gets rid of bonuses or drives them
down—a great many 
<?notus-xml column=375?>of us, and certainly the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards,
have said that we do not like this at all—he will not get the

demerit activity or level of taxation. People have been making that
argument about cigarette taxes over the years, saying “Well, if
people give up smoking, will the Treasury not lose a lot of money from
it?” I do not want to divert too much into the wider principle,
but I would say that a very considerable tax cut has been given to
bankers by reducing the 50p rate of income tax to 45p—a cut that
is providing a very significant bonus to those individuals in this
year. The hon. Gentleman need not worry too much about these poor
maligned executives in the banking system. I know that things must be
very difficult for them—they may even have to defer the purchase
of their yachts for that little bit longer—but we must start

that many of the banks are substantially owned by the public sector,
what does not go in bonuses to the top bankers might come back to the
taxpayer in other ways. On the question of the European dimension, we
often hear that a bankers’ bonus tax could not be introduced
only in the UK because all the top bankers would flee to Luxembourg,
France, Germany or wherever. Is that not a good reason why a
Europe-wide policy should be considered—precisely because there
would be less opportunity for people to get away from UK taxation,

tax?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041747000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0002.htm#13041747000052"><B><Member ContinuationText="Chris Leslie" PimsId="1471" UID="13041747000164" xid="354" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0002.htm#13041747000164">Chris

come down from approximately £11 billion to
£1.6 billion. He is proposing a 130% tax on people
who receive bonuses, in respect of the current statistics. We have
heard from my hon. Friend the Member for Wyre Forest (Mark Garnier)
that the shadow Minister has not thought about the implications for the
reduction in take-home from achieving the changes he wants to
bankers’ bonuses, which will reduce the money coming

numbers will not add up. The question I really want to put to him,
however, is whether his proposed reduction in bonuses relates purely to
cash. If not, is he saying that if employees are given shares, which

themselves. We have to get a grip of it, though, because however much
they lavish rewards on themselves, the Exchequer needs to keep pace

I said before, parliamentary rules prevent the Opposition from tabling
amendments that would tweak the bank levy upwards. There is a
convention of the House that only Governments can table amendments to a
Finance Bill that would increase a charge on individuals or companies.
The process is incredibly frustrating, as we need to ensure that we get
into the detail of how the bank levy should work and what the rates
should be. For the time being, we feel that tabling amendment 2 so that
we can consider a review of how a bank bonus tax could help the young
unemployed, in particular, and of how to incorporate it in to a bank
levy that nets the amount it should is the right way forward. I commend
the amendment to my hon.

Davies:</Member></B> I make my comments in light of the fact that
today’s unemployment figures showed an increase of 42% in the
number of people on jobseeker’s allowance in my constituency of
Swansea West. That comes in the aftermath of the financial tsunami of
sub-prime debt that hit our shores in 2008, which was largely a result
of the banking world taking unhealthy risks in the knowledge that the
state would ultimately stand behind it. On the upside, people can take
enormous gambles and make tremendous bonuses in the knowledge that if
it all goes wrong, the taxpayer will cough up. The net impact of all
that is that we are now doddering along on the bottom of the sea of
growth and people do not have opportunities.</hs_Para>

challenges for the Government are how to ensure that money is focused
on job creation and that the banking community pays its fair share. We
know that from this April, the top rate of tax was reduced by 5
points—from 50p to 45p. I realise that the Prime Minister gets
up on his hind legs and says, “Oh, but we will raise more from
the 45p rate than was going to be raised from the 50p rate,” but
we all know that the reason for that is that people with large amounts
of money can move their income between tax years. Bankers and others
will simply move money to a different tax year when the rate was 45p
instead of 50p and avoid the tax. If the 50p rate had been sustained,
we would have generated a lot more money, particularly from the banking
community. My hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie)
did a great job of highlighting the multi-million pound giveaway to the
richest in our communities from the reduction. Our modest proposal

commentary, the hon. Gentleman asked why the Labour party failed to
bring in the 50p tax rate, and indeed the Prime Minister boasts that he
is taxing the rich more than Labour ever did, and that is great. The
Labour party does not exist to introduce high taxes; it exists to give
people opportunity and employment. Higher levels of employment bring
prosperity and opportunity, so there is enough tax yield from a lower
tax rate to fund public services. Between 1997 and 2008, the economy

one is concerned, as I am—as we all are—about the debt to

there are two ways to get it down. The first is to cut the debt

to increase the size of the economy. In 2010, after we had gone through
the financial tsunami, but luckily on the back of 10 years of
unparalleled increase in growth under Labour, the debt to GDP ratio was
55%; now the forecast is 85%. The reason is not just that the Tories
are keen on cutting money for the poorest and getting money from people
who do not have it, but that they cannot get their act together
strategically to generate a growth strategy that reduces the ratio so
that we do not need higher tax rates. We do not want people who are
making obscene bonuses to pay higher taxes for the sake of it; we want
people in

Government debt that is the real problem, but household debt? In the

England relatively recently looking at the profile of debt in the
run-up to 2008 and from 2010. From 2010, the ratio of the debt between
the Government and the banking community was 1:2. Two thirds of the
debt was that of the banking community. Do not misunderstand me: there
has been a problem with the general public ratcheting up more private
debt through the availability of low interest rates, which in

examination of the causes of the financial problems that we face. He
mentioned housing. Does he agree that the housing bubble is part of the
cause of the problem, because people borrowed against the value of
their property, which is not a long-term, sustainable way of producing
growth in the economy? One reason why the proposal that we are debating
is so important is that we need a sustainable model of taxation to
underpin the growth in the economy with the type of investment that my
hon. Friend is talking about, rather than using assets as a way of
investing, which is not sustainable. Actually, there is some evidence
that that problem is recurring now.</hs_Para>

false assumption that the value of property would continue to
escalate. Lenders would grant 110% mortgages on the
presumption that, within a couple of years, the equity would catch up
and there would not be negative equity. Therefore, borrowers would
start with negative equity. The issue of sub-prime debt is a big
problem.</hs_Para>

flagship proposals of the current Budget is for the state to come in
and subsidise deposits by lending up to four fifths of the 25% deposit.
There are people in the financial community who are thinking, quite
reasonably, “Hold on; this could be the start of another
sub-prime debt problem.” The problem we have is that people
cannot afford to save the deposit that would enable them to become an
owner-occupier. They are paying a rent that is too high because there
are not enough houses, so they cannot save the deposit. There is a
logic that asks, “Can we help them with that deposit?” I
agree with that logic that far, but we must be very careful. People
have said, “Oh well, no one is taking up the offer,” but
if this suddenly becomes a very significant amount of money and it is
not properly balanced as a risk, we could be going down the path that
started the problem in the first place.</hs_Para>

ultimately communities are desperately in need of houses. Historically,
council houses were invented because the marketplace was failing to
deliver affordable, quality housing for very large parts of the
community, and we had Rachmanism. I fear, actually, that we are
witnessing the start of its re-emergence. So investing in assets in
which people can have stable family lives, as a platform to get jobs,
is good. We will not solve the problem today, but part of this debate
is clearly about reviewing whether we can do some extraction from the
banking community. That community have just been given back a lot of
money, they have been causing many of the problems and there is a risk
premium. They should be paying back to the taxpayers who are covering
their back. Then we can think creatively about how to engage the

Davies:</Member></B> That is right, and there would be widespread
support for that across our communities and probably in the banking
community. People are taking home an extra £1 million and asking
themselves whether they should be paying income tax at 45p or 50p, at a
time when we hear cases of people earning, say, £20 a week. As I
mentioned at Prime Minister’s Question Time, a constituent who
recently came to me was a chronically ill man who had £20 a week
after paying his utility bills and his bus fare. This month he is down
to about £14 a week due to benefit cuts. If such cases were
brought to the attention of some of those wondering whether to buy
their second yacht, I do not think they would mind paying a little
more.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041758000002" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0002.htm#13041758000002">It
has been insinuated that a 50p rate would discourage such people and be
so painful for them that they would all get in their yachts and go off
and live somewhere else, but in Britain today many people already pay
more than 50p. Anyone who is earning more than £32,000 and less
than £42,000 is paying 40% tax plus 12% national
insurance. That is 52%. The only reason that they have to pay more than
50p and the millionaires do not is that they do not have their own
personal accountants. That is not fair, is
it?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041758000003" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0002.htm#13041758000003">These
are sustainable levels of marginal taxation and it is right that they
should be paid. It is right that members of the banking community, who

abuse by many members of that community who are taking the

now the FCA, do not have the resources and the clout, and have to deal
with dozens of cases, while the defence lawyers deal with only a few

are going to charge you £1 million”, which is small

to rehearse the same action again and again. I hope the Minister will
look into this as it comes from the horse’s mouth—from
people who are giving advice to people who are being defended. They
also poach staff from the FSA or the FCA to work for them. They say,
“We’ll give you three times as much. You’ve been
charging us and you’re very good at it. You’re not paid
enough for your success. Come over to our side. Have some of our bonus

and a single mother, for example, can afford to work for
£15,000, but not for £10,000. If the state makes up that
difference, we end up with someone who can afford to work and make a
contribution, and a business that is now viable. That is good. If that
is simply stripped away and the tax threshold is increased to make it
more worth while, it does not add up. That is one explanation for why
we had such considerable job growth under the Labour party from 1997 to
2008.</hs_Para>

do not really understand working families tax credit. It is a way of
integrating tax and benefits so that we cannot divide people into those
in receipt of benefit and the workers, which is what Conservatives want
to do for political reasons. They want to say that there are the
workers and the shirkers and they are for the workers and the Labour
party simply wants to support people sitting at home. That is the
opposite of the truth. The Labour party is about enabling people to
have pathways to prosperity through jobs. We should be using the fruits
of engaging with the banking community, who make obscene amounts of
money, and investing in skills and in communications, whether it be
electrification of the railways or high speed rail, in wi-fi clouds, or
in creating a global infrastructure in terms of R and D and our
universities.</hs_Para>

a lot of talk about the reduction in corporation tax from 21% to 20%,
but that makes no difference to multinationals if the comparators are
France at 33%, Germany at 29% and the USA at 40%. We are already
competitive. But that 1% reduction is a 5% reduction in our tax yield
from corporation tax. Would it not be better to spend that on helping
universities to grow with industry? There is a good example of that in
Swansea, which could be the fruits of what we are talking about today,
where the second campus is being underpinned by £250 million
from the European Investment Bank, and where Tata Steel, BP, other
multinationals and the Welsh Government are engaged. Research shows
that that sort of cluster of R and D attracts more and more big
business and jobs, rather than just a marginal bit of corporation tax.
We need to think cleverly about how to generate R and D engines.
Brazil, for example, is spending £5.3 billion from development
banks on getting into the global field of biotech. China and other
countries are making similar investments. That is the way to organise
ourselves in a joined-up way, rather than the laissez faire social and
economic Darwinism of the Tories, where we see the weakest die and the
greediest become more bloated as they exploit the
world.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041758000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0002.htm#13041758000017"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Newmark" PimsId="4831" UID="13041758000113" xid="809" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0002.htm#13041758000113">Mr

Newmark:</Member></B> I am enjoying the hon. Gentleman’s
fascinating speech, and a philosophical divide is clearly developing.
Does he really believe that it is best for a company to pay an extra 1%
to Government, because they know how best to spend that money to create
jobs? Or is it best to leave it with the company? Let us leave bankers
aside, because I know that one is obsessed with those. Let us talk
about the Tatas of the world, the manufacturers who historically have
done a great job in Wales in creating jobs. Does the hon. Gentleman
believe that it is best that that 1% extra goes to Government, because
they are in a better position to create those jobs, than a company such
as Tata, which would take that extra 1% and use it efficiently for R
and D or job
creation?</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13041758000102" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0002.htm#13041758000102">6.15

Davies:</Member></B> You, Mr Amess, probably have one of these
sophisticated iPhones. I bring it out of my pocket because all the
heavy lifting of the technology in this phone, which is a multi-billion
pound product in a global marketplace, has been done by the public
sector. We invented the internet, but GPS, touch sensitivity, voice
sensitivity and most of those things were done by the institute of
technology in California, which is why the Californian government are
suing Apple for £26 billion to try to recover some of
the money earned. Apple did a bit of packaging and marketing, produced
the goods in a lower cost place, and paid tax somewhere else. We have
global companies, which we all know about, which do not pay tax where
the economic activity takes place. The answer to the hon.
Gentleman’s question whether it would be better to give money
back to companies for  R and D is that companies want to do a
bit of R and D, but they want to do it on the back of the heavy lifting
of the public sector. That is the reality. Part of our challenge is to
attract those companies to where we have public sector activity, to
engage in partnership, and to ensure that we tax where the economic
activity and marketplaces are, so that we get our fair share of the
added value and a return from our taxpayer investment. So the answer is
yes, yes,
yes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041758000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0002.htm#13041758000021"><B><Member ContinuationText="Bill Esterson" PimsId="5716" UID="13041758000117" xid="1148" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0002.htm#13041758000117">Bill
Esterson:</Member></B> With regard to why Government have to intervene,
my hon. Friend mentioned Swansea, but around the country there are
regions with big problems, particularly youth
unemployment—Merseyside is a key area where that is a
problem—where we need such intervention. We are talking about a
levy on banks, not on Tata, and we need that money to be directed where
the job shortages are for young people. A small number of my
constituents who have not been able to find work locally travel to
London to obtain work, with all the inherent problems of high housing
costs. It is not an attractive option. It is not what they want to do,
but they have no choice. However, the vast majority are  not in
a position to do that, and that is why youth unemployment in the
regions is going up, and that is why we need the kind of intervention
that my hon. Friend is talking
about.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041758000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0002.htm#13041758000022"><B><Member ContinuationText="Geraint Davies" PimsId="2869" UID="13041758000118" xid="1174" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0002.htm#13041758000118">Geraint

about the growing regional imbalance in the British economy. I realise
that the Government  
<?notus-xml column=389?>have paid lip service to that issue, but if the only place to get a good
job is London, that inflates costs, and young people come to London to
live in squalid conditions in the hope that they can get the experience
to go home at some point. There is a brain-drain as well, so this
policy does not make any sense. One of the first things the Government
did was to get rid of the regional development agencies. They said that
they were no use and cost too much.</hs_Para>

the world. Its mission is to market Britain for trade and inward

and setting out their case. Immediately after the RDAs were destroyed,
there was a queue of companies looking to invest in Britain through

sciences cluster at Swansea university, which brings together the best

not about one or the other; it is about both. I have visited a company
in Maesteg, at the top of the Llynfi valley, a former coal mining area,
which is investing in life sciences. Does he also agree that the sort
of intervention that that company would love to see is in a jobs

growth markets within the global market environment, and life sciences
is one that is of great interest in Swansea, as are biotech and green
technologies and all the rest of it. What the public sector can allow
is a critical mass of research that benefits from economies of scale
and a shared risk that would not be taken by individual operators, and
that can attract inward investors. What we want is a benign
partnership, as we have in

such as the north-east, where trains will be made, and in my area,
where nuclear power stations will be built? He refers to “heavy
lifting”. Does he not agree that through his industrial strategy
the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills has
introduced the aerospace centre, which will be a massive investment,
essentially in the public sector, to promote the development of
aviation? That will also be repeated for the automotive sector. That is

that it is very much a U-turn—although that is fine. One moment
the Government were withdrawing and saying, “We don’t
have to do anything, because the market will spontaneously
grow.” Then nothing was growing in the garden, so they go and
put in some pot plants and that sort of thing, which is great. Hitachi
is very welcome, and Tata has been mentioned. Some of those big
companies, such as Tata, will make strategic investments, particularly
because of the quality of the coal and the history of skills and the
innovation, such as the partnership with Swansea university, where they
are developing a new type of steel that has six layers, generates its
own electricity and, when used to clad buildings, lowers the carbon
footprint. It is the future.</hs_Para>

football, because there is a rivalry between Swansea and Cardiff, and
Cardiff, to be fair to them, have just been promoted. I feel that
people who earn more should pay more towards the public good. Whether
or not the cut-off point is £250,000, we all have a contribution
to make and those with the widest shoulders should pay more and at a
greater rate. There is a debate about what that rate should be, but
certainly those people who advocate a poll tax that would mean the poor
paying the same as the richest for local services are at the far
extreme of reasonableness. Most of us, I would like to think, want the

is yet another Government economic plan that has been poorly evidenced.
It is part of an endless package of ill-thought-through policies. The

miserably. They do not even have a  plan B for the

the financial year 2010-11, the bankers’ bonus tax introduced by
the Labour Government raised around £3.5 billion. It was a
sensible tax on the country’s top earners. It was scrapped
within weeks of the coalition Government taking office and replaced by
a bank levy, which the Prime Minister has consistently claimed would 
<?notus-xml column=392?>raise £2.5 billion a year. The simple truth is that it has not,
so one could say that the Prime Minister’s accuracy at the
Dispatch Box has been found wanting. Do not take my word for
it—the Office for Budget Responsibility evidence, published
alongside the Budget, confirmed the figures. The OBR has said that the
coalition’s bank levy will bring in just £1.6 billion
from the last financial year—almost £1 billion less than
the Prime Minister said it would, and less than half that raised
under Labour’s bank
bonus.</hs_Para>

taken by the hon. Gentleman, which was that it is unreasonable for the
Treasury to carry out a review—of a mansion tax, in the context
of the previous debate. He seemed to have forgotten that the Government
are carrying out a review, at taxpayers’ expense, into the

work. It is estimated that there is a shortfall of 20 million working
hours, which equates to a real unemployment figure that runs closer to
3 million. Questions have also been asked of people who work part time

trying to hold down two or three part-time jobs, as was evidenced

Some people have used their redundancy money to set up as
self-employed, and those figures are slightly skewing the evidence on
what is happening on the ground. Some people have been transferred from
the public sector to the private sector, often on reduced hours. That
shift partly explains the rise in the number of jobs in the private

young people and to help them get a foot on the ladder and contribute

that anyone looking at the proposal would find it very difficult to say
that it does not have a core of fairness within it. It is directed
towards an industry, the banking industry, which was partly responsible
for the economic crisis we face, the impetus for which was people in
that industry being given incentives to behave in a reckless way that
led to the kind of borrowing and lending that created our current
difficulties. They were bailed out by the taxpayer, with bonuses then
being paid out of that bail-out. I would have thought that on the
grounds of fairness alone, Government Members would see at least some
merit in the arguments for the proposal which have been
advanced.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041758000070" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0002.htm#13041758000070">I
have often heard it said, not only by Labour Members, but particularly
by Government Members who are close to small businesses—perhaps
many of their supporters are small business owners—that the
banking industry has strangled those businesses in the middle of the
recession, refusing to lend to them even when there are good, viable
propositions and putting the squeeze on them when they most needed
liquidity. I would have thought that Government Members would have some
sympathy for a proposal that said to them, “We cannot reward
people at the top of an industry who are destroying, squeezing and
making it difficult for the businesses that many of you would regard as
your supporters”, yet they seem to be opposed to

Even some within the banking industry would say that there is no
economic rationale for the obscene bonuses that are given at the top of
the industry, and that there is no necessity for those bonuses to make
it work efficiently. On a weekly basis, businesses and individuals come
to me and say that if anything is strangling growth and the potential
for it, in the economy today, it is the performance of the banking
industry. When I hear about of some of these bonuses, I wonder what
they are being paid for. They are certainly not being paid because the
banking industry is performing well in helping to grow the economy and
lift us out of recession.</hs_Para>

Garnier:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman is making a very powerful
point. However, that is exactly why some of us have spent the past nine
months on the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards examining
the problems he is talking about. It is why the Government introduced
the Financial Services Act 2012 in order to repair the regulatory
environment and to establish the Financial Policy Committee to look at
the instability in the system that can come about as a result of
perverse incentives from bonuses. It is why the Government are
currently taking the Financial Services (Banking Reform) Bill through
Parliament. A huge amount is being done for exactly the reasons he
mentions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041758000074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0002.htm#13041758000074"><B><Member ContinuationText="Sammy Wilson" PimsId="4642" UID="13041758000146" xid="915" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0002.htm#13041758000146">Sammy

of the arguments advanced by Government Members, mainly through
interventions, as to why the proposal is a bad idea, have become
increasingly desperate as the debate has progressed. I believe that
this should be done, first, on the basis of fairness, and secondly,
because it has some potential for changing behaviour, and that ought to
be given serious consideration.</hs_Para>

argument was to say, “If we do this, we will be taking money out
of the economy.” What do these people who get the bonuses do
with them? Are they generating additional expenditure in the economy?
If someone gets a bonus of £1 million, are they likely to spend
it? We all know, and it is well evidenced in economic theory, that the
more money we get, the higher the proportion of that additional income
we tend to save—it does not contribute to the economy. During
the Budget, the Chancellor said that the poor performance in the
economy was because consumer spending had been suppressed and was not
what had been anticipated. When I hear the argument that discouraging
these bonuses, or taking them back in the form of tax, removes spending
power from the economy, I find it rather
bizarre.</hs_Para>

Seabeck:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman is reinforcing a point that I
touched on earlier. In Plymouth, we are losing £16 million a
year in benefits, and the people who usually get those benefits are
poor and would spend the money in their local areas, not on foreign
holidays or by putting it into bank
accounts.</hs_Para>

Wilson:</Member></B> Although saving is, of course, good in any
economy, the important question at the moment is: how do we generate
spending? The hon. Lady has reinforced the point that if money goes to
unemployed people they are likely to spend 100% of that income, but
someone who gets a £1 million bonus is likely to save 90% of
it—perhaps more—so it will not be injected into the
economy. I do not think that the argument that the amendment would
remove money from the economy and, somehow or other, deflate it stands
up to
scrutiny.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041758000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0002.htm#13041758000079">The
second argument, which was made by the hon. Member for Dover (Charlie
Elphicke)—he tried to promote it in a couple of interventions on
the hon. Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie)—is that all
this levy would do is make finance either pricier or less available. As
has been said, that implies that the only part of bank spending that is
sacrosanct is the amount of money spent on bonuses. Making an activity
more expensive tends to direct people away from it, and I cannot see
how the banks would be any different. If we make it more expensive and
more costly for them to give bonuses, they will be driven away from
using those funds in that way and it would create a behavioural change.
If that change did not happen, however, and bonuses continued to be
paid and the tax on them recouped from customers, the alternative would
be regulation. The customer should not have to pay for them—if
banks do not change their behaviour, we should ensure that the taxes
cannot be passed on to
customers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041758000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0002.htm#13041758000080">The
third argument—I found this one bizarre, especially with regard
to the bank levy—is that since we cannot be sure how much money
will be raised, we should not pursue it. If that were true, we probably
would not tax anything. How often do we hear the Government predict the
amount that will be raised in tax revenue, only then to revise the
figure within six months, either because behaviours have changed and
the expected amount has not been raised, or because the economy
performed in a different way than
expected?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041758000081" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0002.htm#13041758000081">It
is the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Mark Garnier) who made that
argument, but on that basis we would not have the bank levy, which was
supposed to raise £2.5 billion this year, but raised only
£1.1 billion. I do not know why that revenue was not
raised—perhaps there was some change in the
economy—but whatever the reason the bank levy did not raise the
money intended. Moreover, the Government made
spending plans on the assumption that that revenue would be
available. I do not think that the amendment can be argued down on the
basis that it may not raise the money and therefore no commitment
should be
made.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041758000082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0002.htm#13041758000082"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mark Garnier" PimsId="5553" UID="13041758000149" xid="1161" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0002.htm#13041758000149">Mark

raise.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041758000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0002.htm#13041758000083"><B><Member ContinuationText="Sammy Wilson" PimsId="4642" UID="13041758000150" xid="915" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0002.htm#13041758000150">Sammy

did not make it very well. When the Chancellor declares what taxes he

requirement that I would make of an amendment of this nature is that it
does not throw out a reckless figure and say, “We will make

calculation was made, but it cannot be argued that, because there is a
degree of uncertainty, this is not a good proposition. I would have
been very unhappy had the amendment said, “Let’s raise
the money and then we’ll see what we will do with it.” It
is much easier to make an argument on the grounds of fairness:
“Let’s raise the money and this is what we will do with
it.” Knowing where the money comes from, the purposes for which
it was being used and the purposes for which it will be used once
collected would enable us to judge whether the proposition is fair. It
is not possible to divorce how the money is raised from what will be
done with
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041758000085" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0002.htm#13041758000085"><B><Member ContinuationText="Neil Carmichael" PimsId="5604" UID="13041758000151" xid="1191" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0002.htm#13041758000151">Neil

businesses that have large order books and successful products and that

collateral and houses? That is what the banks should be focusing on in
our local communities and economies, not on massive bets against share

fourth argument is totally different from the others, but I think that
Government Members were getting increasingly desperate as they clawed
for arguments against what is a reasonable proposition. One Member
asked several times whether the amendment was designed to change
behaviour, to act against perverse incentives or to raise revenue. All
taxes tend to have behavioural consequences anyway; it is in their
nature to change behaviour. Some are specifically designed to do
so, while some are more genuinely revenue-raising because
they do not affect behaviour as much. If the revenue from the tax goes
down because fewer bonuses are paid, that does not necessarily mean
that it is bad for the economy. For example, if banks decide not to pay
bonuses and to keep the money as profits, corporation tax revenue will
go up; or if they decide to put the money back into the bank and
thereby increase liquidity, that will have a beneficial effect on the
economy, because banks will  be able to make more loans to
businesses. Just because  
<?notus-xml column=399?>it may change behaviour does not necessarily make it a bad proposition.
In fact, the proposition stands, as it could have other tax
revenue-raising consequences or induce changes in bank behaviour that
mean they have more money to do what the public expect them to do,
rather than simply giving huge bonuses to their top-ranking
employees.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13041758000105" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0002.htm#13041758000105">7

final argument concerned the specific targeting of banks. It was
argued, “If you want to do this, why not do it to

the hon. Gentleman’s party, who are adherents of supply-side
economics, would accept that it is the role of Government, for example,
to provide opportunities for people to train. That creates jobs. It
increases the skills base of the economy, which makes it easier for the

bonus tax raised a net amount of £2.3 billion for the Exchequer,
and that was supposed to be that. Amazingly, the Labour party had no
other plans to make the banks make any further contribution to the
costs they imposed on taxpayers. I agree with the hon. Member for East
Antrim (Sammy Wilson) on that point. After that £2.3
billion, it appeared that the banks had discharged their responsibility
to the taxpayers. To be fair and to acknowledge the consistency of the
Labour Government, they showed no indication during their 13 years in
office that they wanted to extract a contribution from the banks, even
when the Centre for Economics and Business Research estimated that
bonuses amounted to £11.5 billion in 2007.</hs_Para>

the Labour party was “intensely relaxed” about people
getting filthy rich. We have taken a different view. We believed from
the outset that it was right for banks to contribute more to the
taxpayer than other companies which did not pose a risk to the
Exchequer and to the taxpayer. We agree with the point about fairness,
and that is why the Government introduced a permanent levy—not a
one-off—on the balance sheets of banks in the first Finance Bill
of the new
Government.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041768000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0002.htm#13041768000011">Because

sheets, unlike bonuses, cannot be hidden. They are more stable than
bonus pools and so offer a far better way to collect a levy to benefit
the public. Moreover, balance sheets are a better reflection of the
risks, to the banking sector and to taxpayers, than remuneration, as
set out by the International Monetary Fund in its 2010 report to the
G20. That is why France and Germany quickly joined us in applying bank
levies. They have subsequently been joined by Austria, Belgium, the
Netherlands, Portugal and others. It is fair to say that those
countries have not chosen to charge as much as we have. Relative to the
size of our financial sector, our levy raises five times that raised by
the French levy and two and a half times that raised by the German
levy, but not one of these countries has thought fit to introduce a
permanent bonus tax.</hs_Para>

bonus tax would, of course, have been a catastrophically unreliable
source of revenue, which is why I am very concerned that the spending
commitments proposed by the hon. Member for Nottingham East (Chris
Leslie) seem to be based on it. When the Labour tax was imposed, the
Centre for Economics and Business Research estimated that the total
pool of City bonuses was £6.7 billion. As I said earlier, it
estimated that last year bonuses were £1.6 billion—less
than a quarter of the 2010 level. With regard to the proposals from
Europe, there might be some expectation that the levels will fall
further.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041768000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0002.htm#13041768000017">A
balance sheet tax is obviously a more stable, sustainable and sensible
revenue base. However, to address the points made by the hon. Member
for Nottingham East, balance sheets are not entirely invariable, which
is why we have introduced a second element to the policy. We have
specified that the bank levy should raise at least £2.5 billion
a year, which is why we have clauses 200 and 201. The clauses increase
the bank levy from 0.088% to 0.142% from 5 January 2014. The reason for
these increases is simple: the forecast published by the independent
Office for Budget Responsibility in December implied that 
<?notus-xml column=402?>without amendment receipts for future years would fall short of the
£2.5 billion required and to which we are
committed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041768000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0002.htm#13041768000018">We
announced in the autumn statement, as soon as these forecasts were
published, an increase in the rate, which the Bill implements, to
correct the shortfall. The March 2013 forecasts made by the OBR show
that the levy is now forecast to raise more than £2.5 billion
this year, and in all subsequent years. When the bank levy was first
set, in Budget 2010, it took account of the planned reductions to
corporation tax that were announced at the same time. Since then, as
hon. Members know, the Government have been able to make further cuts
to corporation tax. We have taken the view that this should not be
passed on to the banks. Accordingly, clause 201 increases the bank levy
to recover the benefit that would have been received from the cut in
corporation
tax.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041768000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0002.htm#13041768000019">To
answer the point made by the hon. Member for Ogmore (Huw
Irranca-Davies), the effect of these changes would be to cause the bank
levy to yield not £2.5 billion in future, but £2.7
billion this year, and £2.9 billion for every year into the
future. This extra revenue more than makes up for the shortfall in
revenues experienced during the first two years.</hs_Para>

something about clause 202, the other measure in the Bill relating to
the bank levy. The clause removes an anomaly that would have been
exploited, whereby banks could have claimed both a tax credit and a
deduction for the same foreign bank levy. The view of Her
Majesty’s Revenue and Customs is that the existing corporate tax
rules prevent such a deduction, but the case law is old and we saw fit
to put the matter beyond
doubt.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041768000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0002.htm#13041768000021">I
fear the Opposition have made a mistake in preferring a payroll tax to
a bank levy. As countries across the world demonstrate, a bank levy is
a better reflection of systemic risk: it is permanent, it raises more
money and it is sustainable, not being undermined by avoidance. If the
Opposition persist in basing their spending plans on such a flimsy
source of revenue as the bonus tax, which actually exceeds what is paid
in bonuses this year, then I fear that they have not learned the lesson
that they surely must: jeopardising our public finances would take this
country back to the edge of ruin from which this Government have hauled
it back. If the hon. Member for Nottingham East had any embarrassment
or rigour, he would withdraw this ridiculous amendment. I commend
clauses 200, 201 and 202.</hs_Para>

always raise £2.5 billion.” Last year, however, it was
£1.6 billion; this year it is £1.8 billion. The amount of
money lost is staggering. We will, therefore, want to test the view of
the Committee. The Minister has to get a grip on this issue. He has
been haemorrhaging money, and the £2 billion that has been lost

Friends, is to replace the Government’s anti-tax avoidance
measure, the GAAR 
<?notus-xml column=413?>or the general anti-avoidance rule, as set out in clauses 203
to 212, with an alternative, much fairer, more effective and more
comprehensive measure, the GAntiP or general anti-avoidance
principle—I apologise for all the acronyms. In practice, the
latter would mean that where a court could establish, having taken
account of all the relevant circumstances, that the primary purpose of
an arrangement was the avoidance of tax rather than any economically
substantive transaction, it could strike it down.</hs_Para>

immediately to the Exchequer Secretary that I appreciate that although
UK tax avoidance for the last 70 or so years has been considered on the
basis of four UK court decisions—and notably the Duke of
Westminster case of 1936—the GAAR guidelines, which were
published a couple of days ago, now override that position. I
understand that they are, in effect, legal precedent in their own
right, which any court has to take into account. That is certainly a
significant advance. However, the Government’s GAAR, as set out
in this Bill, is still fatally flawed.</hs_Para>

most importantly, the GAAR advisory panel is riddled through and
through with a blatant conflict of interest. It will be drawn almost
exclusively from highly paid City lawyers who have spent their careers,
and made their fortunes from, giving expensive advice to companies on
how to avoid tax. It is like putting the poachers in charge of the
gamekeepers. Surely it would be right for independent
experts—some drawn from Her Majesty’s Revenue and
Customs—to form the main body of what should obviously be an
impartial membership.</hs_Para>

the point of view of HMRC and the poor innocent taxpayers who are
penalised if the corporate tax abusers are allowed to get away with it,
there is a double jeopardy at work. First, what most people might
regard as unreasonable might well be regarded by highly paid City
lawyers who make their money out of promoting tax avoidance as
perfectly reasonable.</hs_Para>

what is a “reasonable course of action” is heavily
dependent on a subjective view of the role of taxation in society.
Whatever else it is, it is not an objective test at all. The point is
surely that the GAAR advisory panel has been inserted only as a filter,
in order to give the tax avoidance industry a veto on which of its
practices shall be called to account. That is clearly prejudicial and
indefensible. If City lawyers employed in defending corporate tax abuse
are asked whether it is reasonable to hold the view that an arrangement
is a “reasonable course of action”, it is a virtual
certainty that, except in the most egregious cases, they will agree
that it is—at which point many highly controversial and
artificial devices will not even get near an independent judge in a
court. For that reason alone, I believe that the GAAR should be thrown
out, although it has other serious flaws.</hs_Para>

other problems with the GAAR. For the reasons given, it is far too
narrowly drawn, tackling only the most aggressive forms of tax
avoidance. It would not, for example, tackle Google or
Amazon—which have had enormous publicity over the last weeks and
months—because the channelling of profits from genuine sales
through tax havens would still be permitted. That is just one example.
The implication—dare I say it one that was probably intended by

of the GAAR, the burden of proof that an arrangement is abusive has

improvement I mentioned at the beginning, the net accumulated effect of
all these flaws makes it reasonable to argue that

everything else is somehow okay and everything else goes. The other is
the outrageous fact that HMRC cannot commence GAAR action on its own

alternative is the general anti-tax avoidance principle—the

tax avoidance is currently estimated to cost  this country and
its other taxpayers £25 billion or up to £25
billion—I know the figure is much disputed, but it is certainly
a very substantial sum. It would be significantly reduced so that many

more money would be available to help promote jobs, which the
Government want, and economic
recovery.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041768000601" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0003.htm#13041768000601">Secondly,
to deal with the point raised by the hon. Member for Cities of London
and Westminster (Mark Field), the UK tax system would be made
considerably more certain if HMRC were for a small sum to provide prior

go down this route, whether it be a general anti-avoidance rule or on

must be done hand in glove with a proper pre-clearance process. It
needs to be a swift process and it may be that a fee is to be paid as
well, but it must be done on the basis that before any new scheme is
marketed it must get the thumbs up from HMRC that it is a legitimate
one. That would provide a sensible way forward taking into account the

this before, but I have concerns about Parliament agreeing
overwhelmingly with a principle that effectively says, “We as a
Parliament, even with all the specialist advice we get, cannot draft
the law sufficiently well to leave our taxpayers to try to apply and
follow it, and leave HMRC and the courts to determine whether that is
the case.” The proposals of the Government and of the right hon.
Member for Oldham West and Royton 
<?notus-xml column=417?>(Mr Meacher) would in effect create a power for HMRC to say,
“While the law actually says that, what we really meant was
something a little bit different, so while the taxpayer has complied
with the letter of the law, they have not complied with the letter of
the law as we wish it had been written.”</hs_Para>

real power for Parliament to give away. We are saying to an executive
agency of the state, “Your job is no longer to apply the law;
your job is to rewrite it as you wish it had been written by Parliament
in the first place.” I think we should be very careful before
going taking such a line. We need to know exactly what we are doing and
we need to be happy with setting that principle. If the Government
tried to apply such a principle to criminal justice law, we could end
up arresting people for something that was not a legal offence but we
wished had been a criminal offence. If we applied it to immigration
law, for example, there would be howls of outrage saying that the state
had gone mad with excessive power, and that it was the end of the rule

behave.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041768000617" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0003.htm#13041768000617"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mark Field" PimsId="3229" UID="13041768001362" xid="198" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0003.htm#13041768001362">Mark

should be clear about the principle of what we are doing. We are saying

If we are to pursue that line, we must be certain that safeguards are
in place so that we do not see—metaphorically, of
course—tax inspectors turning up with baseball bats, banging
down the door of the taxpayer and saying “Give us money or
else.” The “or else” would mean, of course, HMRC
making the assessment and taking the money in any event, and the other
party having to go through expensive court proceedings to try to get it
back. I have worked with many tax inspectors, and clearly I do not
think that any of them would literally pick up a baseball bat, but
there is a risk that in any difficult situation in which there is some
doubt about the application of the law, tax inspectors will start
writing letters saying, “Unless you agree with my analysis, I
reserve the right to apply the general anti-abuse rule, in which
case”—effectively—“you will be in deep

think it would be very generous of Members to assume that, in all
circumstances and for ever, HMRC would apply this power only to the
largest, most abusive and most complicated taxpayers. I suspect that,
in the experience of most Members, the Revenue has at times been a
little weaker when tackling the very large taxpayers with very big
pockets, and a little stronger when tackling those who are a bit
smaller and a bit less sophisticated, and who may not be able to fight
back as effectively. There is a real risk here. If we give the Revenue
a power amounting to complete discretion in regard to whether it
applies this rule to individual taxpayers, what is to prevent a large
organisation from buying its tax inspector a nice lunch, and an
application to apply the rule perhaps never actually being
made?</hs_Para>

suggesting that that would ever happen. I have certainly never known
such things to happen; tax inspectors are usually very law-abiding, and
very committed to their role. However, there have been instances in
which we as a Parliament have been concerned that the Revenue has not
treated the largest and the smallest taxpayers equally. In this
instance, we are giving the Revenue a discretionary power, and allowing
it to choose when to try to use it. Are we sure that the Revenue will
use that power against the people against whom we think it should be
used, and not against our constituents who have not done anything
particularly
wrong?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041768000627" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0003.htm#13041768000627">It
has been suggested that we are introducing too many safeguards, and
questions have just been asked as to why we are imposing the burden of
proof on the Revenue rather than on the taxpayer, as in every other
situation. This is plainly not a normal piece of tax law. We are
saying, “You may have complied with the law but we still think
that you are in the wrong, so we will retrospectively pretend that the
law said something different from what it actually said.” In
such circumstances it must be right for the Revenue to have a duty to
demonstrate that that is appropriate, rather than saying to the
taxpayer, “You must prove somehow that you 
<?notus-xml column=419?>acted within a law that had not actually been published.” That
would be nonsensical. It would be equally
nonsensical to make the penalties for contravening the GAAR higher than
the penalties for contravening the published law. If I flout the law
and am defeated in my claim on the basis on the published law, I will
rightly be subject to penalties, but for me to be subject to higher
penalties when I have not actually broken the published law, which I
can read, would certainly be
nonsense.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041768000628" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0003.htm#13041768000628">I

are many innocent ways of trying to reduce a tax bill. It is possible
to make a pension contribution rather than taking income as taxed
earnings. I do not think any of us would object to that. The law
clearly identifies it as a choice that we can all make. The owner of a
company can choose whether to take a dividend, a salary or a bonus, or
whether to leave the cash in the company and to be taxed on a capital
gain when he leaves. I do not think many of us would say that someone
who chose not to take a bonus in the year in which he sold his company
but instead to allow the cash to be deemed a capital gain in order to
secure a lower tax rate would be perpetrating an outrageously
aggressive tax abuse arrangement of the kind that we should prevent by
rewriting the law. We must be careful not to allow the Revenue to apply
this power to every piece of innocent, sensible tax planning, when the
only fallback will be the definition of a reasonable use of the
rules.</hs_Para>

ought to have said that something different, and if it turns out that
we have got it slightly wrong, we should amend the law. I accept that
we have been doing that in various situations for the last God knows
how many years, and have ended up with a hugely complex tax code. Every
time we build in more complexity, we create more loopholes, and then we
have to create even more complex rules to try to close those
loopholes—and then we create more and more. Perhaps the answer
is to have much shorter, simpler tax codes. I hope that, once the
Government have put the GAAR on to the statute book—as I fully

about the principle before. I think we must accept that the House has
concluded that the only way of tackling the problem of excessive
outrageous tax avoidance is to risk the principle of the reading of the
rule of law, and to be satisfied that a relatively minor version is
what is needed to tackle tax avoidance. I am not sure I would have come
to the same conclusion. The previous Government looked at a general
anti-avoidance rule about a decade ago, and having consulted for quite
a while and made various drafts, they decided not to

that this is going to happen, I am trying to find a way to ensure that
the provision cannot be abused and used against our small and
medium-sized taxpayers. There are precedents in the tax system for
certain rules applying only to certain sizes of taxpayer. The transfer
pricing rules apply only to large corporates, unless the Revenue gives
separate direction. I am not sure it has ever given a direction to
apply transfer pricing rules to small or even medium-sized companies;
perhaps the Minister has the data somewhere and can find some
inspiration as to how many times that has happened in the 10 years or
so since those rules have been in place. It is not unusual for us to
say that actually, some rules are so complex and burdensome that we
will focus them on the largest and most sophisticated taxpayers, and
not apply them to small
ones.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041768000640" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0003.htm#13041768000640">Ironically,
transfer pricing rules are the exact rules we have in place to tackle
the abuse by Starbucks, Google or whichever companies the right hon.
Member for Oldham West and Royton mentioned. We have the power to
restate the pricing of transactions exactly to stop that kind of abuse.
However, I am not convinced that a general anti-avoidance rule can
prevent people from choosing to put too much profit in one territory,
rather than another. I am not sure that there is some kind of
artificial arrangement or step that would work. I can see that there
could be some complicated corporate legal structure to avoid taxation
of a transaction that ought to be taxed, and which the right hon.
Gentleman’s new clause might get to. However, I am not sure we
can do that by saying, “We think more profit should have been
reported in the UK than actually was.” I suspect there would be
nothing artificial to trigger the arrangement in that situation, so I
am not sure that even his drafting of the rule would catch much of the
outrageous avoidance he seeks to catch. We have to use the transfer
pricing provision and various other measures to get
there.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041768000641" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0003.htm#13041768000641">The
principle I have tried to set out in my amendments is that the Revenue
can apply the provision only if the tax at stake is a certain amount. I
am consciously trying to avoid taxpayers then having a series of
schemes that slip under the de minimis. I tried to include a provision
establishing that we should test this by aggregating all the schemes in
place in a tax year, or when looking at the whole benefit over the life
of the scheme, in order to prevent that kind of situation from
happening. I am not sure whether the Minister will be inclined to
accept this principle. I ask him when he responds to set out exactly
what schemes the Government are after, and when they think the Revenue
should use this provision. Is it to be used only against the most
aggressive and complex schemes that have been designed purely to
exploit loopholes, and not intended to be used for routine, grey-area
inquiries where there is some uncertainty, or where there has been some
choice in how to take various proceeds out of a transaction? A lot of
people are concerned that this power will be stretched and used beyond
the intention of the Government, for things we could not possibly
intend to use it for. Given the Bill’s drafting, it is very hard
to be confident that the Revenue 
<?notus-xml column=422?>would not seek to do that in any situation. The Bill can be read in two
ways: as not applying to very much at all, or applying to nearly
everything.</hs_Para>

couple of questions for the Minister on the Bill’s drafting. A
lot of anti-avoidance rules refer to the question whether a person
enters into an arrangement to secure a tax advantage for themselves or
for a connected person, be it another member of the group of companies,
or a relative. The “or another related person” principle
is not written into the Bill. I am not sure whether that is an
oversight, or whether that is the case because the Government think it
unnecessary. Perhaps the Minister can answer that
question.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041768000643" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0003.htm#13041768000643">I
am also a little intrigued by the references in clause 209
to priority rules, which include a tax treaty. My understanding of the
law is that an international tax treaty trumps all domestic
legislation, and that it is not possible for us to legislate to
overrule a tax treaty. However, that appears to be what we are trying
to do here. Perhaps the Minister could explain how he thinks that will
work. This would appear to be a weakness of the
system.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041768000644" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0003.htm#13041768000644">Overall,
I am resigned to the fact that at some stage after passing the Bill, we
are going to abandon the principle of applying the rule of law as
written, and accept the fact that an agency of the state can rewrite it
to suit itself, and the taxpayer has to fight their way through the
courts. I am trying to ensure that this provision is used only for the
things that we really intend to use it for, and that it does not become
a broad, baseball-bat approach to tax compliance, which we would all
hate to see. I hope the Minister can deal with some of those
concerns.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-04-17?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_04_17_PT_1/C3776EA28410FB808850EF8D90176E34BBE53543" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="17 April 2013">Wednesday

before Second Reading and just two days before we consider the
GAAR-related clauses in the Bill this evening. It is clearly important

Those are without doubt notable sums of money, but let us remind

It is tax that HMRC has been unable to collect, so it will always be an
estimate. I use the HMRC figure because it is the minimum—it is
what it believes and it is a conservative estimate. The Tax Justice
Network calculates the gap at £120 billion. Whatever the actual

avoidance that does not fall within its remit, making it even harder to

developing countries at £1 billion, which one would think would
be enough, ActionAid believed it could be as high as £4 billion

experienced economic hardship. She managed to find a part-time job but
she works unsociable hours. Her benefits, which acted as a safety net
to allow her to live, have now also been cut. Now she has been unfairly
affected by the Government’s pension reforms; she was born in
October ’53, so she will receive less pension than her two best
friends, who were born in March that year. Despite having started work
when she was 16 and 
<?notus-xml column=435?>having paid her share of taxes ever since, she cannot plan for her

exist that the Government’s proposed GAAR is too narrow and that
they have failed to clarify that it will not cover most of the
tax-avoidance activity undertaken by multinational corporations about
which the general public are so concerned. HMRC must have the capacity
and resources it requires to tackle tax avoidance properly. The
Government are undermining its ability to do so with the budget cuts of
over £2 billion in this Parliament, leading to 10,000
job losses. While we all agree that making genuine efficiencies is
important, there has to be a limit to its capacity to do more with

these tough times, when the Government are cutting spending and raising

must put an end to the era of tax secrecy, because the reason some

It is clearly unfair and further undermines companies that do pay their
tax, expecting a level playing field. Over the Easter recess, I visited
many small and medium-sized companies, and time and again they talked
about no growth in the economy, low demand, and larger businesses
avoiding paying their taxes while they were expected to pay theirs, and
on time. Sometimes, yes, there will be good reasons why companies pay
little tax. Some companies invest large sums in research and
development, assets and infrastructure, and we should, and do,
celebrate and welcome that. However, we also need to know when

O’Donnell:</Member></B> I am glad that the Minister shakes her
head and I give her credit for much of the good work that she has done
in office. However, it is time for action. I repeatedly asked the
Secretary of State, when she appeared before the Select Committee,
whether she would act and whether she was pressing the Treasury for
more transparency. She said that it really was not a matter for her; it
was a matter for the Treasury—but it absolutely is a matter for
the Department for International Development and for the Secretary of
State and her Ministers to address this issue. The people in those
developing countries have as much right as people in this country to be
outraged, but unless they have access to the information about whether
tax has been paid, they will not be able to feel that sense of outrage.
I hope that we will see some movement on that
issue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041768000749" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0003.htm#13041768000749">If
we are ever to see a situation in which aid does not have to be stuck
at 0.7%, as I am sure developing countries and many of us want, it will
be by ensuring that tax is paid. We have had estimates from the OECD,

opening remarks, that developing countries lose three times as much
money as they receive in aid. We have a chance now to do something not

McCabe:</Member></B> The Government repeatedly promise to crack down on
tax avoidance. Of course, I welcome any efforts in that direction, but
as my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne North (Catherine
McKinnell) pointed out, the prospect of between £60
million and £85 million projected extra revenue against a tax
gap of £32.2 billion is hardly the stuff of ground-breaking
flagship policies. I am curious to know just who will be pursued under
the Government’s plans. As we heard, GAAR will be targeted at
abusive avoidance that has abnormal features, and on those involved in
highly contrived tax avoidance. Does that mean that normal, low-key,
run-of-the-mill, common or garden tax avoidance is going to carry on as
normal, with very little activity directed at it at all? Like others,
it is not clear to me that GAAR is focused on the tax avoidance of the
multinational corporations we have heard so much about
lately.</hs_Para>

that the Government are planning to put tax avoidance on the agenda at
the G8 summit, but it would be better if we had a clear indication
tonight on what they intend to achieve. For example, I want to know
whether the Prime Minister plans to follow up Chancellor
Merkel’s concerns about the lack of monitoring of British
sovereign territories, which are increasingly used as tax havens. I
would love to know how a place such as Jersey became the world’s
largest exporter of bananas. Will the G8 be considering guideline
prices to help countries in the developing world? Will there be any
discussion on an international tax inspector operation to help the
countries that are being sucked dry by international lawyers,
accountants and financiers?</hs_Para>

least, the Government could announce that they are ending
tax secrecy by accepting amendment 3 and insisting that
multinational groups publish a simple, single figure for the amount of
corporation tax they pay in this country, instead of the current
arrangements where they parcel the tax paid in a variety of ways that
permits avoidance. The Government might also say that they intend to
take some action against law firms in this country who all too readily
set up shell companies, no questions asked, in the full knowledge that
they are aiding and abetting tax avoidance and other corrupt
practices.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041768000755" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0003.htm#13041768000755">The

Government publish details of their own tax affairs. Why not lead by
example? This is not France. We have nothing to fear here—I
think—unlike in France, where the man charged with fighting tax
evasion turns out to be a tax fraud himself. At least the French
President is now going to force his Ministers to publish details of
their tax affairs. Why does our Prime Minister not do the same? He said

and the consequences of worklessness or low-paid work, and we can all
see the cost of the Government’s policy for the poorest in our

the services they depend on. We can also see the consequences of cuts
to in-work benefits, no pay rises and inflation on those who used to
feel comfortably off.</hs_Para>

that there are only two ways to balance a budget: cutting expenditure
and increasing income. The Government’s cuts are harming not
only individuals and their communities, but the economy. Economists
tell us that in a recession increased social security spending has a
strong multiplier effect of about 1.6. Every £1 spent
on welfare is worth £1.60 to the national economy. When social
security is cut, the multiplier works in reverse, so £20 million
of social security cuts would depress the economy by £32
million. A <I>Financial Times </I>study this week showed that cuts in
social security payments would take £19 billion out of the
economy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041768000762" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0003.htm#13041768000762">It
is not just social security spending. We know that the low-paid spend
more of their income, so less money in a community means more jobs
lost, which means more people on benefits and more jobs lost—a
downward spiral. The only way to reverse the spiral is to grow the
economy by investing in properly paid jobs, so that people are not
dependent on social security, but instead are paying into the coffers.
So how do we increase national income and so reverse the cuts and have
that necessary investment? HMRC estimates that in 2010-11, £32.2
billion was lost to tax avoidance and evasion. Tax Research UK
estimates that the gap is £120 billion. Most experts believe
that the figure is somewhere between the two, but whichever it is, it
is a heck of a lot of money. Just think what a difference it would
make.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041768000763" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0003.htm#13041768000763">The
tax gap comprises three areas: tax avoidance, where people and
businesses minimise their tax bills without deliberate deception, but
contrary to the spirit of the law; tax evasion, where there is
deliberate non-payment and underpayment of taxes by making false
declarations, which also includes error and neglect; and 
<?notus-xml column=441?>late or non-payment of tax. The closure of tax offices, cuts of
£2 billion to HMRC’s budget and the loss of 10,000 jobs
will not help to close that tax gap.</hs_Para>

to learn that more staff are employed to administer cuts to child
benefit than to tackle tax avoidance and evasion. Twenty million calls
to the HMRC in 2011-12 were not answered. The estimated cost of these
calls was £33 million and the value of customers’ time
wasted was £103 million. How can we run a system that costs
businesses so much? How can it be right that trying to talk to people
about paying tax costs industry so many millions of pounds? Tax
collection is a service that earns money, but the Government are

Government reckon that the general anti-abuse rule will result in the
collection of an additional £60 million. On the
lowest estimate, that still leaves £32.1 billion of tax not

business investment. It will attack only those schemes that are the

few scenarios on the Minister to see whether GAAR will tackle them.
Would it catch those earning more than £150,000 who brought
forward their payment so that they paid only the 40% rate in 2010, and
those same people who have delayed their income till after this April
so that they pay only the 45% rate? The Government have told us that
they dropped the rate to 45% because people earning more than
£150,000 had found ways to avoid paying the tax. We do not yet
know how much the 50% rate earned in its only full year of
implementation, but the HMRC thinks it will be £1
billion. That aside, will GAAR close the loopholes that allow people to
avoid paying tax that morally they owe?</hs_Para>

employing agency and temporary staff and to take them on properly on
the payroll. The company told me that some employees did not want to be
employed properly, because they had set themselves up as businesses
registered in the Isle of Man, thereby avoiding the tax that the rest
of us pay. Will the general anti-abuse rule capture those workers? Will
GAAR prevent the travesty of Starbucks, Amazon, Google and all the
others that make such vast profits in this country—profits from
people who do pay their taxes—from avoiding paying the tax that
they should be paying to our Exchequer? If GAAR will not catch them, as
seems to be the case, I hope that the Government will tell me what they
will do to capture those businesses.</hs_Para>

blaming the poor, the Government need to do much more to tackle the
rich who are not playing their part. The vast majority of ordinary
people pay their taxes. They do not employ accountants to maximise
their incomes. The Government need to do far more  to close the
tax gap, because if they did, that would go  a heck of a long
way towards closing the deficit. A “sitting on your

along to my local VAT office. The VAT officials there told me that they
needed more staff and every extra member of staff collected five times
more than their own salary, and that was just for VAT. I therefore
wrote to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and said, “We just need
more staff in our VAT offices. There would be a net benefit to the
Treasury because all the new members of staff would collect more than
their salaries.” I got a letter back from an official—not
from the Chancellor—that said, “We are trying to cut
costs by reducing staffing,” which is utterly illogical.
Reducing staffing means a net loss to the Treasury, not a net gain, and

interesting to hear the hon. Member for Redcar (Ian Swales), who seems

That would concentrate a few minds, and I think that is what we should
do, as I think it is criminal for people to rip off the public purse as
they do to the detriment of us all. The great majority of my

We would not need to invent schemes that seem designed to fail. If they
were not designed to fail, I am sure the Minister would not be
frightened of the amendment proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for
Newcastle upon Tyne North (Catherine McKinnell) to have a review in two
years’ time. If the scheme were to be successful, the review
would show its success; if we collected half of what had been evaded
through the Government’s proposed scheme—£16.5
billion or whatever, amounting to 4p on the standard rate of income
tax—the review would approve of what the Government had done. If
the Government refuse to accept the amendment, they are obviously
nervous that their scheme will not be a success. I suspect that they
have brought something up that is designed to fail and will help the

believe that the Government are genuinely concerned about these
matters. If they were, they would take effective action, ensure that it
happened through stronger laws and possibly prison sentences for those
who break these laws, and collect billions more in taxes. The sort of
figures described by Richard Murphy and others are
enormous—equivalent to each year’s deficit, about which
the Government say they are so concerned. They are cutting spending to
solve their deficit problems, but the real problem is not
spending—it is that their revenue is too low because they are
failing to collect all the due taxes. If the Government were successful
in enforcing tax laws so that all due taxes were paid, there would not
even be a deficit. They would have enough money to cover it. Let us see
the Government take effective action: only then will I take them
seriously. Until that time, I shall continue to say what I have said

arising from last year’s debate on the Finance
Bill—particularly about the controlled foreign companies
regulations and what happened to them. We are often accused of tabling
similar amendments to those tabled before, and we did indeed table
amendments asking for a review of the impact of those regulations,
particularly on developing countries. We were told that the amendments
were not needed because the Government would, of course, constantly
review these matters. We were told that asking for a specific review
would somehow put extra onus on civil servants and that we should
simply have trust in what would
happen.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041770000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0003.htm#13041770000019">On
that basis, I ask the Minister—perhaps in his reply now or at
some later time—to tell us whether that review has indeed been
carried out and what information is already available to assure us that
the reassurances given previously have been brought into play.
Otherwise, we are simply being told that we are asking for unnecessary
reviews and that all will be done. Let us see if it is done, as many

changes would be.</hs_Para>

commissioned Graham Aaronson QC to lead a study group. I pay
tribute to the work undertaken by him and by other members of the

anti-abuse rule to tackle abusive avoidance schemes that were not being

Governments have considered general anti-avoidance rules, but their

constitutes tax avoidance and one that constitutes legitimate tax
planning. If I may use the phrase employed by my hon. Friend the Member

some of the claims that we have heard tonight, HMRC has a good record
in dealing with tax avoidance when it occurs. It has been very
successful in taking taxpayers to court, and has won a great many
cases, especially in recent months. However, we must ensure that we do
not encounter the difficulty posed by a broadly based general
anti-avoidance rule, namely that taxpayers and their advisers would
have to consider how the rule might operate in a large number of
circumstances in which it might be applied. That would not just stop
avoidance where it existed, but cast a long shadow on legitimate
arrangements.</hs_Para>

believe that the general anti-abuse rule proposed by the Aaronson group
strikes the right balance between dealing with aggressive, egregious,
abusive tax avoidance and not creating uncertainty. It targets only
avoidance schemes that are clearly abusive. By “abusive
schemes”, we mean schemes that can be seen from the outset to be
simply highly contrived and artificial arrangements designed to enable
people to get around the tax law and avoid paying tax. Those who do
become involved with such schemes know very well what they are doing.
If the general anti-abuse rule that we are considering today makes them
think again and deters them from engaging in such avoidance, I for one
will consider that to be a good
outcome.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041770000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0003.htm#13041770000029">We

it is very broad-based and includes representatives from various
organisations. Although it has taken a little longer than we might have
hoped, I congratulate and thank the panel for its work. It has received
an excellent response and will provide much help to taxpayers wanting
to know where they stand. For example, on the question of what is
contrived and what is abusive—a point raised in the

out the overall principles and descriptions, contains a

specific cases.</hs_Para>

GAAR’s operation centrally, so that all cases and potential
cases will be scrutinised and recorded. The deterrent effect, which we
will see immediately, will be important, but we must also remember the
issues of getting the tax returns in and being able to make a full
assessment of the implications. We believe that a two-year period would
not be practical for a general evaluation. It will take longer properly

Amendment 7 asks the Government to carry out an impact assessment on

points is that as a matter of practicality it is difficult for HMRC to
perform the roles required by the amendments as they require
assessments not of our tax rules but of the tax rules of developing
countries. That takes us outside what HMRC can realistically do. The
point was raised that amendment 7 largely repeats the debate we had

they will face the tough but plain question, “Is it
reasonable?” That is a question that we all understand. Those
who think about using the schemes will all understand it and, I hope,
those who create the schemes will come to understand it. The GAAR will

Banks</B> (Ochil and South Perthshire) (Lab):</Member> I am pleased to
have secured this debate on an important issue in my constituency and
in the context of the whole UK. I am delighted to see the Minister here
tonight. Given her previous position on post office franchising, to
which I will return in greater detail, her remarks will be eagerly
awaited by many up and down the
country.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041770001075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0004.htm#13041770001075">I
asked for this debate because I am very concerned about the proposed
franchising of Alloa Crown post office and the changes that that will
lead to, including the removal of the post office from its current
central location. I am also firmly of the belief that the franchising
of the Crown post office in Alloa will lead to the loss of staff and
services—in time, perhaps even to the loss of the Crown post
office in its
entirety.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041770001076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0004.htm#13041770001076">The
Crown post office provides a dedicated specialist service to my
constituents and is seen by many, including myself, as representing a
vital part of the community. It is an important resource to small
businesses in the area, which rely heavily on its services.
Furthermore, its current central location is ideal and easily
accessible for the majority of
residents.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041770001077" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0004.htm#13041770001077">On
the issue of location, I believe that to constitute part of the town
centre in Alloa, a building has to be in the high street, Mar street,
Primrose street, Mill street, Shillinghill or Drysdale street; those
will not be familiar to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, but if you ever want to
come to Alloa, you will be very welcome. That is where the current post
office is located, so it acts as a feeder and magnet to the town
centre, benefiting the wider community and economic activity in the
town centre. No one but Post Office Ltd and the Minister wants that to
change, so why will the Minister not listen to the voices of the people
of Alloa and
Clackmannanshire?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041770001078" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0004.htm#13041770001078">To
put it bluntly, Alloa requires a strong local Crown post office in a
central location to provide the services that its residents need. We
are lucky enough to have that currently, and we want to keep it. The
move to change the set-up in Alloa has its roots in the Postal Services
Act 2011, which I opposed as a shadow Minister in this place and in
Committee. Now, after I have fought the Minister’s predecessor,
the right hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr Davey), with his
overzealous approach, the Minister, with her history, is left to pick
up the pieces and deliver his
plans.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041770001079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0004.htm#13041770001079">The
Minister will argue against this, I am sure, but—mark my
words—I have absolutely no doubt that franchising will, over
time, result in a significant reduction of the services offered by the
post office. As a result, it will also limit access to important
financial services to those on low incomes, who cannot get a bank
account with a high street bank, and reduced services mean reduced
staffing
levels.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041770001080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0004.htm#13041770001080">The
franchising of Alloa Crown post office would also result in longer
queues and waiting times, as a post office franchised to a local
retailer would cease to be the core business of the outlet and,
frankly, would lead to people doing the business they currently place
with the  
<?notus-xml column=458?>post office in Alloa either elsewhere or with
different businesses altogether. Short-term queues will lead to
long-term decline, job losses and service
erosion.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041770001081" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0004.htm#13041770001081">This
represents the human cost that such a decision would entail. That is
why I am standing side by side with the staff in the post office in
Alloa in opposing these proposals. Moreover, if the franchisee were to
cease trading, as has been the case with many high street retailers,
the community could be at risk of losing its post office
entirely.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13041770001082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0004.htm#13041770001082">I recently
held a very well-attended and—shall we say?—vibrant
meeting in Alloa to discuss the post office plans. Indeed, the
Government were invited to send a Minister to defend their position,
but sadly we are still waiting for a response. I was, however,
delighted that my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh South (Ian
Murray), the shadow Minister for postal affairs, was prepared to visit
Alloa during the recess to add his knowledge and support to the
campaign to keep Alloa Crown post office in its current location and
unfranchised. I thank Connie Hewitt and Tom Moran from Post Office Ltd
for coming along and putting their side forward, but I have to say that
their arguments did nothing to change the views of my constituents who
were present and vocal on the night. I need to say to them again
tonight, and to the Minister, “Don’t try  to
change our minds—change
yours.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041770001083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0004.htm#13041770001083">At
the public meeting, we heard about windows of opportunity for
expressions of interest and thereafter consultation processes, but I
must say to the Minister that no one has faith in her consultation
processes, and if it gets that far people believe that it will be a
done deal; indeed, some people believe that now. We heard Post Office
Ltd claim that it costs £1.43 in spending for every £1 of
revenue at Alloa post office, but if the Minister had been in Alloa
that night she would have heard that claim disputed by staff of the
post office who have accessed the same cost build-up figures. On top of
this, Post Office Ltd is paying the staff in Alloa post office bonuses
for exceeding their performance targets. I have to say to the Minister
that these are targets set by the Post Office, so what else can the
staff do other than out-perform them as they currently
are?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041770001084" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0004.htm#13041770001084">While
the staff of Alloa post office and I want to see the Post Office on a
long-term sustainable footing, I question the actions currently being
taken regarding franchising. While franchising may—although it
is not a given—lead to savings, it will do so only at the
expense of quality and services. This franchising proposal is a step
towards mutualisation of Post Office Ltd, but from my view in Alloa, it
looks more like mutilation.</hs_Para>

Government are failing by their own measure to live up to the words in
their own document, “Securing The Post Office Network In The
Digital Age”; failing to recognise that the post office is more
than a commercial entity and serves a distinct social purpose; and
failing to protect against closures through a policy of closure by
stealth. Proposals to franchise 70 Crown post offices throughout the
UK, including in Alloa, would represent a substantial reduction in
services by stealth while threatening the distinct social purpose of
the post office. It would appear that the post office is no longer the
front office for Government, as was once
claimed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041770001086" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0004.htm#13041770001086"><Member ContinuationText="Gregg McClymont" PimsId="5700" UID="13041770002170" xid="1040" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0004.htm#13041770002170"><B>Gregg
McClymont</B> (Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East)
(Lab):</Member> One of the 70 post offices across the UK which is
proposed to be franchised is 
<?notus-xml column=459?>Cumbernauld Crown post office. Cumbernauld is one of the largest towns
in Scotland, and the post office is in a central location in
Cumbernauld town centre. To echo my hon. Friend, there is no doubt that
wherever such a franchise was placed in a supermarket or a shop around
Cumbernauld town centre, the location would be poorer and the quality
of service would no doubt be diminished. Is this good enough when the
post office plays such a central role in our community, in
Alloa’s community, and in the communities across Scotland and
the
UK?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041770001087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0004.htm#13041770001087"><B><Member ContinuationText="Gordon Banks" PimsId="4743" UID="13041770002171" xid="911" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0004.htm#13041770002171">Gordon

the Department and occasionally walk, depending on the weather. My
motivation is certainly not as the hon. Gentleman suggests. I am keen
to make sure that the post office network is sustainable and am a
passionate believer in the importance of post offices as the hubs of
many of our communities. They play a vital role in our society. Despite
our differences of opinion on this issue, which I will come to, I
recognise that the hon. Gentleman is standing up for and championing an
issue about which his constituents care deeply and it is right that we
discuss such matters in this House. I am very happy to have the

hon. Gentleman has eloquently set out his concerns and we have also
heard an intervention by my parliamentary neighbour, the hon. Member
for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East (Gregg McClymont), who
is concerned about a similar issue in Cumbernauld. I fully recognise
the concerns that they and all our constituents have about any changes

is true to say that, as a constituency MP and as a candidate, I
campaigned vigorously against those closure programmes under the

in that process of determining how those decisions will ultimately be

addressing the specific issues that have been raised about the Post
Office’s proposals to franchise 70 Crown post offices
and to merge or relocate a small number of other Crown branches, it is
essential to set them in their wider context. The 2010 spending review
after the last election saw a funding package of
£1.34 billion, up to 2015, earmarked for significant
investment in the post office network. That funding provides for
the network and Crown transformation programmes, and for
investment more widely across the post office network, together with
ongoing support of the many non-commercial branches that fulfil an
important social and economic role in the communities they serve.
Clearly, this support is particularly relevant in Scotland in view of
its geography and demographic
spread.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041770001108" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/debtext/130417-0004.htm#13041770001108">Our
funding package also requires Post Office Ltd to continue to maintain a
network of at least 11,500 branches and to comply fully with
the access criteria, set by the Government in 2007, with no programme
of closures. Significant elements of the Government funding are
supporting investment in and improvements to the directly owned and
managed Crown office segment of the network, 
<?notus-xml column=462?>with £70 million being spent on modernising some 300
Crown branches and investing in new technology in town centre and high

Labour Government, we provided more than £3.3 billion in support
of the post office network and introduced an annual £150 million
subsidy to support otherwise loss-making post offices in urban and
rural areas. Her own Government’s report recognises the social

Swinson:</Member></B> I absolutely recognise that need, and I also
think that there will always be some need for Government subsidy for
those types of offices where they cannot become commercially viable,
but where the service provided is of such benefit to those particular
locations that it makes sense for the Government to pay for it.
However, I question whether that type of argument should be made for
city centre busy post offices. I think any reasonable person would
recognise that they ought to at least be able to break even, rather
than incur the kind of losses that are currently happening. That is why
we have, in the post office strategy, a determination to ensure that we
can get the Crown office network on to a much more sustainable
footing.</hs_Para>

the losses of the post office network as a whole come from those 373
Crown branches. There are 11,818 post offices, and a third of the

to the House that no business can continue with that kind of situation,

the broader strategy for eliminating unsustainable losses and achieving
break-even for the Crown network by 2015, the Post Office has
identified 70 branches where it sees no prospect of eliminating the
losses at 
<?notus-xml column=463?>local level under the current operating cost structure. The precise
reasons vary from location to location, but commonly include factors
such as high property costs and sub-optimal location, which means that
they are not able to attract increased custom and business. As the hon.

for the franchises tends to be lower. The average queue length in Crown

my constituency, Auchinairn, Killermont, Courthill, Westerton and
Kessington lost their post offices, and Alloa was not exempt from the

pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Howarth. Before I start
the debate, I should apologise for being unable to stay for the entire
afternoon. The debate was originally scheduled for 9.30 this morning,
but owing to the funeral of Baroness Thatcher, the business of the
House begins at 2.30 this afternoon, as hon. Members are aware.
However, because I have had a meeting, in Parliament, with two
constituents arranged since January and because those constituents had
purchased their rail tickets in advance, I could not put them off, so I
hope that you, Mr Howarth, the Minister, the shadow Minister, my hon.
Friend the Member for Makerfield (Yvonne Fovargue), and all other
colleagues present will forgive me for leaving early in what I hope
they agree are exceptional

is a pleasure to open this debate on a subject that at first glance
might seem rather complex and perhaps a little esoteric, but what we
are about to debate is very far from that. In fact, it is fundamental
to the future of so many people, especially young people, who are
desperate for work, education or training—not just in Yorkshire
and the Humber, but throughout the country. I am absolutely certain of
that. Why did I choose such a seemingly long title for the debate, as

felt that it was not possible to reduce the title of the debate any

might be helpful to hon. Members if I first remind them of the
background to bus services in England outside
London<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T14:32:28"></hs_TimeCode>. In
October 1986, the late Baroness Thatcher’s Conservative
Government first deregulated bus services, allowing private contractors
to run registered routes commercially and in competition with one
another, and to tender for registered routes that were deemed to be
unprofitable and were therefore subsidised by local ratepayers, later
to become council tax payers of course. Local authorities were no
longer allowed to run their own not-for-profit bus services, so the
famous Sheffield buses, which in the mid-’80s cost as little as
2p per journey across the city, were
doomed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T14:33:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041741000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0001.htm#13041741000010">Contrary
to popular belief at the time, I understand that many business rate
payers in the centre of Sheffield were angry, because although their
rates were relatively high, the cheapness of bus fares from the
outlying 
<?notus-xml column=76?>villages and suburbs of the great city of Sheffield meant that city
centre shops were always busy and profitable for their owners. Once the
subsidies stopped and the routes became commercialised, the fares went
up sharply, often putting them beyond the reach of many in the city and
its outlying areas. A measure that was intended to lower bus fares
through competition increased them massively in some
cases<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T14:33:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041741000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0001.htm#13041741000011"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T14:33:51"></hs_TimeCode><Member ContinuationText="Angela Smith" PimsId="4808" UID="13041741000188" xid="886" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0001.htm#13041741000188"><B>Angela

Hamilton:</Member></B> I thank my hon. Friend for that important
intervention. I remember clearly that in October 1986 the route that I
used to travel from my then home in Armley, Leeds, to the city centre
was via the Armley gyratory—a massive roundabout and huge
junction on the western side of Leeds. Up to that point in October
1986, the traffic queue was not that great at 8.30 in the morning, but
I remember that, immediately following deregulation, the queues
trebled. Everyone had got on the buses, but they suddenly became much
more expensive. That had been predicted by the Labour Opposition and by
the local authority, of which I was about to become a
member<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T14:34:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041741000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0001.htm#13041741000013">In
my city of Leeds, the former City and the former West Yorkshire bus
services became a commercial company—some may recall that it was
called Yorkshire Rider—and it made a small number of former
public servants very wealthy as they became managers of a cash-rich
commercial service mandatorily divorced from the public service that
they once received a salary to operate. Other commercial operators
entered the field, but were soon swallowed up by Yorkshire Rider, which
did not like the competition. Eventually, of course, Yorkshire Rider
itself was swallowed up by an even larger concern, so that today there
is a virtual monopoly in Leeds, with First Bus operating almost all
commercial bus services not just in Leeds, but in Bradford, Wakefield
and the surrounding districts of West Yorkshire. What was once a public
service had become a cash generator, and the travelling public, so
dependent on buses, were left to pay the cost of ever-increasing fares,
caused by the need to make a profit and the sharply rising fuel prices
that added to the
misery<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T14:35:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041741000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0001.htm#13041741000014">I
shall spare my colleagues the history of the fiasco of the Leeds
Supertram during the past 10 years. Suffice it to say that the lack of
any alternative public transport to the bus network in Leeds has made
buses even more critical for non-car owners. The Labour Government,
however, tried to do something for bus passengers—I will refrain
from calling them customers—with the concept of quality bus
contracts. In government, Labour legislated to enable local authorities
to reverse bus deregulation in their area by introducing a quality
contract—in effect, a move to tendered bus
services.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041741000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0001.htm#13041741000015">Under<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T14:37:10"></hs_TimeCode>
a quality contract, the accountable transport authority sets the fares
and plans the network, while private operators bid to run the services.
That model exists in London, where deregulation of the bus network
never took place. A number of Labour-run integrated transport
authorities are consulting on introducing quality contracts for their
local bus services. This Government 
<?notus-xml column=77?>claim that they will not block transport authorities from pursuing
quality contracts, yet they are reforming bus funding in a way that
creates a financial disincentive for councils to go down that

Waterman, of the Rural Access to Learning Group, contacted me to tell
me what his group, which is concentrating on the connection between
transport in rural areas and access to learning, especially for young
people, is considering. He said that it is trying to promote a
wide-ranging discussion at national and local level on the future
development and funding of student transport in rural areas. Although
many parts of our region of Yorkshire and the Humber are highly
urbanised, it also has huge rural areas dotted with many villages where
huge numbers of residents, especially young people, find themselves
completely stranded without decent and affordable bus

told me about a female student who started an evening course that
finishes at 9 pm. She lives on a bus route, 3 miles from the college,
but the service has recently been reduced and the last bus now passes
her home at 8.15 pm. During the winter months, the student was
understandably nervous about having to walk home in the dark and,
having no access to a car, decided that she could not stay the course.
I am glad to say that Chris told me that the college made an exception
and funded taxi services for that student for that course at that time.
Not all students are that lucky. Many will have to ditch their courses
because they simply cannot get to and from college in time.

shall begin by speaking personally. When I first came to Sheffield as a
student in the late ’80s, bus fares were 2p across town, and
that was one of the deciding factors for choosing Sheffield over other
places. We were outraged in 1989 when fares increased to 10p, because
it put regular bus travel out of the reach for most of us. When I
studied, I was lucky to have a full grant—it was before tuition
fees were introduced—but the seemingly paltry increase in bus
fares meant that I was forced to walk most journeys, because I could
not afford to do
otherwise.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041741000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0001.htm#13041741000034">A<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T14:46:50"></hs_TimeCode>
student ticket in Sheffield is now 80p. I appreciate that for many of
us that does not seem like a lot of money, but students are now saddled
with massive debts, so 80p is a considerable investment. As I did, many
students choose not to travel by bus due to the cost, instead spending
the money on other essentials. During the day, that is fine, and in
fact I would probably encourage it, but at night, I am concerned. I
worry about the safety of students and young people forced to walk in
the dark across town or, as my hon. Friend said, a considerable
distance on rural lanes because they cannot afford a bus fare or there
is no bus for them to
catch.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041741000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0001.htm#13041741000035">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T14:48:05"></hs_TimeCode>
Sheffield and most towns, walking is an option, but the situation is
compounded if a young person has to travel any distance or be anywhere
at a specific time. If an apprentice has to be in work at a set time
for example, what are their options? Rely on friends and family for
lifts; own, insure and pay exorbitant fuel costs for a car; or risk
their life on a bike or scooter. Realistically, the only option is
catching the bus. On £2.65 an hour, a daily commute by bus
becomes a costly enterprise, and some young people I have spoken to
have decided not to take up apprenticeships due to the financial
burden, which horrifies me. They are turning down a future because they
cannot afford the transport to get
there.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041741000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0001.htm#13041741000036">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T14:48:40"></hs_TimeCode>
reality, is there even a bus that they can catch? Ministers promised
that cuts in funding would not lead to a loss of local bus services,
yet many communities have seen significant reductions in vital
services. Fares have risen on average by double the rate of inflation.
The Government have cut funding for local transport by 28% and direct
subsidies to support local bus services 
<?notus-xml column=80?>by a fifth. As a consequence, local authorities have
not been able to sustain the previous level of support for unprofitable
but socially necessary bus
services.</hs_Para><hs_ParaIndent UID="13041741000158" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0001.htm#13041741000158">Research<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T14:49:28"></hs_TimeCode>
has shown that one in five local council-supported bus services were
cut or reduced last year, and 41% of local authorities have reported
cuts to timetables. Where services have been protected, bus companies
have often increased fares to make up for the revenue lost through cuts
to subsidies. It is the most vulnerable who are most affected by the
loss of a local bus service, with 35% of the 5.2 billion journeys each
year in Britain made by those eligible for concessionary travel.
<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>Young people
have been particularly badly affected, with the loss of services and
the rising prices making it harder for them to take up

back.</hs_ParaIndent><hs_Para UID="13041741000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0001.htm#13041741000037">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T14:51:45"></hs_TimeCode>
Rotherham, we are trying to tackle the injustice for young people
head-on. The metropolitan borough council is actively pursuing ways to
increase young user representation, so that the transport services are
fit for purpose. As part of the last 11 million takeover day, when the
Youth Parliament runs Rotherham council, the young people particularly
wanted to address the matter of transport. Issues raised were primarily
about safety and security, the reliability of services, and
affordability. Recommendations were made for a more joined-up system,
with concessionary tickets on all forms of public transport and better
advertising of concessionary
fares.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041741000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0001.htm#13041741000038">Young<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T14:51:45"></hs_TimeCode>
people in Rotherham have been invited to attend a number of upcoming

police and the individual operators welcome young people’s
input. Rotherham council has appointed young people to its transport
liaison committee, and the Rotherham transport users group is actively
recruiting young people, as they are the people who aware of the
specific issues facing them. In Rotherham, we are trying to make the
bus companies apply the 70p fare for young people to through journeys.
Currently, if someone gets off one bus and takes another to complete
their trip, they are charged 70p for each part of the journey, which
often makes the cost prohibitive. Such schemes need to be adopted
across the country. Rotherham has shown that by including young people
in the decision-making process, change can
occur.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041741000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0001.htm#13041741000039">Finally<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T14:51:24"></hs_TimeCode>,
I urge the Government to consider Labour’s proposals to enable
transport authorities to improve local bus services through greater
regulatory powers over fares and routes, and to consider a new
statutory power for the Secretary of State to designate bus
deregulation exemption zones. Without those interventions, I am afraid
that the future for young people looks
bleak.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13041741000182" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0001.htm#13041741000182">2.51

position, but for many the choice is to catch a bus or to stay put and
not travel at all. The option of private transport still does not exist

the plethora of cuts announced by the coalition Government, it is often
the cuts least talked about that do the greatest damage. In 2010, the
Government cut by 28% the funding to councils for local transport and
removed the ring-fencing from funding passed to councils from the
Department for Communities and Local Government. In addition, the bus
service operators grant was cut by 20%. The combined cuts have resulted
in the removal of £500 million from support for bus services.
With that level of cuts, it is no surprise that many people who use bus
services believe that services have deteriorated in vast swathes of the
country. To make matters worse, the cost of catching a bus has
increased by double the rate of inflation in the past year
alone.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041741000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0001.htm#13041741000043">As

The problem exists not just in the rural south. My constituency is made

counties, as metropolitan areas can be made up of significant expanses

of west Yorkshire still have that status. It

I think that the figure has increased by 100%. The increase has been
far higher elsewhere in south Yorkshire, particularly in areas such as

South Yorkshire integrated transport authority is working closely with
the four youth councils in south Yorkshire, as my hon. Friend the
Member for Rotherham said. It is holding a young people’s bus
summit with 40 young people next week, on 27 April, in
Sheffield. The themes to be discussed, which I think she mentioned, are
affordability, accessibility, availability and acceptability, which is
an important and often overlooked point about bus services. That event
alone demonstrates just how important bus services are for young people
in south Yorkshire, an area which outsiders often forget is largely
rural or semi-rural, like large parts of the rest of
Yorkshire.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041741000051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0001.htm#13041741000051">However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T15:03:49"></hs_TimeCode>,
for our every success and step forward, there always seems to me to be
a retreat. Part of Barnsley council’s groundbreaking and
innovative approach was the Mi card, which, among other things, allowed
all under-18s free travel on buses in the borough. Unfortunately,
because of the council’s need to make savings, a charge of 30p
per journey now applies. That means that the very good principle that
we have extended to elderly people and those over 60 has been withdrawn
from a section of the population that, in my view, needs it more than
others, as they desperately need to find work and opportunities to
extend their education and
skills<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T15:04:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041741000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0001.htm#13041741000052">Although
the schemes and efforts of south Yorkshire local authorities are
welcome, they are often being put in place despite the Government, not
because of them, which is the key problem. The facts, which were
mentioned earlier, are that a third of bus journeys are made by people
who are eligible for a concessionary fare, and two thirds of all
journeys on public transport are made by bus. Those two statistics
alone show us why we need frequent and affordable bus services. It is
no good having a bus pass if there is no bus to catch, and it is no
good having a bus if it is too expensive to catch for those of us who
rely on buses. For young people, the latter point is
key.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041741000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0001.htm#13041741000053">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T15:05:27"></hs_TimeCode>
some Members may be aware—the Minister is well aware of what has
long been my position—I am big proponent of re-regulating the
buses. He was a member of the Local Transport Public Bill Committee
that discussed re-regulation. The Local Transport Act 2008 went some
way towards re-regulation, but the quality contracts on offer have not
particularly taken root, partly because of the risks involved in
integrated transport 
<?notus-xml column=84?>authorities wanting to take up the option, and also because of the
failure of the Government to underwrite some of those risks to get
beyond that first
hurdle<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T15:06:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041741000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0001.htm#13041741000054">Re-regulation
would give the rest of the country, particularly metropolitan areas
such as Sheffield, Barnsley and Leeds, what London already enjoys and
has never had taken away from it. However, the Government are
determined that any area that pursues a quality contract should be
excluded from better bus area funding. There is therefore not only an
unwillingness—I do not know whether it is ideological—to
support integrated transport authorities that want to develop quality
contracts, but a penalty for developing one. That is wrong and has put
many integrated transport authorities, such as the one serving my area,
in the impossible position of having to accept the terms and condition
placed on them by the Department for Transport to access any extra
funding.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041741000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0001.htm#13041741000055">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T15:07:34"></hs_TimeCode>

environmentally friendly, have full disabled access and are clean and
warm for the people using them. We all know that such services can play
a big role in helping local economies to grow and improve, not least

all, we need to recognise that if we fail our young people by not
providing them with the bus services they need, their general
opportunities through life will be curtailed. The damage done to young
people who cannot access the opportunities that they need when they are
16, 17 or 18—the limitation on their mobility at that
age—might have lifelong impacts. I am part of the generation who
suffered in the recessions of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Many
people of my generation have never fully recovered from the damage done
to them by the very high levels of unemployment in areas such as south

them opportunities, and saying, “You failed us.” I

my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Sarah Champion) said,
transport is less prominent and less talked about, but it is equally
important in the equation. Indeed, for many young people, the high cost
of transport is the biggest challenge of all. The UK Youth Parliament,
for example, voted to make “Make Public Transport Cheaper,
Better and Accessible to All” its priority campaign for 2012.
The Youth Select Committee, which is made up of young
people, chose transport as its first topic for inquiry. Therefore, it
is not only young people in Yorkshire and Humberside who see transport
as vital, but young people throughout the
country.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041741000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0001.htm#13041741000063">Some<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T15:11:19"></hs_TimeCode>
older people, such as myself, might be surprised by that, but it makes
perfect sense. Young people need to be able to get to their place of
work or college, and to get there in a cost-efficient and pleasant way.
I agree with my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T15:11:35"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Penistone and Stocksbridge (Angela
Smith)<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T15:11:26"></hs_TimeCode>about

you will forgive me, Mr Howarth, if I use an example from my
constituency. A constituent came to me because she was worried about
her sister, who had to make a journey of 11 miles to a sixth-form

choose between paying for a meal at lunch time or taking public
transport to college—there are, of course, no free school meals
in sixth-form colleges. That is not a decision any young person should
be forced to make.</hs_Para>

carried out a survey that found that 72% of students take a bus to

that distance there and back. The survey also found that 94% of
colleges believe that the abolition of the EMA has affected
students’ ability to travel to and from college. The cuts to bus

fares could make buses the mode of choice at an early age and lock in
patronage for the future and help to reduce car travel. That is why, at
the bus partnership forum in January, I asked the bus industry to
consider offering travel discounts to all people aged 18 and under, not
just those in education. A fares discount based on age seems far easier
to administer than one relying on proof of education. I have encouraged
the bus industry to do that because it is in its interest to identify
people who want to use the bus and lock them in for future use for the
rest of their lives. Potentially, they will be bus users for 50 or 60
years beyond their education time.</hs_Para>

enough, the legislation that regulates the bus industry, which we
inherited in 2010, does not require bus operators to offer any reduced
fares to young people. If Government intervened to enforce an
age limit for charging an adult fare or legislated to create a national
concessionary travel scheme for young people, local authorities would
be obliged to reimburse bus operators for any revenue forgone; thus a
financial burden would be imposed on local authorities, or, if that
were reimbursed to them, there would be a further significant burden on
the national taxpayer. In practice, bus fares are set at a commercial
level by the operators. In general, despite the fact that there is no
requirement to offer anyone below 18 a discount, operators offer free
travel to under-fives and a reduced fare to those up to 15 or 16,

Department for Transport carried out a survey of travel concession
authorities in 2012. Those that responded said that about 40% of
operators in their areas offered commercially discounted fares up to
the age of 15 and a further 30% offered discounted fares up to the age
of 18. Where operators offered concessions, they were mainly discounts
of between a third and half the adult single fare. About a fifth of
operators cut a quarter off the adult fare. That shows what an unfair
and confusing patchwork of fares is available to young people. For the
lucky minority, local bus operators will give a 50% discount to those
under 18, but young people with access to a local bus service run by
one of the 70% of bus operators who offer no discount to 16 to
19-year-olds are in an entirely different situation.</hs_Para>

a deregulated market, bus operators are in competition with each other,
and if they were to agree specific fares for young people, it could be
deemed anti-competitive. However, in principle, there seems to be
nothing to prevent several operators in an area offering discounts 
<?notus-xml column=89?>to young people as a percentage of the adult
commercial fare, whatever that may be. It will of course vary from
service to service. That approach would offer young people a deal that
is not universally available. There are areas where such an informal
arrangement is already in place. In Norfolk, for example, there
is a voluntary agreement between several bus operators to offer a
standard discount to young people.</hs_Para>

addition to such informal arrangements, a local authority can decide on
a discretionary basis to offer concessions to young people in its area.
That is solely a matter for the local authority and such an enhancement
would have to be funded locally. In Yorkshire and the Humber, all the
local authorities have some form of local travel assistance for young
people, and I am pleased about that. The integrated transport authority
areas of South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire, as well as the city of
York, issue travel cards that give young people discounted bus fares on
the services of several local bus operators. The most rural authorities
in the region, where there are fewer bus services, subscribe to the
Wheels 2 Work scheme, which allows young people to hire a bicycle or a
scooter for access to training and employment. In addition, all
jobcentres in the country can provide jobseekers with discretionary
support for travel costs, such as support for the cost of a
bus fare to attend a job
interview.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041741000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0001.htm#13041741000087"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T15:25:42"></hs_TimeCode>Therefore,
while there is some support for 16 to 19-year-olds with transport
costs, it is only ever offered on a commercial or discretionary basis,

“BUSFORUS” web portal created by the industry—an
initiative I welcome—has only further highlighted the disparity;
a look at the bus operators’ web portal suggests that they have
recognised that. We must do better for young people and give them more

to the use of buses to get to education, all local authorities have a
statutory duty to provide home-to-school travel where they consider it
necessary to secure a child’s attendance at school. Legislation

generally a bus. Where transport is considered necessary, it must be
provided free of charge. Transport must be free for those pupils
attending their nearest suitable school, 
<?notus-xml column=90?>where that is beyond the statutory walking distances of two miles for
pupils below the age of eight and three miles for those aged eight and
above. There is also an additional entitlement to free home-to-school
transport for children from low-income families. That provides
additional support for attendance to those children who are entitled to
free school meals or whose parents receive the maximum working tax

authorities must make arrangements for children who are unable to walk
to school because of special educational need, disability, or mobility
problems, or who cannot reasonably be expected to walk because of an
unsafe route. However, there are suggestions that some local
authorities have reclassified, as safe, routes that were previously
designated unsafe, to save money on providing school transport. Parents
can appeal to their local authority about such a decision, but that is
not always an independent process. Parents can complain to the local
government ombudsman about the handling of such an appeal. However,
that can be a lengthy process, and in the meantime, children could be
walking potentially unsafe routes to school. I would expect local
authorities to use the Department for Education’s guidance,
which was published last month, to implement fairer and quicker
processes for appeals. That, by the way, is an example of good
cross-departmental co-operation between me and the hon. Member for East

Baker:</Member></B> The point the hon. Lady misses is this: it is in
the interests of the bus companies themselves to invest for the future
to generate more passenger traffic by having newer buses and a better
service. That is indeed what they are doing. For example, the average
age of the bus in this country is declining. We are seeing massive new
investment in buses, not least of all through the Government’s
green bus fund. The way to get more passengers is to provide the
service that people want. Everybody in the bus industry understands
that and they do it really quite well, as the figures on

have seen a reduction in both uptake of creative subjects and funding
for people seeking to teach them. An Ipsos MORI survey commissioned by
the Department for Education found that 15% of schools have withdrawn
one or more arts subjects, and it was suggested that that was a
consequence of the debate we had on the EBacc. People reading and
listening to this debate will know that one of the consequences of the
EBacc’s description, which did not include those subjects, was a

am glad that the Department rowed back from the extreme end of those
proposals—that was an improvement —but the consequence of
the way that debate was conducted is that fewer schools are offering
those subjects. Worse, because the retreat from those subjects is
higher in schools in deprived areas, the survey found that 21% of
schools with a high proportion of pupils on free school meals withdrew
one or more arts subjects, compared with only 8% of schools with a low

narrowing of the curriculum at the expense of creative subjects will

education and the eloquent contribution that she has made to this
debate. I am sure that she will agree that children in
England—and elsewhere, but in England for the purposes of this
debate—can lay claim to a rich cultural heritage. It should be
our collective aim to ensure that they all have the chance to take part
in it, supported by high-quality and engaging local opportunities that

cultural activities through their investment in libraries, museums,

private galleries, 10 theatre and dance companies, 72 museums
and 1,000 village halls regularly used for cultural
activities. There are many other examples across the country. Alongside
that, the arm’s-length bodies of the Department for Culture,

education. I understand the hon. Lady’s impatience and
frustration. She has secured a debate a year on, and she wants to see
the

12 months, an enormous amount of work has been undertaken. The hon.
Lady acknowledged in her contribution that the Government’s
commitment was not a shallow one; we have set up new programmes and
brokered new partnerships. It is an opportune time to reflect on
progress thus far and make clear our expectations for the future. The
plan will do so, and will affirm our commitment to ensuring that all
pupils have access to a rich and fulfilling cultural education.
That commitment is backed by £292 million in funding for
cultural educational activity over the three years to

plan will highlight the many examples of partnerships and initiatives
supported by investment from schools, local authorities, voluntary
organisations and bodies such as the Arts Council, and the Government
also support a host of programmes designed to strengthen access and the
take-up of provision, which will enhance the quality of the local and
national cultural education available to schools and help to achieve
greater opportunity for young people. I am afraid that the volume of
those programmes does not allow me to go through the whole repertoire
in the short time available for this debate, so I will draw
attention to a core selection, some of which she referred to. Some are
aimed at children with a special interest or promise in the arts; some

bringing together partnerships between music services, schools,
education and arts organisations. A total of 123 hubs, managed by Arts
Council England on our behalf, began work in September 2012 and they
are already delivering innovative projects throughout the country,
including access for all pupils, especially those from disadvantaged
backgrounds, which is crucial, and they are working to augment and

Henley’s review concluded that, despite some excellent
examples of collaboration between arts organisations and schools, a
more systematic approach was necessary to develop a coherent and
educationally sound cultural offer for young people. Some schools can
be overwhelmed by the provision on offer, while some might struggle to
find support that meets their needs. In response to the review’s
recommendations, a strategic partnership between Arts Council England,
the Heritage Lottery Fund, the British Film Institute and English
Heritage has been brokered as the cultural education partnership group.
The group is working to ensure that the priorities for cultural
education are

clearly have an essential role to play in introducing cultural
experiences to their students as part of a broad and rich curriculum.
The most successful schools put culture at the heart of their

knowledge that all children and young people should know between the
ages of five and 16. As the hon. Lady knows, we have completed the
consultation, and I am sure that she made her views known. It will

Energy Bill and the failure to debate abolition of the Agricultural
Wages Board may be an example of how, despite the issue being deeply
significant to many hon. Members, including me, we were unable to
debate the matter. There was no mechanism by which to divide the House
to establish what support exists for that abolition, which was
introduced in another place. That worries me, and to ensure that today

that, by its very nature, is relatively short term—often five
years at the most. I congratulate the Government on rightly looking

substantial pension funds and other investors are looking to invest.

demonstrated with a target set sooner rather than later. Not only has

to make his own remarks later, and I trust he will do so, but I point
out that Germany, by going away from nuclear generation, will see a
significant rise in emissions—not only there, but in
neighbouring countries. Germany has been a net exporter of low-carbon
electricity to its neighbours, and that also is going and will create
substantial problems for Europe as a whole in meeting its emissions
reduction targets. It will also present severe problems for
Europe’s response to the challenge of global warming.

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T17:30:31"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

there might not be enough time to discuss this matter when the Energy

us who served on the Bill Committee faced was the lack of detail in
many areas. We were promised the delivery document in May, and that

has rightly been said, the Government made late amendments to the Bill
on the decarbonisation target. However, they did not require it to be
set, or to be set in 2016, which, according to
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T17:31:24"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Brent North (Barry Gardiner), is the earliest date it can be set.
They did not even say that it should be available for 2030, which is
merely the earliest date to which it should apply. In essence, there is
no provision for a decarbonisation target in the Bill. Even more
worryingly, when the Bill was published, the Government announced their
gas strategy, which clearly envisaged a substantial number 
<?notus-xml column=113?>of new gas generation stations. It seems to me
that the emissions performance standard in the Bill would allow
for the building of new unabated gas stations, even though Ofgem has
warned that bills could rise substantially until 2016 should we have a
heavy reliance on gas. There could also be a reduction in
energy security, so we might have to rely increasingly on
imported

current carbon budget might have to be amended—not downwards but
upwards—to allow for the greater emissions that are to be
created. Certainly, the Committee on Climate Change has been a strong
proponent of the need for a decarbonisation target and is concerned
about that very
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T17:32:30"></hs_TimeCode>. As
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T17:32:25"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas) rightly said, the main reason
for a decarbonisation target is to reduce carbon emissions; we must do
that if we are going to have any chance of keeping within 2°, as
she said. The Committee on Climate Change has made it clear that
decarbonising power is the cheapest way of meeting our overall carbon
budget. It is important that we give a clear and unequivocal message
that we must continue with decarbonisation. It is remarkable that those
who are calling for the target include not only those who campaign on
climate change but a wide range of industries, which wish to maintain
progress on climate change not for political reasons but for
hard-headed business reasons. They want to be sure of the future before
making very substantial investments in new green energy, and they are
looking at investments into the 2020s. Long lead-in periods are
involved, and decisions taken now are for massive investments that will
not come on stream for many years. They need to be sure that those
investments are worth while. There are mixed signals from the
Government, which makes business nervous that there will not be the
same commitment to renewable energy in

supply chain is established to help us reap the economic benefits and
jobs that come with it. We must not end up, as we have in the past,

hon. Member for North Warwickshire (Dan Byles) stated that we had some
of the world’s toughest targets on climate change, but it is
precisely because we have those targets that a target now for
decarbonisation of the energy sector up to 2030 is vital. Essentially,
that is the case that the Committee on Climate Change made on
decarbonising the power sector, falling from 450 grams or so
per kWh today to about 50 grams per kWh by 2030. That is because the
power sector produces a large percentage of emissions, so we cannot
decouple the question of decarbonisation of the power sector from
overall targets. The suggestion by the Committee on Climate Change
that, in order to stay in line with the overall targets that this
country has set itself, the target should be about 50 grams per kWh by
2030 should be the basis for what we set as a target in the Energy
Bill.</hs_Para>

Government tabled amendments to the Energy Bill after it was considered
in Committee, stating that they “may” set a target.
However, they cannot do it before 2016, and if they do so
the Minister “may” set a target 
<?notus-xml column=118?>of—a level we know not what. In terms of
building confidence for industry and knowing that we have to reach the
position that I have suggested regarding the relationship of energy to
overall climate change targets, that change in the Bill will be of very
little comfort indeed to those people who know what they
have to do as far as investment in the low-carbon economy is
concerned.</hs_Para>

suggestion of some 19 GW of gas—we need gas, but not that much,
running at a much lower trajectory—we will irrevocably bust our
climate change targets by that act alone. That is why it is important
that there is a target in the Bill that locks us into a proper

been signed on siting offshore wind fabrication facilities in the UK.
Part of the reason why the final decision has not yet been taken on
that is the fact that the global companies involved, which have to make
a case to their international boards, are not convinced that they have
the clarity to be able to say that there will be a market. The only way
we will bring down the cost of offshore wind is by having scale, and

closer alignment with the Department for Business, Innovation
and Skills. I cheered the last Government when they created a separate
Department of Energy and Climate Change. It is a good thing, but it
must also be a good thing, as he pointed out, to have 
<?notus-xml column=124?>much closer alignment between BIS and DECC. The appointment of my right
hon. Friend the Member for Sevenoaks (Michael Fallon) to the important
job of Energy Minister, much as it will stretch him, sends a clear
signal about the central importance of the low-carbon economy to
British growth and our long-term growth prospects, as the Prime
Minister said and every Member who has spoken in the debate has pointed
out. The CBI supports the agenda, and there is wider support for the
low-carbon economy that goes way beyond certain renewable energy
technologies. It offers export and other business opportunities
requiring little or no subsidy, and it has a great deal of its own
momentum.</hs_Para>

return to the decarbonisation target when the Bill returns to

hon. Members have argued that we should go further and set a target
now, to provide greater certainty to investors. I understand that
argument—I listened carefully to the contributions made in the
evidence session before the Bill Committee—and I see the strong
merit of the argument for a decarbonisation target. That is why we are
introducing measures in the Bill to create such a target. However, we
must also resist the temptation to think that life is about targets.
Surely, we learned our lesson under the last Government. Simply setting
targets does not deliver results. If this Government are about
anything, we are about deployment, results and driving real change in
real time, and our record demonstrates that we are capable of doing
that.</hs_Para>

in the carbon plan in December 2011, it is likely that, as well as
decarbonising electricity generation, meeting our 2050 target will
require the electrification of a significant amount of heat and
transport in the UK. In turn, that will not only affect overall demand
for electricity but require us to take into account when that
electricity is needed. For instance, when will people want to charge
electric vehicles? Heat demand changes seasonally and over the course
of a single day. All those things must be taken together when we
consider the best way to decarbonise electricity as part of a
least-cost route to meeting our obligations under the Climate Change
Act 2008.</hs_Para>

Brine</B> (Winchester) (Con):</Member> You will be happy to know that I
have prepared for this debate, Mr Gray. It is a pleasure to serve under
your chairmanship for the first time and I am pleased to have secured
the debate. I am still wearing a black tie after the events of
this morning, but I think that this debate involves good news. I look
forward to the Minister’s winding-up speech. The debate provides
an opportunity for me to discuss an issue that can blight the lives of
many hard-working young people in our constituencies and seek
clarification from the Minister on recent developments in Government
policy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041755000094" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0002.htm#13041755000094">Police
cautions can have a detrimental impact on the lives and employment
prospects of young people. An e-mail from one of my constituents led me
to initiate the debate, and I know that many other Members have
received similar correspondence. My constituent, who is now in her
final year at university, received a police caution in early 2007, when
she was 15 years old, for a minor shoplifting offence while part of a
dominant group of girls. Her e-mail explained to me that the huge peer
pressure that she felt so as to be accepted as part of that group and
coercion by her then friends were key reasons for her behaviour, which
she admits was poor. I am sure that many of us have some sympathy with
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041755000095" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0002.htm#13041755000095">Looking
back, my constituent admits that she feels utterly embarrassed by and
ashamed of her actions, which were completely unrepresentative of her
character. She has not acted similarly before or since. She is not a
dishonest person—I have seen several character references from
employers and former teachers that she has provided to back that
up—and in the years since the offence she has not kept in
contact with any of the people involved and has gone on to achieve
success in her exams and at
university.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041755000096" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0002.htm#13041755000096">My
constituent’s ambition is to pursue a career in law, and her
academic success and involvement in voluntary and extracurricular
activities make such a career possible, but that dream has been
jeopardised by the police caution that she received more than six years
ago. The Solicitors Regulation Authority has informed her that it is
more likely than not that her application will be rejected due to her
caution. She is understandably devastated that she may not be able to
pursue her chosen career.</hs_Para>

despite their previous offences, as many do. Nevertheless, while we
recognise that for very serious offending, disclosure of convictions
will continue to be in the public interest, we consider there is
potential to go further in relation to more minor convictions. We
therefore recommend that, in addition to keeping the youth
rehabilitation periods under review, the Government considers
legislating to erase out-of-court disposals and convictions 
<?notus-xml column=126?>from the records of very early, minor and non-persistent offenders at
the age of 18, so that they cannot be disclosed to employers under the

should be punished according to the rule of law, like anybody else,
when they do wrong. How we respond to often low-level bad behaviour by
youngsters, however, has the potential to blight the rest of their
lives by further alienating them from society. Our country cannot
afford and would not be right to put young people, in effect, on the

not entirely down to the actions of our Committee—it would have
been a swift move by the Minister if so—I am pleased that the
Government plan to lay before Parliament a statutory instrument to
amend the exceptions to the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act
1974, so that some spent convictions and cautions do not have to be
disclosed and cannot be taken into account in employment decisions.
Nevertheless, that development still leaves us with several

29 January this year, the Court of Appeal ruled that the system of
Criminal Records Bureau checks constituted a breach of article 8 of the
European convention on human rights and of the Human Rights Act 1998,
and that requiring the disclosure of all convictions and cautions
relating to recordable offences is disproportionate to the aim of
protecting children and vulnerable adults. Why, therefore, did the
Government feel the need to seek leave to appeal to the Supreme
Court<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T18:21:42"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041755000104" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0002.htm#13041755000104">The
statutory instrument that the Government will lay before Parliament
will help my constituent and many others, so I welcome it. It is
proposed that cautions and equivalents administered to a young offender
will not be subject to disclosure after two years, and that a
conviction received as a young offender resulting in a non-custodial
sentence will not be subject to disclosure after five and a half years.
May I press the Minister, however, to implement the measure as quickly
as possible? 
<?notus-xml column=127?>How long will it be before the order is laid before
the House? Will he confirm that any changes will be applied

my constituent highlighted two other important issues, which concern
other Members as well. First, on the role of local constabularies in
removing or retaining a caution on a young person’s record, my
constituent contacted Hampshire constabulary in the hope that it might
be able to remove the caution from her record, but she was told that
nothing could be done in that regard. However, in certain
circumstances, do not chief constables have the discretion to prevent
the disclosure of cautions? Where does the truth
lie<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T18:22:49"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041755000106" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0002.htm#13041755000106"><Member ContinuationText="Rehman Chishti" PimsId="5607" UID="13041755000167" xid="1077" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0002.htm#13041755000167"><B>Rehman
Chishti</B> (Gillingham and Rainham) (Con):</Member> I congratulate my
hon. Friend on securing this important debate and the work that he does
on these issues. He is talking about certain constabularies approaching
the matter in certain ways. I understand that the Government have
piloted initiatives to examine dealing with cautions in a different
way, as he has discussed. Has he made any assessment of how effective
the pilot scheme has been so
far<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T18:23:15"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041755000107" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0002.htm#13041755000107"><B><Member ContinuationText="Steve Brine" PimsId="5594" UID="13041755000168" xid="1154" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0002.htm#13041755000168">Steve
Brine:</Member></B> No, is the honest answer, but I am aware of the
pilot, so perhaps the Minister will be kind enough to refer to it. I am
grateful for that point, made by a fellow member of the Justice
Committee<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T18:23:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041755000108" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0002.htm#13041755000108">Other
people want to get in to speak and we want to give the Minister time to
respond, so I shall draw to a close. To make the second point, there is
no requirement to consent to receiving a police caution for young
people. Many of them do not appreciate the impact that a criminal
record will have on their life and career prospects, which means that
they can be burdened with a record without fully understanding the
consequences. Can more be done, therefore, to ensure that young people
are aware of the consequences of receiving a caution, which is more
than just a ticking off or what used to be a clip around the
ear<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T18:23:54"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041755000109" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0002.htm#13041755000109">In
summary, many of the young people who receive cautions immediately
regret their actions, but they soon discover that the consequences
severely jeopardise their job prospects and opportunities. Many of
those youngsters come from underprivileged and unstable backgrounds, so
is it not counter-productive to criminalise them further and to destroy
what opportunities they might have in our
society<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T18:24:20"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041755000110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0002.htm#13041755000110">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T18:09:55"></hs_TimeCode>

generalities, the youth justice system is focused on early intervention
and on diversion of children and young people from formal disposals
where that is appropriate. In recent times, there has been an increase
in the use of informal disposals by the police and an adoption of
restorative justice approaches, which I strongly support. All police
forces now have trained restorative justice facilitators, and an
on-the-spot restorative action can often provide the best disposal when
a minor, usually first-time misdemeanour is committed. Such an approach
can also be beneficial to the victim, who gets immediate reparation
from the young person who has committed the offence. There has been a
significant reduction in the use of formal disposals by the police over
recent years. Since 2001-02, there has been a 57% fall in the number of
reprimands, final warnings and conditional cautions given to young
people in England and Wales: 40,757 were given in 2011-12, compared

important. As I am about to explain in detail, we are concerned to
encourage the use of out-of-court disposals but to ensure that, first,
the length of time for which they are active beyond the period of the
commission of the offence is properly limited and that, at the same
time, they provide confidence in the wider justice system and in

are useful and heading in the right direction, but we might be getting
away slightly from the core of the issue: misdemeanours or offences
committed at a young age, whether leading to cautions or convictions
and minor punishments, can blight people’s lives. We saw that,
in particular, with the elections for police and crime commissioners,
when a number of individuals of all political parties were prevented
from standing 40 or 50 years after committing the offences. That should

to avoid such damage to

youth caution may be given for any offence that the young offender
admits when there is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of
conviction but it is not in the public interest to prosecute. The
flexibility provided by the youth caution allows the police greater
discretion to offer a disposal that is appropriate to the circumstances
of the offence and offender, rather than being arbitrarily determined
by previous disposals or convictions.</hs_Para>

retained in the youth caution the critical elements of assessment and
intervention inherent in the final warning scheme. The youth offending
team will be obliged to assess and, unless considered inappropriate, to
put a rehabilitation programme in place when a young person has
received a second or subsequent youth caution. That reflects the
current threshold of obligatory assessment following a warning and is
designed to prevent a return to precisely the repeat cautioning to
which my hon. Friend
referred.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T18:32:04"></hs_TimeCode> Unlike
reprimands and warnings, the youth caution does not have a fixed limit
on the number that may be administered, and it may be used if a young
person has previously been convicted. That allows the police to use
discretion, in consultation with the youth offending team, and to avoid
an unnecessary court process if that is not

a flexible youth caution that can be used more than once should help
young people when seeking future gainful employment despite a minor
misdemeanour that is causing concern. The youth caution becomes spent
immediately, so there is no requirement for the young person to

employment in an occupation listed in the Rehabilitation of Offenders

Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 revised the
youth conditional caution. We reduced unnecessary bureaucracy by giving
the police power to authorise youth conditional cautions without the
need to seek the authorisation of a prosecutor. The police can now
offer a youth conditional caution with input from a youth offending
team as at present but without the need for agreement from the Crown
Prosecution 
<?notus-xml column=130?>Service. The youth offending team’s role is now statutory to
provide a check on the appropriateness of the disposal and will also

cautions require offenders to take responsibility for their actions,
including agreement to conditions that require them to put things right
or to seek help for their behaviour. It is important to recognise the
role of the victim and to ensure that they have proper redress through
such an out-of-court disposal. Since 8 April, the revised youth
conditional caution has been available to all 10 to 17-year-olds
throughout England and Wales. The youth conditional caution has a
three-month rehabilitation period to allow for the conditions to be
completed, but offers similar benefits to the youth caution in becoming
spent rapidly and therefore not subject to disclosure for most
purposes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041765000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0002.htm#13041765000017">The
third change to that sort of disposal in the 2012 Act was to abolish
penalty notices for disorder for 10 to 17-year-olds. Penalty notices
can be an effective deterrent and provide resolution
of offences for adult offenders, but we believe they are less effective
for young people. The principal aim of the youth justice system is to
prevent offending by young people. For that age group, we believe it is
more effective to use out-of-court disposals involving assessment and
intervention by the local youth offending team than fixed
penalties.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041765000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0002.htm#13041765000019">Other
legislation that is centrally important to the matters that the debate
gives rise to is the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974, which has an
important role in helping those who have a criminal conviction but have
put criminality behind them. From the tone of the debate, it is clear
that many hon. Members believe that it is important to provide
individuals with the opportunity to leave behind mistakes that they
made when they were young. Minor offending behaviour committed when the
offender was immature should not blight their prospects. That is
recognised in the fact that rehabilitation periods are generally
shorter for under-eights than for adults. Most crime committed by young
people is relatively minor and often results in the out-of-court
disposals or fines that I am talking about. A significant proportion of
the population have had a conviction at some point in their lives, but
few of them pose a serious risk of harm to the public. I am sure that
we all agree that it is in society’s interest that ex-offenders
are given the chance to reintegrate into their communities and lead
law-abiding
lives.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041765000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0002.htm#13041765000020">My

current exceptions order to the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974

because they provide for blanket disclosure of all spent convictions

that judgment—my hon. Friend raised this point specifically

that reason disposals for specified sexual and violent offences and
other offences relevant to safeguarding will always be subject to
standard or enhanced disclosure. Any offence resulting in a custodial

have a key role in how criminal record information is treated, and they
should have a fair and objective policy on the recruitment of
ex-offenders. It is important that they should consider the
circumstances and relevance of a spent, or unspent, conviction where
that is disclosed. That should include taking into account the age of
the person at the time, the disposal received and what the person has
done in the meantime. Of course,
we<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T18:40:14"></hs_TimeCode> encourage
employers to adopt that fair approach, which is critical in assisting
ex-offenders in obtaining gainful employment and, therefore, helping

hon. Friend’s constituent, I understand that she received a
caution for theft aged 15 but now wishes to pursue a career as a
lawyer. That is an occupation listed on the exceptions order and
therefore disclosure of spent cautions and convictions can be requested

advised that her caution means that she may not be accepted to practise
law.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T18:40:44"></hs_TimeCode> However, I
am pleased to say that, from his description of the case, it appears
that she will benefit from our proposed amendment to the exceptions
order. As I have said, under the proposals, a caution received as a
young person for a non-specified offence, which includes theft, will no
longer be subject to disclosure, nor will an employer be able to take
it into account, after a period of two years. I should be clear that
the caution will nevertheless remain on the record, but the changes to
the exceptions order will specifically address his constituent’s
case. Clearly, there are circumstances in which the disclosure of all
cautions and convictions may still be required, such as in subsequent
court proceedings.</hs_Para>

reasons why multiple cautions have been given to some criminals; the
difference in the use of cautions by different police forces and
whether increased scrutiny is needed to ensure that they are used
consistently; and the impact on individuals of accepting a caution,

Twigg:</Member></B> The Department for Education announced on 13
November 2012 its intention to close Castle View house in Runcorn,
which is owned by the Department as a freehold property. It proposes to
transfer the work to Manchester. The Runcorn site accommodates
450 staff, including 222 Department for Education staff,
private sector support staff, staff from other
Departments—including the Department for Work and Pensions and
the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills—and staff
from the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service, and
national health service procurement
staff.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T18:46:09"></hs_TimeCode> Civil
service jobs—originally with the Department of
Employment—have been based at the site, and previously at the
building next door, for more than 40 years, providing an important
source of good-quality jobs in the borough of
Halton.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041765000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0002.htm#13041765000038">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T18:46:31"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T18:09:55"></hs_TimeCode>
Department has identified the following key areas on which to test its
proposal: cost and value for money, needs of the business, estates
policy, the effect on staff and the wider socio-economic impact. I will
address each area individually, but first, what about the overall
handling of the issues by the Department for Education? There was no
business case on which to justify a closure, and it was made clear to
staff from the beginning that it was highly unlikely that the proposal
would be changed, despite a consultation being launched later. Even
when I,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T18:47:02"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T18:09:55"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Weaver Vale and David Parr, chief executive of Halton
borough council, met the DFE permanent secretary to discuss the
proposal, we came away with a view that the decision was a fait
accompli.</hs_Para>

am sure that most independent-minded people would find it odd that
there was no business case to base the proposal on. The key arguments
made for closure and transfer of the work to Manchester do not remotely
stand up to scrutiny, as I shall argue. It is fair to state that the
staff and unions have believed for some years that there has been an
agenda in the senior management to close down the Runcorn operation for
reasons that we could never get to the bottom of. I think the DFE wants
the closure now because it fits in with the image that it wants to
project of being ahead of the game in Whitehall on how to cut costs,
and, therefore, it will  
<?notus-xml column=134?>be held up as a template for other Departments. The problem for the
Department for Education is that the change will not save the taxpayer
anything.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041765000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0002.htm#13041765000040">In
terms of cost and value for money, of the 12 DFE sites, Castle View
house is the second least expensive. The cost per person for Castle
View house is £2,545. The cost for Piccadilly Gate in
Manchester—the building that it is proposed to move the jobs
to—when comparing like for like is £4,583 per person. The
Department suggests that the refurbishment of Castle View house would
cost £500,000. A qualified property survey carried out by Halton
borough council suggests that the figure would be nearer to
£30,000 to £50,000, depending on whether decoration was
undertaken. Castle View house is a modern building with excellent
facilities and good IT infrastructure. The Department did not factor in
the income from sub-tenants in the figures that it based its original
closure proposals on.</hs_Para>

have also been informed today that the Public and Commercial Services
Union met the Department on Monday in London to talk about staff
relocation costs. The DFE has now accepted that it will have to support
Runcorn staff with travel costs of up to £4,250 each
year—a significant increase, I understand—to cover travel
costs on other, longer routes than the very congested Runcorn East
line.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13041765000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0002.htm#13041765000042"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T18:49:18"></hs_TimeCode>We

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T18:49:22"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Weaver Vale will point out, incurring more cost for the taxpayer.
Further, we can add to that the cost of running an empty building when
a re-let is unlikely, according to Halton borough council, in the short
to medium term. The DFE already has an empty site next door to Castle
View
house<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T18:49:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041765000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0002.htm#13041765000043">Let
us consider the business need. The suggestion was that Manchester had a
wider-ranging skills base, but that has not been evidenced or tested
other than by the fact that a number of other Departments are based
there. Similarly, the assertion by the DFE that Manchester would
attract better staff is flawed—again, where is the evidence? The
Runcorn site offers a range of skilled staff, holding degree-level and
professional qualifications. The public communications unit at Runcorn
offers a centre of excellence. A skills audit by the PCS of its members
showed that, among the staff who responded, 139 professional
qualifications were
held<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T18:50:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041765000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0002.htm#13041765000044">It
is accepted that Manchester has very good travel connections, but it is
quicker to travel to London from Runcorn. There are also local lines to
Liverpool, Manchester and Chester. The M56 is only a few minutes from
Castle View house and also gives quick access to the M62 and the
M6<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T18:50:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041765000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0002.htm#13041765000045">On
being able to attract and retain good-quality staff at Runcorn, we have
only to look back to the heyday of the Runcorn site in the 1980s and
early ’90s, when nearly 1,000 staff were employed there. That is
a clear indication that staff with good skills can be
attracted.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041765000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0002.htm#13041765000046">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T18:51:05"></hs_TimeCode>
want to examine the effect on staff. It goes without saying that the
morale of this loyal and hard-working work force has been badly
affected by the proposal, but also by the way the Department
has handled it. The closure of Castle View house will also impact more
on  
<?notus-xml column=135?>the lowest-graded and lowest-paid staff, and those who are made
redundant will find it hard to get another job, given the high
unemployment in
Halton<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T18:51:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041765000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0002.htm#13041765000047">The
PCS union met departmental officials and representatives of Arriva
Trains on 30 January. Arriva has confirmed that it cannot transport the
required number of staff from Runcorn East station to Manchester at
peak times. I understand that the Department has now accepted that and
informed staff that it will explore “alternative
options<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T18:51:46"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T18:51:46"></hs_TimeCode>”.
There are also few parking spaces at Runcorn East, where staff would
travel from. That is a particular concern for disabled staff. A number
of staff who live in Halton would have to make two bus
journeys<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T18:51:58"></hs_TimeCode> to get
to the
station.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041765000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0002.htm#13041765000048">On
the socio-economic impacts, Halton is the 30th most deprived borough in
the country and the areas that fall within the Halton Lea ward are some
of the most deprived in England. Youth unemployment is particularly
high in the area. There will be a wider impact on Halton through the
largely retail-based employment in Halton Lea, which was known as
Shopping City and which relies on the employee daytime population.
Castle View house and those employed there are an important source of
custom. Therefore, if employment is removed from the Halton Lea ward,
wider employment in the ward will suffer. The wider impact on Halton
will be worsened by the fact that a large proportion of Halton
Lea’s work force live in
Halton<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T18:52:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041765000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0002.htm#13041765000049">It
is important not to forget that Halton Lea is a town centre, not just a
shopping centre, and the Government have stated that they want to
regenerate town centres. I hope that, when coming to a
decision, the Minister will ensure that account is taken of wider
Government policy on town
centres.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041765000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0002.htm#13041765000050">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T18:09:55"></hs_TimeCode>
is important to highlight to the Minister the fact that support for
retaining the DFE jobs from both the private sector and the public
sector is very strong. That includes Halton borough council, the
Liverpool City Region local enterprise partnership—I am
pleased that my right hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley (Mr
Howarth) is present for the debate—and Halton chamber of
commerce<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T18:53:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041765000051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0002.htm#13041765000051">To
summarise, Castle View house is much cheaper to run than the Manchester
Piccadilly Gate building. Closing the MPG building would save the DFE
more money than closing Castle View house. Closing Castle View house
would be an ongoing liability for the DFE. Staff at Castle View house
would find it harder to find jobs in the locality. Closing Castle View
house puts in jeopardy the other 200-plus non-DFE public sector jobs
based there. The socio-economic impact on Runcorn and on the viability
of Halton Lea shopping centre will be serious. There are
serious issues about Runcorn staff being able to travel to Manchester
and about the associated
costs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T18:53:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041765000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0002.htm#13041765000052">If,

should like to make two key points. First, I shall address the need for
savings across the Department—to position the real impact that
the closure could have on the Department’s balance books.
Secondly, I shall address the human and economic cost that it would
have on an area that has the potential to thrive, at a time when we
should be addressing unemployment issues, not adding to
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T18:55:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041765000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0002.htm#13041765000056">I
do not dispute the need to look for economies, and the Department for
Education is no less bloated than other Departments that have ballooned
in size to unsustainable proportions. However, those efficiencies need
to be just that—the business case must be sound to justify the
action. I am convinced that these proposals are not sound.
Significantly, there are gaps in both the long and the short-term
expectations of
savings<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T18:55:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041765000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0002.htm#13041765000057">Castle
View house has been portrayed as a low-quality building in need of
significant redevelopment. That is simply not the case. I have visited
the building on numerous occasions, and compared with the wildly
varying conditions of other public sector buildings, it is in very good
condition, with excellent facilities. Even if a full refurbishment were
required, the cost, as set out by Halton council’s response,
would be one tenth of the £500,000 suggested by the
Department’s review. In reality, the building has the
second-lowest overheads of all the Department’s offices and the
cost per square metre is just over one quarter of that for the
Manchester Piccadilly
site.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041765000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0002.htm#13041765000058">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T18:56:39"></hs_TimeCode>
is clear that a withdrawal from the area would have a negative impact
and make it less easy to re-let or sell in the near future. That is
clear from a consideration of other nearby Government buildings that
have previously been closed. The overhead costs of Castle View as an
unused building are a staggering £382,000 a year. That would
swiftly impact on the balance sheets that the Department so desperately
wants to
correct<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T18:57:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041765000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0002.htm#13041765000059">The
long-term impact of the decision has also not been considered
sufficiently. The High Speed 2 route, which will connect up the
country, will have a major terminus in the centre of Manchester, in the
location of the Department for Education’s building. Although
the line will not reach the city for some time, it is obvious that the
building work for such a significant station will take years and result
in the vacation of the offices sooner rather than later. That will be
hugely costly and would, were the Castle View staff to relocate there,
cause significant instability and uncertainty once more. Closing one
office in Runcorn, sending staff to Manchester Piccadilly and then
moving them again makes no sense 
<?notus-xml column=137?>whatever. It is clear that the scrutiny that we
expect from a detailed analysis is lacking, and I urge the Department
to have more
foresight<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T18:57:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041765000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0002.htm#13041765000060">I
should like to draw attention to the impact that the proposal will have
on Halton Lea. Although some steps have been taken to produce an action
plan for relocating staff to the Manchester branch, it is clear that
such a move will leave many behind. Half of Halton Lea falls within the
most deprived 5% of the
country<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T18:58:30"></hs_TimeCode>; the
other half is within the bottom 15% and unemployment has risen to 9.4%
in the past year. When we talk about closure, we are not talking just
about comfortable civil servants having a longer commute—an
issue that I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister will
address—but about those at the bottom of the employment scale
falling out of work entirely. Service workers at the site cannot
relocate, and as I have said previously, the chances of an instant
re-let of the building are remote. That is not to mention that the
shops and services around the area do not just benefit from but rely
heavily on trade from these offices. Footfall at Halton Lea’s
retail centre could drop by 20%—a drop that I am sure hon.

summarise, Castle View house is the second least expensive building of
the 12 Department for Education sites identified. It has excellent
public transport and road links and free car parking on site. Halton
Lea’s Castle View house would be difficult to re-let or sell in
the short to medium term. Halton Lea is one of the most deprived wards
in one of the most deprived communities in the country. Some 85% of the
work force are local and it is therefore the most sustainable solution.
Most of the people employed there live in the borough. Closure will

securing the debate and for their contributions. Both Members made
excellent contributions, which reflected the impact on their
constituencies of the future of the Department for Education offices. I
am sure that they would join me in paying tribute to the excellence and
professionalism of the staff in Runcorn. Indeed, the hon. Member for
Halton made a point about the quality of those staff, and I absolutely
agree with
him<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T19:00:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041765000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0002.htm#13041765000064">The

the hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend have provided has been very
helpful in enabling us to reach a proper decision. Some of what they

the time. In coming to its

developed a proposal to close down a building and transfer staff to
Manchester, based on a flawed case and best-guess estimates, when a
local authority and MPs were later able to put together much clearer
facts than the Department itself could? Does that not make the Minister

Truss:</Member></B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for making his point. It
is an open consultation; the decision has not yet been made. We wanted
to listen to available evidence, but we put forward the evidence
available at the time. His contributions, and those of others, have
helped to develop our

Secretary of State and I have often spoken in the House about our
desire to see a better education system for our children and families,
and we have made great strides in achieving that aim, by expanding the
academies programme, rolling out free schools and introducing a
rigorous new curriculum. Key to success is the hard work and dedication
of civil servants in the Department for Education, who are tireless in
their efforts to improve our schools and children’s services,
but there is always more work to be done. The Department for Education
can continue to build on the successes. We want to be the best
Department in Government, a Department in which the best and brightest
want to
work.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041765000069" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0002.htm#13041765000069">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T19:05:02"></hs_TimeCode>
have launched the DFE review, which reported last November and laid out
how we intend to achieve our aim. The review proposes fundamental
changes to our ways of working, which are designed to make the
Department the best it can be. We need to hold ourselves to account to
the same standards of use of public money to which we hold schools and
children’s services to account. That is important. As a result
of the changes, there will be difficult decisions to make. We have a
smaller work force, which needs to be more flexible, effective and
responsive to future needs, which means that we have to reduce our
office space. We currently occupy 12 sites across the country and the
review recommended that we consolidate them into just six and move to
cheaper accommodation. That is the issue we are discussing today.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T19:05:02"></hs_TimeCode> do, however,
value the regional presence of the Department. It provides an
alternative perspective on policy to that of a single London-based
office. It provides accessibility for external
stakeholders<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T19:05:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

has suggested several alternatives to the existing building, based on
the consultation? I do not agree with this, but it says that the
proposal it is not economic; it is the most expensive option. There are
various alternative locations in my constituency that have been put on
the table—Rutland house, Vale house, Howard house, Clifton
house—so there is no shortage of public sector properties
available in Halton. It does not have to be shifted out of the
community of Halton Lea to Manchester Piccadilly in Greater Manchester;

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T19:05:52"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Weaver Vale for his comments, and I am aware of his
proposals. We are absolutely considering all available options in the
north-west in relation to our package. I understand that both speakers
have acknowledged that there is essentially a choice between Runcorn
and Manchester. They have put forward a good case about why Runcorn has
particular issues of staff quality, employment levels and local
regeneration that need to be considered in the decision-making
process<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T19:06:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041765000073" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0002.htm#13041765000073">The
decision to close any Government site is never easy. I understand the
worry and uncertainty of staff who might be affected by the decision.
It is a difficult time across the Department when there is such
uncertainty. I also understand the concerns of the local community in
Runcorn about the site’s future. The consultation is open, but
we wanted to be honest about our initial intentions, so that people
have time to make representations and
preparations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041765000074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0002.htm#13041765000074">I
acknowledge the points made about the economic impact on the area.
Among the factors that we will take into account in our decision are
wider central Government policies—for example, the town centre
policy that the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T19:07:27"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Halton mentioned—and minimising costs for the
Department, which is clearly important to the achievement of value for
money. I note the point that both hon. Members made about the
availability of more affordable sites in the Runcorn
area<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T19:07:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041765000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0002.htm#13041765000075">Whichever
site is selected for closure, we will put in place comprehensive
support for affected staff to help them through the change. All staff
will have the option to transfer to work from whichever site is chosen,
and we will offer assistance with excess fares. However, for 
<?notus-xml column=140?>those who either cannot or do not want to make such a move, we have
already made a commitment to allow staff to apply for voluntary terms,

employers in the region to identify alternative employment
opportunities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041765000076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/halltext/130417h0002.htm#13041765000076">I

the further representations about cost, vis-à-vis Manchester and
the local economic situation, I confirm that they will be taken into
account in the final decision. I shall ensure that I discuss the

secretary and the Secretary of State. The decision is being deliberated

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-17T19:09:05"></hs_TimeCode> point that
the hon. Member for Halton made about alternative accommodation being
available in the Runcorn area. We are aware that High Speed 2 could
mean that Manchester Piccadilly Gate will be demolished, but that is
subject to consultation, and plans suggest that demolition would not be
required before 2027, which is after the lease on the Manchester

In its Coalition programme for government, the Government committed to
making the import or possession of illegal timber a criminal offence.
The Timber and Timber Products (Placing on the Market) Regulations 2013
provide for new criminal offences for: placing illegally harvested
timber or timber products on the EU market; failure to exercise due
diligence when placing timber or timber products on the EU market, and
failure to maintain and regularly evaluate the due diligence system
used. The maximum penalty for these offences is two years' imprisonment
and an unlimited fine. Further offences provided for are: failure by
those placing timber or timber products on the market or those trading
in such products to keep and make available specified information;
failure to comply with a formal notice to improve issued by the
enforcement body, and the obstruction of inspectors. The maximum
penalty for these offences is a fine of up to level five on the
standard scale (currently £5000). Related enforcement powers of
entry, inspection, and seizure of illegally harvested timber are also
provided for in the
Regulations.”</hs_brev></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-04-17?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_04_17_PT_1/A9730F9FB1C011A3E01C61581F8610B01D815ECE" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>0</House><System>1</System><Sitting short-date="17 April 2013">Wednesday

be considered for an individual who is not accepted as being in need of
international protection (i.e. asylum or humanitarian protection (HP))
but who is able to demonstrate particularly compelling reasons why
removal would not be appropriate. Discretionary Leave is normally
granted for a period of three years. Further leave may be granted,
subject to a review of the individual’s circumstances.
Humanitarian protection (HP) is leave granted to a person who is not a
refugee under the refugee convention but who would, if removed, face in
the country of return a real risk to life or person arising from the
death penalty; unlawful killing; torture or inhuman or degrading
treatment or punishment; or serious and individual threat by reason of
indiscriminate violence in situations of international or internal
armed conflict. If a person has been refused asylum they may still be
considered for this status. Humanitarian protection is normally granted
for a period of three years, after which the person can apply for
indefinite leave to remain. A person who is granted humanitarian
protection is allowed to work and has access to public
funds.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>3. ‘Cases with decision

the CHP Quality Assurance programme proposed to amend the requirements
for a scheme to 
<?notus-xml column=402?>qualify as ‘Good Quality CHP’. The electrical efficiencies
of some renewable powerplant are substantially higher than those
assumed when the current requirements were developed. As a result some
powerplant are able to qualify as Good Quality CHP, and hence receive
the CHP uplift available through the renewables obligation, despite
supplying only minimal quantities of heat. The proposed amended
requirements would ensure that only plant which supply a significant
quantity of heat fully qualify as Good Quality CHP, hence ensuring that
the additional support available for CHP delivers value for money. The
consultation does not have any impact on ROC banding for plant which
meet the definition of Good Quality
CHP.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13041769000373" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/text/130417w0001.htm#13041769000373">Initial
responses from stakeholders expressed concerns at the lack of
“grandfathering” of current requirements for existing
plants. For this reason, DECC issued supplementary consultation
questions on 21 January seeking stakeholders views on an alternative
approach, which would involve grandfathering of the current
requirements for some existing plant. I have had no discussions with
representatives from the combined heat and power sector on this issue.
The Department has received a small amount of correspondence on the
subject and officials have met a number of CHP stakeholders to discuss
it. In addition, 47 stakeholders have provided their views via formal
responses to the consultation. Officials are currently analysing these
responses.</hs_Para>

residential portfolio sale by Berkeley Group holdings to PRUPIM. All
534 properties involved in the sale were private rented units. There is
thus no impact on the amount of affordable housing in the Kidbrooke
regeneration scheme. An independent valuation assessment confirmed that
the sale of the portfolio was at market value and that therefore the
Homes and Communities Agency's share of the return in respect of its
Kickstart investment represented value for money to the public

eligible care costs and extended state support for individuals in

Friend the Member for Richmond (Yorks) (Mr Hague)'s Preventing Sexual

and complement work which is under way across the UK Government on the
Women, Peace and Security agenda. One of the key aims is to tackle the
culture of impunity for sexual violence committed in conflict and to
ensure that perpetrators are held accountable for their actions. At
their meeting on 11 April G8 Foreign Ministers agreed a Declaration on
Preventing Sexual Violence which contains a set of practical
commitments to overcome the barriers that impede the implementation of
the 
<?notus-xml column=442?>existing international legal framework and prevent successful
investigations and prosecutions. The G8 also endorsed a new,
non-legally binding, international protocol on the investigation and
documentation of sexual violence in conflict. The UK is currently
taking forward work on developing the protocol. This protocol will help
improve the evidence base from which prosecutions for sexual violence
in conflict can be drawn. The G8 has collectively pledged £23

conflict,</hs_Para>

Wright:</Member></B> The use of cautions is at its lowest level for
more than five years, as is the number of cautions issued to those who
have a previous criminal record. The public and victims have a right to
expect that people who commit serious crimes should be brought before a
court. On 3 April 2013 we launched a review into the use of cautions
which will focus on the use of cautions for serious offences and
persistent
offenders.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304181000581" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/text/130417w0002.htm#1304181000581">Among
other things, the review will examine whether there are some offences
for which the use of simple cautions is generally inappropriate, the
reasons why multiple cautions are given to some criminals and the
difference in the use of cautions by police force areas. The review is
a significant step to ensuring that cautions are used correctly, in the
interests of justice, and command the confidence of the public. The
review will be completed by the end of May
2013.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304181000582" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/text/130417w0002.htm#1304181000582">The

reoffending outcomes. Using a Payment by Results model makes sense as a
way of improving effectiveness and getting a good deal for the

providers who fail to reduce reoffending will have to bear the cost of
that

months in 2011; 6.6 months in 2012 and 7.8 months so far in 2013. In

academy trusts and multi academy trusts are required to appoint
independent auditors to report on their financial statements. This
requirement is also in funding agreements, which are the Secretary of
State's contracts with academies. The Secretary of State also requires
these auditors to deliver an opinion on the regularity of the academy
trust's income and expenditure. This opinion is delivered jointly to
the Secretary of State (through the Education Funding Agency) and to
the academy trust. Academy trusts also appoint an auditor to review
their internal control functions. The Education Funding Agency may also
undertake risk based audits of academy trusts.</hs_Para>

child ratios in childcare settings with individuals and organisations
in England, as have officials of the Department. These conversations
revealed a wide range of views. There is a recognition that staff to
child ratios have remained the same for decades, and have not kept pace
with the significant changes in child care and early education we have
seen in this country. This reinforces the case for reviewing those
rules and considering greater flexibility for providers to deploy
better qualified staff to meet children's needs
effectively.</hs_Para><Question><hs_Para UID="1304182000347" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/text/130417w0004.htm#1304182000347"><B><Member PimsId="4742" UID="1304182001042" xid="842" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/text/130417w0004.htm#1304182001042">Mrs

Laws:</Member></B> The Government is currently considering proposals
for determining entitlement to free school meals under universal
credit. We do not expect to introduce these until after October 2013.
From April 2013, as universal credit is very gradually rolled out to
small areas of the country as part of the pathfinder, all households
receiving universal credit will be entitled to free school meals for
their children; this is because they would have been entitled to out of
work benefits under the current benefits system. This interim measure,
to ensure children continue to receive free school meals during the
pathfinder, does not reflect any decisions over FSM eligibility when
universal credit is rolled out more
widely.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="1304182000020" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/text/130417w0004.htm#1304182000020">GCE

independently run by the Institute for Credit Management (ICM).
Signatories commit to: (1) pay suppliers on time, (2) give clear
guidance to suppliers and (3) encourage good practice. Signing up to
the code is a public gesture of commitment to prompt payment and the
ICM's focus is on promoting dialogue when cases of dispute do arise.
There is a form for registering complaints about signatories on the
Prompt Payment Code website. In addition, references are re-taken every
six month to confirm continued good practice by signatories. So far the
number of disputes raised and signatories removed remains low which
indicates general
compliance.</hs_Para><Question><hs_Para UID="1304182000861" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/text/130417w0004.htm#1304182000861"><B><Member PimsId="5668" UID="1304182001098" xid="1209" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130417/text/130417w0004.htm#1304182001098">Alex
