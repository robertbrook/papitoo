trapped into slavery. It is notable that it is not just people who are
being trafficked from eastern Europe or elsewhere. There are examples

the whole House will know, successive Governments have sought the
deportation of this dangerous man since 2001. The prospect of his
deportation now depends on one very narrow issue: the question of
whether evidence obtained through the mistreatment of others might be
used against him in his home country of Jordan. In January last year,
the European Court of Human Rights ruled that there was indeed such a
risk, and therefore blocked his deportation. Following that ruling, the
British Government sought from the Jordanian Government further
information and assurances not just in relation to the treatment of
Qatada himself, but about the quality of the legal processes that would
be followed throughout his
trial.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042446000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/debtext/130424-0001.htm#13042446000014">Although

November last year it ruled that there was still a risk that a trial in
Jordan would breach Qatada’s rights under article 6 of the
European convention. Since then, the Government have pursued a twin
strategy: first, to appeal SIAC’s decision; and secondly to work
with the Jordanian Government to seek further assurances to convince
the courts that Qatada would indeed receive a fair trial. I want to
take each of those approaches in
turn<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T12:35:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042446000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/debtext/130424-0001.htm#13042446000016">First,
I shall deal with the Government’s appeal. On 27 March, the
Court of Appeal confirmed SIAC’s interpretation of the law and
ruled that we could not deport Abu Qatada to Jordan under present
conditions. Yesterday, the Court of Appeal refused the
Government’s application to appeal that decision to the Supreme
Court. The Government disagree with that ruling, and I can tell the
House that we will now seek permission to appeal from the Supreme Court
itself<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T12:35:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042446000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/debtext/130424-0001.htm#13042446000017">Secondly,
I can tell the House that I have signed a comprehensive mutual legal
assistance agreement with Jordan. This agreement is fully reciprocal,
offers considerable advantages to both countries and reflects our joint
commitment to tackling international crime. It covers assistance in
obtaining evidence for the investigation and prosecution of crimes in
either country and provides a framework for assistance in the restraint
and confiscation of the proceeds of
crime<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T12:36:00"></hs_TimeCode>. It also
includes a number of fair trial guarantees that would apply to anyone
being deported from either country. I believe that these guarantees
will provide the courts with the assurance that Qatada will not face
evidence that might have been obtained by torture in a re-trial in
Jordan.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13042446000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/debtext/130424-0001.htm#13042446000018">Before<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T12:36:32"></hs_TimeCode>
the agreement can come into force and become a formal treaty, it must
be ratified by both countries, and the Jordanian Government will be
laying the draft treaty before its Parliament
shortly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T12:36:31"></hs_TimeCode>. In the
United Kingdom, 
<?notus-xml column=888?>the agreement does not require any changes to our domestic
law, but it must be placed before both Houses for
21 sitting days before it is ratified. So I can confirm that the text
of the treaty has been laid before both Houses today, and, depending on
the date of Parliament’s prorogation, we expect the 21 days to
be completed before the end of
June<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T12:36:54"></hs_TimeCode>. Under
Jordanian law, once ratified the provisions of the treaty will take
primacy over existing Jordanian law in cases such as Qatada’s.
We therefore believe that the treaty will deliver the protections
required by SIAC to secure Qatada’s deportation.</hs_Para>

believe that the treaty we have agreed with Jordan, once ratified by
both Parliaments, will finally make possible the deportation of Abu
Qatada, but as I have warned the House before, even when the treaty is
fully ratified, it will not mean that Qatada will be on a plane to
Jordan within days. We will be able to issue a new deportation
decision, but Qatada will still have legal appeals available to him,
and it will therefore be up to the courts to make the final decision.
That legal process may well still take many months, but in the meantime
I believe that Qatada should remain behind
bars<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T12:37:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042446000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/debtext/130424-0001.htm#13042446000020">Lastly,
I would like to say this: as any sane observer of this case will
conclude, it is absurd for the deportation of a suspected foreign
terrorist to take so many years and cost the taxpayer so much money.
That is why we need to make sense of our human rights laws and remove
the many layers of appeals available to foreign nationals we want to
deport. In the meantime, however, the Government are doing everything
they can to deport Abu Qatada to Jordan. I believe that this treaty
gives us every chance of succeeding in that aim, so I commend this
statement to the
House.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13042446000295" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/debtext/130424-0001.htm#13042446000295">12.38

ignore the Court and put Abu Qatada on a plane regardless of its
ruling—and I do not believe that we would be able to do so in
practice—we would risk being ordered by the Court to bring him
back to Britain and pay him compensation. Worse than that, as soon as
we started to ignore our obligations under international law, we would
not be able to rely on other countries’ obligations to us under

Opposition, in any aspect of their policies, is an
apology for what we had to inherit. The deportation  of Abu
Qatada has been considered by successive Governments since 2001. We
have taken several steps that I believe have put us a position in which
we will be able to achieve that end. I have been absolutely clear that
rights of appeal will be available to Abu Qatada if a new deportation
decision is issued, so the process could take many months—it
will not be over quickly—but the Government have been absolutely
right to take such action. We have reduced the issues that must be
dealt with to this single point that we believe the agreement will

type of house actually built and that which had been permitted, with a

the deputy chief magistrate who heard the case stated in her summation

Speaker. During Scottish questions earlier today, the Secretary of
State agreed to group Questions 6 and 7. I am puzzled as to
why my question, Question 12, which was exactly the same,
was not also grouped. As you know, I stood up at the time to try to ask
my question but was unsuccessful. That is not a complaint; I just

Gentleman’s point of order is that responsibility for the
grouping or non-grouping of questions lies entirely with the
Government. Ordinarily, the Government make a calculation of the likely
point that will be reached in Question Time, based on previous
experience, and judge accordingly whether or not they think it
appropriate to group Questions. It is not a matter for the Chair. I am
genuinely sorry if the hon. Gentleman was disappointed not to be able
to participate in the exchanges on—if memory serves me
correctly—the effect of the Budget upon Scotland, but I know
that he is a dedicated and assiduous contributor to our proceedings and

begin by thanking Opposition Members for their constructive engagement
on the treatment of Ministry of Defence police and fire workers’
normal pension age under the Bill. Important issues were explored
during our debate on Monday, when views were put forward passionately
by Members on both sides of the House. The Government have acknowledged
the strength of feeling. In the other place, my colleague Lord Newby
has explained that the Government fully accept the spirit of the Lords
amendment we are considering today.</hs_Para>

are willing to include a review of defence fire and rescue service and
MOD police members’ NPA in the Bill and formalise the approach
that I announced we were intending to take. The review will ensure that
the issue can be discussed formally by the appropriate parties to
consider the best way forward. However, although the Government agree
with the amendment, it requires some small changes to ensure that it
works as intended. I urge hon. Members to agree to the tweaks put
forward in our
amendment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042446000143" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/debtext/130424-0002.htm#13042446000143">I
will explain briefly why the wording of the Government’s
amendment differs slightly from that proposed in the other place.
First, we have made a small change to  the nature of what must
be reported on in order to make it more precise and legally
certain. Secondly, the names of the work forces were incorrect. The
reference to the “Defence Fire and Rescue Service” has
been adjusted to make it consistent with the terms of other legislation
that describes the same work force.</hs_Para>

the amendment passed to us from the other place seems to confer a
double role on the Secretary of State for Defence, as he would be
included by both references. My right hon. Friend is a very busy man.
It cannot be right to require him both to prepare and to lay a report
in conjunction with himself—that would defy the laws of physics.
I assume that was unintentional, and it is easily rectified by
Government amendment
(a).</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042446000145" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/debtext/130424-0002.htm#13042446000145">Finally<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T13:35:21"></hs_TimeCode>,
and most importantly, it is unclear when the amendment is to come into
force. The Opposition in the other place have called for the review to
be completed within six months. I am keen to address the House on that
point, because I believe that there has been some confusion about
whether that means six months from the date of Royal Assent, or six
months after section 9 comes into effect. The Opposition’s
amendment would require a review within six months of the Act coming
into force. However, the Act will be brought into force in stages and
some sections might not be commenced for more than a year. We do not
intend section 9 to be one of those stages.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=906?><hs_Para UID="13042446000146" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/debtext/130424-0002.htm#13042446000146">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T13:39:27"></hs_TimeCode>
Government’s amendment proposes that the review period should be
six months from when clause 9, which relates to the state pension age
link, comes into force. That provision alters the normal pension ages
for those work forces, so that is where the focus should be. It is our
intention that the clause should be commenced as early as possible.
Standard Government rules require that provisions in a Bill are not
commenced until two months after Royal Assent unless the Bill itself
provides for earlier commencement, as

should all remember that the key effect of the review is likely to be
felt in 2015, which is when the new schemes are brought in, but the
important point is that there will be no delay. The Government have
every incentive to resolve the terms and conditions of the MOD police
and the defence fire and rescue service as soon as possible, since they
will be needed to design and implement the new scheme, which will cater

already ticking and a delay would make implementation of the schemes
all the more challenging. Moreover, I should emphasise that the time
scale is already much tighter than that which Members requested during
our debate on Monday. My colleague Lord Newby stated yesterday that the
Government would not kick the review into the long grass. I reiterate
that statement today and fully endorse his comments. I give the House
my assurance that the MOD and the Treasury will work to ensure not only
that clause 9 and the new clause set out in our amendment are commenced
as soon as possible, but that preliminary work on the review will start
before the new clause is commenced. I hope that hon. Members will agree
that rejecting the amendment passed to us for consideration from the

refined version is the most sensible way
forward.</hs_Para>

make the point in passing that it was a little unwarranted for the
Government to tell the Lords that it was not allowed to continue with

have three principal questions on which I would like the
Minister’s reassurance, although he has addressed them in part.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T13:42:46"></hs_TimeCode>First—the
hon. Member for Colchester (Sir Bob Russell) alluded to this—the
Lords felt that it was important that Treasury Ministers and the
Secretary of State for Defence should undertake the review jointly,
that it should not be brushed off to one Department or the other, or to
a third, independent reviewer, and that it should be the
Government’s set of conclusions. Sometimes Treasury documents
refer to a Secretary of State and sometimes they refer to the
Chancellor of the Exchequer. I sensed from what the Minister said that
both Departments would be involved in the review. Will he give that
reassurance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T13:43:24"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T13:43:27"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042446000159" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/debtext/130424-0002.htm#13042446000159">Secondly,
when will we get the review? The Minister said that it is not normal
practice to refer to Royal Assent as the date that triggers the
announcement of how many months it will take before reports and reviews
will be produced. I am not sure whether I agree with him, but I will go
with it on this occasion, given that he 
<?notus-xml column=908?>has spoken in the spirit of compromise today. The Minister said that the
process would start as soon as possible. I got the impression that he
was implicitly saying that it would take two months or similar to
trigger clause 9 and then six months thereafter. He implied that we
would get the review at the end of this calendar year, so it would be
helpful if he could confirm that general time frame. He also responded
to the intervention by

a source of anxiety since our debate on Monday—the Minister has
not touched on this—has been the question of the abatement of
MOD firefighter and police pay as part of the necessary adjustment to
ensure parity between the civilian and civil service pension schemes.
Obviously, it would be unfair to deduct a sum from the pay of MOD
firefighters and police at source—that seems to be the case
historically—as well as to ask them to pay again when additional
contributions begin under the new scheme. Will the Minister assure us
that that discrepancy will be properly addressed in the review? The
risk of a duplication of contributions would be unfair and there is
some anxiety about this. The level of the abatement needs properly to
reflect the relative value of benefits in the new scheme. This is a
complex point, but it would help if the Minister could assure us that
the abatement issue will be drawn to a
conclusion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T13:45:38"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T13:45:38"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T13:45:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13042446000299" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/debtext/130424-0002.htm#13042446000299">1.45

They are asking to be put in a position similar to those who do similar

services. My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T13:48:09"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Colchester (Sir Bob Russell) made the
obvious point about the logic of that position when he said earlier
this week that the argument in favour of Ministry of Defence
firefighters and police and rescue people retiring at 60, as is the
case in the civilian services, is, bluntly, that they do dangerous jobs
that require them to be particularly fit. The argument that they can be
expected to do their job properly and protect themselves and others
after they reach 60 has not been made.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T13:48:50"></hs_TimeCode> are all in
favour of more flexible ages of retirement. I buy the argument that the
retirement age has to go up, both in general and in relation to public
servants, and I support the Government’s proposals, but we have
to accept that the time when people are not fit enough to do certain
jobs will come earlier than
others<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T13:49:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042446000165" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/debtext/130424-0002.htm#13042446000165">I
have a few questions. The Bill’s provisions will commence when
it is enacted, but that does not apply to those in clause 9—the
pension age provisions—which will be subject to an announcement
by the Chancellor or a Treasury Minister at a later date. That is a
perfectly normal procedure. Will the Minister explain in his response
to the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T13:49:43"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie) when he expects that
announcement to be made? That will be of wider interest, because it is

I ask the Minister to accept that some of the facts and figures that he
has used, which I think have also been used by the Government in the
other place, are not accepted as facts and may be misinformed. I am not
accusing the Minister of doing that wilfully. For example, he has made
the fairly strong argument that an 8% increase in contributions would
be required from these firefighers, rescue workers and police to fund a
pension age of 60. The workers say that it would be a very small figure
of about

ties in to my third question. It is important that we take into account
what this change would cost the Treasury and the taxpayer. The
Government have in both Houses given the estimate of £10 million
a year. The people who have come to see me have argued that the sum
will be much smaller and may be in the order of £2 million a
year. I do not pretend to be an expert on these issues, but I am sure
that the Minister will say when he winds up that the Government will
not go into this process with a closed view. It is a negotiation, so
the arguments will be heard and I hope that the true facts will be

has been accepted already in the conversations with the Ministry of
Defence that the pension age for fire and rescue workers and police in
the services can be held at 65 and not rise in line with the provisions
of the Bill, which take account of increasing life expectancy. I want
to reinforce the point that the people who will be affected argue not
that their pension age should held at 65, but that it should be 60, in
line with similar civilian workers. If that age is later renegotiated
across the piece for firefighters, rescue workers and police, that is
fine. I

that I placed in the Minister on the public record on Monday has been
justified. I thank him, those around him and those in the other place
for bringing matters to a resolution that, although a compromise, is
one that I hope we can all live with. In that spirit of concord, I
thank Opposition Front Benchers for their contribution. We should
praise the representatives of the Ministry of Defence police and fire

remain critical of the Ministry of Defence, because if it had been
involved at an earlier stage, we would not have got to the stage where
a resolution was needed. I am still concerned that we are looking at
this matter the wrong way around. It is the fitness of the people to do
these very dangerous jobs that should be paramount, not the retirement
age or the pension. They defend and provide security and fire services
for nuclear installations. I urge the Ministry of Defence,
notwithstanding the resolution of this particular matter, to look
calmly at the security and fire protection that its police and fire and
rescue services provide in the national interest to ensure that they
are fit for purpose. Nobody doubts the courage and commitment of the
individuals concerned. However, as I said on Monday, do we really want
our nuclear installations to be looked after by people of my

contributions is an enormously complex process. Following 
<?notus-xml column=911?>a review by the Government Actuary’s Department, the abatement on
pay rates for MOD firefighters has been reduced
retrospectively from 9% to 7.8% from 1 April last year. The fact that
that calculation has been made only recently and has been backdated is
an indication of how complicated a subject this is. It is important
that during the review, all the calculations are transparent and
independently verified, and that the workers are allowed to ask
questions about
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T13:57:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042446000176" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/debtext/130424-0002.htm#13042446000176">I
am delighted that the Government have listened and brought forward the

good for the workers or for the taxpayer for people doing these
strenuous and dangerous jobs to work beyond 60. The calculations will
show that if the retirement age is 65 or 68 and significant numbers of
people are forced to retire early on health grounds, both the taxpayer
and the worker will lose out. The worker will lose out because they
will not get the full pension that they had expected. The taxpayer will
lose out because the amount that has been paid into the pension pot
will not cover the cost of the pension if it is paid out
early.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042446000177" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/debtext/130424-0002.htm#13042446000177">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T13:59:01"></hs_TimeCode>

Of course, that is exactly what I expect. To give him further
reassurance, I point out that proposed subsection (2)(b) in the

states that the Ministry of Defence will ensure that the work forces in

right hon. Friend the Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark asked an
important question about timing. Perhaps I can add some more clarity.
As I said earlier, the Government intend that the review, which will
take no longer than six months, will commence when the provision in
clause 9 related to the pension
age<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T14:01:57"></hs_TimeCode> is itself

Royal Assent. I am willing to go further, because this is an important
issue and I know that many fire workers and police officers from the

fully expect that to be the time scale. I am therefore happy to commit
to the House that I fully expect the review to be over within eight

originally considered Lords amendments, we recognise the strength of
feeling that exists on whether there should be a specific provision in

the Government explained at earlier stages of the Bill’s
passage, we amended what was initially a “substantial
harm” requirement to one of “serious harm” to
raise the bar for bringing defamation claims. The Lords amendment

that aim, and is now linked explicitly with the serious harm

consider that the approach that we have taken is clearly preferable to
that in the earlier Lords amendment 2 for two main reasons.
First, the use of the words “serious financial loss”

motion has been selected. None the less, I am not prevented
from—and nor shall I be inhibited from—saying a few
things about where we are now. There are plenty of aspects of the
Defamation Bill—which has been chuntering away in the background
in this House and the other place for a few years now—that are
commendable, and other aspects that are utterly harmless; they will not
do any good, but neither will they do any harm. I am disappointed as
well, however—although I suppose that might partly be to do with
my having been first elected to this House 21 years ago and having been
here too long—that the coalition Government have allowed
themselves to create the law of England through a series of backdoor
deals, rather than through any rational and coherent thought.</hs_Para>

were advocating—that it is not in the public interest to have a
financial damage hurdle for companies to overcome that want to bring
proceedings in libel. This week, the Government have changed their
mind—or have had their mind changed for them. I am all for
people changing their mind if the circumstances or evidence supports
that. What I find intolerable—and what I think amounts to a form
of incoherence and political feebleness, and which is little short of
intellectual dishonesty—is for a Government to march their
troops up the hill one week and then to rush down the hill the next
week saying, “We didn’t really mean it last week,”
or “We had not really thought about it,” or “We
are doing this for no other reason than that we are under political
pressure from A, B or C, and we have decided to ask our Government

do not think that is a proper way to create the law of England. If we
want to adjust the law of defamation we can, of course, do so;
Parliament is sovereign and it can do that as and when it sees fit to
do so. On the whole, however, Parliament and this Government will be
better respected if they do so on the basis of having thought about the
matter and having relied on the evidence that supports their case, as

strikes me—and I think it struck my noble Friend

because of the serious harm test that will already exist in clause 1.
The clause will simply have the effect of ensuring that libel claims
brought by corporations generate satellite litigation and become more
costly. Special damages claims are expensive to try, more complicated
and far less easy to settle. Those who chose to defend libel claims
brought by corporations, but who ultimately fail, will have an even

correct factual point, but I think he exaggerates it. The number of
cases involving corporate claimants is small and the damages they
recover, absent special damages, is low. Damages to trading reputation

the case of Wilmshurst, in which he was sued by NMT Medical, would
probably pass the “serious financial loss” hurdle. If my
hon. Friend thinks that he is helping Dr Wilmshurst or those like him
by amending the Bill in that way, I am afraid he is wrong. If he wants

I said last week and as was said in the other place yesterday, the
great and sadly late Lord Bingham said in the case of Jameel that
corporations have trading reputations that ought to be worthy of
protection. A corporation’s trading reputation is a thing of
value. However, the Government and those who support them on this
particular volte face confuse themselves because they have separated
out—no doubt for well intentioned reasons—non-trading
companies and trading companies for the purposes of the amendment to
clause 1. However, trading companies have different types of
reputation, as Mr Justice Tugendhat said in the case of Thornton last
year. Individuals—and certainly companies—have different
segments of their reputation that are susceptible to being
defamed.</hs_Para>

used the example of the BBC last night on “The World
Tonight”, at about quarter past 10. The BBC is a large trading
corporation. It sells things for profit—programmes—but it
has another reputation as a source of unbiased and disinterested news
reporting. It has another reputation as a supporter of good causes such
as Children in Need and another reputation as an employer. I could
libel the BBC in its trading capacity and it might or might not
overcome the hurdle that clause 1, as about to be amended, would
present. However, I could also accuse it of being, let us say, a hotbed
of or a magnet for child sex abusers. That would not necessarily cause
it serious financial loss, but it would most certainly defame the BBC
and undermine its reputation as a place to be employed or a place to go
and visit. Despite the fact that that would cause it serious
reputational 
<?notus-xml column=919?>loss, the BBC would be unable to vindicate its reputation,

clearly experienced in these matters, but he is not satisfied by the
conclusion reached by the two Houses after a huge amount of
consideration over a very long period, with attempts by everybody to

by doing a deal at the end of the day. A Government—any
Government—have to get a Bill through both Houses of Parliament,
and for a long time no single party has had a majority in the House of
Lords. The House of Lords has often intervened to say that it does not
like what the House of Commons is doing, and there have been one, two
or three attempts at the end of the Session to see whether we can reach

Hill who introduced a private Member’s Bill to Parliament some
years ago and in many ways triggered this reform of our defamation
legislation. I also pay tribute to my noble Friend Lord McNally, who
has steered a controversial Bill through many stages. He referred in
his speech yesterday to the fact that it has been through the
pre-legislative stage and the legislative stage. It has been considered
by the Liberal Democrat party; there were conference debates and

Conservatives and Cross Benchers, have worked together on the threshold
for dealing with corporate claims, and we have made progress on that.
Therefore, today is progress along the lines that he wanted, and that
he knows colleagues from all three parties wanted. He pretends to be
naïve—which he is not—about the way these things
work, whether or not there is a coalition Government. At the end of a
political process in Parliament, negotiations take place in the public
light and also behind the scenes. As he knows perfectly well, that has
happened with all three parties to try to get to the most agreeable and
consensual place. My party has been as much a part of that process as
the Labour party and the Conservatives in arriving at this

with a local authority, which effectively stated that local authorities
cannot generally sue to protect their reputation because they are
public authorities. However, as I think everybody has agreed in both
Houses, common law will evolve, which does not stop it being dealt with
by further judgments of the courts across the United Kingdom. In light
of the Localism Act 2011, there may be further definitions of a public

public authority work. That business remains unaltered by the Lords

want to tell the story of Richard Doll, who drank too much college beer
when applying to study mathematics at Trinity college, Cambridge. He
did not get chosen, so he went to St Thomas’ instead. He had an
interest in asthma and lung diseases. In 1950, he did a quick study on
whether motor fumes or tarmac caused lung cancer, as was suspected at
the time. He and his colleague, Bradford Hill, discovered that the
common factor was smoking. They did not show until 1955 beyond any
doubt what had first been suspected by German scientists in the 1930s,
namely that, if a person smokes 25 cigarettes a day, their chances of
developing lung cancer or associated serious illnesses increased by 25
or 50 times—I forget the actual
figure.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042446000257" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/debtext/130424-0002.htm#13042446000257">If
the too-frequent current habit of commercial companies suing for damage
had been prevalent when Richard Doll published his material, I suspect
that the tobacco companies would have shut him down. When he later came
out with the proposed link, which was proved, between asbestos and
serious lung conditions, the same thing might have happened. One vital
question is how we protect scientific speculation and the publishing of
preliminary findings without the risk of
action.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042446000258" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/debtext/130424-0002.htm#13042446000258">I

research study, finishing it, delivering it to the magazine so it can

board’s abolition in the teeth of opposition from my colleagues

many farmers. Perhaps it was also the result of a fear of another
coalition split or Back-Bench revolt. Today, the Opposition are

reform because,

another 4,700 live in other accommodation, such as caravans. The

accommodation will no longer have to be fit for human habitation, safe
or secure. Workers will not be guaranteed a bed for their sole use, and
there will be no requirement to provide drinking water or sanitation. I

protection for farm workers. In the Labour party, we believe that the
people who pick the fruit should also be able to buy it in the shops,

Glass</B> (North West Durham) (Lab):</Member> The Agricultural Wages
Board is important in constituencies such as mine—rural
communities where there is already much poverty, and wages are low.
Established by the Attlee Government in 1948, the board has served us
for the last 65 years, setting a minimum wage and terms and conditions
of employment for workers employed in agriculture. It costs the
Government little to administer; I am told that it will probably cost
more to abolish than to
maintain.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042450000125" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/debtext/130424-0002.htm#13042450000125">It
appears that the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T15:36:31"></hs_TimeCode>

are the Government so desperate to abolish the Agricultural Wages Board
that they will breach their own consultation and deny debate in the
House? Is the board excessively expensive? Does it act illegally? Is it
so far beyond reform that the only way to deal with it is by abolishing
it in this high-handed manner? It is a public body that costs very
little, yet decides the terms and conditions of agricultural workers.
It sets rates for young workers, including those under 16, who are not
covered by the minimum wage. It also sets out maximum deductions for
tied housing, which affects up to a third of farm
workers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T15:41:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042450000135" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/debtext/130424-0002.htm#13042450000135">Why
are the Government so determined to use whatever means possible to
abolish the board? Their only answer is that it is too bureaucratic for
farmers, so implementing decent wages and conditions for workers on top
of all that form filling to claim EU farm subsidy payments is clearly
too bureaucratic. The Government argue that abolishing the Agricultural
Wages Board, and hence the agricultural minimum wage regime, will
simplify employment practices and remove an unnecessary regulatory
burden. The problem for farmers is therefore nothing whatsoever to do
with the predatory practices of the supermarkets, but all about the
time it takes to read the annual bulletin from the Agricultural Wages
Board<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T15:41:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Government’s impact assessment shows clearly that
workers’ wages will fall by up to
£34.5 million a year over 10 years as a result of abolition. For
new contracts, the change in the value of annual leave, if employers
implement statutory terms rather than those under the agricultural
workers order, will be up to £13 million a year over
10 years. Farmers’ employment costs that represent transfer
payments to the Government and others will fall as wages fall, so the
Exchequer will also be hit, and that is before we consider the cost to
the public purse of paying the working benefits that agricultural
workers will need as their wages
fall<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T15:42:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042450000137" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/debtext/130424-0002.htm#13042450000137">The
north-east is the region that has the smallest number of people working

Nevertheless, 3,360 people in the north-east work on the land. The
abolition of the board will have a direct impact on 60 people in my
constituency. If we force agricultural workers off the land and cannot
attract younger workers, just who do Ministers think will fill these

to the Government’s figures, the abolition of the Agricultural
Wages Board will take £260 million out of the rural economy over
10 years. It will take money out of rural communities, village shops,
pubs and post offices, and away from everyone who relies on those
businesses. Rural communities have already lost local buses, and the
Government are set on a national funding formula for schools that has
no place for a small schools premium, which will result in the closure
of rural schools—hon. Members heard it here first. The abolition
of the board will lead to lower wages, poorer rural housing and an
increase in the number of immigrant workers on the

the abolition of the AWB, as it should have been by statute. The
Government failed to do that and passed the measure through the back

State knows that he should have consulted the National Assembly. These
are important matters for my colleagues there. As has been mentioned,
the National Assembly may outline shortly its plans to keep the minimum
wages and conditions set by the Agricultural Wages Board in a Welsh
context. However, that will involve bureaucracy and cost. It would have
been far better, particularly from a Unionist party, if the conditions
had been maintained across England and
Wales.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042450000176" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/debtext/130424-0003.htm#13042450000176">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:03:07"></hs_TimeCode>

Shropshire is not far from mine; his borders Wales and mine borders
England. If there are different terms and conditions on either side of
the border, the market will flow across it. If the conditions are worse
in England than in Wales, which they may be if the Welsh Assembly
retains the board, the Secretary of State will find that there is a

George</B> (St Ives) (LD):</Member> This is a difficult debate, and I
am grateful to the Labour Opposition for having brought it forward. In
a point of order after the debate on Lords amendments to the Enterprise
and Regulatory Reform Bill last week, I said how strongly I opposed our
having had neither a debate or a vote on this significant matter. As I
indicated earlier in an intervention, we had only limited opportunities
to discuss the abolition of the AWB, among a large number of other
measures, in our debates on the Public Bodies Act 2011. We were
reassured throughout those debates that the House would have ample
opportunity to debate the issue and come to a conclusion on it at a
later stage, when a specific proposal was brought forward under the
powers in schedule 1 to that Bill. I come at this debate on the basis
of a significant disagreement with how the Government have handled the
matter and frustration that we are shutting the stable door after the
horse has bolted. Nevertheless, it is important to have the
debate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:06:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042450000180" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/debtext/130424-0003.htm#13042450000180">I
listened carefully to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and
did not get the impression that the AWB was being abolished because it
was holding back wages and conditions for agricultural workers. In
fact, I still have a strong impression that the opposite is true. I
know that there has been a lot of speculation about the outcome of the
abolition, but I am clear that it is not happening to enhance
agricultural workers’ pay and
conditions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:07:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

also find it difficult to understand the impression that the Government
are giving, given the slogan “We’re all in this
together”, which they adopted in their first Budget and which I
approve of entirely. One good proposal from the European Commission on
the common agricultural policy is to cap the single farm payment at
€300,000 and disburse the money saved in different ways. That
could have been on the agenda under the previous Administration 10
years ago, but we are where we are. On the one hand, the Government are
content 
<?notus-xml column=948?>to pay cheques of more than £1 million to large farmers who,
frankly, usually do not need it. On the other hand, I fear the
abolition of the AWB will mean that more public funds need to be
deployed to pay the wages of agricultural workers who find their
conditions and wages cut, or to pay benefits to those whose standard of
living falls below a certain level. In both cases, a lot of public
money is involved, in one case enriching large farmers and in the other
subsidising poverty in our rural areas. I am not content with that
contrast, and I will draw conclusions about it at the end of my
comments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:09:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042450000182" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/debtext/130424-0003.htm#13042450000182">The
abolition of the AWB was not in the Liberal Democrat manifesto. It was
in the Conservative party manifesto, however, and indeed the NFU made
it clear in the lead-up to the last general election that it was very
much in favour of the abolition of the AWB. That was certainly the case
in my area, so my experience contrasts with that of
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:09:35"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire (Simon Hart) on that point.
One of the NFU’s key asks was the abolition of the AWB, yet when
I raised the issue with farmers, I found that a significant number of
them were opposed to that policy. They were opposed to it for the
reasons the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:10:07"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Member for Wakefield (Mary Creagh) has outlined, such as that it would
leave them in the position of having to negotiate individually. The
collective approach through the AWB provided them with a framework that
enabled them to avoid considerable embarrassment and difficulty or
having to buy-in human resources consultants to resolve things.

it—but not, I am afraid, on this issue. Regrettably, on matters
such as this the NFU tends to resort to becoming a large

large farms that have low productivity. As the hon. Gentleman rightly
says, some farms that are small in acreage are intensively farmed and
have high levels of

larger farms was in the context of the fact that some—although
admittedly very few—receive hundreds of thousands of pounds, or
even over £1 million pounds, in public subsidy. He
cannot deny that that is the case. Those sums are given to a very few
large farms as a result of the arrangements through the single farm

The backdrop to this terrible and petty Government measure is the fact
that real wages have fallen by £1,700 since this Government were
elected. This is a Government who preach about making work pay, yet
raise the national minimum wage by only 1.9% while consumer prices
index inflation is at 2.8%. This is a living standards debate. Instead
of raising standards for farm workers, the Government are engaging in a
race to the bottom on pay and fair treatment.</hs_Para>

first early-day motion I ever tabled in this
House —early-day motion 754, on 6 September
2010—was a motion opposing the Government’s then
proposals to eradicate the AWB. I did it with the full support of the
Labour party, because we on the Opposition Benches know that the AWB
protects pay and conditions for 152,000 farm workers in England and
Wales and is used as a benchmark for others employed in food
manufacturing. Some 3,360 of those workers live in the north-east of
England and 170 of them are in my constituency. Once the AWB is gone,
42,000 casual workers could see a drop in wages as soon as they finish
their next job. The remaining 110,000 could see their wages eroded over
time.</hs_Para>

me ask the Minister straight out: why are the Government taking
£260 million out of the rural economy in disposable income? That
is how much will be lost in sick pay and holiday entitlement over a
10-year period. How do we know that? We know because the
Department’s impact assessment tells us so. The loss to local
businesses 
<?notus-xml column=950?>is not the only part of that cost, which also includes estimates for new
HR costs and litigation for farming businesses that will no longer have
the collective negotiating umbrella under which the whole labour market
is regulated. Indeed, the last time an attempt was made to get rid of
the AWB, even Baroness Thatcher had to U-turn. Not only did she U-turn,
but the gravity of the deprivation that could have hurt hard-working
people did not make economic or moral sense then, and it does not make
economic or moral sense now. We believe that those people—often
they do not own even 1 square foot of soil on the land—should at
the very least be able to afford the food they grow on that land. The
Government should be helping families across this nation to deal with
rising living costs, not actively participating in driving down
hard-working people’s pay—and all this from a Government
who are doubling the nation’s debt in a five-year period, with
accrual of debt outstripping any allegations of debt accrual against us

is the perverse backdrop against which the demolition of the AWB is
juxtaposed—a demolition that saves virtually nothing in Treasury
terms, but which will ultimately bestow a huge tragedy upon rural
communities. I repeat: it is a policy that saves virtually nothing,
while the Government are also, as we know, cavalierly forgoing more
than £1 billion in revenue that could be used for investment or
to pay off the debt they are accruing. Instead, that money is being
sacrificed to give millionaires a cut in the top rate of tax. Those
millionaires could use that tax rebate, stick it with the
Government’s spare home subsidy and buy up the surplus housing
stock in some rural communities. The Government have just shafted

£150 and £264 in sick pay once the AWB is abolished. The
Secretary of State disagreed and said it would continue, but that is as
long as TUPE regulations exist, and that is worth about 90 days in the
current currency. A new employee in that sector will not be

some, including the Secretary of State—that in the early
’90s, all other remaining wage councils and wages boards were
scrapped. There was no rationale for them. Some 26 remained in about
1993, and all were abolished. Many covered sectors such as hotels,
catering, retail, hairdressing and clothing manufacturing, but as the
Secretary of State said, there were also some rather odd-looking boards
such as those for the ostrich and 
<?notus-xml column=952?>fancy feather industry, or rope and net manufacturers. One has only to

return to the 1993 debate, the then Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries
and Food, Gillian Shephard, held a consultation. A small number of us
in the farming industry said that the AWB should go; that it was out of
date and anachronistic; that farming should not be treated as a special
case; and that the AWB read like something from the 1950s. It tended to
be the larger, more forward-thinking farmers who took that view, led by
a large salads company, the G’s group, which was run by Guy
Shropshire. It was not one of my most successful campaigns. The
Government had some 3,500 responses to the consultation, of which only
11 were in favour of abolition. I was one of those 11. That highlights
the massive swing in opinion. Opposition Members have highlighted the
current consultation, but 40% of people who responded to it have said
that abolition is the right thing to

big thing in this debate compared with the last one—it is
important to recognise this—is that the National Farmers Union
is on the right side. For once, it is saying that we should get rid of
the AWB because it is out of date. In 1993, the NFU let down its
members. David Naish, the then president, supported the retention of
the AWB, and he was wrong to do so. The NFU board of directors at the
time was out of touch and behind the curve, but the NFU now recognises
that things need to change and fully supports and endorses the
abolition of the AWB. If even the NFU supports the abolition of the
AWB, it is time to act. Another big change since 1993 is, as many hon.
Members have said, the introduction of the minimum wage, which is yet
another measure that makes the AWB out of date and no longer
necessary.</hs_Para>

AWB frustrate rather than improve career development in the
agricultural sector? The most important thing is the huge lack of
flexibility. The board is based on old-style wage grade rates dating
from the ’60s and ’70s, and completely ignores
the  fact that, in the most progressive farm
businesses,  many people are paid a salary and have management
responsibilities. The best farm businesses have profit shares and
payment by results. Piece rates are increasingly used when people earn
far in excess of the minimum wage rates. Those modern day pay practices
are completely ignored by the agricultural wages order, which can
frustrate the development of more progressive pay policies in the
farming industry and keep it trapped in a 1950s

receive higher remuneration than would be set as a minimum by the AWB,

remuneration.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042450000210" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/debtext/130424-0003.htm#13042450000210"><B><Member ContinuationText="George Eustice" PimsId="5717" UID="13042450000430" xid="1026" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/debtext/130424-0003.htm#13042450000430">George

problem with the rigid pay structure is that, as currently structured,
it can discourage training and career development in small farm
businesses. I will explain why. A small farmer might have two or three
employees. He might not be able to afford to employ someone on grade 2,
grade 3 or grade 4. He might not really have a need for those staff to
be trained to those grades, but might nevertheless take the view that
to aid the career development of a new employee—perhaps 
<?notus-xml column=954?>someone who has just left school and joined their business—he
will give them time off work and support them in proficiency tests and
training. At the moment, if they do that, the next thing that happens
is that they suddenly have to pay that person more money. Is it not
better if that person can develop and train, and has a farmer who wants
to facilitate that, so that maybe, when a neighbouring farm needs
somebody who has the proficiency test skills and a different type of
skill set, they are able to progress and take a job that is higher paid
in that neighbouring farm? The farmer will want that to happen; he will
be happy to encourage somebody and see a career develop. At the moment,
however, we are in a situation where the rigid grade structure
discourages farmers from wanting to have their employees seek further
training.</hs_Para>

completely. Farmers, if they are still in business today, have to do
all sorts of challenging things: they have to negotiate with people day
in, day out; they have huge amounts of paperwork to deal with; and they
have to negotiate and fight over the costs of their feeds, fuel bills

can guarantee that there will still be times when they have to have

farmers employed perhaps 50 or 60 people on what would now be
considered a smallish family farm, and there was of course a need for a
trade union and for the Agricultural Wages Board. It would have been
difficult for those farmers to negotiate with their farm workers
without such a board. Now, however, those farmers employ a tiny number

minimum standards. Crucially, it is also about other conditions of

difference between the statutory arrangements and the board’s
arrangements will be that, in future, it will be possible for a farmer
to pay someone who is off sick £81.60 a week less. Farming is a

abolishing the AWB is an inefficient way of proceeding. I asked the

even I was surprised to learn that its administrative costs were
£179,000 a year and its enforcement costs were £150,000.
That fully functioning Agricultural Wages Board therefore cost a grand

concerned about a race to the bottom. There are tens of millions of
people on the continent who are desperate for work, and the last thing
we want to see as a consequence of these proposals is a race to the
bottom. My experience suggests that even where farmers depart from the
AWB rates of pay—and they often do—it is helpful to have
a clear framework and starting point, varied as appropriate in
particular circumstances, depending on the skill level required, for
example. Something very similar to that was put to me.</hs_Para>

fit for human habitation, safe and secure, a bed for sole use, drinking
water and sanitation. Some might say that all that sounds a bit 19th
century, particularly the idea of a bed for one’s own use. They
would not say that if they had seen the sort of places I saw when I was
deputy general secretary of the old T and G and then of Unite. I saw
some of the most shameful accommodation—and not just for those
employed by gangmasters, as it was sometimes for those employed by
farmers. The great thing about the Agricultural Wages Board is that it
lays down very clear basic minimum standards for the kind of
accommodation that I hope we would all like to see agricultural workers

changes in the legislation governing gangmasters have protected
agricultural workers who are employed by them. The Agricultural Wages
Board has become redundant. It is no longer a necessity because there
are other safeguards, irrespective of the changes in the dynamic of
agriculture.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042450000247" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/debtext/130424-0003.htm#13042450000247">Let
me draw a few comparisons. If an agricultural worker who is charged
with the responsibility of driving quarter of a million pounds’
worth of combine harvester makes a mistake in setting the sieves, much
of the crop may go over the back of the combine. For the farmer, it is
vital that the right member of staff, with the right skills, is sitting
in that seat to protect his crop. I do not understand why a warehouse
worker driving a forklift truck for Amazon does not need extra
protection, but the combine harvester driver does.</hs_Para>

harvester can probably harvest £50,000 worth of crop, so damage
to just 10% of that crop could cost a farm business £5,000 a
day. Again, for the farmer it is vital that the right member of staff
is driving that tractor and helping to ensure that the business is well
looked after. If the right member of staff with the right skills is to
sit on that seat, the farmer must pay him the right amount. The farmer
must give him the right terms and conditions, or else he will walk off
to another farmer.</hs_Para>

level than was provided for by the Agricultural Wages Board.

argument we heard was that agricultural workers are particularly
vulnerable because they live in tied cottages. I do not understand why
the Opposition do not make the same argument for public house managers
who work for a brewery and whose home is the public house itself. Why
do they not require the extra protection farm workers supposedly have
from the Agricultural Wages Board? The manager of a post office often
has a flat above the business. Their accommodation is tied, so why do
they not require extra protection? Double standards are in

Blackman-Woods</B> (City of Durham) (Lab):</Member> I am pleased to
take part in the debate. I have a constituency interest, and I led for
the Opposition in the Committee on the Public Bodies Bill, so it is a
matter of some disappointment to me that in the intervening two years
the Government have not refined their arguments, nor have they produced
further evidence to suggest why the board should be
abolished<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:56:58"></hs_TimeCode>. Given
the catastrophic effect abolition could have on the pay, terms and
conditions of the country’s 152,000 agricultural workers, not
least in my constituency, where well over 100 workers will be affected,
it is important to ask serious questions of the Government about why
they consider it necessary and, in particular, whose interests they are
serving.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042450000254" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/debtext/130424-0003.htm#13042450000254">As
we have heard,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:57:24"></hs_TimeCode> Agricultural
Wages Board was formed in 1948, but its lineage goes back to 1924. The
fact that it has survived so long is testament to its continuing
relevance. My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:57:46"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Jack Dromey) is
right: it has modernised over the years and could modernise further.
The board has demonstrated its importance for protecting the rights of
workers in the sector. Those rights are now very much at
risk<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:58:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042450000255" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/debtext/130424-0003.htm#13042450000255">The
Government’s response when asked why they want to abolish the
AWB is that agricultural workers, like others, are now covered by
minimum wage legislation. Excellent though the minimum wage legislation
is, it does not cover the same range of wage levels and categories as
the AWB. The agricultural industry needs to attract people with the
right skills and aptitude, which is becoming more important as farming
methods continue to develop technologically. The AWB has a grading
system for the terms and conditions of employment for agricultural
workers that reflects the diversity of skills needed and the
responsibilities attached. As many others have said, minimum wage
legislation does not cover the many other areas overseen by the AWB,
such as the standard of tied accommodation, overtime rates, sick pay
and holiday entitlement. Why are the Government abolishing the board,
and in whose interests will it be?</hs_Para>

the Public Bodies Bill was being considered in Committee, far from
Labour Members being out of line, as
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:59:29"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire (Simon Hart) suggested, it
was Government Members who were out of line, because the only people
supporting abolition were some parts of the National Farmers Union.
Indeed, it was only some in the union. We received many representations
from farmers and farm workers who thought that getting rid of the AWB
was an extremely bad idea because they liked the structure that it gave
to
negotiations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T17:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042450000257" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/debtext/130424-0003.htm#13042450000257">We
know that the abolition is not in the interests of not only
hard-pressed agricultural workers, who stand to lose significantly from
the change, but those wishing to enter the sector. I have a very good
agricultural and horticultural training college in my constituency.
From 
<?notus-xml column=961?>talking to several of the young people studying at Houghall, I know
that they are worried about what will happen to
terms and conditions in the sector following the abolition of the AWB.
They are also concerned that they will no longer have a clear career
ladder after leaving college, yet no Government Member has addressed
that problem. We know from Lantra, the skills body overseeing the
sector, that another 60,000 people will soon be needed in the industry
because 25% of agricultural workers are over 55. Ministers cannot
seriously be suggesting that the abolition of the board will make the
industry more attractive to young people, because they have told me
directly that it will
not<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T17:01:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042450000258" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/debtext/130424-0003.htm#13042450000258">The
abolition is not in the interests of the rural economy as a whole,
especially in the north-east, given that millions of pounds will be
taken out of an economy that is already suffering from high
unemployment. The Government’s policies have hit my constituency
hard. The latest unemployment figures show that City of Durham’s
claimant rate has almost doubled in the past 12 months, which is one of
the biggest rises in the country. It will be difficult for people in
the agricultural sector to argue for a better standard of living when
unemployment is so high, because they will be told, “If you
don’t like it, lump it, because there are lots of people in the
county who will be able to take your job.” The Government simply
are not addressing that problem, yet because the abolition of the board
will remove workers’ protections, it will be more difficult for
them to argue for a better standard of
living<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T17:02:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042450000259" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/debtext/130424-0003.htm#13042450000259">I
will conclude, because I want to give others time to speak, but it is
difficult to understand what the abolition of the board will achieve.
It does not cost much to operate, but it protects workers in the
sector, and sets a clear framework for negotiations and a career
structure. It could be modernised in line with the new skills needed
for farming, but one can only assume that the Government, as they have
shown with other policies, are hellbent on driving down the wages of
the low-paid in this country while at the same time giving tax cuts to
millionaires<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T17:03:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13042450000321" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/debtext/130424-0003.htm#13042450000321">5.3

that I still consider myself to be very much part of the farming
community. I was saddened by the way in which the shadow Secretary of
State tried to portray farming and farmers. I took part in a debate on
Radio Devon after she had made a statement in which she went on at
great length about things such as gangmasters, as if to suggest that
every farmer was a terrible employer, but I do not recognise that
situation in Devon or across the farming
sector<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T17:04:22"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T17:04:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042450000261" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/debtext/130424-0003.htm#13042450000261">I
am saddened by how the debate has proceeded. Some 40-odd years ago, I
left school at the age of 16 to milk cows. I started on a farm of 50
acres. With the help of NatWest bank, which charged me enormous sums
for the privilege, I managed to build up the farm to about 250 acres.
During that period, we sometimes employed people, while at other times
we did all the work
ourselves.<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

the farming community have changed so much. Many hon. Members have made
the case that farm workers are extremely valuable because of the 
<?notus-xml column=962?>type of farming that we carry out. In dairy farming, the milking
parlours are equipped with computers which determine, for example, the
amount of feed that the animals have. In the poultry industry, the
buildings are temperature-controlled and farmers must make sure that
the poultry are fit and free from disease. The same applies in the pig
and sheep industries. The entire farming industry has changed hugely.
When one gets on to a tractor, it lights up like a Christmas tree
because there is so much computer equipment in it, reflecting the fact
that it is difficult to operate. Of course we value the farm workers
who operate all that
equipment<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042450000263" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/debtext/130424-0003.htm#13042450000263">The

pleasant land that we all live in and the good, healthy food that we

the farm workers. We produce it together and I am proud to be part of
that industry. I am sick to death of this debate, which is all about
the long history of the Agricultural Wages Board and from where it
started. I would be the first to admit that there was every good reason
for it in those days, but now we have minimum wage legislation and an
industry that has moved on. We want agriculture to be competitive and
to move forward and employ more people on higher wages. We want a much

believe there is a bright future for agriculture. All the Agricultural
Wages Board does is hark back to a past that we want to leave behind.
It is right for us to take these decisions. The figures that we have
show that more than 90% of agricultural workers are, fortunately, paid
above the minimum wage, and we welcome that fact. During the debate,
the sheer negativity from the Opposition has upset me. I would take
their move to defend the Agricultural Wages Board much more seriously
if they had replied to the question—they have been challenged
three times on this—of whether they would make retention of the
AWB a priority of the next Labour Government if this country were mad
enough to put them back into power. I will therefore reply for them.
They are not going to replace it. That is

be blunt about it—to be portrayed in that way. We do not employ
people on poor wages. We want to progress people. During my farming

Board is necessary. I do not believe it is. Why is it the only wages
board left? It was left originally because there was no minimum wage
legislation, but since that legislation has come in, there is no need
for it. Hon. Members are worried that farmers and farm workers who have
such responsible jobs on the modern farm cannot sit down with one
another and negotiate their own wage rates. Surely hon. Members know

own assessment has calculated that abolishing the AWB will take
£260 million out of the rural economy over the next 10 years.
That can mean only one thing: the 80% of agricultural workers who are

minimum wage levels, regardless of the skills involved, not to mention
the antisocial hours and the need to be out in all weather, using

farmers in areas such as rural Wales are both employer and employee,
because they often work on contract for other farmers. They might
sometimes employ agricultural workers, but they or members of their
family might also be employed as agricultural workers. They have said
themselves that it is not about being unable to set pay rates, but that
it is far simpler and fairer in a rural community to say that everyone
will go by the same rate. That is the importance of the AWB, and that

other things that the AWB sets, such as allowances for night work and
being on stand-by, bereavement, sick leave, holiday entitlement and the
rates for under-16s, none of which are covered by the national minimum
wage legislation. In a rural community there are few alternative job
opportunities and it is difficult for agricultural workers to find
alternative employment. The cost of living is often higher because of
the higher costs of transport and fewer opportunities to shop around
for cheaper
deals.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042450000277" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/debtext/130424-0003.htm#13042450000277">Those<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T17:14:33"></hs_TimeCode>

will happen when casual workers start their next job and find that the
going rate is less? For many of them that will mean that their
households incomes fall, so more families will become more reliant on
higher levels of tax credit, which will not be good for the public

rate of pay for their work and a proper wage from their employer, so

because it has wrongly been said that we have already made up our mind
not to re-establish the AWB. When the AWB is abolished, it will, in
effect, be shattered into little pieces. Its mechanisms will be
entirely taken away, but I will tell my hon. Friend what we will do:
Labour has already made clear its proposals under the Fair Work
Commission—which I hope Members on the Government Benches will
support, even though they opposed the work of the Low Pay Commission,
which resulted in the national minimum wage, which they have been
praising today. There will be a new commission that will consider our
emerging proposals on the rural living wage, extending the remit of
gangmaster legislation and tackling the agency workers question, and
thereby addressing the undercutting of pay and conditions in local
areas. That will no doubt be the arena in which our response to the
abolition of the AWB will be developed. I suspect—in fact I can
guarantee—that the Government parties will not be carrying out
any similar piece of work.

many Government Members have said, agricultural workers are a precious
resource in our rural areas. Do Opposition Members not understand that
farmers cannot get a skilled stock man or woman in many areas? They
have to pay them to attract them. Do they not understand that farmers
do not put someone on the national minimum wage in charge of a
£500,000 machine? That is the reality of the modern agriculture

are therefore left with a statutory body that, uniquely, deals with
career progression in one half of one industry—the AWB does not

ways. I want to see career progression, flexibility of contracts and

delighted to have this opportunity to speak to the House on such an
important issue today. Tomorrow is international girls in ICT day, so
it is particularly appropriate that we should mark the occasion by
debating what we can do to attract more girls into information and
communications technology. I understand that the Minister for Culture,
Communications and the Creative Industries,

girls into ICT<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T18:04:20"></hs_TimeCode>.
Celebrating technology, and women’s contribution to it, is one
way of helping the sector to become more representative of the 51% of
the population who do not have the Y chromosome. Right now, women make
up only 12% of professional engineers and 15% of those applying for
computer science
degrees.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042457000584" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/debtext/130424-0003.htm#13042457000584">I
hope that the Government, and particularly the Minister, will do more
than speak at events and offer warm words of encouragement. I

nation, as well as impeding our economic and social progress. As you

I started my degree, 12% of my fellow electrical engineering students

time, and it is indeed depressingly long. The most depressing thing of
all, however, is that although women now make up 43% of GPs, 41% of
solicitors and even 22% of Members of Parliament—a third in the
Labour party, I should add—the proportion of female engineering
students has not increased at all. That is scandalous. In computer

It is certainly the case that the video games industry is a modern one;
one would hope that it would be reflective of society, including those
who play games, but it is not. I shall show a little later that the
figures I have for females in the video games industry are even worse

send no girls at all to sit A-level physics. In 2012, 2,400 female

segregation is at its most extreme in skilled trades such as that of
electricians. Women constitute only 1% of the work force in such
occupations, which is barely significant in statistical terms. I
commissioned House of Commons Library research which has armed me with
a large—depressingly large—number of similar statistics.
It is clear that we are doing much worse in this regard than many of
our European and OECD counterparts. I want to focus on what we can do
about it, “we” being the ICT sector, civil society and,

ICT as an engineer for 23 years. I must emphasise that I was often
fortunate enough to have great male bosses who were determined that
working in an all-male, or almost all-male, environment should not be a
barrier to a successful career for a woman. However, I have known other
managers who were not so supportive, and company cultures that worked
against attracting girls and women into ICT and did absolutely nothing
to help them to stay

year, when I was a shadow business, innovation and skills Minister, I
wrote to 10 of the leading companies in the engineering and technology
sector to ask what they were doing to improve the situation. I wrote to
BAE Systems, Google, Microsoft, IBM, ARM, Rolls-Royce, BP, Shell, Ford
and Jaguar Land Rover. Their responses are summarised on my website.
What was quite amusing was that two of the companies addressed their
letters of response to “Mr Onwurah”. I shall not name
them, but it did make me wonder how accustomed they were to engaging
with
women.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042457000597" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/debtext/130424-0003.htm#13042457000597">Not
surprisingly, nearly every company claimed that it was hiring women in
proportions above the national average. The exception was ARM, which
candidly said that the proportion of women was higher in its divisions
outside the UK, especially in India. Female literacy in India is just
65%, while male literacy is 82%. The fact that India is doing so much
better than we are in regard to ICT gender balance is particularly
striking for that
reason.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042457000598" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/debtext/130424-0003.htm#13042457000598">It
is also striking that IBM did not respond to my inquiry despite
repeated entreaties, while Google and Microsoft responded but refused
to release any figures. As relatively young companies, at least in
comparison with, for instance, Shell and Rolls-Royce, they might be
expected to be at the forefront of gender equality. Both Google and
Microsoft cited confidentiality as their reason for not revealing the
proportion of women whom they employed in ICT. That is rather strange,
because it suggests either that Google and Microsoft do not know how to
aggregate and anonymise such information—which, given that they
are leaders in big data management, is worrying—or that they
have so few women employees that giving the figure would necessarily
identify individuals. That is also very worrying.</hs_Para>

traditional companies were more open about releasing figures, with Ford
giving the most detailed breakdown across different job types. Most
firms said that the main problem was a lack of qualified female
candidates in ICT, engineering and science, and all the firms said that
getting more women into those fields was a corporate priority. Most
outlined steps that they were taking, from overhauling corporate
procedures, for example, making sure that women were on interview
panels, to intervening early in schools to steer girls towards

Onwurah:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes an interesting point. In
single-sex schools, it is certainly the case that more girls study
A-level science than in co-educational schools. There is evidence that
girls do better in a single-sex environment. It is not clear whether
that is due to the presence of strong female role models or, in other
schools, the influence of boys who may be more aggressive in taking
resources. I would say to my hon. Friend that schools should examine
ways of ensuring that girls are engaged and excited. For example, I
know that all-girl science and computer science clubs successfully
engage girls with ICT in an environment that they find comfortable and
stimulating, which is what we are trying to
achieve<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T18:20:10"></hs_TimeCode>. If we
are considering how society socialises girls away from ICT, we could
wonder why 
<?notus-xml column=982?>girls’ toys are generally pink and patronising, and rarely
involve any ICT participation, while boys’ toys tend to be more
centred on engineering, machines and

sample of responses that I received demonstrates just how much is being
done. I am worried that Microsoft and Google, which are role models in
their own right, do not appear to want to let anyone know how

Minister agrees that it is essential that we have such information if
we are to understand what we need to achieve. However, I was impressed
by the measures that many companies are taking to attract girls to ICT,
which suggests that there an increasing desire for change which was
missing during large parts of my career in the industry. Indeed, I was
at an industry event only last night at which several representatives
of large ICT companies raised that issue with me before I had the
chance to ask them about it. Given that I usually raise the issue with
such companies at a very early stage, one can imagine how quickly they

Sunderland Software City in the north-east is setting up a coders

with STEM education. As we have heard, we know that it is critical to
engage girls at a young age, before preconceptions have formed, because

Government are failing to take up that challenge. I suspect
that the Minister will disagree with that, but let us look at the
evidence. The Government ended funding for UKRC, the organisation
dedicated to supporting girls and women into ICT. They claim to be
making the ICT curriculum more flexible, but they are in fact simply
disapplying all standards and requirements of the national curriculum.
They have reduced support for, and undermined, careers advice, which is
the key way of helping into ICT those many girls who have no direct
contact with ICT professionals as part of their background.</hs_Para>

Increasing diversity in the workplace can be more challenging for SMEs

rely on older recruitment methods—for example, employing friends
of current staff, which means that the work force does not become more
diverse over time. Of course, employing one’s friends can happen
in larger organisations, and even in Government. But the Government
should be offering more support for skills

taking to use subjects which do engage girls, such as climate change,

ensuring that primary school teachers in particular have the right ICT

agree with the hon. Lady that we need to start young in encouraging
girls to take up these careers. It is important that young people
should be encouraged not to close off options by dropping subjects that
may be important later. That points to a wider issue relating to
engineering, IT and other STEM disciplines, because those subjects have
the highest earning premiums with regard to A-level, degree and PhD,
and women often lose out on the possibility of valuable and engaging
careers because they do not study those subjects earlier in their
school

who were apparently paying thousands of dollars in bounties for anyone
suspected of being an enemy combatant. After a short time at the
detention facility in Kabul, he was transferred to the US Bagram
airbase and then to the US Kandahar base, before being rendered to
Guantanamo. He arrived at Guantanamo Bay on 14 February 2002, the day
his youngest child, Faris, the son he has never met, was born in
London. The explanation of why he was in Afghanistan is, in my view,
beside the point. I have never met Mr Aamer and have never taken a view
on why he was there. The fact remains that he languishes in Guantanamo
Bay and has been there for more than 11 years without a charge being
brought against him associated with his time in Afghanistan or any
other
period.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042445000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0001.htm#13042445000015">Shaker<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T09:35:11"></hs_TimeCode>

General Mark Martins, chief prosecutor of the US office of military

concerns me for many reasons. First, there is no credible evidence that
Mr Aamer was ever engaged in “hostilities”. Secondly, the
duration period described is incredibly vague. When he responds, will
the Minister say whether the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has an
understanding of what that might mean? Does it mean for, for example,
the duration of the US deployment to Afghanistan? Will it extend beyond
the US troop draw-down from Afghanistan? That is important, because it
might lead to an eventual release

though other such difficult cases have been resolved. For example, the
case of another British resident, Binyam Mohamed, who was often

therefore, to explore other means of securing his release. That might,
I suspect, involve increasing the pressure on the US Government, and
pulling diplomatic levers that have not yet been considered.
Diplomatically, how might the Government respond if another foreign

route, which was discussed in detail with the Foreign Secretary and

Defence Authorisation Act for Fiscal Year 2013. The NDAA regulates
defence spending, including on Guantanamo Bay, and also regulates how
and when detainees can be transferred or released. Before 2012,
granting certifications for transfers was made all but impossible
because of the demanding obligations placed on the Secretary of State
for Defence and others—the bar was set very high. However, since
January 2012, the NDAA has included a new waiver mechanism, which
allows the Secretary of State for Defence to release prisoners if any
risk associated with their release has been “substantially
mitigated”—that is the key phrase used. In October 2012,
the Foreign Secretary confirmed that the NDAA 2012 and its new waiver
mechanism might make Mr Aamer’s release more likely,

not commit an act of terrorism in the first place, whether their
treatment in Guantanamo has inspired them to violence. Releases depend
largely on whether the receiving country is trustworthy and able to
demonstrate that it can significantly mitigate any risks of recidivism,
and I strongly suggest that the UK is eminently trustworthy in that
regard. After all, the US trusts us in a range  of sensitive
areas, for example shared intelligence and co-operation on joint

there are other simpler steps that our Government could take to
mitigate the risk in the eyes of the US authorities. As I have said, if
Mr Aamer is apparently being held under “the law of
war” to “prevent his return to the battlefield”,
could the UK Government not seek assurances that he would not travel
back to Afghanistan, or to any other prescribed country that the US
considered a battlefield, to satisfy the concern? Could travel
restrictions be placed on him? Indeed, I 
<?notus-xml column=307?>understand from his US lawyer that Mr Aamer has agreed

there is an incident such as 11 September, one can understand that, to
protect its citizens, the natural reaction of the state is to scoop up
everyone, put them in prisons or detention camps, and then search for
the evidence to prosecute them or do whatever needs to be done. In this
case, it seems that for 11 years—that is a long
time—someone has been kept in detention, with no charges brought
against them and no trial carried out, which cannot be

Qureshi:</Member></B> I entirely agree with my hon. Friend that we
should try to normalise and humanise all such situations, and to
resolve the conflict. At the end of the day, America is one of the
greatest democracies in the world, under the rule of law, for which we
admire it. The situation has been a big stain on its reputation
internationally, and dealing with all this—resolving the issue
of Guantanamo Bay and, of course, the case of Shaker Aamer—would
help its reputation in the world. That would give it back its
credibility and respect, which it is losing as it continues the
Guantanamo Bay detentions, including of Shaker

I have said, there have been cases in the European Court of people who
have been in custody for a long time, but no charge has been made in
the case we are discussing. As a former prosecutor, I know that
international criminal laws are so wide that if people have committed
an offence—they do not actually have to have set off a bomb or
to have shot someone, but all jurisdictions in the world have the
concept of attempting to commit a crime, where people try but do not
manage to complete the offence—they can be charged. However,
that is not relevant to this case. There is also what is called aiding
and abetting, which means that if people counsel, aid, procure,
encourage or in any form or shape assist in the commission of an
offence, they can be prosecuted. In virtually all jurisdictions, such
people are treated as though they were the main
participator—although sentences tend to vary—so
individuals can be caught even under those
provisions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T09:54:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042445000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0001.htm#13042445000050">The
fact that that has not happened in relation to  Mr Shaker Aamer
and others in Guantanamo Bay, who have still not been charged with
anything and still languish in prison, is, legally, fundamentally
wrong. Eleven years later, it cannot be right that people are being
detained in custody apparently for eternity—there seems to be no

am grateful to our Government for making efforts to get Shaker Aamer
released. The Foreign Secretary has said that he is anxious to get him
back, so that we can repair some of the damage done to him. Britain has
of course said that it will not charge him with any offence. That again
shows that we cannot just have people in indefinite detention, perhaps
for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. In this case, he was
there legitimately, teaching—as he has said—and, because
of the bombing, he tried to leave the country where he was working, but
was then
detained<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T09:55:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042445000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0001.htm#13042445000052">Fundamentally,
this all boils down to the fact that either someone is prosecuted or
they are not. The American Government say that Shaker Aamer is an
unlawful combatant and does not therefore come within the parameters of
the ordinary criminal law. However, international conventions state
that somebody cannot just be held for ever; they must be prosecuted or
released.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042445000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0001.htm#13042445000053">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T09:57:16"></hs_TimeCode>
relation to the frequently used term “unlawful
combatant”, a soldier serving a country in an armed conflict who
is arrested by another country would be a “lawful
combatant”, meaning that they might be treated as a prisoner of
war, and only if they were not part of the armed services of a
particular state but were involved 
<?notus-xml column=309?>in some kind of illicit fighting or wrongdoing would they be an unlawful
combatant. Even so, they are entitled to rights, including to a proper

international organisations have found that the trial system in
American military courts has no transparency and contravenes all
principles of natural justice and fairness of trial. I would therefore
say that even a trial in the American military courts would be wrong,
but even that has not happened. No legal process is being carried on. I
know that that has been emphasised, but why this is happening is beyond

has been suggested, certainly by his lawyer, that one reason Shaker
Aamer has not been released is that he has stood up for his rights in
prison. He certainly did so when he was arrested. There is also the
fact that he is now on hunger strike. He has not seen his children or
wife; in fact, one of his sons was born soon after he was detained and
he has not even seen
him.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042445000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0001.htm#13042445000056">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T09:58:28"></hs_TimeCode>
therefore ask the Minister what discussions there have been with the
Americans about their having breached international laws, which is
clearly happening in this case. I could stand here and give chapter and
verse on all the cases, but I do not want to bore everybody stiff with
the legal niceties. As someone who specialises in human rights law and
is a former prosecutor, I can honestly say of this case and the law in
this area that what is happening to Shaker Aamer is completely illegal,
fundamentally flawed and against all principles of

he was transferred to Guantanamo. During his 11 years of detention,
Shaker has been tortured by US agents by having his head repeatedly
banged against a wall, and has witnessed the torture of another UK
resident. He has spent more than 1,000 nights in a
windowless isolation cell, and, when first detained, he was starved,
kept awake for nine days in a row and chained into positions that made
the slightest movement unbearable. Under those conditions, Shaker said
he was delirious and confessed to whatever the Americans wanted just to
make the torture stop.</hs_Para>

Shaker has never been charged with any offence. The ongoing torture
that is the hopelessness of indefinite detention has resulted in Shaker
embarking on a desperate hunger strike that has lasted more than 70

unless he is released as a matter of urgency, Shaker will die in
Guantanamo. That fact makes this debate more urgent than could possibly

Shaker’s clearance is limited to release to Saudi Arabia. As
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T10:05:46"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Battersea said, that makes no rational sense. Britain has the best
record of all countries in taking prisoners from Guantanamo Bay. Of the
14 people released to Britain, nine nationals and five
residents, none has any involvement in extremism. By contrast, in Saudi
Arabia, which has a vaunted rehabilitation programme, a larger number
have committed subsequent
acts<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T10:06:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042445000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0001.htm#13042445000068">That
is what leads us to the uncomfortable conclusion that the only possible
reason for sending Shaker to Saudi Arabia is to stop him from speaking
out about his abuse—abuse in which the UK authorities have been
complicit. As was reported at the weekend in <I>T</I><I>he</I>
<I>Observer </I>newspaper, Shaker is allegedly able to describe in
detail how a UK intelligence agent was present while he was beaten. He
also claims that a British operative was present while a US
interrogator repeatedly smashed his head against a wall shortly before
he was sent to Guantanamo. According to Shaker’s US lawyer,
Britain’s intelligence agencies have also been defaming Shaker
to the US, passing on false information and accusing him of extremism,
which is also holding up his release. If he is right, Shaker is being
deprived of his liberty on the basis of lies that he is unable to
challenge, which is why he has begun defamation action against MI5 and
MI6. Ironically, such action could be pushed into a secret court under
the terms of the Justice and Security Bill, leaving him once again
unable to confront his accusers or to challenge the evidence used by
the Government against him.</hs_Para>

hope the Minister can answer some of these questions today, including
whether or not UK intelligence agencies have been passing false
information to the US regarding Shaker, the result of which is his
continued detention. Will the Government confirm whether such
information that has been passed was marked “not for executive
action”, by which I mean that it should not have been used for
actions such as holding someone in prison, particularly in illegal
indefinite detention such as at Guantanamo Bay? Have steps been taken
to ensure that any information that was previously provided to the US
should not be used against Shaker on pain of sanctions? What response
has been given to each of the Government’s requests for
Shaker’s return? Has the Secretary of State received letters
that Shaker has sent to him directly, as he is concerned that they may
not have cleared Guantanamo censorship? Have the Government raised with
the US authorities any possible breach of international law by the
Americans, and, critically, will the Minister assure us today that he
can absolutely guarantee that we really can hold our heads high and say

second point has just been touched upon, but I just want to be very
clear about why this situation has happened. The reality is that, as
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T10:10:05"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas) has just said, Shaker is a key
witness in exposing the torture and rendition that were undertaken; it
was not only undertaken by the US but this country’s
intelligence services were complicit with
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T10:10:21"></hs_TimeCode>. I think that
this detention is an attempt to ensure that that witness never appears
in a court, because Shaker would be able to expose all of that, and he
would do this country a service, whereby we might make some attempt to
regain control of this country’s intelligence services, which I
believe have been operating out of control for a considerable number of
years.</hs_Para>

what are the efforts that have taken place? My own view is that the
efforts have been slight. I do not doubt that Ministers have raised
this matter time and again with the US Government. I must say, as an
aside, that I am deeply disappointed with Obama. I am deeply
disappointed that he has not closed down Guantanamo; I am deeply
disappointed that he seems to have put off closing it even further; and
in his second

Guantanamo and release Shaker immediately without any political cost at

I do not doubt the sincerity of Ministers, I am not sure about the
scale of the efforts that have been made and their effectiveness. I
also have to say that even if Ministers have been sincere and even if
efforts have been made, the reality is that our own intelligence
services have been undermining those efforts and representations
throughout this
period<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T10:11:28"></hs_TimeCode>, and that

although I am sure that it does not need restating, I want to place on
the record that Labour is completely opposed to Guantanamo Bay. We
removed all British citizens and all but one British resident from

portfolio includes counter-terrorism. Although national security is, of
course, a paramount concern for both the US and UK Governments, the
continued existence of Guantanamo Bay is also a fundamental human

the Minister share our concern that somebody with indefinite leave to
remain in this country, who has a family in the UK, is married to a
British citizen, has four children who are British citizens, and has
not been convicted of a crime, should be sent to Saudi Arabia, about

increasing desperation of detainees and perhaps a fear that the

have been completely forgotten. Can the Minister assure us that the
Foreign Office remains determined to secure the release of the last
remaining British resident and, more generally, to press for the
closure of Guantanamo Bay? Does he share our concern, which many
Members have expressed in their speeches and interventions today, that
its continued existence undermines the USA’s ability to promote
human rights around the world and, given that the USA is such a close
ally and friend of the UK, risks undermining our credibility on

remains the Government’s understanding that Mr Aamer
has only ever been cleared for transfer, and not release. The US

to prosecute him.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T10:33:40"></hs_TimeCode>It is the

reiterate that the Government continue to support President
Obama’s commitment to closing the detention facility at
Guantanamo Bay. We understand the requirement for detainee transfers
and releases to satisfy US legislation. Previous legislation passed by
the United States Congress—namely, the 2011 National Defence
Authorisation Act—all but precluded transfers out of Guantanamo
Bay. That legislation was renewed by the US Government for 2012 in
largely the same terms, but it allowed for the US Secretary of Defence
to exercise a waiver should stringent conditions be
met.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042445000128" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0001.htm#13042445000128">Despite<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T10:37:01"></hs_TimeCode>
our best endeavours, Mr Aamer was not released in 2012.
Indeed, no detainees were released from Guantanamo Bay in 2012. The
National Defence Authorisation Act was renewed in January 2013. All
Guantanamo Bay detainees cleared for transfer or  release now
require a waiver under the Act before they can be transferred or
released from the detention facility, regardless of their destination
country. The Government continue to work with US counterparts to
consider the implications of the NDAA 2013 for Mr
Aamer’s release. Notwithstanding that, any decision regarding
Mr Aamer’s release ultimately remains in the hands of
the United States Government. I will have a little more to say about

colleagues have raised in the debate, starting with why Mr
Aamer is in Guantanamo Bay, which is the central question. I will say
what I said before: he is not being held by the United Kingdom, so we
do not have a reason why he is detained. In our view the detention is
wrong and he should not be there. I make that very clear. The United
States must satisfy itself that it has reasons.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13042445000138" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0001.htm#13042445000138">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T10:42:59"></hs_TimeCode>
is genuinely very difficult to comment on why the United States might
think that Mr Aamer is rightly in Guantanamo Bay. We have to
discuss the detail with the US to seek to secure his release. That is
sensitive, and we do not discuss intelligence matters. We have always
held the view that indefinite detention without review or fair trial is
unacceptable. We welcome the President’s continuing commitment
to closing the detention facility and to maintaining a lawful,
sustainable and principled regime for the handling of detainees there.
Beyond our making it clear that we do not consider the detention of
Mr Aamer to be right or correct, the United States plainly
has a different point of view. The process of our arguing for
Mr Aamer’s release is seeking to persuade the US; to
a certain extent the parliamentary and public pressure in the United
Kingdom adds to that sense of persuasion that the detention is not
right or appropriate. That remains the Government’s
view<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T10:43:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

wrong. We do. It is clear we have a difference of opinion with the

think and what they think is part of the confidential discussion we

use our best endeavour to ensure that that happens. We are continuing
to work with counterparts to try to understand the implications of the

Pawsey</B> (Rugby) (Con):</Member> It is a great pleasure to speak
under your chairmanship, Mr Robertson. I secured the debate to
highlight the importance of packaging materials in reducing food waste.
I acknowledge that the hon. Member for Bristol East (Kerry McCarthy),
whom I am pleased to see in her place, introduced the Food Waste Bill
last March. She began and has continued a campaign to ensure that food
that is safe to use but not saleable by supermarkets and manufacturers
is donated to charities. My remarks will consider a slightly different
side of the debate on food waste, focusing on how food waste can be
reduced, and particularly the role that packaging can play in achieving
that objective.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13042445000164" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0001.htm#13042445000164">Many of my
remarks will be based on the Fresher for Longer campaign, launched a
month or two ago by the Packaging Federation, to whose chief executive,
Dick Searle, I pay tribute. That body worked in conjunction with the
Kent Waste Partnership under its manager, Paul Vanston, and alongside
WRAP UK, the British Retail Consortium and the Food and Drink
Federation. The campaign was launched on 5 March to show how packaging
not only protects food from damage but can keep it fresher for longer
in our homes, meaning that less food is wasted. The campaign has caught
the public’s attention. On the day when it was launched, it
trended at No. 1 on Twitter, beating the pop star Justin Bieber to top
spot.</hs_Para>

campaign and this debate so necessary? One key finding of research for
the Love Food Hate Waste campaign was that only 13% of the public
realise that packaging can play an important role in protecting food in
the home. The campaign attempts to deal with some public
perceptions.</hs_Para>

the extent of the problem, food waste represents a significant cost to
all consumers. Throwing away food not used in time costs £6.7
billion a year, which is £270 a year to the average household or
£5 a week, a significant sum at a time when many household
budgets are stretched. Many families would rather not bear that burden,
which is unnecessary in many cases. I hope to show how packaging can
help reduce that cost, but to do so, we must change
perceptions.</hs_Para>

for Longer campaign found that 61% of consumers believe that keeping
fruit and vegetables in their original packaging makes them sweat and
go off more quickly, when actually the opposite is true. In a 2011
article published in <I>Food Science and Technology</I>, Dr Paul Butler
points out that only about 19% of food waste is unavoidable, consisting
of things such as meat and fish bones, peelings, eggshells and banana
skins, meaning that 81% of food waste is avoidable. Why is that
proportion so high? Dr Butler concludes in his article that</hs_Para>

problem is that consumers have largely lost touch with food; what it
is, where it comes from and how it is produced. They perceive that food
is cheap and plentiful and can be wasted without any thought as to the
consequences”.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T11:03:41"></hs_TimeCode></hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13042445000168" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0001.htm#13042445000168">There
is concern that the average shopper does not know how to treat
different foods. Should bananas be put in the fridge? The answer, of
course, is no. Should cucumbers be taken out of polythene wrap? No.
What should people do with cheese once they have opened it? 
<?notus-xml column=328?>They should put it back into a resealable pack. The lack of such
knowledge is damaging the environment and, crucially, people’s
pockets. The quantity thrown away amounts to 7.2 million tonnes of food
and drink every year, which the campaign says is enough to fill Wembley
stadium nine times over. Of that amount, 4.4 million tonnes would have
been safe to eat. In addition, the food wasted produces 17 million
tonnes of CO<Sub>2</Sub>, the amount produced by one fifth of all cars
in the UK. It is a pretty substantial problem.</hs_Para>

most worrying statistics is that many people believe that the disposal
of packaging is a problem bigger than or equal to food waste. A quick
look at some statistics shows just how wrong that presumption is. The
CO<Sub>2</Sub> emissions from food thrown away are 166 million tonnes,
while the CO<Sub>2</Sub> emissions from the packaging amount to just
10.8 million tonnes. That is one fifteenth of the amount, a massive
difference. The consequences of using packaging are not nearly as
dangerous to the environment as those of food
waste.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042445000170" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0001.htm#13042445000170">In
2008, the Advisory Committee on Packaging found that, of the total
energy used in the food chain, approximately 50% is used in food
production, 10% in transport to the shops and retailing, 30% is used by
shoppers driving to the shops and storing and cooking food, and just
10% in making the packaging. The case gets stronger. The Love Food Hate
Waste campaign points out that the impact on the environment of
throwing away an apple is six times greater than that of the pack it
comes in; for tomatoes, it is 30 times greater; for lettuce, it is 100
times greater.</hs_Para>

making delivery of products effective, packaging can help prolong the
life of our foods. Increasingly, food is produced at some distance from
where it is consumed, so packaging is critical to ensuring that it
survives the journey from production to consumption. Without packaging,
fruit and vegetables would not be available out of season, and
consumers would have to grow their own food or shop for it
daily.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042445000172" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0001.htm#13042445000172">The

aware that phase 2 of the Courtauld commitment, which set targets for
reducing food and packaging waste, is coming to an end. The target has
been exceeded, although it was low in the first place. It seems to me
from what he is saying that there is an argument for separating the
targets for 
<?notus-xml column=329?>food waste and for packaging waste, and that it would be wrong to try to
bundle up the two in one target. Does he
agree<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T11:09:14"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042445000175" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0001.htm#13042445000175"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mark Pawsey" PimsId="5620" UID="13042445000285" xid="1139" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0001.htm#13042445000285">Mark

environment and the consumer can benefit from packaging; extending the
shelf life of our food is a significant way in which to reduce food
waste. Using appropriate packaging can help in three ways: first, as I
have already mentioned, through the protection of food in transit. The
average household in the UK buys more than 4,000 items of food and
other products every year; in the country as a whole, 25 million
households buy more than 100 billion items, and more than 75% of those
purchases are grocery products, mainly food and drink but also
household detergents, paper products, cosmetics, etc. To meet that
demand, a typical supermarket today carries considerably more than
50,000 product lines, compared with only 2,000 in the 1960s, so a much
broader range of products needs to be distributed, often from much
further afield. Those products have to survive the journey from farm or
factory to the consumer in an undamaged and unspoilt condition; if food
arrives damaged, that only serves to increase the amount of food
wasted. Primary packaging protects products, while secondary packaging
is the cardboard boxes and trays that are used to group the products
together during
distribution<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T11:11:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042445000177" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0001.htm#13042445000177">A
second role of packaging is to prolong life, and the third is to inform
consumers about the contents of the pack, which is fundamental to the
Love Food Hate Waste campaign. The campaign website has hints and tips
about how consumers can store products effectively. It even includes a

consumers how to store food; I shall quote one about

response to such ideas and demands, the packaging industry has produced
a number of new types of pack. One way in which it has dealt with bread
is through smaller packs; fridge packs allow baked beans to last longer
once they are opened; and a great deal of packaging is now subdivided,
sometimes almost into individual portions, so that the consumer can use
some now and some later, which is common for salads and sliced meats.
The packaging industry has made significant strides in reducing food
waste. It has further innovated by introducing items such as zip locks
on cheese packs or breathable fruit and vegetable
bags<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T11:12:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042445000180" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0001.htm#13042445000180">The
Fresher for Longer campaign, on its website, points out eight ways in
which packaging can assist in reducing the amount of food that is
thrown away. Some simple ones include: carrots, peppers and apples
being best kept in the bag in which they were originally supplied,
because such packaging is specifically designed to keep the product
fresher for longer; resealable packs 
<?notus-xml column=330?>for cheese to prevent it drying out; and, during the production process,
the air inside salad containers often being modified to enable the
salad to remain fresher for longer in fridges by slowing down
decomposition, giving customers a longer time in which to eat
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T11:13:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042445000181" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0001.htm#13042445000181">Consumers
can be informed not only through websites but through the packaging
itself, which can play a vital role in advising and informing them how
to handle their food. The nature of packaging enables producers to
communicate with consumers. Some of the ways in which innovative food
producers are taking advantage of that facility of packaging include:
removing “display until” dates, so that the “best
before” and, most importantly, “use by” dates are
easier to see; giving flexibility for some products to be used after
the date, for example, hard cheeses having a “best
before” date rather than a “use by” date;
highlighting on the front of the pack where to store food to keep it at
its best, as many are doing, with most food packs having detailed
storage advice; and moving away from guidance that tells consumers to
“freeze on day of purchase” to “freeze before the
use by date”, so that if food is purchased, kept in the fridge
and not eaten, it can be frozen before the date in order to be used
later. All such initiatives help reduce food waste and show that the
food production and packaging industries are being
proactive<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T11:15:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042445000182" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0001.htm#13042445000182">The
packaging industry has also subscribed to the process of packaging
optimisation, to make certain that less material is used in packaging.
There have been substantial reductions in the amount of material used,
for example in the production of a coke can or cardboard box.
Packaging, therefore, has significantly less impact on the environment
than many would have us believe. At the end of its life, packaging
makes up less than 20% of household waste, amounting to less than 3% of
materials going to
landfill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T11:15:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042445000183" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0001.htm#13042445000183">I

the Member for Rugby (Mark Pawsey) on securing it and on his continued
work to inform policy makers and the House of important issues to do
with food and packaging. He rightly emphasised the importance of the
subject, not only from an environmental perspective but in terms of
household expenditure. Household bills are squeezed at the moment, and
we have the opportunity through a variety of different agencies to
inform people better about where their food comes from and how to use
it most economically; if we get things right, there could be many wins
and virtuous circles. Retailers clearly have a major role to play; they
have the relationship with the consumer that is best suited to
informing people. Everyone, however, has a role, and I shall come on to
talk about the Fresher for Longer campaign and how to continue the work
achieved thus

identified food waste as a priority waste stream for action in their
waste review. Although UK annual household food waste has decreased
since 2006 by 13%, which is more than 1.1 million tonnes, UK households
still waste a total of £12 billion in food per year, which is
about £50 a month for the average family; £6.7 billion of
that total is due to food “not used in time”, which we
think of as wasted by not being eaten when it could have been. The rest
of that total is food waste that we think of as unavoidable, such as
bones, teabags, banana skins and so forth, as described by my hon.

all know that we ought to be wasting much less food, that food wasted
means fewer pounds in our pocket, that the energy and water used to
produce the food has been wasted, and that the transportation and
packaging costs have been wasted. Not only that, but what happens to
wasted food can have significant financial and environmental costs.
Most people want to do something on a personal level about the
situation and we are taking steps to help them to do so. The
Government, by funding WRAP, is working with consumers to help them to
save money and to reduce household food waste. Its Love Food Hate Waste
campaign, which has been referred to, offers information and ideas on
reducing food

Fresher for Longer campaign was developed by WRAP, as was the Love Food
Hate Waste campaign, and funded by the Government in partnership with
representatives from the food and packaging industries and local
government. Packaging is often seen as the problem, but the campaign
shows the important part that packaging can play in helping to reduce
food waste and save consumers money. Throwing away food that is not
used in time is costing the average household £50 a month. Only
13% of consumers realise that packaging can play an important role in
protecting food in our homes. That is the reverse of the statistic that
my hon. Friend rightly raised. We must do an enormous amount to ensure
that we are improving on that.</hs_Para>

we can all pay attention to the storage information on food packaging,
which will help us to store food at home so that it keeps fresher for
longer. Keeping most fruit in the fridge in its packaging can keep it
fresher for a week or more, but around 60% of us take fruit out of the
packaging, and more than 70% of us do not store it in the fridge.
Reclosing packs of cheese and sliced meats helps to stop them drying
out in the fridge, but 13% of us apparently store such food unwrapped
in the fridge, and there may be some changes in the Benyon household.
If bread is stored in a fridge, it will go stale six times quicker than
if it is properly stored elsewhere. As my hon. Friend rightly said, 81%
of food waste is
avoidable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042445000196" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0001.htm#13042445000196">Retailers
and food manufacturers can continue to improve their packaging and do
more to tell consumers about the innovations they are already making on
food labelling and packaging. That will raise awareness of the benefits
and encourage consumers to make use of them. I will give an example.
Marks &amp; Spencer have reduced packaging by 25% over the last five
years, but we must be mindful of continuing to protect the product to
avoid it being unnecessarily wasted. I have an image of naked cucumbers
in my head, and my hon. Friend made a good point about them. Marks
&amp; Spencer has 
<?notus-xml column=333?>introduced individually packaged meat and fish fillets within a larger
bag to enable customers to use only the portions they need and to
freeze the rest without exposing it to the
atmosphere.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042445000197" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0001.htm#13042445000197">The
Fresher for Longer campaign’s materials can be used by all
retailers, brands and councils. That should stimulate further
reductions in food waste and help consumers to make the most of the
food they buy. The aim with packaging should always be to use the
minimum level to protect the product from damage and to ensure that it
maintains its quality during its shelf life. If a product is wasted due
to not enough packaging, its disposal often has a greater environmental
impact than the packaging itself, as my hon. Friend
said.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042445000198" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0001.htm#13042445000198">Some
great examples of innovative food packaging have led to a reduction in
packaging material and its environmental impact, and increased the
product’s shelf-life. I have given the example from Marks &amp;
Spencer, and other examples include vacuum-packed fresh meat and fish
from Marks &amp; Spencer, Waitrose and the Co-op where packaging has
been reduced by up to 75% but produces an extra five days of life. It
is also important to continue efforts to reduce the environmental
impact of any new packaging by, for example, making it easier to
recycle it and increasing recycling
rates.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042445000199" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0001.htm#13042445000199">The
message is that we need the right sort of packaging. The public
perception, often among people who could most benefit, is sometimes
that we need smarter packaging and easier-to-understand labelling but,
as my hon. Friend said, it is most important that people understand
where food comes from and how to use it most effectively. That will not
only benefit the environment, but reduce household
expenditure.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042445000200" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0001.htm#13042445000200">I
assure my hon. Friend that we will continue to work closely with
informed people such as him, the packaging industries, retailers and
others to ensure that across the whole spectrum of food production,
processing and retailing we get the problems as right as we can. It is
not a job for Government alone, and cannot be driven from a
Minister’s desk in Whitehall. There must be solid partnership
working throughout the United Kingdom, and I welcome the opportunity to

both to serve under your chairmanship during this important debate, Mr

diabetes. In 2007, after a chance testing by my local GP, Professor
Azhar Farooqi, who is now the clinical commissioning group lead in
Leicester, I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Before I discovered
that I had diabetes, it was not really a subject that I was aware of.

obesity has become an important political issue. The NHS report,
“Statistics on Obesity, Physical Activity and Diet”, of
February 2012, stated that in 2010, about 30% of boys and girls were
classified as either overweight or obese. The study found that 17% of
boys and 15% of girls were obese, which is an increase from 11% and 12%
respectively in only 15 years. The factors that cause childhood obesity
are a major part  of the debate. A recent study by University
college London found that 30% of the difference between
the  
<?notus-xml column=335?>bodyweight of one child and another can be explained by their genes.
However, genes alone cannot explain the rapidly increasing incidence of
childhood obesity.</hs_Para>

address three key areas. The first is the role of Government in facing
the obesity epidemic head on. That is closely linked to the second key
area, which is the role of food and drink manufacturers. The
responsibility deal was a flagship of the previous Secretary of State
for Health, who is currently Leader of the House. It was launched in
March 2011, but I am sorry to say, it appears to have failed. Voluntary
agreements with industry have made little impact. The headline pledge
to cut 5 billion calories a day is simply incalculable,
arbitrary and misleading.</hs_Para>

Gentleman agree not only that parents have a huge responsibility to
feed their children appropriately and ensure that they get adequate
exercise, but that schools have a huge responsibility to give children
nutritious, non-fattening and not sweet foods—healthy
foods—and through sports, encourage them to take the exercise
that will make them healthy and set in train for their whole lives the
habits of exercising and eating healthily? It is not only about

factor is the manufacturers. Coca-Cola pledged to reformulate their
best-selling drinks to reduce calorie content by at least 30%, but it
has chosen not to reformulate its classic, full-fat Coca-Cola, the
world’s most popular drink. A can of full-fat Coca-Cola has
eight teaspoons of sugar. If the responsibility deal is to be truly
believed, it has to be more robust. The pace  of change among
food and drink companies must  be dramatically increased. The
only alternative to the responsibility deal, in my view, is
legislation.</hs_Para>

introduced a private Member’s Bill, the Diabetes Prevention
(Soft Drinks) Bill, to reduce sugar content in soft drinks by 4% and to
establish a programme of research by requiring manufacturers of soft
drinks to reinvest part of their profits in diabetes research. In 2010,
14.5 billion litres of soft drinks were consumed in the United Kingdom.
According to research by Professor Naveed Sattar of the university of
Glasgow, the average person in the UK consumes between a fifth and a
quarter of their daily calorie allowance through non-alcoholic drinks.
Those are somewhat hidden calories. Professor Sattar said:</hs_Para>

legislate on the issue have been rather unsuccessful. In September
2012, New York’s mayor, Michael Bloomberg, introduced a ban on

has not been limited to sugary drinks. In October 2011, the Danish
Parliament passed a so-called fat tax on foods containing more than
2.3% saturated fat. The tax was scrapped after concerns were raised
about its adverse effect on the economy as increasing numbers of Danes
crossed the border to purchase food in Germany. Clearly, that would be

right. The third key area is the role of schools in childhood obesity.
Healthy eating in schools has been given a real boost by initiatives
such as Jamie Oliver’s “Feed Me Better” campaign,
which successfully attempted to transform lunch-time menus. However,
many schools still have vending machines offering fizzy drinks and
sugary snacks. We should issue an ultimatum: schools should remove all
vending machines by 31 December this year. That would go some way

fast food on their way home from school. For many, fast food is readily

outlets within a 1-mile radius of Rushey Mead primary school. Positive
action has been taken by some local authorities. Waltham Forest

statistics so often that they lose their impact, but I have to repeat
them again today. There are an estimated 3 million people in the UK

condition but are not aware of it. The complications from poorly
managed and poorly treated diabetes are shocking. It is the leading
cause of blindness, kidney failure and lower-limb amputations. Each
week, there are 100 diabetes-related amputations; and each year, 24,000
people die earlier than expected due to complications from the

do we cope with this situation? There are practical steps that health
care providers, local authorities and the general public can take, but
the key is prevention. The new NHS health checks will offer those aged
between 40 and 74 a check to assess their risk of heart disease,
stroke, kidney disease and diabetes. If only I had had that check when
I was 40, I would have discovered six years earlier that I had
diabetes. However, new research revealed by the university of Leicester
on Friday suggests that the checks could detect at least 158,000 new
cases of diabetes or kidney disease, but they are not being taken
up<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T14:47:07"></hs_TimeCode>. I pay
tribute to the work of Professor Kamlesh Khunti of Leicester
university, who was behind the research that revealed the number of
cases that could be discovered. The health check has enormous potential

My mother, before she died, had absolute faith in her local pharmacist.
Of course she listened to her doctor and she got her prescription. On
occasion, she would listen to her son and her daughters. However, the
person she really respected was the pharmacist, and because pharmacies
are on the high street, they are available to local people, so they can
get their tests. The benefits of testing for diabetes in pharmacies are
twofold. Bringing testing into the community because the pharmacies are
there means that hundreds of thousands of people who have not been
diagnosed with the condition can discover whether or not they have it
and, more importantly, it would reduce the pressure on already
over-burdened
GPs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042451000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0001.htm#13042451000034">Finally,

would like to highlight the clear distinction between type 1 and type 2
diabetes. The vast majority of children with diabetes have type 1,
which is not preventable and needs daily treatment with insulin. That
is not to say that diet is not important; some believe that one can put

<?notus-xml column=340?>off presenting with type 1 by adopting a very sensible diet and exercise
regime, but that is not proven. The fact is that there is not a lot
that most people can do to stop it happening, myself—a type 1
diabetic—included. It is going to happen; it is a question of
when.</hs_Para>

majority of people with diabetes have type 2, which is
explicitly linked to lifestyle. Other risk factors include ethnicity
and family history. Type 2 usually manifests later in life, but
lifestyle in a person’s early years has considerable bearing on
later risk. Just to confuse the situation, rather worryingly, we now
see cases of children developing type 2 diabetes, with about 500 cases
diagnosed in the UK to date. It is therefore extremely worrying to hear
that a quarter of children entering reception classes are overweight or
obese—the proportion rising to one third at age
11.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042451000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0001.htm#13042451000041">How<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T14:55:16"></hs_TimeCode>
significant a public health disaster obesity is likely to become cannot
be overstated. On current trends, it is estimated that direct costs to
the NHS will be  £10 billion a year by 2050 and the
wider social costs will be many times that once issues such as early
incapacity, lack of productivity and so on are factored in. An obese
man is five times more likely to develop diabetes than a healthy man.
Obese women are 13 times more likely to develop it than their healthy
counterparts. Diabetes is one of the more costly long-term conditions
for the NHS to deal with, so higher levels of obesity will clearly lead
to greater problems for the NHS, and I am not sure anyone has yet
figured out how to address the human and financial
costs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042451000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0001.htm#13042451000042">I
am<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T14:55:54"></hs_TimeCode> happy to
welcome the work that the Government have undertaken so far on diabetes
and wider public health issues. We have made significant progress in
identifying where the problems are and what is causing them, and the
national diabetes audits have been a great help in that regard. For all
its controversies, the Health and Social Care Act 2012 should allow
health care professionals to integrate what they do with local
authorities, public health services, schools and so on—whether
it happens in practice has yet to be
seen.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042451000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0001.htm#13042451000043">The
overarching problems are clear: a more sedentary lifestyle, and, in
childhood, the attraction of TV and video games; the lack of structured
sport and exercise—especially in schools—and an increased
perception among parents of the heightened dangers of playing outside.
Coupled with those is an increasingly unhealthy diet, exacerbated by
excessively sugary, salty and fatty foods. A difficulty arises when we
consider how to tackle what is at root a cultural problem. France, for
example, experiences the same commercial challenges, with the
availability of unhealthy food and the growth of electronic
entertainment, but has only half the UK’s rate of childhood
obesity. A lot of voices call for quick, and sometimes superficial,
Government interventions, such as banning or regulating sugary cereals,
a tax on particularly unhealthy products and so on. Such policies might
have some value as part of a wider strategy, but on their own they will
not effect the cultural shift we
need.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042451000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0001.htm#13042451000044">We
need to improve the ability of consumers, especially parents, to make
informed decisions about what food to buy and prepare. To me, that
implies a two-pronged approach, with better food labelling at the point
of sale—whether at a supermarket, restaurant or even fast-food
outlet—and better education, particularly in 
<?notus-xml column=341?>schools, both playing a role. We need to look at promoting alternatives
to sugar, especially in soft drinks, which contribute a great deal to

spoke at a diabetes conference yesterday. A concern that came up, which
has been coming up for years, is that previous strategies to improve
outcomes have often failed due to silo working or a lack of integration
between services. In Torbay at least, the health care system has
recognised the serious problems that causes and has integrated primary
and social care services, which gives it a head start when tackling
public health issues. We now need that principle extended to the
policies and services that impact on child health, specifically
obesity. In Whitehall, there has always been a chasm between the
Department of Health and the Department for Education, and it needs
bridging at national and local levels. We would do well to recognise
that prevention works best the earlier it
starts.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042451000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0001.htm#13042451000046">Statistics
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T14:58:52"></hs_TimeCode>show that
children are already in trouble before they get to school, so there is
a role for early years services as well. Whether we like it or not,
public services are driven by financial imperatives and we will need to
address the problems at the funding level, by giving schools, GPs and
all the other interested parties a shared duty to tackle public health
issues and rewarding those that show innovation in their curriculums.

Friend the Member for Leicester East (Keith Vaz) for securing this
important and timely debate. Across the UK, childhood obesity is
soaring and, with it, diabetes. We need to deal with childhood obesity
sensitively and robustly, and we must not make the mistake of thinking
that one solution will fit all children. Obesity in childhood is a
complicated condition and can have many different causes. Childhood
obesity often persists into adult life, and adults who are obese as
children have a higher risk of diseases associated with obesity,
particularly type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases
and, yes, even cancer.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13042451000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0001.htm#13042451000049">The UK has
one of the highest levels of childhood obesity among developed
countries. I will take a moment to discuss what has been happening in
Scotland, because we share that problem. In fact, it is probably
multiplied. In common with most of the developed world, Scotland is
experiencing an obesity epidemic, and the west of Scotland heads up all
the wrong health leagues in Europe. Scotland has one of the highest
levels of obesity among OECD countries. Only the USA and Mexico have
higher levels. Recent figures show that 26% of adults in Scotland are
obese and 65% are overweight. For children, the corresponding rates are
15% and 31%.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=342?><hs_Para UID="13042451000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0001.htm#13042451000050">Worryingly,
the prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increasing rapidly in Scotland, as
well as across the UK, with the largest part of the increase likely to
be due to poor diet and low levels of physical activity, resulting in
increased levels of obesity. Our diet in Scotland was a response to a
life spent in the heavy industries, but it is totally unsuitable for a
career spent in front of a computer screen. Activity levels are far too
low to burn off our daily calorie intake. To give children the best
start in life, early life interventions need to begin before and during
pregnancy, continue through infancy into early years settings, such as
nurseries and childminders, and carry on into primary school.</hs_Para>

constituency of Inverclyde, we have had to take steps to address the
growing problem. Many years ago, we started to educate children and
parents about healthy eating. In primary schools, our classes are in
competition to see who the healthiest eaters are and which are the most
active classes in their school. Our schools have sports co-ordinators,
who introduce and encourage kids to participate in a wide variety of
sports. It is not only that—our schools link up with local
sports clubs to encourage kids to continue to be active after school
and at weekends.</hs_Para>

from my right hon. Friend the Member for Leicester East, we continue to
have vending machines in our schools, but in Inverclyde we have put
healthy foods in them. Fizzy drinks are no longer available in our
schools; the only thing that can be bought from vending machines is
water. Granted, it is difficult to get companies to participate in
that, but our schools have been encouraged to do it off their own bats,
if need be. Fast food and mobile vans have been banned from being
within a one-mile radius of our schools, so that if a
child—especially those in secondary schools—wishes to
partake in fast food outlets, at least they have to walk a distance to
get there and back.</hs_Para>

years offer the best opportunity to put in place healthy behaviours
around food and physical activity, which will hopefully be sustained
into adulthood. Central to that is the involvement of families.
Encouragement must start within families to adopt a healthy lifestyle
and eat healthier foods. Today, 15 out of every 100 primary school
children in Scotland aged between four and a half and five and a half
are dangerously overweight. Diabetes is a serious condition that causes
heart disease, stroke, amputations, kidney failure and blindness, and
more deaths than breast and prostate cancer combined.</hs_Para>

quarter of a million people in Scotland have diabetes. New statistics
in the annual Scottish diabetes survey show that the number of people
with the condition has continued to increase alarmingly by about 10,000
a year. The majority of those people will have type 2 diabetes, a form
of the disease that can be caused by an unhealthy lifestyle and can be
so easily prevented. Across all four nations in the UK, we have seen a
huge rise in childhood
obesity.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042451000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0002.htm#13042451000055">We
know that losing weight is about more than just altering your diet, but
people are different. There are burners and storers. Storers find it
difficult to lose weight, but love food—and love the wrong
food—and do not take to exercise too keenly. Those additional
factors lead to their heading in the wrong direction with their weight,
and that can subsequently lead to diabetes. Let us not assume, however,
that all is well with the thin 
<?notus-xml column=343?>people whom we meet, because poor diet can cause problems. We clearly
need an approach that combines diet, exercise, the education of
children—and, crucially, the education of parents—and
psychological support. We need to increase physical activity at primary
school and carry that on into secondary school. We need to encourage
leisure activities for children to get them involved in sports and away
from their computers and TV screens.</hs_Para>

I said, we need to increase physical activity at primary school and
carry that on into secondary school. The competition for young
people’s leisure time has never been greater. Many prefer to
play a sport on the Wii than try it for real. The issue is not only
with the young, but with the elderly. A unique group called the
Globetrotters has recently been set up in my area. It encourages the
elderly to be more active and its members have, in their
actions—their steps are counted and their trips are mapped
out— walked to the moon and are on their way back.
“Walking to the moon and back” is the group’s most
ambitious trip to date. The Globetrotters is a fantastic example of
what can be done from a perspective of physical exercise not needing to
be that challenging.</hs_Para>

food industry, as we have heard, needs to take responsibility for the
fizzy drinks and sweet foods targeted at children. Healthy eating
patterns, as we know, are formed in childhood and taken into adulthood,
and new research has warned that suffering obesity as a child may take
a bigger toll on health in adulthood than was previously thought. If we
do not put in place a varied approach to tackling obesity, a major and
irreversible time bomb will be ticking away at our children’s
and our nation’s health. Obesity will cost the NHS billions.
Obesity-related illnesses already cost the NHS an estimated £5.1
billion a year. If we are to get to grips with it, we need to do a lot
more together, starting right now, before the problem becomes worse and
the NHS can no longer

me start with the assumption that an obese child is an abnormality in
some sense or other. It is not normal in nature for children to be
obese; what is rather more normal is for people, as they get older, to
find it difficult to stop being obese. If we think of portraits of
obesity in literature, we think of Billy Bunter in the ’40s.
Then, obesity was seen, in a very naive way, as a consequence of
childhood greed, because it was a rare and not well understood
phenomenon. An earlier example is the plump lad in Dickens—I
think he was called the fat boy—who was actually a thyroid
victim. However, such children were unusual enough in those days to be
pointed out; they were not at all a standard thing. Now, as all of us
have recorded, the phenomenon of obese children is no longer a rarity
in an advanced society.</hs_Para>

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T15:10:28"></hs_TimeCode>the Minister and
I attended an event organised by the all-party group on obesity,
although I do not think she was aware I was there. A very earnest man
told us we need to be careful about every extra Mars bar we eat every
day; otherwise, we would increase our weight exponentially and
eventually end up with serious problems. He was particularly horrid
about egg custards and the like. Although what he said was probably
broadly correct, I could not help thinking that it was not really
sensible for any of us constantly to calculate exactly how much we had
eaten, whether we had eaten too much or too little and by how much.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T15:11:05"></hs_TimeCode> was slightly
reassured by some research that came out after that event, which said,

Member for Inverclyde (Mr
McKenzie)<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T15:17:25"></hs_TimeCode>has
just done, that there is more to this issue than meets the eye. If
people become plump, it is not just a question of over-supply; it is
sometimes to do with their glands and their
endocrinology—whether they are burners or storers.</hs_Para>

recognise that this is a complex problem, but the fact of the matter is
that the nations that have an obesity problem, as many advanced nations
do, always have three principal characteristics: a relatively unlimited
supply of food, easy access to that food—in other words, it does
not have to be cooked or prepared in a long, elaborate way and can
simply be grabbed—and a sedentary lifestyle. I do not see any of
those changing any time soon. All three are probably necessary before
nations have an obesity problem, and all three are, in many respects,
here to stay.</hs_Para>

am therefore a little sceptical about claims that there is an easy
solution to this problem. While other Members were speaking, I wrote
down some of the solutions that were advocated, and every one can be
faulted in some way. School dinners were mentioned. I used to be a
teacher, and I used to see children walk past pictures of big, rosy
apples, lettuces and things like that, before going straight for the
pizza and chips. I was sometimes aware of how futile and ineffectual
healthy eating programmes can be. The reality is that school
dinners—many of us have experienced them—have never been
notably healthy or low in calories, because it is assumed that children
need lots of energy to get through the day. Working hard on school
dinners and children’s choices is not, therefore, necessarily an
easy solution.</hs_Para>

tax on fattening food was mentioned, and I am sure you would not warm
to one at all, Mr Davies. The reality is that most food, if we eat
enough of it, is fattening, with the possible exception of lettuce and
something else, which requires more calories to eat it than we get from
it—[<SmallCaps>Hon. Members:</SmallCaps>

some of the problems we have with alcohol is reminding people what the
calorie intake from a glass of wine or a pint of beer actually is.

sport, it is unquestionably the case that one reason why children
acquire the extra pounds is that they move around far less than they
ever did. When I was at school, the dinners were intensely fattening,
but children moved far more, so the obesity problem was not that
marked. One issue, however, is that if the problem starts early, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T15:16:19"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Torbay (Mr Sanders) suggested, and the child is already

on producers and the responsibility deal were mentioned, and a lot can

of salt in our food by agreement with the producers, and nobody has 
<?notus-xml column=346?>really minded. Clearly, similar results can be achieved by agreement
with sugar producers, and there is no reason why that should not
happen. Again, however, people tend to deceive themselves. We are all
familiar with the phenomenon of people who sit there with a beefburger
and chips, but who have a diet coke by their side. The assumption is
that if they drink the diet coke, the effect of the chips and the

right hon. Member for Leicester East mentioned the
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T15:17:30"></hs_TimeCode> of access.
Access to fast food is one of the principal reasons why society has the
difficulties it does. When we go to railway stations or other places
where we are in a hurry to buy things to take on our journey, it is
noticeable that we are presented with larger snacks than we would want,
such as grab bags and extra-large chocolate bars. There is no
explanation for that, other than that the producers are being blatantly
irresponsible and trying to shift more of their product.</hs_Para>

must make a confession that may shock many Members present. As a
student, I once worked as an ice cream salesman, driving an ice cream
van. Our strategy was always to turn up at schools around lunch time,
although my ice cream was of such low grade that the children would
walk past my van. Instead, they would go to the Mr Whippy van, even if
it got there later, so our strategy did not entirely work. However,
Members can see that having food near lots of ravenous children is
attractive to commercial interests, even if it is irresponsible of them
to pursue such a strategy.</hs_Para>

those solutions have merit, but most of them have limitations. It is
tempting simply to say there are a lot of issues—I have said as
much myself—and that we have to press all the buttons to get the
effect we want. I am quite happy to go along with that, I would like us
to concentrate on what works and on what there is clear evidence to
support; that is what I think needs to happen. One serious problem that
concerns me, and which has been mentioned, is tokenism. I have seen
tokenism in action; I have seen schools go through the motions of
telling the children a bit about food and sticking up the appropriate
pictures, but nothing really changes, so the phenomenon persists
because it has not been properly addressed. There is irrevocably an
element of personal and family responsibility. We cannot take that out
of the equation. However, the most successful methods of making it
easier for people to make the right choices must be evidenced,
supported, endorsed and spread. We should not put into practice a
mechanism that might or might not

concern that results indirectly from concentration on the problem in

acknowledge that I am a diabetic because of the lifestyle I had. Hon.
Members may know the experience of being offered a well man check by
the doctor, who always says there is good news and bad news; we say,
“Tell me the bad news first.” The doctor five years ago
told me, “The bad news is you are diabetic. The good news is you
can manage it if you really want to.” That was the thrust of it.
He said “You can ignore this, and shortly you will be on
tablets, and then on injections.” He was not scaremongering, but
just wanted me to know exactly what the condition meant. He said,
“Your diabetes will not kill you, but what will kill you will be
all the things that come from it: your blood pressure and heart, or
amputations and stress levels.” I know fine rightly that I
became a diabetic because of my lifestyle five years ago. The fact is I
love Chinese food; five days a week I had a sweet and sour pork and two
bottles of Coke. It never changed—I like it, and so that was
what happened. As well as that there was all the stress of the
job—previously I was an Assembly Member in Northern Ireland, and
a councillor. I love long hours, and they do not bother me at
all—and that probably applies to every other hon. Member; the
hours were not an issue, but the stress is.</hs_Para>

I had to make changes. Looking back  into my ancestry, no
one—not my mother, father or grandparents—had diabetes. I
was the first in my family, so the cause was clearly my lifestyle. I
make that point because of the question of heredity and the hope that I
would not pass on my difficulties to my children or my wee
granddaughter, four-year-old Katie-Lee. The question is how to instil
in children and grandchildren the necessary control, so that they eat
the right food, in the right way. I was on diet control in January, and
am now on two Metformin tablets in the morning, and two at night; there
is nothing graceful about growing old. We may need tablets to keep us
going, and probably most of us in the Chamber are of that ilk. The

children. That can lead to serious health problems such as blindness
and strokes, to name but two. Some 24.5 children in every 100,000 aged
14 and under are diagnosed with the condition every year in the UK.
Statistics are real to those of us who are focused on the disease and
how to deal with it. The UK’s rate is about twice as high as the
rate in Spain, which is 13 in every 100,000, and in France, which is
12.2 in every 100,000. The league table covers only 88 countries where
the rate of incidence of type 1 diabetes is recorded. There are around
1,038 children under the age of 17 living with type 1 diabetes in
Northern Ireland, and almost one in four of those reached diabetic
ketoacidosis before a diagnosis was made. DKA can develop quickly and
occurs when a lack of insulin upsets the body’s normal chemical
balance and causes it 
<?notus-xml column=348?>to produce poisonous chemicals known as ketones. If undetected, those
ketones can result in serious illness, coma and death. We all know
people who have come through that, and I am aware of people who have
succumbed to

number of people living with types 1 and 2 diabetes has increased by
33% in Northern Ireland during the last five years; that is the largest
increase in the United Kingdom, compared with 25% in England, 20% in
Wales and 18% in Scotland. The total number of adults with
diabetes—those aged 17 and over—registered with GPs in
our small part of the UK is just shy of 76,000, and 1,038 young people
under 17 are known to have type 1 diabetes, which is another
significant rise. Prevalence in the Northern Ireland population is now
more than 4%. Some 10,000 people have diabetes without having been
diagnosed with the condition. It is scary stuff, when we realise what
is happening in our region.

Ireland. He is clearly doing a great job, including setting aside
funding to employ additional diabetes staff—specialists, nurses,
dieticians and podiatrists: all help that a diabetic needs, but perhaps
not enough. All the hon. Members who have spoken have done so with

Shannon:</Member></B> Many parents have made me aware of that. There is
a key role for supermarkets and how they do things. When we go to the
supermarket—let us be honest—we can always find a
multipack of crisps or chocolate. By the way, there is nothing wrong
with that as long as it is done, like anything in this world, in
moderation. Children love a treat, and why should they not have one if
it does them no
harm?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042451000090" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0002.htm#13042451000090">Unfortunately<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T15:30:50"></hs_TimeCode>,
it is more difficult to find a multipack of fruit juice, or bags of
fruit on offer or sliced up. It is much handier for parents to pick up
a bag of crisps for their child’s break than to take the time to
cut up fruit when they cannot afford to buy the pre-cut fruit that they
want. I believe that we need to change that by encouraging supermarkets
to put regular offers on healthy options, and perhaps by looking at tax
incentives to make such options a realistic lifestyle choice, and not
just a fad to go for for a wee
while.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042451000091" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0002.htm#13042451000091">One<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T15:31:03"></hs_TimeCode>

to cook healthily for the family in a quick and cheap way. Women of all
ages learned how they could cook on a budget, but still provide a
healthy and satisfying meal. That is also key, and I suggest that
funding might be set aside for community groups and churches to put on
such classes, which could make real lifestyle changes to entire

cuts can be made so that healthy meals and snacks for families are
still provided. Will the Minister kindly address that and explain what
can be done to educate and help those who simply do not know how to do
the best for their families? A surprising number of families cannot do

conclusion, it is clear that something needs to be done. If there is
one message from every speaker, it is that we all agree that something
needs to be done; the question is how best to deliver that. Many
children and adults will not be able to live a healthy life because of
something that they could have made small changes to prevent. I
congratulate the right hon. Member for Leicester East on bringing this
matter to the Chamber. Many more hon. Members would like to make a

right hon. Friend the Member for Leicester East (Keith Vaz) on securing
this important debate on childhood obesity and
diabetes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T15:33:17"></hs_TimeCode>. We
know the parameters of the problem: on current trends in childhood
obesity, more than half of British children will be obese or overweight
by 2020. A particular concern of mine, as the representative of an
inner-city constituency, is that children in the poorest decile are
more than twice as likely to be obese compared with those in a more
affluent or middle class decile. It is curious that, generations ago,
obesity was a challenge faced by the well-off. We now live in a
society, both here and in north America, where obesity is often a
disease of poverty. I will return to that
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T15:33:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042451000095" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0002.htm#13042451000095">We
also know that diabetes is the No. 1 health threat in the UK, where 3.7
million people live with the disease, and as the Royal College of
Paediatrics and Child Health has told us, care processes and outcomes
for children with diabetes in England and Wales remain significantly
worse than those for adults, which is what makes this debate so
important<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T15:34:22"></hs_TimeCode>.
Thinking on the issue has changed. When I was a child, people said of a
child who was a bit chubby, “Oh, they’ll grow out of
it.” It was not seen as anything to worry about. We now know
that overweight children become overweight adults, with all the
associated health

always, the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T15:34:38"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Member for Southport (John Pugh) made an interesting speech, but he
said a few things that perhaps need amplification. He seemed to say
that it was inevitable that there would be a problem of obesity in
advanced societies. I was in Finland last week, and Scandinavian
countries—Finland, Sweden, Denmark—do not have our
problems with obesity. That is for all sorts of reasons, one of which
is that Governments have taken the issue seriously and made what were
sometimes hard decisions to try to change public
health<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T15:35:12"></hs_TimeCode>
outcomes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042451000097" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0002.htm#13042451000097">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T15:34:38"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Gentleman seemed to imply that school dinners are not necessarily
part of the solution. I believe that, certainly for primary school age
children, being exposed to a range of healthy foods and having healthy
school dinners makes a difference to outcomes for diet. I also believe
that it is worth educating school children about
diet<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T15:35:36"></hs_TimeCode>. There has
been a complete turnaround of public attitudes to smoking over the past
30 years. Many things contributed to that, including Government action,
but it was also due to the role of education and public heath
campaigns. I believe that, in the medium term, we can do that for
healthy eating and

therefore know the parameters of the problem and that, as has been
said, it cannot be fully accounted for by genetics; it is due to a mix
of a more sedentary lifestyle and the consumption of far too many
calories through the eating of more fatty, salty and sugary products.
We should note, however, that one reason why people eat more fatty,
salty, sugary and processed foods than they did when we were children
is that they are marketed aggressively at families and children.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T15:36:48"></hs_TimeCode> want to talk
about pester power. If a child sees endless advertisements for Ronald
McDonald, the parents, even if they know better, find themselves under
great pressure when they are out to purchase foods that they know in
their hearts are probably not the best for their
children.  
<?notus-xml column=351?>An occasional treat is one thing, but the problem
relates to when such foods are not just an occasional treat, but have

Members have talked about parental responsibility. I believe in that,
but we must bear it in mind that childhood obesity and related
conditions, such as diabetes, are issues not just for the child and
their family, but for us as a wider society that is concerned about the
health and well-being of all our people. To be blunt, there is also the
cost of childhood obesity and of diabetes, hypertension and all the
related conditions. I think that fully 20% of the NHS drugs budget
currently goes on drugs for diabetes. It is all very well to talk about
parental responsibility, and about the nanny state as opposed to the
Pontius Pilate state, but I think that the state owes its people a
philosophical responsibility, and we certainly owe the taxpayer a
practical responsibility to do something about the financial

problem is multifaceted and needs multifaceted solutions, one of which
is more parental responsibility. The role of supermarkets, and what and
how they market, is part of the problem. I live in east London, which
is very varied demographically, and I can go half a mile to one
supermarket that largely serves working class people—at the
front and centre it has unhealthy foods—and half a mile in the
other direction to Waitrose, which has fruit and wine. Supermarkets are

Members may remember the case last year of what <I>The Sun</I>
newspaper described as the fattest girl in the UK. She became so obese
that the back wall of her house had to be knocked down, and she had to
be taken out of the house with a crane and taken to hospital. The point
about her is that she had been obese all along, but had been sent to a
health farm in America and had lost a considerable amount of weight.
She and her mother were reported as saying that the day she came back
after several months in the US on a healthy diet, her mother somehow
did not have any healthy food in and sent out for fish and chips. With
some obese children, it is almost an issue of co-dependency. If we are
to work effectively with childhood obesity, we have to work with the
family—whatever that family unit constitutes. Will the Minister
tell us what action her Department is taking on marketing and
promotions, and how it intends to encourage the reformulation of food
products, because we need to reduce the high salt and sugar content of

the role of local authorities, we should—and I have said this

working, because in an ideal world, the education, environmental and
leisure services departments work alongside public health professionals
to achieve better public health outcomes. We must not forget that for
every pound that is spent on things that affect our health, only 10%, I
think, is spent by the NHS. The rest is spent by housing and leisure

Friend the Member for Leicester East on securing this important debate.
I do not believe that there is any one measure that can impact on the
matter of childhood obesity and diabetes. I have touched on some of the
practical issues, but there are many others, such as culture and ideas
of parenting. There is a generation of young women whose notions of
parenting are limited. They hear advertisers say, “Give your
child this healthy bar and that makes you a good mother,” and
they do not have the information to think beyond that. Diabetes is the
No. 1 public health issue facing us now, and childhood obesity gives a
premonition of even worse public health problems to come. I wait with
interest to hear what the Minister has to say about the points that I
and some of my colleagues have raised in this interesting

great success stories. Obesity, as everyone attending this debate

exist. I have no problem with coffee shops, but young people go in and
have a large coffee—not a small one, and we could talk endlessly
about portion control; I absolutely get that point and think that it is
valid—which has syrup in it. It might have marshmallows on top,
and then perhaps another little dollop of cream, because it is just a
snack, a treat or elevenses. “And by the way”, they say,

issue of obesity.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T15:53:44"></hs_TimeCode> is a
difficult subject, because when we start to talk about people’s
weight, they take it personally, and rightly and understandably so.
There are many people who say, “Well, it’s not the role
of Government to tell people what they should or shouldn’t
eat”. They are absolutely right; it is not my role to tell
people what they should or should not eat. However, it is the role of
the Government, as stewards of the NHS, to make sure that the NHS
budget is spent as responsibly and sensibly as possible. We know that
obesity costs, not just in human terms but in NHS terms; it costs
billions of pounds.</hs_Para>

costs in human terms as well, and many of us who see children who are
overweight or obese are upset and concerned about that, because we know
that many of those children will not only suffer from health
issues—that is one of the things that I learned when I went to
see a project in Rotherham, and I will discuss that project in a
moment—but will be bullied. Many of them are unhappy that they
cannot, as they perceive it, join in the sport or physical activity
enjoyed by their friends. There is a real human cost to overweightness
and
obesity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T15:54:50"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T15:54:36"></hs_TimeCode>.

will not repeat the many facts and figures that have quite properly
been given in this debate. However, 1.3 million children are
obese, which is one in six children. According to the national child

just because citizens from south Asian backgrounds and indeed, I
believe, from Afro-Caribbean and African backgrounds have a higher

who are overweight or obese are from the most deprived
backgrounds, as opposed to 6.8% who are from the least deprived
backgrounds. I do not know why, but we cannot use the word

perhaps used the wrong language some months ago when I talked about the
responsibility that falls upon us all as individuals, because we all
take responsibility for our own health and, most importantly, for the
health of our children. I was talking to the Food and Drink Federation
about the responsibility that I believe it, too, bears, for reasons
that I will not go into in too much detail. However, I put forward the
fact that those who are overweight and obese as children are more
likely to come from the most deprived backgrounds. There was much
criticism, misreporting and all the rest of it, and, if I may say so,
some political cheap shots were aimed at me. However, I hope that those
facts speak loudly, and I also hope that everybody takes this away: the
reason why I feel this way with such a passion is that if someone comes
from a poor, deprived background, they have enough problems as a child,
and enough bad things going against them to prevent them from having a
great start in life, without the burden of being overweight or
obese.</hs_Para>

people with the education and knowledge they need, then ensure that
they have the opportunities and options to make healthy choices. We
have the national child measurement programme; we have change for life.

have said, in Rotherham there is a wonderful project, which anyone who
has an interest in this subject really needs to go and see, because one
of the things that is happening there is that everything is integrated.
The project has been up and running for three to four years, and the
NHS, dieticians, GPs, nurses and health visitors all work with schools,
teachers and the local authority—in many ways, it is driven by
the local authority. It is a wonderful experience, where the project
workers do not demonise food, but look with kindness and care at the
causes of problems. They help people, not only with their diet through
the information that they provide, but by helping them to
exercise.</hs_Para>

Francis McGreanery, or Billy McGreanery as he was known, was a
41-year-old man who was shot dead by a Grenadier Guard, a member of the
1st Battalion Grenadier Guards, in Derry city in the early
hours of the morning of Wednesday 15 September 1971. He worked in a
well-known sports shop in the town and quite possibly sold me the first
pair of football boots that were actually bought for me, as opposed to
being hand-me-downs from brothers. He was a quiet, settled,
well-engaged man; I know that from many people who were friends and

location of his shooting is variously described as the junction of
Eastway, Lonemoor road and Westland street in Derry. Visitors to the
city might say that that junction is where Creggan meets the
Bogside<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:01:31"></hs_TimeCode>. The
soldier who shot him was in a sangar at what was known, in the
Army’s terms, as Bligh’s lane army base. In effect, these
sangars and other makeshift army occupations were in the curtilage of
the Essex factory, as it was then known, in the lower
Creggan<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:01:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042458000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0002.htm#13042458000028">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:02:21"></hs_TimeCode>

part of the Historical Enquiries Team inquiry into Billy
McGreanery’s death, show
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:02:20"></hs_TimeCode> not only
was stone throwing and what, in some cases, were described as riots
reported, but there were also some shooting attacks on that army
base<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:02:34"></hs_TimeCode>. One
soldier, Sergeant Martin Carroll, a member of 45 Medium Regiment Royal
Artillery, was killed by a sniper. He died later from the injuries he
received that day. Another soldier, Sergeant James Black, also of the
Royal Artillery, was injured that day as well. I set out that record
because I know that if I only focus on what happened in the early hours
of 15 September, people might say that I am giving some partial account
of the events and the overall circumstances of that

Billy McGreanery was shot dead in the early hours of Wednesday 15
September, there were no disturbances pertaining at that time. Indeed,
he and a number of friends were walking in the area and had to detour

on<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:03:41"></hs_TimeCode>. When Billy
McGreanery and friends stood at this junction, he then fell to a
gunshot from the army sangar at Bligh’s lane. He was taken to
Altnagelvin hospital. Army records show that an ambulance was called at
0043 hours, but the Altnagelvin records show that he was admitted,
having been transported in a van, at 0045 hours. Billy McGreanery died

soldier who shot him, who was later named as soldier A in the context
of the inquest and various other investigations, maintains that he shot
a man who was pointing a rifle at his sangar. The other civilians
present at the time, of course, completely disputed that and gave their
accounts in the subsequent investigation conducted by the Royal Ulster
Constabulary, the police force in Northern Ireland at that
time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:04:54"></hs_TimeCode>. However,
the RUC did not question either soldier A or the other soldier who was
with him, soldier B, because in those days the arrangement was that
soldiers were only 
<?notus-xml column=359?>interviewed by the Royal Military Police, not by the
RUC<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:05:19"></hs_TimeCode>. So the RMP
special investigation branch interviewed the two soldiers and took the
account that a gunman was
shot<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:05:30"></hs_TimeCode>. Of course,
that became the account that was briefed to the media and Government
spokespersons at the time. Of course, Billy McGreanery, a man who lost
his life, was branded as a gunman. That has aggrieved his family for
many years: not just that he was robbed of his life, but that he was
also robbed of his innocent name by the subsequent smearing by the Army
version of accounts, which became the received verdict as far as
Government and others were
concerned<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:06:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042458000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0002.htm#13042458000031">Mr
McGreanery was a single man who had no descendants, but his nephew,
Billy, and his niece, Marjorie Roddy, have fought a long campaign, with
excellent support from the Pat Finucane Centre, to try to have the
facts and circumstances of his death properly established and his
innocence rightly declared. We have seen this, similarly, with other
families, whether the Bloody Sunday families in my constituency or the
Hillsborough families in Liverpool, all trying to ensure that the good

chief superintendent, Frank Lagan, recommended on 8 November 1971 that
the soldier be prosecuted for murder. That opinion was endorsed at RUC
headquarters. However, that prosecution never took place. It should be
put on the record at this stage that, at that time, conversations were
going on between representatives of the Ministry of Defence and the
then Attorney-General for Northern Ireland, Basil Kelly. In papers

Attorney-General told me that he had before him recommendations from
the police that a soldier should be tried for manslaughter arising out
of the death of Mrs Sarah Worthington in Belfast and that another
should be tried for the murder of a man named McGreanery in
Londonderry. His provisional view was that no action was called for in
the Belfast case and that manslaughter at most would be appropriate in
the Londonderry incident. Indeed, he felt that the latter probably
called for no charge at all. He promised to advise us if he felt that
action in either case was called for. I have no doubt that the Attorney
General is doing all within his power to protect the security forces
against criminal proceedings in respect of actions on duty. He must,
however, preserve an impartial approach and is worried about the
possibility of private criminal proceedings should he fail to act in
cases where inactivity could hardly be justified.

since I secured this debate I have been contacted by a family who lost
a loved one to shots fired by the Parachute Regiment on the Shankill

contested the Army version of events—that the soldiers fired at
two gunmen—and they are quite clear that their loved one was an
innocent man, not a gunman. They want to know that, when they receive
their HET report, they will not have to go around begging, busking and
petitioning MPs and other people so that they can get a proper apology
on the record in parliamentary terms. I suggest that the Minister ask
the MOD to consider that, when families receive HET reports in future

the hon. Gentleman has just stated, the HET was set up as an
independent team within the Police Service of Northern Ireland to help
bring closure to all families who lost relations and friends during the
troubles and to bring some measure of resolution to the past. My
Department strongly supports the work of the HET and fully co-operates
with its requests for information and liaison with
witnesses<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:16:45"></hs_TimeCode>. When
HET reports have been made available to us, following permission from
the family of the deceased, we have found them to be as detailed and
comprehensive accounts as are now possible considering the passage of

will not go over all the ground that the hon. Gentleman has just
covered, but it is important to remember the facts, which are that Mr
McGreanery died on 15 September 1971, 41 and a half years ago. The HET
report states that there had been a number of shootings in Londonderry
in the days and nights leading up to Mr McGreanery’s 
<?notus-xml column=362?>death. Barricades had been erected, nail bombs and petrol bombs had been
thrown, and rioting had broken
out.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042458000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0002.htm#13042458000046">During
the afternoon before Mr McGreanery’s death, as the hon.
Gentleman rightly stated, Sergeant Carroll was shot and killed in
Londonderry by a terrorist sniper. He was actually shot and killed in
Eastway gardens, just by the Bligh’s lane observation post,
which he had just left. There is no doubt about
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:17:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042458000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0002.htm#13042458000047">The
HET report goes on to say that, some eight hours later, at
midnight on 14/15 September, Mr McGreanery and others were walking
around Londonderry and approached the same Army observation post. The
group moved forward and a single shot was fired by a soldier. Mr
McGreanery was wounded and later died in hospital. I do not think the
facts are in
contention<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:18:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042458000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0002.htm#13042458000048">The
soldier who opened fire said that he thought  Mr McGreanery was
aiming a rifle at the observation post, and he made a split-second
decision to open fire. I think we can all now accept that that was an
error. That is what the HET report states, and I understand that the
young soldier involved—he was young at the time—has
stated that he thinks it was an error, too. He regrets the shooting,
given what he has now
discovered<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:18:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042458000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0002.htm#13042458000049">The
pathologist who carried out the post-mortem said that Mr
McGreanery’s wounds had been caused by the bullet passing
through his raised forearm, through his chest and exiting his
back:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13042458000126" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0002.htm#13042458000126">“the

one knows why his arm was in that position. The HET does not believe he
was pointing a rifle at the time. Forensic swabs show that he had not
fired a weapon, and I think we accept that he did not have a
weapon<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:18:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042458000051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0002.htm#13042458000051">The
local RUC commander at the time believed, as the hon. Gentleman said,
that the soldier had acted unlawfully. A file was sent to the chief
Crown prosecutor recommending that the soldier be tried for murder.
That was passed to the Attorney-General for Northern Ireland, but he
took a different view, believing that the soldier was acting in the
course of his duty and that it was difficult to see how the element of
malice, “express or implied,” necessary to constitute
murder could be inferred from his actions. He thought that the soldier
could have been negligent but that consideration would have to be given
to whether the negligence was “reckless” and amounted to
manslaughter. In the event, no action was taken against the
soldier<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:19:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042458000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0002.htm#13042458000052">When
the MOD received a request from the family  of Mr McGreanery
for an apology for his death, my Department asked for a copy of the HET
report into his death so that the request could be properly considered.
That is relevant to what the hon. Gentleman said. It is up to the
family to give us the report; we do not get to see it. Similarly, when
the Chief of the General Staff wrote to the family, that was private
correspondence as far as we were concerned. It is up to the family to
reveal it. However, I will come to that
later.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042458000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0002.htm#13042458000053">I
am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree that it is only right, if we
are asked to apologise for the actions that led to somebody’s
death, that we should be able to see the results. We do not see them
until we get the HET report. When we received the report, we read it
carefully and came to the conclusion that, in such circumstances, an
apology was appropriate, because it was clear that 
<?notus-xml column=363?>the soldier involved was mistaken when he thought that Mr McGreanery
posed such a serious threat that it was necessary to open fire. That is
absolutely
accepted.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042458000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0002.htm#13042458000054">Having
carefully considered the circumstances of the death, the Chief of the
General Staff—he is the head  of the Army, which is not
a lowly rank, as the hon. Gentleman implied—wrote to the family
with an apology on 14 July 2011. In those cases in which the Ministry
of Defence has apologised for a death—there have been five, not
including apologies made by the Prime Minister in person for the Bloody
Sunday killings—the practice has been either for the Chief of
the General Staff or a Minister to write, and the apology is given by
either, on behalf of the Government as a whole.</hs_Para>

that Mr McGreanery’s family has accepted the apology but wanted
one on behalf of the Government, recorded in parliamentary records. On
behalf of the Government, I am happy to repeat that apology. As for the
request that it be made publicly, as I have explained, it is normally
left to the family to decide whether they wish to publicise it. Some
will wish to do so, but some will not. As a result of these
proceedings, the apology given to Mr McGreanery’s family is now
on the parliamentary record. As we know that that is the
family’s wish, I am happy that it should be
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042458000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0002.htm#13042458000056">I
am also aware of press reports—the hon. Gentleman referred to
them—about recently released historical documents that have been
interpreted as suggesting that at the time of Mr McGreanery’s
death, there was a deliberate policy of not prosecuting soldiers for
deaths that occurred while they were on duty, and that there was some
cosy relationship with the Attorney-General at the time to facilitate
that. It is not and never was up to the MOD to decide whether soldiers
should face criminal charges as a result of opening fire in the course
of their duties.</hs_Para>

however, important that those contemplating such decisions are provided
with information relevant to the incident under consideration. The fact
that the Attorney-General of the day was prepared to consider
representations from the Army about murder cases is surely entirely
reasonable. I am not a lawyer, I am glad to say, but it seems entirely
sensible that he would want to see as much information as he could to
enable him to consider properly the public interest surrounding those
cases, just as we have the well-established Shawcross exercise, in
which ministerial views are sought on the public interest before a
decision is made on prosecution in appropriate cases.</hs_Para>

know that the hon. Gentleman feels that this was some sort of cosy
stitch-up—I think I have got that right—it is different
from some agreement or policy that the military had a veto on
prosecutions of soldiers, which would have been illegal and for which
there is no

Durkan:</Member></B> I did not use those particular words, although I
can see why they would spring to the Minister’s mind and the
minds of many people. He referred to the Shawcross exercise, in which
Ministers speak to the Attorney-General. This was an officer of the
MOD. The minute of the meeting is supplemented by a diary entry, which
goes into more detail about the exchange between the Attorney-General
and the MOD representative and appears to establish a working
presumption at the time that any killing by a soldier acting in the
course of duty would not result in a murder charge. That happened in
the crucial weeks before Bloody
Sunday<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:24:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042458000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0002.htm#13042458000060"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Robathan" PimsId="387" UID="13042458000143" xid="501" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0002.htm#13042458000143">Mr
Robathan:</Member></B> I am not in a position to either negate or agree
with the hon. Gentleman. If I may say so, there is a difference between
those who act in good faith in the course of duty and those who might
have acted  in bad faith. I think that we can agree about that.
The question is malice. As far as I am aware, there is certainly no
policy that nobody should be prosecuted. As the hon. Gentleman will
know, I spent many years in the Army, and I know of many cases in which
people were prosecuted, including cases in Northern Ireland in which
people who had behaved maliciously were rightly prosecuted for murder.
I agree with that, and I think that the MOD of the time would have
agreed with it as
well.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042458000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0002.htm#13042458000061">Some
may believe that we should hold a fresh investigation into the
circumstances surrounding Mr McGreanery’s death.
Whether that happens is a matter for the Police Service of Northern
Ireland, which would need to consider whether there was any new
evidence in the case. If that were to happen, my Department would
co-operate with such investigations. Just as importantly, we would
stand by our obligation to support fully the soldier who, in this case,
found himself having to account for actions that took place in the
course of his duties some 40 years
ago<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:25:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Durkan:</Member></B> To take the Minister back to the point about how
such cases are handled in future—there will be more—he
referred to the fact that the Historical Enquiries Team does not share
the reports with the MOD; it is up to the family to do so. If the
family share a report and receive an apology, and if they ask for that
apology to be in the parliamentary record, will the MOD make it future
policy to do so by way of a written ministerial
statement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:25:47"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para>

under your chairmanship, Mr Davies. I cannot help thinking that it is
somehow appropriate that you should be chairing this debate. I begin by
declaring myself a lifelong fan of the BBC and its programmes. It has
some of the most brilliant and creative people in the world. I could go
through a lengthy list of the world-class programmes that I and many
others have enjoyed over the years. It is the same with news and

one BBC news journalist recently said to me that they should try to
infiltrate a totalitarian regime that has just built a new monument to
its vanity. He was not talking about North Korea; he was talking about
BBC management. I want to be clear that what I have to say is not about
the people who staff the BBC; it is specifically about the people who
run the BBC at corporate level and how the trust and the executive
work, or do not work. I have rarely encountered such poor management at
any level in any organisation, which is why I argue that the role of
the BBC Trust is so crucial.</hs_Para>

public trust in the BBC was compounded by the woeful lack of active
leadership by the BBC Trust, which is meant to be the guardian of the
interests of licence fee payers. When it should have been leading the

every invoice in excess of £500. This morning, strangely, the

BBC reacted, but only when it was under enormous pressure to do so; it
was dragged kicking and screaming to the point at which it would
undertake reviews. I was in contact with the BBC from the very start,
and I can tell the Chamber as a fact that it did not want to indulge in
any form of review at that time. It got there in the end, but it should
have got there much earlier, which is one of the main criticisms of the
management at the

the widespread public anger in recent years about lavish spending at
the BBC, it is unacceptable that the BBC continues to refuse to publish
the costs of the Pollard review and related post-Savile inquiries.
According to some estimates, they may add up to more than the Leveson
inquiry, which was a public inquiry on a vastly larger scale that
lasted for almost a year rather than a couple of months at best.
However, what is really inexplicable is that the BBC Trust has refused
to challenge the corporation’s management to publish that
information. I understand that Lord Laird wrote to Lord Patten last
month seeking confirmation of how much the Pollard review will cost and
that Lord Patten refused to provide or even find out the information.
When Lord Laird wrote a further letter, Lord Patten did not respond,
and has not yet done so as far as I know. Why should licence fee payers
remain in the dark about the amount of money spent in their
name?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042458000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0002.htm#13042458000079">More<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:37:49"></hs_TimeCode>
seriously, the Pollard report was full of holes from the day it was
published. Lord Patten was keen to jump on the fact that the Pollard
report exonerated the BBC management on the most serious charge, that
of suppressing a “Newsnight” investigation into Savile to
protect the corporate interests of the BBC, but the evidence compiled
by Pollard does not in any way justify a clean bill of
health<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:36:59"></hs_TimeCode>. There is
still no explanation of why deputy news chief Steve Mitchell took the
“Newsnight” Savile investigation off the managed risk
list of potentially controversial stories in November 2011, before it
was quietly dropped by the then editor. Pollard, with no power to
question witnesses under oath, completely failed to get a proper
account of the conversations between the deputy head of news
and  the editor of “Newsnight” before what we are
told was the editor’s personal decision to axe the Savile
exposé. Pollard was particularly scathing about
Mitchell’s convenient multiple lapses of memory during the
inquiry, as well as several other aspects of Mitchell’s conduct,
yet neither Mitchell nor anyone else at the BBC has been fired as a
result of one of the most damaging failures in its
history<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:37:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042458000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0002.htm#13042458000080">However,
the most important unresolved issue, and the one that the BBC needs to
learn lessons from, is whether—and if so, why—the
BBC’s most senior management chose to ignore the multiple
warnings they received about Savile. Let us not forget that Savile was
probably the country’s most prolific paedophile ever discovered,
and yet he worked seemingly unfettered at the BBC for decades. The BBC
is not the only culprit, 
<?notus-xml column=368?>but it is astounding to think that the BBC’s culture, systems and
management could have allowed that to happen, despite the wreckage
caused to the lives of so many young people. It is still rather
sickening to reflect on. The BBC would have emerged with far greater
credit had it confronted the mounting allegations against Savile
head-on. Instead, it kept them quiet for as long as it possibly could,
before finally being publicly confronted and indeed engulfed by the
truth. Years of rottenness tumbled into full view of the
public.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042458000081" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0002.htm#13042458000081">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:39:04"></hs_TimeCode>
issue goes right to the top of the BBC at the time. In particular, the
Pollard report concluded that it had no reason to disbelieve the story
of then director-general Mark Thompson that he knew nothing about the
sexual abuse allegations against Savile or about the nature of the
“Newsnight” investigation until after he left the BBC.
That is frankly implausible. The BBC’s former head of news and
current head of radio, Helen Boaden, told the Pollard inquiry in a
legal letter that she had informed Mark Thompson in December 2011 about
the nature of the allegations against Savile. Shockingly, the evidence
of the BBC’s then most senior female executive on the issue was
given zero weight and was not even mentioned in the Pollard report.
Instead, we were asked to believe that when Mark Thompson was
sufficiently worried to call the head of BBC News to discuss the
“Newsnight” investigation into Savile, he somehow,
miraculously, never gained any indication of what the investigation was
about.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042458000082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/halltext/130424h0002.htm#13042458000082">Thompson
maintains his denials of knowing anything about the Savile allegation,
despite the fact that they were drawn to his office’s attention
on at least 10 other occasions before he left the BBC in 2012. He even
authorised the threat of a libel action to <I>The Sunday

performance and for that of their organisations. It is not in the

such issues. Frankly, an active BBC Trust and an active chairman would
have made it their business to get to the bottom of the matter without
delay. Instead, having spent millions of pounds of public money on
inquiries, Lord Patten and the trust seem content to pass lingering
questions about failures in the BBC’s management into the hands
of its executive. At the very least, that shows an amazing lack of
curiosity by Lord Patten to get at the

public money on getting rid of its previous choice of director-general,
almost via constructive dismissal, and then parachuting in another one
with no open competition or advertisement. The new

a related incident involving some fairly crass behaviour on
ITV’s “This Morning” programme. Ofcom replied in
November 2012 announcing that it had opened an investigation into both
programmes. Nearly six months later, we are none the wiser as to its
conclusions or even the state of its investigation. Again, instead of
effective regulation and oversight, it looks as though Ofcom is happy

ensuring the independence of the BBC, and assessing the views of
licence fee payers. We believe that those principles, alongside the
others set out in the charter and agreement, provide a strong framework
for the trust to ensure accountability to licence fee payers.</hs_Para>

clear, following those events,
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-04-24T16:50:01"></hs_TimeCode>that the BBC

director-general of the BBC. When Tim Davie took on that acting role,
he was very conscious of the need to engage not only with politicians
and the licence fee payer, but with the people who worked at the BBC.
We should not forget, as my hon. Friend made clear, that the criticisms
surrounding the BBC in recent weeks and months are not directed at the
vast majority of people who do a fantastic job for the BBC, and the

and 80 face-to-face meetings with witnesses. The BBC is also carrying

which has been publicly stated, and in May, the BBC will provide a

that apart from redactions required to avoid legal action, if I can put
it that way, all the evidence that was supplied to the Pollard review
has been published. I am sure that people will still have their views

hon. Friend discussed value for money, which is important. Let us not
forget that one of the first decisions of this Government was to freeze
the licence fee until the end of the charter. It was a good decision,
not only to provide value for the licence fee payer, but to force the
BBC to address some of the costs that it could remove from
its organisation. It has done that through the “Delivering
Quality First” strategy, which has made savings of
£700 million. It has reduced the amounts
paid to senior managers, as
well as the number of senior managers.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Glamorgan (Alun Cairns) mentioned
the issue of publishing invoices. As I understand it, the BBC is trying
to make progress on that point. Last year, the previous
director-general, Mark Thompson said that the BBC would release details
of spending by category, which will provide a coherent and transparent
picture of expenditure. However, the BBC believes that publishing
individual invoices would cause commercial difficulties. Let us not
forget that the 
<?notus-xml column=372?>BBC deals with a range of commercial partners that
might not wish to see the commercial terms of their relationship with
the BBC published. I can tell, just by making that brief remark, that I

second-order issue. He is an experienced, former politician, who can
sometimes have a particular turn of phrase, but I have no doubt at all
that he took on the job with serious intent. He intends to run the BBC

that he wants to make sure, as we run up to charter review, that we

important point to make that we are gearing up for charter review. The
BBC’s charter runs out at the end of 2016. The previous
Government conducted a long, three-year process of charter review.
Whether that is necessary in this instant, again, is a matter for
contemplation and debate. What is important about the charter review is
that those important issues can now be subject to part of a formal
procedure. I am certain that

That is central to its very being. The trust’s oversight, as I

making, but that does not mean, concerning recent events, that we
cannot acknowledge that lessons need to be learnt, not only from the
events themselves, but, as we made clear at the time, from the pace at
which they were addressed. The Secretary of State for Culture, Media
and Sport made it clear that she felt the trust could have acted
quicker with the initial inquiries. It is also now
clear—the Secretary of State again made it

2012. The legislation does not distinguish between different hot
takeaway food products. Any food product that is heated to order for a
customer, kept hot or marketed as hot, is liable to VAT at the standard
rate. If it is left to cool naturally, it is not. Toasted sandwiches
have been liable to VAT at the standard rate since 1984, and there is

petition proposes removing or reducing VAT from hot takeaway food
“across the board”. When the UK joined the European
Community in 1973 we signed up to the general agreements that covered
the application of VAT throughout the EC. Under these and successive
agreements, we are allowed to keep our existing zero rates, but we may
not extend the scope of our existing zero rate reliefs. Having excluded
hot takeaway food from the scope of the zero rate in 1984, the UK
cannot legally reinstate
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042449000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/petntext/130424p0001.htm#13042449000026">Some
EU Member States apply a reduced rate of VAT to restaurant and catering
services, which is provided for in EU law. However, such a relief would
necessarily go far wider than simply the treatment of toasted
sandwiches, and would therefore come at a significant cost, which would
have to be met either through increasing other types of tax or from
increased public borrowing. Increasing borrowing would risk raising
interest rates and undermining international confidence, which would
damage the recovery and have an adverse impact on individuals, families
and small businesses, including those in the hot takeaway food
sector.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13042449000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/petntext/130424p0001.htm#13042449000027">This

a total value, with the industrial contribution, of over £85m.
In this financial year 2013-14 the Technology Strategy Board has plans
to invest a further £4.5m into ongoing activity supporting fuel
cell manufacturing and the supply chain and £5m into
technologies specifically enabling the market for hydrogen. Fuel cells

July 2012 from the Technology Strategy Board and the Department for
Energy and Climate Change. The project aims to supply green hydrogen to
the refuelling station for multiple vehicle use and a significant part
of the benefit of the project is the fact that it builds on the
previous investment in this unique facility. The total cost of the
project is £3.5m and it has been awarded a grant of
£1.75m. It is one of five projects funded in a programme with a

payment in 2009-10 upon taking early retirement. 10 staff received
voluntary exit scheme payments in 2011-12 and two in 2012-13 as part of
the Wales Office's programme to deliver efficiencies savings and better
align skills across the Department to ministerial priorities. The Wales
Office is not an employer in its own right. Our permanent staff are
employees of the Ministry of Justice (MOJ), with other staff members on
loan from the Welsh Government and other Government Departments. Some
of the schemes under which Wales Office staff received payments were
offered by the MOJ and the Welsh Government, and the Wales Office
funded only some of the costs arising. The total cost funded by the
Wales Office amounted to £19,250 in 2010-11, and
£238,156.13 in 2011-12. Information relating to 2012-13 will be

Animal Welfare Act 2006, it is an offence to cause any unnecessary
suffering to an animal or to fail to provide for an animal's welfare
needs. On conviction, the maximum penalties available for an offence of
unnecessary suffering are a fine of £20,000 or six
months’ imprisonment, or both. The maximum penalties for failing
to provide for the welfare of an animal are a fine of £5,000 or
six months’ imprisonment, or both. The court may, in addition to
any other punishment on conviction, disqualify the person convicted
from having custody of any animal for such a period as it thinks fit.

November last year, the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for

Grayling), announced as one of his priorities a real drive for a
criminal justice and court system that works effectively and puts
victims first. Work is underway to increase both the effectiveness and
efficiency of the criminal justice system. It will look at the whole of
the system to drive performance and tackle some of the perennial
weaknesses so it is quicker, less erratic and more efficient. We will
be publishing a strategy and action plan shortly which will set out in
detail how we will achieve this.</hs_Para>

views are taken seriously in international forums, and are pleased that
the Arab League has taken this action. This demonstrates the increasing
credibility of the Coalition as a political organisation. It is also a
welcome sign of the increasing support behind the Coalition in the
region. Although international credibility is important, it is
imperative for the Coalition to continue reaching out to and winning
over ordinary Syrians on the ground and increasing its representation
among minorities and women.</hs_Para>

independent judiciary. However, the judicial system is hammered by
inefficiency and a lack of trained personnel and resources. Although
the law requires that a detainee appear before court within
24 hours of arrest, detainees are routinely held for much
longer periods. Trial procedures are reasonable, though many defendants
cannot afford a lawyer. According to human rights groups there have
been cases of arbitrary arrest and detention. We also understand that
prison conditions can be harsh.</hs_Para>

in 2011 following the electoral victory of the Patriotic Front. While
there is an active civil society in Zambia, much of the media is
government-controlled. In February the opposition complained to the
Commonwealth about government violations of democratic space; we regard
some of the claims as exaggerated. Security is generally good, though
there is some crime. For example, there is sometimes unruly behaviour
at political rallies and during by-election campaigns and a Zambian
died during a clash during a local election campaign in November

the risks of asbestos, has established the Asbestos in Schools Steering

requirements and has asked the Committee on Carcinogenicity to consider
and report upon the relative vulnerability of children to asbestos
compared with adults. Alongside this, the Department liaises as

a prescribed list of languages allows a balance between giving schools
a variety of teaching options on the one hand, and maintaining
continuity between primary and secondary language teaching on the
other. We consulted on the question of which languages to prescribe and
the proposed list broadly reflects the languages that primary schools
indicated that they intend to teach. However, it does not restrict them
unnecessarily, instead giving them a choice that extends to Mandarin,
which is important economically, and Latin and Ancient Greek, which
provide an important foundation to a number of modern languages, as
well as covering the major European languages. The languages in the
list comprise a sample of important languages that, each in its own
right, give a good grounding for further languages

methodology for the Pupil Premium, and we published our conclusions

allocated on the basis of current eligibility for FSM; the Ever6 basis
was then introduced from 2012-13. Our report, published on 13 December
2010 following the consultation, set out our rationale. We consulted on
the merits of different indicators as a basis for the distribution of

link between FSM eligibility, both current and recent, and
under-achievement is very strong, and there is overwhelming evidence
that pupils eligible for FSM generally have lower educational
attainment outcomes than their peers. While there is also a strong link
between other characteristics and under-achievement, such as parental
educational attainment, a school's ability to identify eligible pupils
easily and objectively using a nationally recognised measure is very
important in enabling them to claim the necessary funding and to
deliver the educational interventions that their pupils require. FSM
based measures fulfil these criteria more closely than other
approaches.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13042482000054" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/text/130424w0003.htm#13042482000054">Pupils:

teacher supply requirements are estimated each year by the Teacher
Supply Model (TSM). This model takes into account any future growth (or
decline) in pupil numbers, pupil-teacher ratios within schools, and any
policy changes that may affect, for example, the number of specialist
(secondary) subject teachers needed. In addition, the TSM also
forecasts the number of experienced teachers entering or leaving the
profession as a result of retirement or career change. Collectively,
these factors are used to determine the number of new teachers it is
necessary to train in order to supply the workforce needs of our
schools. We initially allocated 34,791 initial teacher training (ITT)
places for the 2013/14 academic year<Sup>1</Sup>.</hs_Para>

supply needs are addressed through the allocation of these ITT places
among a growing number of ITT providers and schools located across
England. There are now more than 240 higher education institution-led
and school-centred providers of ITT (including 38 new school-led
providers accredited in the last 12 months) and more than 800 schools

education and inconvenience a significant number of parents. We will be
assessing the likely impact on schools, pupils and parents of any
strike action by the NUT and the NASUWT, including the strike they have
announced in the North West of England on 27 June. However, at this
stage, it is too early to estimate with any accuracy the exact number
of parents likely to be affected by this strike, which is over two

Confidence intervals have been calculated around the proportions as not
all schools were able to submit curriculum information, and not all
qualifications returns were complete. Qualifications information was
either not provided, or the subject field was missing for 12% of the

Next” programme aimed at attracting high quality career changers
with a recruitment target of 200 in total by September 2013. In the
2011 pilot year 68 career changers were recruited. In 2012, the first
full year of the programme, 106 career changers were recruited. To
date, Teach First has recruited 121 career changers to the 2013 cohort
that will commence training this September, so they are on course to
recruit 295 career changers compared to the target of
200.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13042482000067" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/text/130424w0003.htm#13042482000067">Teachers:

Department were to be informed of such allegations about named
individuals and named employers, my officials would notify the
Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS). It would make no difference when
we were informed. If an organisation removes an individual from working
closely and regularly with children, because of harm or a risk of harm,
it must make a referral to the DBS. If it fails to do so without good
reason, it is committing an offence under the Safeguarding Vulnerable
Groups Act 2006. If the DBS had evidence that such an offence may have
been committed, it would inform the

plans to make a specific graded judgement on the quality of careers
guidance in respect of the school inspection framework and the common
inspection framework. However, in the common inspection framework,
which applies to Further Education colleges, sixth-form colleges and
independent learning providers, inspectors are required to consider how
well learners develop an understanding of careers and progression
opportunities, and their ability to benefit from training and
development opportunities in reaching judgements for outcomes for
learners.</hs_brev>

inspection framework, inspectors must assess how well leaders and
managers ensure that the curriculum promotes successful progression to
the pupils' next stage of education, training or employment. Ofsted
intends to amend its school inspection framework from September so
inspectors take greater account of the quality of careers guidance in
respect of reaching a judgement on the effectiveness of a school's
leadership and

Fiscal has a duty to investigate all sudden, suspicious, accidental,

post mortem are not yet known, the cause of death can be given as
"unascertained, pending investigations", and the actual cause of death
will be entered at a later date. Therefore National Records of Scotland
(NRS) receive notification of suicides more quickly than ONS. In 2011

Overall, our arm’s length bodies reform is on track to deliver
expected running costs of £231 million over the spending review
period and since May 2010, 11 bodies have closed and two transferred to

stories of how communities are now developing innovative solutions to
develop their high streets. We published an update in our

only one person. Where more than one person is responsible for a child
and each satisfies the entitlement conditions, they should decide
between themselves which of them shall be entitled and make an election
to that effect. If they are unable to decide, it falls to a
decision-maker, acting on behalf of the Commissioners for HMRC, to make
a discretionary decision. There are no hard and fast rules governing
these decisions, as every case is different and many factors that have
a bearing on the care arrangements need to be considered. In general,
the claimant who bears the greater responsibility will be awarded the
child benefit. The overriding position is to ensure that the child is
the ultimate
beneficiary.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1304255000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130424/text/130424w0005.htm#1304255000042">The

Gauke:</Member></B> HMRC does not operate any “premium
rate” helplines. All 0845 call charges are based on the tariff
arrangements individual customers have with their service provider. For
many customers, the cost of dialling a 0845 number will be very low or
free; for those using a pay as you go mobile, the cost can be as high
as 31.75p per minute.</hs_Para>

up 0845 numbers they were a cost effective way of improving the
telephone service provided to customers. Since then the telecoms market
has changed, and the tariff arrangements of individual customers mean
that some are now disproportionately disadvantaged by the use of 0845
numbers. Between April and September this year HMRC will migrate 0845
numbers to 03XX, a move which HMRC estimate will save their customers
about £13 million per year.</hs_Para>
