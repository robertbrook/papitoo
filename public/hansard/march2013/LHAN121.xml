Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, since 2010 the Government have announced
successive increases in the personal allowance totalling £2,965.
Taken together, these changes will ensure that more than 2.2 million
low-income individuals will be removed from income tax altogether. The
Government are also taking other measures that will benefit those who
are below the income tax threshold, including the introduction of
universal credit, support on childcare and the pupil
premium.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030662000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0001.htm#13030662000003"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Greaves" PimsId="3545" UID="13030662000707" xid="1111" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0001.htm#13030662000707">Lord
Greaves:</Member></B> My Lords, some 4,300,000 employees already earn
too little to benefit from the increase in the personal allowance this
year—which I fully support—and this will rise to nearly 5
million workers in 2013-14, about 17% of the labour force, of which
two-thirds will be women. How can it be right or fair that a policy
trumpeted as helping low-paid workers does nothing for the lowest-paid
5 million? Will the Government look seriously at new ways to end this
unfair
situation?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030662000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0001.htm#13030662000004"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Newby" PimsId="2095" UID="13030662000708" xid="1358" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0001.htm#13030662000708">Lord
Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, some of those 5 million were paying
income tax until we took them out of income tax, so they have benefited
significantly from the changes that we made. The vast bulk of those
5 million are people in work who are not working full time,
so one of the key things that we have to try to ensure is that more
people are working full time. One of the better statistics on the
labour market—which had a good year in many respects last
year—is that 32,000 people who were working part time and who
wanted to work full time got full-time jobs in the last quarter of last
year.</hs_para>

supporting the poor, and the Government have made it clear that they
encourage people to use it. 
<?notus-xml column=1492?>However, for many people who are poor the key thing is to get into work
and, having got into work, to work the number of hours that are

tax—an ideal which was first put forward by my noble friend Lord
Saatchi—perhaps I may just ask whether they have any plans to
raise the threshold at which people pay national insurance. Many of the
people to whom the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, referred are still paying
national insurance at very high rates, and national insurance is a tax.

million people who may have benefited from the changes have in fact had
to pay extra VAT since this Government came to power? They are all
paying 2.5% extra in VAT. Could we not look for a reduction in the VAT

reduction in the VAT rate makes any sense at this point. A 1% reduction
in the VAT rate costs about £12 billion. If we were to reduce
the VAT rate, we would have to find that £12 billion from

On the first point she raised, if one is self-employed, the only person
you can look to to pay your salary is yourself. If you earn money
yourself, you are able to pay yourself well. If you have a contract
with somebody as a self-employed person, you should be looking to be
paid at least the minimum wage under that contract. However, many
self-employed people do consultancy work of various sorts for a fixed
price or produce goods and the extent to which they earn an income
depends on the extent to which they are able to sell what they
produce<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T15:13:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030662000015" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0001.htm#13030662000015"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Davies of Oldham" PimsId="2862" UID="13030662000719" xid="1735" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0001.htm#13030662000719">Lord

perpetrated very heavily against the low-paid and the poor, for whom
the Government have scant regard, having of course withdrawn
significant numbers of benefits from them. When will the Government

in the economy is whether they have a job. Last year, an additional
half a million people got a job and it was a major step forward in
their personal circumstances. The labour market has performed well, and
it continues to perform well, and all forward indicators in recent

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, I pay tribute to the Oliver King
Foundation for its work, as indeed I do to Cardiac Risk in the Young,
which for many years has been campaigning very tellingly and
successfully in this area. I think that my initial Answer should have
satisfied my noble friend on the screening question, because that is
now being reviewed by the screening committee. Regarding
defibrillators, we have to look at the need to improve survival rates
in the most effective way. I understand that the majority of these
deaths—possibly as many as 80%—occur in the home. While
we agree that the wider availability of defibrillators could save
additional lives, CPR skills—cardiopulmonary
resuscitation—should save more lives. To that end, the outcomes
strategy says that my department will work with the Resuscitation
Council, the British Heart Foundation and others to increase the number
of people who are trained in
CPR.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030662000020" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0001.htm#13030662000020"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Turnberg" PimsId="4356" UID="13030662000725" xid="1473" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0001.htm#13030662000725">Lord

Again, as the CVD outcomes strategy sets out, basic life-support skills

doubles survival rates yet is attempted in only 20% to 30% of cases.

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, the European Union
institutions all together employ approximately 55,000 people. EU staff
are exempt from national income tax, a similar situation to that found
in other international bodies. As in other international bodies, the EU
deducts a proportion of salary as a form of extranational taxation,
proceeds from which are returned to the EU budget. This is applied
progressively, rising from an initial 8% to a 45% marginal rate for the
highest-paid. In addition, there is now a special or solidarity levy,
which last month was increased from a top rate of 5.5% to 6%; most
officials pay an average of 2%. I should declare an interest. My wife
was for five years the director of the Robert Schuman Centre in
Florence, whose staff regulations were those of the European
institutions. We have examined her payslips and established that an
average of 28% of her gross salary was deducted in community tax each
month<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T15:23:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030662000033" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0001.htm#13030662000033"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Flight" PimsId="5908" UID="13030662000738" xid="2118" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0001.htm#13030662000738">Lord

question about residency, non-residency and international
organisations. It has been a common rule for international
organisations that you do not pay national taxes but are
given a degree of exemption. If we were to reclassify the European

inadequate personnel policies, the relatively generous allowances and

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, the Foreign
Secretary has stated that there must be a political solution to the
conflict, which has already claimed more than 70,000 lives. The longer
the conflict continues, the more radicalised and sectarian it will
become, with an increasing risk of regional overspill. There is no sign
that the Assad regime intends to enter into a genuine political
process. We must, therefore, increase pressure on Assad and his regime
to push them to the negotiating
table<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T15:30:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030662000051" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0001.htm#13030662000051"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Falkner of Margravine" PimsId="3182" UID="13030662000756" xid="1739" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0001.htm#13030662000756">Baroness
Falkner of Margravine:</Member></B> My Lords, does my noble friend
agree that the increase in pressure proposed today in the Foreign
Secretary’s Statement may be too little, too late? Does he
further agree that the West’s interests are now profoundly
engaged, as a failed state in Syria will result in an expansion of
international terrorism, increase the dangers from WMD, endanger the
supply of energy and destabilise Jordan, Lebanon, Israel, Iraq and even
Turkey<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T15:31:01"></hs_TimeCode>?
Therefore, will Her Majesty’s Government now work with the
United States and France to arm the non-jihadi opposition forces,
recognising that the use of force will be the only way to bring the
Assad Government to the negotiating table or to bring about an eventual
forced peace, should Assad not be available to bring about

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, we are balancing a number
of extremely difficult choices all the way through. We are
attempting to force the regime to negotiate. We do not have all the
permanent members of the UN on our side. The Russians continue to
support and, reportedly, to supply the Assad regime. The Iranians are
of course supplying the Assad regime. We have taken what we regard as a
carefully calibrated decision to upgrade the amount of support,
including non-lethal armour, to the Opposition, but we are all
conscious that once you start supplying high-end weapons to a civil
war, you never quite know where they will end up, as the French
discovered in
Mali<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T15:32:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Wright of Richmond:</Member></B> My Lords, I hope that I may be
permitted to ask a few of the many questions which I would have tried
to ask if the Foreign Secretary’s Statement had been repeated in
this House today. First, does the Minister accept that even the supply
of non-lethal assistance to the so-called Opposition represents a
dangerous escalation of our involvement in what is now, and has been
for a long time, effectively a Sunni-Shia war? What reason do the
Government have for thinking that the Opposition, which HMG have now
recognised as the legitimate Government of Syria, would be any more
accountable or democratic than the present regime in
Damascus<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T15:33:11"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030662000054" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0001.htm#13030662000054">Secondly,
can the Minister confirm that we still support Ambassador
Brahimi’s mission? Does he agree that, instead of rubbishing
President Assad’s recent interview in the <I>Sunday Times</I>,
we should encourage Ambassador Brahimi to follow up President
Assad’s offer of unconditional negotiations with such parts of
the Opposition as have also expressed their readiness to

I welcome the decision of the United States Government and HMG to

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, there were a large number
of questions there. I say simply that my right honourable friend the
Foreign Secretary is meeting Lakhdar Brahimi this afternoon. He is also
meeting the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister. The Foreign Secretary and
other Foreign Office Ministers are extremely actively engaged. It is
not yet a Sunni-Shia conflict. We are all conscious of the danger that
it will deteriorate into a Sunni-Shia conflict. Working with the
Opposition, we are doing our best to encourage them to represent all
the different communities within Syria. Our aim is to bring a
negotiated end to the conflict and to prevent it from deteriorating
further<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T15:34:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Saudis, the Qataris and a number of other states in the Middle East. We
are very conscious that Lebanon and Jordan are particularly affected by
the Syrian conflict. In Lebanon, the number of refugees is equivalent
to 10% of its population. If we imagine the impact on British society
of the arrival of 6 million refugees, that is what Lebanon is currently
going through. We are very conscious of the potential for this conflict

efforts under way to protect the Alawi minority, the Christian minority
and the smaller number of Druze within Syria from what could easily
deteriorate into a sectional jihad. We are all very worried about that
possibility. A great deal of work is under way, quite a lot of it
funded by DfID, to advise the Opposition about negotiated transition,
rebuilding local communities and providing the basic services that
people need to start the process of
reconciliation.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="StatutoryInstrument">

Government have sought cover for their clause by citing the report of
Professor Löfstedt, <I>Reclaiming Health a</I><I>nd Safety for
All.</I> A small section of that report focused
on strict liability, where the professor recommended that there should
be a review of such provisions and that they be either qualified with
“reasonably practicable” or amended to prevent civil
liability attaching to such provisions. In the event, of course, the
Government have not undertaken a review and are going much further than
the professor in seeking to remove civil liability from all
breaches of health and safety regulations. The Government have focused
on strict liability as being unfair because an employer
could be found liable to pay damages to an employee, despite having
taken all reasonable steps to protect
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030662000068" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0001.htm#13030662000068">However,
that does not give fair recognition to the fact that strict liability
applies in very limited circumstances and where injured employees would
otherwise face a near impossible evidential burden. Overwhelmingly, the
duties are qualified by the phrase, “so far as is reasonably
practicable”. Examples of strict liability would include injury
caused by defective equipment where the employer controls the
selection, purchase, installation and maintenance of equipment, where
investigation can be very difficult and with the employer holding all
the cards.</hs_para>

Government’s own impact assessment is that the number of
compensation cases which rely on a breach of strict liability
statutory duties will be small and despite their position,
the Government have declined to undertake the review that Professor
Löfstedt recommended to potentially restrict the number
of situations in which strict liability is
relevant. They now argue that it would be too complex a task and 
<?notus-xml column=1503?>would anyway have largely been done when consideration of the
transposition of EU directives was considered. Rather than doing the
work, they use the issue as an excuse to change the liability regime
across the board, potentially to the disadvantage of tens of thousands
of employees each year, who will find access to justice more difficult
and expensive. For some, it will be denied altogether.</hs_para>

construction sites, full of scaffolding and workers working on them.
The workers who regularly endanger their safety on these sites deserve

With this clause enacted in legislation, it will be much worse: the
burden of health and safety will be transferred from the shoulders of
well resourced employers to vulnerable workers, which is unjust and
unfair. It takes the law on workplace safety back to Victorian times,
beyond the landmark 1898 law, under which it became possible to claim
compensation where employers had breached their statutory
duty.</hs_para>

Phillips of Sudbury:</Member></B> My Lords, I suggest to the
Minister that there is a lifeline to the Government in this group of
amendments, particularly Amendment 80B in the names of the
noble Lords, Lord McKenzie and Lord Wigley. It requires the Secretary
of State to set up an independent panel to carry out a review of what
will become Section 62. I agree with all that has been said so far in
this debate; in particular, I think the Government would be very wise
to accede to the proposal for the independent panel because there can
be few provisions in our whole legislation that are more complex than
Clause 62 and the multitudinous amendments that it makes to Section 57
of the Health and Safety at Work etc.

Minister’s attention—if it needs drawing, and I am pretty
sure it does not—that the litigation that could flow from Clause
62 as it stands could be formidable, not least in terms of European
law. The impact of the law of the European Union in this area of life
is very considerable indeed. Professor Löfstedt, in his 2011
review, reported that there were more than 200 health and safety
regulations in this country that were affected by EU law. As we all
know, where there is a clash, EU law will prevail over domestic
law.</hs_para>

the one that the Government are currently arguing on. It is perfectly
certain that if you take away absolute liability for breach of

employers—and there are a few, I am afraid—to take risks
that will redound to the disadvantage of their employees.</hs_para>

this clause remains part of the Bill, there is a serious risk of
injustice for some people who will be deprived a remedy: the right of
damages arising from a breach of their employer’s obligations
towards them. The Minister himself recognised that in Grand Committee
on 14 January, col. GC 176. However, the Minister suggested that there
would only be a small number of cases. First, therefore, can the
Minister tell the House what was meant by a small number of cases? Was
the estimate of numbers based upon an analysis of cases which proceeded
to proof, or did it include cases that were settled without litigation

disabled people, and to the state, and it will be transferred to all of
these people from insurance companies which will be the principal

noble Lords have referred to this right of action, which has existed
since the 19th century. I do not wish to point out the error of the
noble Lord, Lord McKenzie of Luton, by saying that it dates back to the
case of Groves v Lord Wimborne in 1898. That case in the Court of
Appeal certainly did decide that there was such a right. However, the
law goes much further back. In Scotland and England there were cases
before that dealing not with factories, which Groves v Lord Wimborne
did, but with coal mines. There was a case in Scotland in 1871 of Edgar
v Law 
<?notus-xml column=1508?>and Brand at the Inner House of the Court of Session—which is the
equivalent of the Court of Appeal—which decided that the widow
of a collier who had been killed because the mine owner breached the
regulations had a right of action, just as the court in England decided
20 or so years later. In 1912, the Judicial Committee of this House
ratified these decisions—in terms to Groves v Lord
Wimborne—but emphasised that they were correctly decided. In
doing so, Lord Kinnear observed that when a duty of protection is
imposed on employers for the benefit of particular persons, there
arises, at common law, a correlative right of action in those persons
who may be injured by the
contravention.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030662000099" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0001.htm#13030662000099">Clause
62 removes that common law right. We should not sanction such a radical
change in our law unless there has been detailed consultation about the

the context of claims for damages arising from breach of statutory
provisions, some people refer to strict liability and there is a risk
of misunderstanding the scope of civil liability. Where regulations
impose an unqualified obligation on employers, there is clearly an
automatic criminal liability, so there could be a prosecution. However,
that is not the case in civil actions. Mere breach of the regulation
does not give rise to a right of action: one has to establish that the
breach caused the damage. There is, therefore, a double issue: the
question of the breach and also the fundamental question of causation.
Unless one can bring home liability based on causation there is no
right of

point by reference to the Ionising Radiation Regulations 1999.
Regulation 8 contains special provisions for pregnant women who have
notified their employer of their pregnancy. In such cases, the employer
must ensure that the equivalent dose of radiation to the foetus is
unlikely to exceed one milliSievert for the remainder of the pregnancy.
If a foetus were exposed to more than one milliSievert after the date
of notification, the employer could certainly be prosecuted but there
would be no civil liability unless the employee established a number of
facts. First, she would have to prove that she is part of the class
that is protected and that she notified the employer. Secondly, she
would have to prove that after the notification she was exposed to more
than one milliSievert. Thirdly, she would have to prove that the baby
was injured. Fourthly, she would need to prove that the injury was
caused by the overexposure. The question of causation is likely to be
the most difficult challenge, as it is in most cases. The injury to the
child might not manifest itself for some considerable
time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030662000102" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0001.htm#13030662000102">Having

agree with all the arguments in favour of this group of amendments, and
I wish to be associated with them all, but I will make a few additional
points to reinforce some points that have already been made. As my
noble friend Lord McKenzie of Luton said, the justification for Clause
62 is that there is a perception among some employers that a
compensation culture exposes them to a risk of unjustified damages
claims by employees, and—this is where the briefing that the
noble and learned Lord referred to comes in—that this perception
prevents employers from taking on new workers and is a barrier to
growth<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T16:18:00"></hs_TimeCode>. However,
no such compensation culture exists. The Government’s own
statistical evidence shows that claims arising from workplace accidents
are going down. The Health and Safety Executive’s impact
assessment of these provisions suggests that this is the case, too, as
do the figures published by the Government’s Compensation
Recovery
Unit<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T16:18:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030662000110" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0001.htm#13030662000110">In
Grand Committee, I asked the Minister to point me to the evidence that
existed—even the evidence of a perception—and argued at
the same time that legislating in response to a perception, which was
in fact a misperception, was a poor basis for making law. The Minister
was gracious enough at our meeting to confess that, try as they might,
neither he nor his officials could find evidence even of the
perception—although, to be fair to the Minister, he said in
effect, “We know it is there but we cannot find
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T16:19:09"></hs_TimeCode>”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030662000111" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0001.htm#13030662000111">This
is supposed to be a deregulatory measure. Therefore, the test of
whether it is a proper policy is whether it will result in any
deregulation. Frankly, the evidence in relation to that suggests
otherwise, too. It will not remove the complexity of the challenges
faced by employers, particularly if they are concerned about possible
civil claims by
employees<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T16:19:36"></hs_TimeCode>.
Indeed, it will add to that uncertainty by making the law less clear
than it 
<?notus-xml column=1511?>is presently. In particular, the issue of whether these reforms will
leave the law incompatible with the European body of law that it has to
be compatible with, will inevitably lead to complicated legal argument.

Government’s plan is to require all those who wish to claim in

claim by way of a common-law negligence case. I am grateful to the
noble and learned Lord, Lord Hardie, for setting out at least some of
the potential complexity of such a claim. The component elements of a
common-law negligence case will inevitably mean that cases will be
prolonged. The health and safety regulations that the Government seek
to skirt around will not become irrelevant to such claims, as the
Government intend. They will add to their complexity because persons
claiming will rely on them to show what a careful employer would have
done—what was reasonable and feasible. So we have added an
unnecessary layer of complexity to a set of claims that now proceed by

Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, support
these amendments. For a number of years before the passing of the 1974
Act, I enjoyed a reasonably successful practice at the Bar, often
instructed on behalf of employers’ insurers defending negligence
claims by injured workmen. Mostly these claims were settled, quite
often for substantially less than their true value, because of course
the insurers, for whom I acted, were altogether better able
than the claimants were to risk losing them. A number of these claims
were lost —I defeated them—because the claimants were not
quite able to assemble all the evidence necessary to prove actual
negligence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T16:32:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030662000127" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0001.htm#13030662000127">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T16:29:51"></hs_TimeCode>
1974 legislation, which Clause 62 is designed to overturn, introduced a
sea change in the approach to damages claims for workplace injuries. No
longer was it necessary to prove that the employers knew, or should
reasonably have recognised, that their machinery, equipment, systems of
work or workplaces were actually dangerous, it was sufficient to show
that regulations designed to secure the workforce’s safety had
been breached and that, in consequence, the employee had suffered often
appalling injury. Thereafter most claims were settled early, at their
true value and with very little in the way of litigation costs. Of
course, we at the Bar suffered for this change, because our personal
injury practices were greatly damaged, but almost everybody else
benefited. Injured workmen obviously did but so too did the Exchequer,
because benefits for their injuries thereafter were paid by the
insurers out of the premium moneys they had received instead of the
cost being put on the state. Safety conditions in the workplace were
hugely improved. There is nothing like strict liability, or its civil
equivalent, to induce employers to take proactive steps to ensure that
the risks and 
<?notus-xml column=1514?>dangers are reduced to a minimum. Employers’
insurers therefore, since 1974, have had altogether fewer claims to
meet and have certainly incurred far fewer legal costs in meeting

Razzall:</Member></B> My Lords, if there is one lesson that your
Lordships and the Government might draw from this debate, it is that it
is a mistake to introduce a major change in the law so late in the
process of a Bill going through the House of Commons. The noble
Viscount’s department had a very good record of not changing the
law without extensive consultation. It is quite clear from the debate
today that even one or two noble and learned Lords did not quite
understand what it is being proposed in the way that I understand it.

Government’s intention is to try to find a balance between what
the noble Earl said about protecting employers from unfair strict
liability claims and protecting the rights of the sort of claimants
that the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, is referring to. The Löfstedt
report made various recommendations and, had we had proper
consultation, that would have come out. The Government say that they
are implementing what Löfstedt recommended but some would say
“Up to a point, Lord Copper”. He did of course say that
the strict liability issue needed to be looked at, but with a lot of
reservations as well as to how strict liability could be amended. That
would have come out in proper consultation. However, we are where we
are. As I understand it, the Government wish to remove strict liability
to protect the sort of company referred to by the noble Earl. They say
that the complainant or the injured workman can rely on the law of
negligence to protect them. There is of course criminal liability, and
in extreme cases somebody’s offending will be prosecuted, but
they are relying on the law of negligence.</hs_para>

Government do not accept the argument that this measure sends the wrong
signal about the importance of complying with health and safety
legislation; in fact, quite the opposite. This is about giving
employers the reassurance to focus their attention on the things that
have a real practical effect on controlling risks. In Grand Committee

represents a backward step by placing the burden of proof on employees
and will make cases more difficult and costly to prove—the noble

that someone has been injured at work does not and should not mean they
are automatically entitled to compensation. Many health and safety
duties require the injured employee to show fault on the part of their
employer. Currently, claimants do not recover compensation in about 30%
of claims. The cases that will be most significantly affected by this
change are those which would have previously relied on an absolute or
strict statutory duty, a point raised by some noble Lords today. In
claims for negligence, 
<?notus-xml column=1517?>the claimant will have to show that the employer failed to
take reasonable steps to avoid reasonably foreseeable risks to their
health and safety, which led to the injury.</hs_para>

to achieve as health and safety duties are variously expressed in the

number of cases anticipated is small and many claims are low in value,
the impact on the amount of benefits that can be recovered is also

Hayter of Kentish Town:</Member></B> My Lords, this simple amendment in
my name and that of the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, would make letting
and block managing agents have to belong to a redress scheme. Estate
agents must belong to a redress—that is, an
ombudsman—scheme. That is good for users, having an independent
arbitrator to sort out disputes. Also, if an estate agent repeatedly
cheats consumers, or does so particularly badly, it can then be banned
by the OFT. However, letting agents, which handle client money and have
slightly younger, poorer and less confident users, are completely
unregulated. This means that an estate agent banned by the OFT can
reopen the next day as a letting agent. Neither the landlord nor a
tenant can take a complaint about a letting agent to an ombudsman,
unless that particular agent chooses to
join<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T17:14:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

people who rent privately, two-thirds through letting
agents. Given that tenants move quite often, they resort to letting
agents with some frequency. Half of them stay in their property for
less than two years, as opposed to 6% of owner-occupiers. There are, I
fear, a lot of bad—indeed, some very dubious
—letting agents. Just today, we have had a major ASA ruling
against a letting agent who was breaking the ASA code by not disclosing
compulsory charges.</hs_para>

Just yesterday, the mystery shopping undertaken by <I>Which?</I><I>

they went to a letting agent to arrange a viewing. No prospective
tenant was given a list of charges. This failure to disclose fees up

have no one to complain to. I hope that the Government will not expect

only a third of landlords check whether their agent is even a member of

is no surprise, therefore, that landlords are completely behind this
amendment. It is not simply that tenants and landlords have nowhere to
go with a complaint: it is also that letting and management agents
cannot be banned for bad practice; they do not need to provide
indemnity insurance; they do not need to have a complaints procedure
and there are no client money protection rules. This is a big business
for such a lack of standards. It takes some £175 million a year
just from tenants, so it is no wonder that everyone wants letting and
block managing agents to be subject to the same requirements as estate
agents.</hs_para>

Sharkey:</Member></B> My Lords, when we discussed this issue in
Committee the Government gave four reasons for rejecting the proposal
made by the noble Baroness, Lady Hayter. These reasons were as follows.
First, bringing letting agents under regulation would increase costs
for consumers and reduce the choice and availability of accommodation
on offer to tenants. Secondly, letting agents are already
subject to consumer protection legislation. Thirdly, consumers who are
charged unreasonable fees can seek help from trading standards
officers. Fourthly, around half of all agents belong to a voluntary
scheme that sets standards and offers redress. None of these reasons
stands up well to any kind of examination. The fact that half of all
agents belong to a voluntary scheme is not a reason for failing to
address the fact that half do

who are charged unreasonable fees can seek help from trading standards
officers is one of those facts that are true in theory but of no help
in practice. Even if consumers knew about this recourse—and I am
sure that they do not—it is well known that trading standards
officers are overstretched and underresourced. This is an illusory
comfort to ripped-off or abused
consumers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T17:23:23"></hs_TimeCode>. That
letting agents are already subject to consumer protection is another
true, but comfortless, fact that relies, again, on action by trading

relief, if any at

the first reason the Minister gave in Committee for rejecting the
amendment in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Hayter, is the one on
which the Government seemed then to rely most, and which at first
glance appeared to have some merit—that is, that the amendment
before us again would increase costs to consumers and reduce the choice
and availability of accommodation on offer to tenants. This argument
was challenged by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, and the Minister
subsequently wrote to the noble Lord to set out the evidence—or,
rather, grounds—for this
argument<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T17:24:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030662000192" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0001.htm#13030662000192">These
grounds amounted to an estimate, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hayter,
has already mentioned, of an additional annual cost to a letting agent
of around £800. It is very hard to see that an additional cost
of £800 would drive any letting agent out of business. The
Government have produced no evidence of their assertion that it might
do so. Even if it did—which is not only
unproven but unlikely to be provable—it does not follow that
rental properties would be taken off the market or that costs would be
passed directly on to the tenant. The Government have produced no
evidence to show that letting agents who are members of the voluntary
scheme charge more than those who are not. In many cases,
the reverse is likely to be the
case.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030662000193" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0001.htm#13030662000193">Even if
all the Government’s assertions in this area were true and
evidenced, their position would amount to saying that they were content
to have serious abuses in the marketplace because the
abusers could not afford to pay to become non-abusers. This is not an
attractive or coherent proposition and it is especially unattractive
when one considers the analysis of cost benefit produced by RICS, among
others, which gave evidence of a beneficial financial outcome for
implementing the proposals. All in all, and exactly as in Committee, it
is hard to understand why on earth the Government have opposed this
measure. It stops significant abuse, it is easy to do, it has almost
universal industry support and it has long-term financial
benefits.</hs_para>

situation whereby a member of the public who walks through the door of
such a business wishing to buy a house will have access to
accountability if they suffer poor practice. However, if they rent a
house from the same business they will not. There is access to
independent redress and client money protection for those buying a
house but not for those renting one. This is quite illogical and is
untenable at a time when more and more young families with children are
renting privately, most of them through a letting agent. We cannot have
letting agents leaving boilers unfixed, properties in a state of
disrepair or running off with people’s money and facing no
repercussions. When people do not get the service they pay for there
should be consequences for the businesses involved. That is a simple

market that operates outside existing voluntary registration schemes is
damaging the reputation of the entire profession. A survey by Shelter
showed that only 20% of renters trust their letting agent, with 84%
disagreeing that letting agents work in the interests of their tenants.
It is vital for everybody—tenants, letting agents and landlords
alike—that standards are raised. I have yet to hear a convincing
argument against these proposals. The Government have claimed that
requiring letting agents to meet certain professional standards will
push up costs. However, research by the Royal Institution of Chartered
Surveyors shows that this is not true. While there is a one-off cost,
that figure is quickly recouped and there is a net benefit to the
economy from these changes of £21 million over 10
years.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-06?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_06_PT_1/7FEE650C1102AFFF2247B326F4272BE0E2921B7F" __version__="1.9"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 6 March 2013">Wednesday,

argued that existing regulations provide for redress in the event of
poor practice. As far as I can see, that is also not the case. Existing
regulations can stop only malpractice. CPRs do not empower consumers or
provide them with a route to redress. In addition, a lack of trading
standards resources means that these regulations are inconsistently
applied, if they are at all. Only a tiny number of prosecutions have
been taken against letting agents using existing CPRs. This is despite
a significant upsurge of dissatisfaction with poor practice in the
lettings

to the argument that these proposals amount to extra red tape, this is
not red tape. Businesses do not like red tape and businesses are asking

letting agents. It is worth noting that landlords complain as much as
tenants when the agent belongs to the ombudsman scheme. Landlords would
be greatly helped by this

the mean time, consumers want change. As polling for RICS
and Shelter show, the vast majority of those renting want basic

reason to deny them that. These changes are not
a panacea for all the problems in the letting agents’
profession but they are a vital first step towards a market which works
fairly. This amendment closes a loophole that should, in truth, have
been closed quite some time ago. Doing so has long enjoyed wide
support, including at one time from the current Housing Minister when
he was in opposition. Back then, Labour Ministers opposed it and the

so many noble Lords said in Grand Committee, which, unfortunately, I
was unable to attend, there is a very strong argument that letting
agents and management agents employed by landlords to look after their
property should be covered by the Estate Agents Act 1979 and by an
ombudsman scheme, as estate agents have been for some time. In Grand
Committee, my Front Bench spokesman, the noble Baroness, Lady Hayter,
made a powerful speech, as she has today, in favour of extending the
power of the Office of Fair Trading to ban estate agents for misconduct
to those who engage in the letting and the management of property and
to make available an ombudsman scheme for complaints. In Grand
Committee she put forward a number of very strong arguments—for
example, the size of the market, running to a couple of million letting
and management agents. On the number of complaints, she quoted from the
Property Ombudsman, for whose council I had the honour to serve as
chairman a few years ago. It has shown how the number of complaints has
increased. All of the speakers so far in this debate today have
mentioned that almost all British Property Federation bodies connected
with this field are in favour of the scheme being proposed in this
amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T17:36:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030684000008" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0001.htm#13030684000008">The
ombudsman scheme is very familiar to us now in all sorts of private
industries, as it was already in public concerns—for example,
the Parliamentary Ombudsman, which in 1967 started the ball rolling in
this country, and the Local Government Ombudsman. I found very puzzling
the response of the noble Viscount 
<?notus-xml column=1531?>the Minister in Grand Committee when he said that
there would be a reduction in choice if the amendment were carried.
When government departments were made subject to the
Parliamentary Ombudsman, individual departments were not given the
choice as to whether they should be subject to the Parliamentary
Ombudsman; they are all subject to it. As new departments and, indeed,
quasi-departments, if I may put it that way, have come into being,
they, too, have been particularly mentioned as being subject to the
Parliamentary Commissioner or Parliamentary
Ombudsman<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T17:37:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030684000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0001.htm#13030684000009">I
thought that the Minister’s answers, as I understood them, were
quite inadequate. They seemed to bring in the subject of competition. I
am all in favour of competition, and part of this Bill is concerned
with improving competition. Competition and choice are very important.
Nevertheless, where does the benefit to the consumer come to choose
between estate agents, estate management or letting agents, or
whatever, which belong to an ombudsman scheme and those which do not?
If there is a choice, surely no sensible consumer would wish to go to
somebody who does not belong. It seems to me that a mandatory scheme is
most desirable in this

I mention in passing the banning of estate agents when they engage in
misconduct. This dates, as we all know, from the Estate Agents Act
1979. The Office of Fair Trading has probably not used it as much as it
might to deal with bad estate agents. In my day at the Office of Fair
Trading we tended to ban only estate agents who were in prison. In
other words, they were imprisoned for fraudulent activities and we
received evidence that they were coming out of prison shortly. We
decided that they must not come out and engage in estate agency so we
would ban them. There are not that many estate agents who have been
banned who were not at the time in jail.</hs_para>

of a red tape for a consumer and a tenant, simply because, at the
moment, a tenant has to understand the difference between being with an
estate agent and a letting agent and to understand that if they are
with an unlicensed letting agent, instead of going to the ombudsman and
taking redress through the code of practice, they may have to go
Citizens Advice, a small claims court or trading standards. My 19
year-old son in his first foray at university would not have known
where to start with that. If we can do what his university rightly
tries to do in guiding the students and say, “You need to be
assured that the people you are dealing with actually follow a code of
conduct and there is an ombudsman to whom you can turn”, then we
would have a much simpler system, which is free of red
tape<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T17:51:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Gardner of Parkes:</Member></B> I will start at the back and deal first
with Amendment 82, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord
Campbell-Savours. You might think that auctions are bad here but you
should see them in Australia. I bought my flat at auction out there and
what they do is start the auction and when they reach a certain point
they stop and say, “We’ll have a break”. In the
break, they get hold of the vendor and say, “Why don’t
you come down on your reserve?”, and get hold of the purchaser
and say, “Why don’t you go up on what you are going to
buy?”. They might do that two or three times within the auction.
Fortunately I had someone helping me, who made clear to the auctioneer
that if they went on and broke more than once, we were out. We got the
property and I have had it a very long
time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T17:57:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030684000037" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0001.htm#13030684000037">There
are good and bad things about auction. I accept the point the noble
Lord made about deceiving people about how cheaply they are going to
get something, 
<?notus-xml column=1536?>but of course it is unpredictable and properties sometimes really do not
sell, while in other cases they do. At least with an auction all the
documentation about the property is provided in advance of the auction
so people are not kept in the dark the way they are with lettings and
by managers. People launch into a property they are going to rent, or
buy leasehold, and they find that there are all sorts of hidden clauses
that no one ever drew their attention to and that no real documentation
is available. It is quite different; each system might have its faults
but they are different faults and it is hard to know whether you will
ever get them right.</hs_para>

certain sympathy with the point the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours,
made. If you have gone a long way it is very difficult—you have
gone to the trouble, you think the place is going to be within your
range but it is not. It is really very hard to resolve that one. Do
people wake up to the fact that it is just a selling technique, which
happens all the time, or are people genuinely taken in by these
deliberate ploys? It is complicated but he has got a very interesting
point that requires further

strongly support the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Hayter.
Talking about letting agents, I was quite stunned to see on television
people letting these sheds in some parts of London. They had no windows
or anything in them; a family of 10 living there and
sometimes no running water or electric light. It was just unbelievable.
The people who were renting them produced leaflets from the agent who
was offering them to let. When the BBC—I think it was the BBC
although it could have been another broadcaster—went to say to
these people, “How could you be letting this when it has no
planning permission and does not conform with any health
standards of any sort?”, the answer was, “Oh, no, we were
never letting it”. Yet they had proof in front of them of the
printed leaflet about it being available to let from that particular
agent. That is the absolute bottom of the

conflicting interests in property, or most of them, seemed to be
present at the round-table meeting at the department. Every one of

redress scheme was the one common denominator that came out. Those
represented included LEASE and Peverel. Everyone was present
and every one of them favoured a redress scheme. Every one of them
thought that the group you had to worry about—say, with ARMA or
ARLA—was not the 50% who voluntarily paid their £150
membership but the others who did not join. The ones who did not join
did so because they did not want to conform to certain standards, so it
is very important to have that

noble Lord, Lord Borrie, was a very distinguished president of the
Trading Standards Institute. Fair trading is good, but people do not
tend to associate it mentally with property. Everybody knows what a

first step—a redress scheme that was not voluntary 
<?notus-xml column=1537?>but obligatory, we would have made huge progress, even though it might
only be a first step. There is a need for legislation, and that
legislation really needs to bring in regulation of both letting and
managing. The noble Baroness, Lady Hayter, will correct me if I am
wrong, but I think her amendment covers managing agents as well as
letting agents. That is a very important point. As has already been
said tonight, at the round-table meeting the British Property
Federation wanted to make it perfectly clear—because it was
misquoted so often—that it supports a regulatory system. This
must be repeated again and again; we have heard so often that it
opposes it, but that is not true at

say we should not have any more regulations. We are all for less
regulation, but not where it is necessary. Regulations should be
brought in where they are required. This complete lack of transparency,
this failure to disclose things, takes place all the time; for example,
in the management of blocks people have no idea what they have to pay
for and what they do not have to pay for, and no idea what the money is
spent on. There have been cases in the past where it was found that
someone who claimed insurance money was getting a 50% kickback from it,
all due to a lack of transparency. Until we get some regulatory
standards we are not really going to get that.</hs_para>

early point—would have saved huge amounts of money and huge
amounts of work. People are even threatened with the loss of their own

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 82,
spoken to by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, concerns sales of
property through auctions. I shall turn to that shortly. Amendment 81A
and the next group of amendments are aimed at two different types of
activity. One is the letting and management of privately rented homes.
The other is the management of residential leasehold properties. It is
important to make that distinction because, while some agents engage in
both these activities, they are different activities, with different
clients, contractual relationships and issues. However, a number of the
amendments we are debating cover both sectors, so I shall make some
remarks about each sector in turn before turning to the
amendments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030684000045" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0002.htm#13030684000045">The
Government are aware of the important and growing role played by
private renting and residential leasehold. This is true particularly in
London and the south-east, where the pressures of growth in housing
demand and the challenges of increasing supply are intense. There are
now around 3.8 million privately rented and 3 million leasehold
properties across England, with the majority of the latter being flats.
Obviously, not everyone living in those millions of properties is happy
with their property in every respect, whether 
<?notus-xml column=1538?>because of the costs they face in buying or renting it and then living
in it, its condition or the quality of its management. Many of them are
content, of course, and find that on balance private renting or
leasehold meets their
needs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030684000046" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0002.htm#13030684000046">We have
heard a number of contributions today, and previously in Grand
Committee, describing unsatisfactory practices by letting agents in the
private rented sector. This was highlighted today, notably by the noble
Baronesses, Lady Howe and Lady Hayter, among others. Indeed, this
sector has had a substantial amount of attention recently in the other
place, in the media and in recent reports from <I>Which?</I> magazine,
the Office of Fair Trading, the Property Ombudsman and others. The
Government have been listening carefully to the views expressed on this
subject, and recognise that there are issues. I am pleased that the

there are many agents who perform a good and honest service for their
clients and serve an important role in the private rental market, there
are too many agents who are not acting responsibly. My honourable
friend in the other place, Mark Prisk, said in a debate in Westminster
Hall last week that the Government consider many of the problems to be
a consequence of years of undersupply in the housing market. The
imbalance between supply and demand has put rents, the quality of
accommodation and standards of service under pressure in some areas of
the country. That has had consequences for the way lettings agents, as
well as landlords,
operate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030684000048" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0002.htm#13030684000048">Expanding
the supply of rented homes is therefore at the heart of the
Government’s strategy. We want a bigger and better private
rented sector. That is why we established a debt guarantee scheme of up
to £10 billion to encourage institutional investment
and, alongside that, a £200 million Build to Rent fund. Boosting
supply is not just about financial support, however. It also means
avoiding excessive regulation that can deter investment and stifle
supply. Excessive regulation, however well intentioned, can result in
precisely the outcomes we want to avoid. That is why we did not proceed
with the proposals of the previous Government, such as a national
register of landlords and the full statutory regulation of letting
agents.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030684000049" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0002.htm#13030684000049">Nonetheless,
there is a role for regulation in preserving standards. We have heard a
number of people express the view that the lettings market is totally
unregulated. That is not in fact the case. There is a substantial body
of consumer protection legislation that covers letting agents. The
Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 protect
tenants from letting agents who mislead or engage in aggressive
business practices. Similarly, the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts
Regulations 1999 protect tenants from unfair conditions, such as unfair
restrictions on the ways in which they can use a property. We know that
trading standards bodies use these powers to prosecute lettings agents.
Some very substantial fines, and indeed prison sentences, have been
handed down to agents who engage in serious misdemeanours, such as
misrepresenting their membership of professional bodies, or
indeed misappropriating clients’ money.</hs_para>

friend in the other place, Mark Prisk, acknowledged that there is a
problem with enforcement, and that action is needed on the less serious
cases as well as the most serious ones. He stated his determination in
Westminster Hall only last week to encourage national trading standards
bodies to ensure that they tackle these issues across the marketplace.

to residential leasehold, I believe that we have to be realistic and to
recognise that living in a property where more than one party has
significant financial and other interests, and where common parts of a

concerns and disputes. Although complaints procedures and a range of
mediation and ombudsman services are already available—and,
where those options fail, a number of legal options that can be
pursued—we recognise that not all leaseholders are happy. The
noble Baroness, Lady Hayter, asked why there is no client money
protection in residential leasehold, but I reassure her—as she
may know—that statutory protection already exists for leasehold
service charges, which the law deems to be held in
trust.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030684000055" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0002.htm#13030684000055">Our

they deserve or expect, or is sending increasingly unaffordable bills.
We also hear from elderly and sometimes vulnerable people whose
freeholder, or their agent, is failing to 
<?notus-xml column=1540?>follow good practice and, in some cases, may even
be breaking the law. Where relationships over the management
of people’s homes break down and become adversarial, it can lead
to real worry and distress and can in some cases, as we know, culminate
in cases before tribunals and the

involved in letting and managing agency work. This is intended, as we
understand it, to give the Office of Fair Trading powers to prevent
letting and management agents conducting business and to require agents
to have in place redress schemes, client money protection and to meet
the other requirements of the Act.
While<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T18:13:57"></hs_TimeCode> we
acknowledge that there are issues that need addressing, we do not
believe that the answer is to regulate letting and managing agents in
the way that the noble Baroness proposes. The regulatory burden could
be substantial, adding to costs borne by landlords and, in turn,
tenants.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030684000058" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0002.htm#13030684000058">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T18:14:16"></hs_TimeCode>
his report for the Property Ombudsman, Professor Michael Ball set out a
range of costs that this would entail. The noble Baroness, Lady Hayter,
and my noble friend Lord Sharkey both brought up the issue of the cost
of compliance with a mandatory scheme, and both stated that there would
a debit of only some £800. Indeed,
there<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T18:14:26"></hs_TimeCode> are costs
to bear in mind, including of extra staffing and other administrative
work, to ensure that the business is run according to the relevant
codes of practice. Our own figures suggest that these are on top of
costs of perhaps £170 per office per year for redress,
£300 for client money protection and £300 or
more for professional indemnity

many<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T18:15:06"></hs_TimeCode> letting and
managing agents already sign up to similar schemes, and government
guidance encourages landlords and tenants to ask which bodies an agent
belongs to. However, the approaches that are right for many agents are
not necessarily appropriate for all. That is why the Government are in
favour of nimbler and more tailored self-regulatory approaches wherever
possible. For<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T18:15:29"></hs_TimeCode>
example, while client money protection is not mandatory for letting
agents who are not members of professional bodies, the Government have
endorsed the SAFE— safe agent fully endorsed—scheme,
whose easy-to-recognise logo makes it easier 
<?notus-xml column=1541?>for consumers to understand whether the agent offers
client money protection. Legislation already sets down requirements on
how service charge money in leasehold must be

it is not clear what the effect of the noble Baroness’s
amendment would be. In particular, it is not clear that it would
succeed in bringing letting and managing agents into the scope of
redress mechanisms within the Act. This is because the definition of a
complaint within the Act relates to selling and buying “an
interest in land”, not letting and renting. On the other hand,
because the amendment covers management activities in connection with
land, it could, possibly unintentionally, bring some other activities
such as property development and perhaps even agricultural land
management into the scope of the Act, resulting in a far broader range
of industries having to comply with the terms of the Act. That would
not be right.
Therefore<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T18:16:36"></hs_TimeCode>, while
I understand why the noble Baroness might like to see letting agents in
the private rented sector, and managing agents in the
leasehold sector, brought into the scope of the Estate Agents Act, in
particular in terms of access to redress, I do not believe that this
amendment is the best way to achieve that
goal.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030684000061" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0002.htm#13030684000061">I

concerned to hear that buyers may be experiencing difficulties when
trying to purchase a property at auction, especially if it involves
first-time buyers. I am pleased to say that there is already

the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008,
auctioneers, like traders in all sectors of the economy, are required
in their dealings with consumers to treat them fairly and not mislead
them. Under the CPRs, there are also a number of business practices
that are considered unfair in all circumstances and are prohibited.
When marketing a property, it is prohibited to use bait tactics such as
luring bidders to auctions using pricing techniques, which the noble
Lord raised as an example. OFT guidance on the CPRs published last
September, of which the industry should be fully aware, gives the
specific example of guide prices not being distorted to attract
potential
buyers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030684000067" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0002.htm#13030684000067">Where
traders treat consumers unfairly, they may face criminal or civil
enforcement action. Enforcement of the CPRs is by the OFT and local
authority trading standards services. We are, of course, in the process
of better equipping trading standards to take greater responsibility
for consumer law enforcement, and will be transferring central
government funding for national leadership and co-ordination of
enforcement activity from the OFT to the National Trading Standards
Board. In addition, the new Competition and Markets Authority will have
consumer enforcement powers to address business practices that distort
competition or impact on consumer choice in otherwise competitive

I understand that the industry encourages fair practice in this area
and offers guidance and training. For example, the Royal Institution of
Chartered Surveyors provides best practice guidance for auctioneers
selling real estate. Such guidance addresses price guides and states
that these guides must not be misleading, advising that a price guide
that is clearly below the figure that the seller will accept is
misleading. As best practice it also says that auctioneers should
clearly indicate in the catalogue that price guides may be subject to
amendment during the period leading up to the day and time of the
auction
sale.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030684000069" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0002.htm#13030684000069">In the

Gardner of Parkes:</Member></B> My Lords, I
shall speak to the group of amendments in my name, so that
we do not have to keep coming back on different items. I have been
asked to put them all together. I will start with Amendment 81F because
that is the most important of them all. That has come about because of
the court decision recently in the Phillips and Goddard v Francis case
that any amount of work to be done per flat worth more than £250
in a year would require consultation. If, for example, it was a block
of 10 flats and you had spent £2,500, after that, for
everything, even if it was for £1, £10, or whatever, you
would have to implement a consultation
process.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030690000002" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0002.htm#13030690000002">In
their answers tonight, the Government have told us that the one thing
that they want to avoid is lots more paper, cost, expense and
consultation. That is exactly what the amendment is designed to
achieve. The Public Bill Office has now gone online and worked out that
the sum of £250 should in today’s prices be £330,
so that is why there is a difference in the figures. We have gone
through it carefully, and we think that certain things are particularly
important or desperate, such as fire provisions, safety provisions
and—one of which I have had personal experience—when the
front door of a block of flats is damaged. What would happen if you had
to wait for about two months to get consent for you to put on a new
front door lock, although it was so
urgent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T18:36:53"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030690000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0002.htm#13030690000003">We
do not wish to change the law at all. We wish to clarify the law as it
is to make clear that the £250 is not an annual figure but a per
item or per effective work figure. That amendment is straightforward
and the Government should certainly consider it. I have heard 
<?notus-xml column=1547?>them tonight and 50 million other times say that they want to reduce
costs, difficulties and expenses. This is the opportunity to do it.
Otherwise, every tenant will be burdened with so many consultation
documents that they will get to a point where they barely look at the
really important, serious one because they say, “Oh,
that’s another one from the agent and it is all out of my
pocket”. Amendment 81F is really
simple<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T18:37:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030690000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0002.htm#13030690000004">Amendment
81B concerns leasehold valuation tribunal costs. I tabled the amendment
because when I asked about the cost of leasehold valuation tribunals,
which, at the moment, are limited to £500 for any applicant, I
found that the practice, which is quite wrong, has arisen
where the landlord, head lessee, or whoever is at the next stage above
the leaseholder, is bringing in more and more expensive
legal brains against the ordinary applicant. The worst thing about that
is that, win or lose, the amount paid for that extremely major legal
defence is charged back to the residents in the leasehold flats as a
management expense. That was never the way that leasehold valuation was
envisaged. In 1996, I was very involved when we passed the legislation.
Those things were specifically against what we wanted. We wanted it to
be approachable for anyone at
£500<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T18:39:01"></hs_TimeCode>. I
received a letter from the noble Lord, Lord McNally, from which I
understand that later in the year it will be swallowed up into a major
tribunals review and the figure of £500 will probably
rise. However, that is different from where the unlimited cost is being
charged back to the leaseholders. That is the reason for that
amendment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030690000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0002.htm#13030690000005">Amendment
81C concerns a redress scheme. As we pretty well won the redress scheme
with the previous amendment, which has just been passed, I do not think
it is so important any more. However, when we had a round-table meeting
at the department of all the interested people, they all said, from the
most extravagant people down to the most careful, that the one thing
that could save time, trouble, expense and simplify life for everyone
would be a redress scheme. Therefore, no matter what happens with the
previous amendment, I am hoping that at Third Reading the Government
might bring forward some wording on a simple redress scheme.</hs_para>

Amendment 81D and protection schemes for service charge money. The
noble Baroness, Lady Brinton, mentioned that university students had a
problem regarding their deposits and so on for the premises they were
letting. I pay full tribute to the Labour Government who as a response
to that introduced protection for tenancy deposits. Tenancy deposits
are well-protected now. No longer can an avaricious landlord grab every
penny of your deposit money. Even if you are just an ordinary
individual, letting property without an agent or anything like that,
you have to place the deposit in a secure government scheme, which is
very good and desirable. However, why is the same amount of protection
not given to people who pay service charges, which are probably very
much larger
amounts?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030690000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0002.htm#13030690000007">Amendment
81E concerns the redress scheme. If I am satisfied with how the
previous amendment, which has just been passed, is interpreted, I will
not bring it back at Third Reading. However, if I find there is

back. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T18:41:37"></hs_TimeCode>I beg to

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to my noble
friend Lady Gardner for the thought and effort that she has put into
the preparation of the five amendments we are now considering. Her
ideas and broad experience of the housing sector are an invaluable
resource to this House. Her amendments, like those of the noble
Baroness, Lady Hayter, address the private rented and residential
leasehold sectors. I will not repeat what I have already said about
those areas.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030690000010" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0002.htm#13030690000010">I
have carefully considered my noble friend’s Amendment 81B on the
ability of freeholders to recover their legal costs from leaseholders
and I take her concerns very seriously. This amendment aims to limit
the circumstances in which costs of proceedings incurred by a landlord
or other party with an interest in the property at a leasehold
valuation tribunal could be charged back to leaseholders. I should
point out that where a freeholder is able to recover costs in
connection with proceedings from the leaseholders, this is contractual
matter between them and will be set out in the lease. I am aware that
leaseholders are increasingly concerned about the recovery of such
costs as administration charges where the lease permits this and I
understand that my honourable friend Mark Prisk is thinking about this
issue. I am concerned that my noble friend’s amendment would not
achieve her goals and would not in fact provide any greater protection
for leaseholders than already exists.</hs_para>

friend, as she said, recently took part in a high-level round-table
discussion on residential leasehold issues. I understand that a number
of practical ideas for improving awareness of leaseholders’
rights emerged from that event and that the Department for Communities
and Local Government is committed to working with the Ministry of
Justice and others to take those ideas forward. The issue of recovery
of legal costs as an administration charge, rather than a service
charge, requires detailed consideration. For this reason, I believe
that the current Bill is not the best place to consider this complex
issue.</hs_para> <hs_time UID="13030690000065" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0002.htm#13030690000065">6.45

friend’s Amendment 81C concerns an alternative form of dispute
resolution for landlords and tenants in the private rented sector. The
amendment would require the current deposit protection schemes to
provide a dispute resolution service for all disputes between landlords
and tenants whose deposits are protected under the scheme—for
example, disputes about repairs or rent arrears. The tenancy deposit
protection schemes are authorised by the Department for Communities and
Local Government under concession agreements that require them to offer
a free service to resolve disputes over tenants’ deposits. The
latest round of agreements has just been awarded and it would not be
reasonable or appropriate to change them now.</hs_para>

change these schemes would expose tenancy deposit schemes to a much
broader range of activities than they have signed up for, or for which
they are perhaps qualified. To expect those services to be free, as
they are for resolving disputes on deposits, would also be
unreasonable. This is not the best vehicle for introducing further
dispute resolution mechanisms between landlords and
tenants.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030690000014" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0002.htm#13030690000014">We
should also remember that mechanisms besides resorting to the courts
already exist for tenants who are dissatisfied with their landlords.

have looked carefully at my noble friend’s Amendment
81D on the protection of service charge money in residential leasehold
and I take her concerns on this matter very seriously. The Government
are aware that the service charges paid by leaseholders are a key
issue, particularly where these are high and increasing, and where they
are regarded as unreasonable by those paying them. My noble
friend’s amendment attempts to provide similar protection for
service charges in leasehold as that which has for some years applied
to tenancy deposits in the private rented sector. I understand,
however, that statutory protection already exists for leasehold service
charges, which the law deems to be held in trust. To apply
the deposit protection scheme, which has produced good results in
private letting, to residential leasehold is unnecessary and
may in practice be unworkable as deposits and service
charges are for different purposes. Given that for many
leaseholders what matters most is the level of their service
charges, we also need to be very careful not to
create additional burdens and compliance costs on freeholders and their
managing agents, which would over time be passed on to the
leaseholders.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030690000016" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0002.htm#13030690000016">My
noble friend’s Amendment 81E concerns arbitration and mediation
services. In the private rented sector there is a range of consumer
protection legislation that protects tenants and many landlords from
poor practices by agents. Our goal should be to work with trading
standards bodies to ensure more effective enforcement, and I note the
intention of my honourable friend Mark Prisk to do just

explanations from the Minister, some of which are quite unsatisfactory.
For example, he says that what people are really concerned about is the
level of service charges and that we want to keep those down, and so
on. We all understand that. But he then rejects Amendment 81F, which is
so important and would clarify exactly what you can and cannot do in a
block with or without permission and would tremendously reduce the
paperwork and red tape, with its terrible waste of time and money, on
the ground that it is perhaps too cheap and saves too much. I do not

arguments. As I said, if the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness,
Lady Hayter, covers a redress scheme that is mandatory for everyone,
and if they would have to belong whether they are managing agents or
whoever, then I am satisfied with that. I would not then want to pursue

after studying the noble Baroness’s amendment, to see what it

Minister to expect me to return at Third Reading, by which time I hope
we will be a bit clearer on exactly what is good and bad in what we

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, these amendments will
simplify employment legislation for around 40,000 farm businesses in
England and Wales. They will ensure the same levels of employment
protection for agricultural workers as for workers in all other sectors
of the economy. They will also abolish 31 public bodies whose functions
are now used infrequently or have simply fallen into disuse. This is an
important reform, which will contribute to the Government’s key
objective of encouraging economic growth as well as the programme of
reducing the number of public bodies. We brought these provisions
forward in Grand Committee but they were not accepted. We believe that
the case for them is very strong and therefore we have reintroduced
them.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13030690000026" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0002.htm#13030690000026">The
agricultural wages committees were set up in their current form nearly
65 years ago, just after the Second World War, although their origins
go back even further. The Agricultural Wages Board is now the only
remaining sector wage council; the 26 others were abolished 20 years
ago, in 1993. Agricultural workers represent 0.5% of the total
workforce. There is no reason why they should be treated differently
from the other 99.5% of workers, who are all protected by the national
minimum wage and other statutory employment provisions.</hs_para>

very different from 65 years ago. It is a now a global, international
business. Farmers compete against not just each other but farmers
overseas to sell both here and in international markets. 
<?notus-xml column=1552?>Technological developments and increased
mechanisation mean that workers need to be highly skilled and qualified
to operate complex machinery, and to be able to keep up to date with
modern animal husbandry methods. The industry is also becoming
increasingly diverse, particularly as businesses move away from mixed
farming to specialise in specific sectors. Around a quarter of farms
now also operate non-agricultural businesses; for example, a farm shop
or bed and breakfast. This means that many farm businesses have to
employ workers under both the agricultural minimum wage and the
national minimum wage regimes. They therefore have to comply with two
sets of employment legislation, which is an unnecessary cost to farm
businesses in both time and resources.</hs_para>

traditionally regarded as agricultural activities, there are grey areas
where a farm business has to determine whether employees are employed
in agriculture and entitled to the agricultural wages order terms and
conditions as opposed to general employment terms. For example,
livestock and poultry rearing would normally be considered agricultural
activities and covered by the agricultural wages order, but this is not
necessarily the case for on-farm slaughtering operations. Similarly,
where there is a farm packing business, packing of produce grown on the
farm would normally be covered by the agricultural wages order, whereas
packing of bought-in produce is not.</hs_para>

agricultural minimum wage will remove the need for farm businesses to
operate two employment regimes and end the confusion of whether
activities fall within the national minimum wage regime or the
agricultural minimum wage regime. It is widely accepted that the
legislation which underpins the Agricultural Wages Board is
outdated and hampers the ability of the industry to offer more modern,
flexible employment packages. For example, it effectively dissuades
employers from offering the payment of annual salaries, which is
disadvantageous for workers as it hinders long-term financial
planning—and thereby better security for farm workers and their
families.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13030690000030" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0002.htm#13030690000030">The
abolition of the Agricultural Wages Board and the agricultural minimum
wage regime will allow farmers to agree terms and conditions that take
account of the requirements of the farming sector and suit the
particular circumstances of both employers and workers. It will make it
easier for employers to offer opportunities for workers to work the
same number of weekly hours, but over a compressed period. This could
be beneficial for businesses, who may want to provide for longer
shifts, and for workers with family and domestic
responsibilities.</hs_para>

farm businesses to compete for workers on a level playing field with
other local employers. It should encourage longer-term and more
permanent employment of farm workers, which will boost growth and have
wider benefits. For the avoidance of doubt, research suggests that
there will continue to be considerable demand for farm workers in the
years ahead, which will mean that employers will need to offer
competitive pay rates to attract new workers. A majority of workers
already receive terms and conditions  
<?notus-xml column=1553?>above the agricultural minimum wage rates, and as contracts are already
in place their wages should not be affected if the board were
abolished.</hs_para>

conditions suggest that there will be a sustained demand for
agricultural workers. The 2011 survey from the UK Commission for
Employment and Skills indicates a shortage of workers with relevant
skills within the agricultural sector, and that this shortage is higher
than comparable shortages in other areas of the economy. The
agricultural workforce is also ageing: 55% of the sector’s
workforce is aged over 45, which again is higher than in other sectors
of the economy. These factors mean that we can expect demand for both
workers and skills in the sector to increase over the next 10 years and
beyond, which means that market drivers will ensure that wages remain
competitive. Farm businesses will be wise and prudent to provide career
and development opportunities to encourage workers into agriculture and
offer attractive terms and conditions to retain them.</hs_para>

remember that agricultural workers who have contractual rights
reflecting the terms of the agricultural wages order at the time of the
board’s abolition will retain those rights until either their
employment contract is varied by agreement or their employment comes to
an end. New workers coming into the industry or workers who negotiate a
new contract will have the same level of employment protection as
workers in all other sectors of the economy. Furthermore, agricultural
workers who are supplied by a labour provider and who may be at the
lower end of the wage scale will continue to have the added protection
of the gangmaster licensing
legislation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030690000034" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0002.htm#13030690000034">Turning<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T18:59:57"></hs_TimeCode>

implementing that abolition. They require much greater information,
much clearer arguments, much better figures and much more effective

may be good reasons why the Government are trying to change tack. One
is that they have problems with the Welsh Government—this is
England and Wales legislation. The Welsh Government, like their

statutory minimum standards in the agriculture sector. Of course, it is
also convenient for the Government that they have not been required to
come forward with that kind of information. They have not presented us

for abolition.

will say a few words about the nature of the agricultural workforce. Of
course, the Minister is right that it has changed since 1917 and 1948,
but we are left with an agricultural work structure of a lot of
relatively small businesses that employ one, two, three, perhaps six,
permanent staff and parts of a sector that employ large numbers of
casual workers on a seasonal basis. There is no other sector in the
whole of the economy that is like that. There is no other sector,
therefore, that requires the kind of legal protection that until very
recently all parties in the industry and all parties in the House
recognised was
important<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T19:06:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030690000046" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0002.htm#13030690000046">Moreover,
the Government’s analogy is quite wrong. The Agricultural Wages
Board specifies a whole wages structure and a whole career structure
for workers in the agricultural sector. It does not simply specify a
minimum wage, like the national minimum wage; nor is it the same as
most of the old wages councils, which simply specified a basic rate
rather than the whole range of conditions required within the
agricultural sector, which will be difficult to achieve without some
legal underpinning by normal methods of collective bargaining either
nationally or by agreements between individual farmers and their own
workforce—something that would often be very difficult for both
sides to
accomplish<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T19:07:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030690000047" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0002.htm#13030690000047">The
Minister claims that this is a great removal of burdens on small farm
businesses, but the operation of the board has in many cases been of
great benefit to small farmers. In the consultation—such as it
was; it 
<?notus-xml column=1556?>was only four weeks’ consultation, whereas most people are
required to go through three months, and it was only one week in
Wales—a significant number of small famers said they wished to
retain the Agricultural Wages Board because that meant that once a year
they knew what they were going to pay their staff and they did not have
to go into embarrassing and lengthy detailed negotiations
with their own two or three employees. Therefore, the burden of
administration on the farmers is actually less under the Agricultural
Wages Board than it will be if the Minister gets his way and it is
abolished<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T19:07:47"></hs_TimeCode>. In

impact assessment also says that the effect on farmers’ incomes
will be a significant improvement. In fact, it has that down as the
reciprocal of the cut in the agricultural workers’ wages. But
the reality is that a lot of those famers will never see that money, or
will only see it temporarily. The wage cut for workers will
almost certainly end up being of benefit to the supermarkets. It is
very interesting that in the consultation nearly 40% of the replies are
from the horticultural sector, which employs the mass amount of casual,
unskilled labour and which deals directly with the supermarkets. Even
more tellingly, the strongest supporters in the rest of the food chain
are the Fresh Produce Consortium, whose dominant members happen to be
Tesco, Morrisons, Asda and Marks &amp;

once the supermarket buyers hear that the Agricultural Wages Board and
the minimum rates have been abolished, they will go back to their
farmers and suppliers and say, “We want a cut in the prices that
we are giving you”. The reality is that whatever burdens the
Minister claims will be removed from small employers, many of whom do
not accept that, the money will not come out of the pockets of farm
workers and into the pockets of the farmers, it will go out of the
rural community entirely and into the pockets of the

dangerous move and one that we certainly could not support. There is
little in what the Minister said tonight with which I can agree. There
is little in what his supporters in Committee, who were in the

estate, on my own farm, people I know pay a lot more than the minimum
wage”. Of course they do. It is a wages structure. A lot of
employers pay more than the minimum. But once you abolish the floor,
the whole wages structure starts coming
down<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T19:10:32"></hs_TimeCode>. The impact

sector has a wages board. We do not have one in construction or in
transport: why in agriculture? The perception seems to be of a sector
stuck in a <I>Lark Rise to Candleford</I> era where employees are
exploited by unscrupulous employers who resemble the mill owners of the

The parties concerned meet for their annual sport and confront each

cottages. Now, however, they are far more mobile than they have ever

reflected in some of the responses to the consultation that,
as long as the wages board exists, many farmers will continue to
abdicate their responsibilities for negotiating terms with their
employees and simply adjust their salary levels annually when the wages
board pronounces its decision. It is time for that to stop and for
employers to properly take on the responsibility—as I am
convinced they will—to reward their employees for the skilled

Whitty, and agricultural workers who came to brief us this morning are
obviously very worried at the Government’s assessment of a loss

indication as to how that was achieved. Can the Minister tell us
whether that figure includes savings or reductions in monies other than
purely wages, where the figure was derived from and on whom is it
likely to impact? The agricultural representatives took it that
overtime rates will be totally abolished. The question of working hours
is well defined, for all workers, by the EU working time directive, so
everyone knows how many hours are required in any employment in excess
of this figure. Under what guidance or legislation will the rates of
payment for these hours be
determined?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030692000047" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0002.htm#13030692000047">The

graded system in the rates of remuneration. However, the grades
currently in place are built on a system of certified qualifications

acknowledges that agriculture is very different from 60 to 65 years ago
when the current Agricultural Wages Board was introduced. I know that
some of the work can still be very tedious and repetitive, such as
riddling potatoes for hour after hour or even driving up and down a
field all day, albeit in an air-conditioned or heated cab, either with
or without sat-nav assisted steering. Of course, now no weights are
lifted because instead of bags coming in at 1 hundredweight or even 2
hundredweight as they used to, they come in weights of 1 tonne. So you
automatically jump into the forklift truck, do things much quicker and
save yourself from exposure to the

the work with livestock can be pretty full-time. You are always on
call, particularly at certain times of the year, such as during lambing
or calving and, even more importantly, when quietly walking up and down
your dairy buildings at night to check which cows might be on heat in
order to maintain or to avoid your calving index slipping. I also know
that work with livestock can sometimes take place in fairly fresh and
rugged conditions, both wet and cold. It has always seemed to me that
shepherds and dairymen really should be flock or herd managers and paid
an annual salary with bonuses paid on targets achieved. As I understand
it, that is not specifically allowed under the current rules of the
AWB—or at least it does not

our farm, including in our dairy, we do not pay much attention to that
or to any Agricultural Wages Board rates. We pay much more than the AWB
rate. We would not keep staff very long if we did not. As I have said
before, why would one pay a minimum wage to people responsible for
operating machinery costing up to £500,000 or more, and whose
skill at operating it can sometimes be the difference between profit
and loss on the

the Agricultural Wages Board is—everyone has mentioned this and
I have admitted it before—a very convenient benchmark to use in
the annual wage adjustments. On our farm, all wages across the farm go
up by the 2%, 3% or whatever the AWB rate is. In addition, we usually
round it up. Incidentally, in the consultation evidence I received from
Unite, I noted that by far the most common reason—again, it has
been repeated in the debate today—from farmers for 
<?notus-xml column=1567?>opposing the abolition was the helpful benchmarking service that the AWB
provides. However, as I have also said previously, this is a service
quite easily replaced, and indeed promised, by the NFU and others on a
non-statutory basis. Therefore, I am afraid that I have to discount all
that evidence. I do not think that it is relevant to the

question really is: why should we get rid of the safety net? If most
farmers pay no attention to it, does it really matter whether we have
it or not? After all, it is only a small cost to the taxpayer in the
general scheme of things. It is the last of many wages
boards and councils, and therefore has a historic role, if nothing
else—the last vestige of post-war
socialism<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T19:54:25"></hs_TimeCode>. I
admit that I have only limited knowledge of the horticultural industry,
where it is claimed that the national minimum wage—a full 2p per
hour less—would apply if the AWB was not
there<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T19:54:39"></hs_TimeCode>.
Furthermore, the rightly generous overtime rates of the AWB would no
longer apply in that industry, which I believe is a valid point. But
perhaps that is a fault of the national minimum wage rules rather than
a plus point for the
AWB<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T19:54:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030692000054" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0002.htm#13030692000054">I
paused in my thought processes here. What harm is the AWB doing? After
all, agriculture is no longer a poorly paid industry, so it must be
being successful. The hourly average pay in agriculture is higher than
in hotels, restaurants, shops and even local authority administration.
Why dispense with all that gain? I like to think that I care about
farming families, both employers and employees. I have spent most of my
life trying to promote wider businesses and jobs in the countryside
outside farming<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T19:55:30"></hs_TimeCode>,
because agriculture represents less than 4% of rural employment.
Therefore, one of the reasons for my passionate promotion of the wider
economy is that many farming families, both employers and employees,
depend on having a non-agricultural wage earner in their family to
maintain their lifestyle or, if they are the employers, their presence
on the
land<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T19:55:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030692000055" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0002.htm#13030692000055">I
asked myself whether it is helpful to overall employment in agriculture
that there should be a state-controlled wage structure over and above
the minimum wage which the other 96% of the rural workforce does not
enjoy. I asked myself whether the rest of the rural economy was ruined
by the abolition of the other 100 or so wage councils. Or is it spoilt
now by having a free market in wages, subject of course to the national
minimum

lorry drivers disadvantaged by not having a lorry drivers’ wages
board? I take that as a good equivalent because they, too, spend long
hours in cabs, driving up and down—not fields but roads. I
thought that they were not disadvantaged. The rural economy is
flourishing better than ever before, including lorry drivers. As an
aside, obviously any reform of the CAP should put more money into
Pillar 2 and less into Pillar 1 but that is not the subject we are

next question to myself was whether UK agriculture can adapt and grow
better, including providing more overall employment up and down the
whole food chain, with or without its own centrally controlled,
state-run wage order. All my experience over the past 50 years suggests
that state interference in an industry 
<?notus-xml column=1568?>is not very helpful to any of the participants in that industry, apart
from the need for a national minimum wage structure and having a strong

the 10-page submission, headed “Subsidies for wealthy landowners

lowest level set. The union also claims that there is no such thing as

Government’s best estimate is a cost to the rural workers of
£236 million over the next decade. Abolishing the
Agricultural Wages 
<?notus-xml column=1570?>Board would bring agriculture into line with all other sectors in the
economy. Allowing farmers to compete fairly in the labour market and
allowing agricultural wages to follow market levels will enhance the
competitiveness of the sector and may increase employment. This would
in turn encourage long-term prosperity in rural
areas<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T20:05:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030692000071" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0002.htm#13030692000071">The
impact assessment itself gives a range of impacts and makes it clear
that there is considerable uncertainty, with a potential £238
million impact for workers being at the upper end of the range. The
impact assessment also makes clear that there may be, in fact, no
reduction in wages or worker benefits. I would like to give a little
more information than was asked for in terms of how we arrived at these
figures. I stress that the figures are the upper estimate, based on
empirical research comparing wages in fisheries and the agricultural
sector over an 11-year period up to 2010. The figures are based on two
particular issues. First they are based on existing workers. With the
abolition of the Agricultural Wages Board, one assumes that existing
workers on contracts would not receive a pay rise over 10 years.
Therefore there would be a definition of wage slippage, allowing for
inflation. Secondly, it allows for new workers who may be taken on at
the national minimum wage rate, not the old agricultural wages rate, if
the Agricultural Wages Board was abolished. So it assumes the very
worst scenario, with no increase at all on what there was before, and
it assumes, in effect, that farmers would be sitting on their hands. I
would argue that this would be highly unrealistic.</hs_para>

reduction in wages in the agricultural sector by £250 million.

doubt, in many of the enterprises of the noble Lords, Lord Cavendish,
Lord Cameron and Lord Curry—I am sorry to fall out with him, but
at least we are both being consistent on this issue—there will
be better pay and little impact. But all the Government’s
statisticians, agronomists and economists are looking at the total
situation and saying, “The net effect of all this in aggregate
across the whole of the agricultural and horticultural sector will be a
loss of wages of that order”. That is their best estimate and
that is at odds with the noble Lord, Lord Cavendish, and the circle of
farmers in which he moves. Although clearly they are in the same
geographical area, they are a different lot from those among whom the
noble Lord, Lord Greaves, moves. But, even if he is right for all those
farmers, the Government’s view is that is not the total effect
on the sector. Either the Government’s impact assessment is

abolition and arguments against any other alternatives. They have tried
to cut corners on this, but their own experts tell them that the net
effect of this will be a substantial cut in rural workers’
incomes.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13030697000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0002.htm#13030697000009">If
the House votes for the Government’s amendment and defeats my
amendment to that amendment, that is what they are voting for tonight
and they had better recognise it. That is the message they will be
sending 
<?notus-xml column=1575?>out to rural areas. I am looking perhaps particularly to people on the
Liberal Democrat Benches who were not committed by
their manifesto to this abolition, as the noble Lord, Lord Greaves,
said. I do believe that the Government have got this wrong. We could
have had a more coherent debate had we gone down the route of the
Public Bodies Bill and the Government had produced their range of
statistics and we could have had a sensible argument. Instead, we have
a minimalist consultation, minimalist information and the Government
sticking to an ideological position, supported by some elements of the
farming industry but by no means all, and prepared to try and push
through something which has an impact on the incomes of a lot of rural
workers and their families. My amendment would allow a better way
forward, a modernising way forward, and a reduction of bureaucracy, but
it would retain the central protection that those agricultural workers
have had and which they deserve to
retain.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030697000010" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0002.htm#13030697000010"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Byford" PimsId="2408" UID="13030697000443" xid="1122" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0002.htm#13030697000443">Baroness
Byford:</Member></B> My Lords. I will be very brief. Three times the

nothing to do with the rural workforce; it is to do with the
Agricultural Wages Board and he is misleading colleagues if he keeps
using that
phrase.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030697000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0002.htm#13030697000011"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Whitty" PimsId="4591" UID="13030697000444" xid="1139" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0002.htm#13030697000444">Lord
Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, the right reverend Prelate said two
things. First, the agriculture workforce is a smaller proportion of the
rural workforce than it used to be, but also the Agricultural Wages
Board is taken, either in its substance or in the rate of increase, to
a lot of other rural workers, so it does affect a wider range than
those who are legally entitled to Agricultural Wages Board rates. It is
not the whole of the rural workforce, but it is nevertheless taking
£250 million out of the rural economy, ostensibly giving it to
the farmers, but actually giving it to the supermarkets. If that is
what the House wishes to vote for tonight, they had better be clear
that that is what they are doing.</hs_para>

and wretchedly, war remains a part of the tragic present, and
today’s debate takes us to the very heart of contemporary
conflict. Sexual violence in conflict stretches back into history, well
before the 
<?notus-xml column=1579?>20th century. That conflict-strewn century saw such abuses of our common
humanity multiply terrifyingly. In the Bosnian conflict, in our own
continent of Europe, somewhere between 20,000 and 50,000
women were raped. In a continent that traces the history of its
civilisation back to antiquity, and indeed in a continent ravaged by
two world wars in that century, these figures can scarcely be taken
in.</hs_para>

terrifyingly still, in the Rwandan genocide between 300,000 and 400,000
women were raped in a period of only 100 days. These figures alone give
us cause enthusiastically and energetically to support and develop the
Government’s initiative, led personally by the Foreign
Secretary: the preventing sexual violence initiative. I am sure that
the Minister will elaborate further on that initiative, and on the
prospects for achieving a resolute consensus on this matter at the G8
Foreign Ministers meeting next month, so I shall focus in the minutes
available to me on further
background.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030697000016" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0002.htm#13030697000016">The
2012 Human Security Report Project challenged this dominant narrative
on a number of fronts. It pressed home some important points and argued
that such violence is exceptional and confined to certain conflicts.
Sometimes the claims are not based on evidence. The omission of male
victims from the mainstream narrative is also crucial. Indeed, some of
the data were missing. These exaggerations and weaknesses can too
easily play down the significance of sexual violence in wider society.
However, the figures quoted earlier from specific conflicts are
sufficient to indicate the alarming abuse of humanity
implied.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030697000017" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0002.htm#13030697000017">Sadly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T20:37:16"></hs_TimeCode>,
we are seeing such terrifying abuse committed in Syria today. I would
welcome some comment from the Minister on how we might properly
document such abuse, so that future legal redress and prosecution will
be possible. In Syria, for reasons we all know, the western nations
appear powerless to halt the appalling atrocities being committed by
both sides in the conflict. What, then, are the crucial questions?
First, this is obviously more than a moral issue. However morality is
defined—by human rights, by a categorical imperative, by natural
law, by respect for persons—sexual violence is an extreme denial
of moral purpose and integrity, even in the extraordinary and tragic
conditions of war and armed
conflict.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030697000018" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0002.htm#13030697000018">Secondly,
there is the issue of impunity. The facts of war do not somehow remove
culpability and the normal patterns of human responsibility. Rape and
sexual violence are inhumane and immoral in every circumstance, but
fear has too often driven out a proper challenge and response to these
tragic and inhumane abuses. In places such as the Democratic Republic
of the Congo, which I know well, this is the precise situation. In the
case of that republic, Her Majesty’s Government should be
encouraged to push the donor community to enforce all aid-funded
reforms: in the army and justice sectors, in infrastructure, in basic
services provision and elsewhere. By pressing this home, there is that
much more chance of putting an end to the conflict in general, and also
to respond to the lack of protection and the fragile
situation of women. In the DRC, many agencies, including the churches,
have been muzzled by fear and terror of retribution, not only
individually but within 
<?notus-xml column=1580?>entire communities. This is true, and it is one of the reasons why it
has been difficult even for churches to act together without somehow
endangering some members of their sister
churches<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T20:37:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030697000019" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0002.htm#13030697000019">Universally,

churches under the title We Will Speak Out. The catalyst for this, the
Tearfund report, <I>Silent No More</I>, particularly documented the
churches’ responses in the Great Lakes region of Africa. The
churches are determined to set their faces against the muzzling of
those caught up in such conflict. It would be good to hear from the
Minister how the bottom-up, community-based efforts of churches and
other faith-based organisations might best feed into the
Government’s own
initiative.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030697000020" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0002.htm#13030697000020">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T20:37:16"></hs_TimeCode>

UK Government in their engagement with the UN could contribute by
seeking to place the issue of sexual-based violence on the agenda at
peace negotiations. There can be no amnesty in law for rape and violent
crimes in times of war. However, very little has been done not just to
bring offenders to book but even to articulate that rape is a crime and
action will be taken against those responsible. These issues rarely
form part of peace negotiations and that is because the offenders are
the people at the table and they have no interest in bringing the issue
to the table. If supporting Governments, such as the UK, could make it
clear that aid and assistance will only follow if women have a place at
the negotiating table and if the peace agreement contains a clear
statement about sexual violence and its consequences, this would
provide a context for beginning to address the problem. The UK could
also use its influence to promote compliance with the requirement that
peacekeepers deal with their own perpetrators of sexual violence and
most particularly that they deal with, and provide for, the UN
babies—those born out of the
conflict<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T20:53:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030697000035" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0002.htm#13030697000035">Another
contribution that the UK is very well placed to make would be in the
context of criminal investigation. Any complaint that a rape victim
makes has to be in the context of local and national law. Women often
have to accept that they have no access through criminal law courts and
their only redress is through local laws. The Government could, in
their 
<?notus-xml column=1583?>aid packages, prioritise a functioning police and judiciary. Women in
these countries express the fact that they need to
be able to work closely with the social guardians to disseminate
messages about GBV. They say that when church and state and any UN and

it works.</hs_para>

Alderdice:</Member></B> My Lords, I suppose it is a tragic
inevitability that shooting, bombing, injuring and killing people
violently is part of war, and there is often debate about which
incidents of bombing, shooting or violence are within the moral or
legal framework. However, there is no dispute that sexual violence in
the context of war is outside all moral and legal limits. I believe
that those who in engage in this kind of behaviour know perfectly well
that they are outside what is morally acceptable—unless they
have so dehumanised those whom they are abusing that they have largely
lost their own humanity. We should be clear about this: there are no
contexts in which this is acceptable, either to the overwhelming
majority of victims who are women, or as we are increasingly seeing in
Syria, the minority who are men, often young men.</hs_para>

Colombia has recently begun peace dialogues with the FARC guerrilla

Tonge:</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate the right reverend Prelate
on securing this debate. I wish to raise three practical points. First,
the Foreign Secretary has stated that rape and sexual violence are used
as a deliberate weapon of war. That said, will he take the lead at the
G8 in calling for rape and sexual violence in conflict to be classified
as a war
crime?</hs_para><hs_para UID="130306100000002" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0003.htm#130306100000002">Secondly,
we had reassurances during the debate tabled by the Lord, Lord Lester,
two weeks ago that after rape during conflict, women are entitled to
have a safe abortion, if they want it, under international humanitarian
law. Can we therefore have this specifically included in DfID’s
paper on safe and unsafe abortion, so that it is quite clear? It is
unthinkable that women who have been raped should be forced to continue
their pregnancy, should they not want
to.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130306100000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0003.htm#130306100000003">Finally,
NGOs often pool funds for specific projects and I have been totally
unable to establish whether the USA’s ban on funds for abortion
is affecting our projects in this field. NGOs that I have
approached—and there are many—are unable to give me any
figures at all so how can we be sure that our money, channelled through
DfID, is being used for safe abortion? Please can the Minister give us
some more information?</hs_para>

Hodgson of Astley Abbotts:</Member></B> My Lords, I offer my thanks,
briefly but sincerely, to the right reverend Prelate for having given
us the chance to debate this important matter. I need to draw the
House’s attention to my involvement with the charity Freedom
from Torture, which offers solace, comfort and rehabilitation to
refugees in the UK who have been tortured overseas. All too often, I am
afraid, that torture involves rape.</hs_para>

remarks, I want to focus on an aspect of this terrible topic that has
not been raised before: that is to say the rape of men, young boys and
adults. It is an equally ugly but less reported crime and one where
perpetrators are rarely, if ever, brought to justice. Male rape does
not fit easily into the narrative. As my noble friend Lady Eaton said,
men are supposed to be strong and dominant, not vulnerable and weak.
Further, male rape, which will inevitably involve anal penetration,
gives rise to particularly horrific injuries. In countries where
homosexuality is culturally frowned upon or remains a criminal
activity, such injuries are even more likely to remain unreported and
untreated.</hs_para>

Prelate referred to the Democratic Republic of Congo. The American
Medical Association, which surveyed that country, said that 30% of the
women had been raped but that 22% of the men had been raped as well. It
is not just in Africa that these stories remain unheard. One of the few
academics to have looked into the issue in any detail is Lara Stemple
of the University of California’s Health and Human Rights Law
Project. Her study, <I>Male Rape a</I><I>nd Human Rights</I>, notes
incidents of male sexual violence as a weapon of war or political
aggression in countries as diverse as Chile, Greece, Croatia, Iran,
Kuwait, the former Soviet Union and the former Yugoslavia.</hs_para>

towards the exit door in Afghanistan we are in danger of leaving behind
an endemic male-rape culture. As the BBC reported recently, every
police base has at least one “chai boy”, who usually
looks between 13 and 15 years old. Police commanders often see it as
their right to abduct a local boy from his family and keep him as a
servant and sex slave. Is this what we went to Afghanistan to
preserve?</hs_para>

only 2% of the perpetrators were ever brought to justice. The Foreign
Secretary has put on record his conviction that effective response to
sexual violence needs to be built into every aspect of conflict

statistics on violence against women and girls are shocking. Globally,
one in three women is beaten or sexually abused in her lifetime. In
conflict and post-conflict situations, sexual violence can be even more
widespread, as the noble Lord, Lord Parekh, pointed out. As the noble
Baroness, Lady Eaton, the noble Lord, Lord Collins, and others have
said, women and girls are the poorest and most marginal in
society, with the least power. In conflicts, they are the most
vulnerable. As the noble Lord, Lord McConnell, the noble Baroness, Lady
Tonge, and others have pointed out, we also see rape being used as a
weapon against the woman, her family, her
community and her society. However, as the right reverend Prelate says,
and my noble friend Lord Hodgson emphasised, we also see sexual
violence against men and boys used to degrade and destroy. We see that
now in Syria. The noble Lord, Lord Sheikh, rightly emphasised the
stigma of
rape<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T21:17:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

silence on this and change behaviours? Unless we do, we undermine the
likelihood of peaceful resolutions. We know that sexual violence causes
huge physical and psychological trauma. My noble friend Lady Hamwee
referred to that. But it also exacerbates ethnic, sectarian and other
divisions, further entrenches conflict and undermines efforts to
restore peace and stability. It reduces progress towards the millennium
development goals and represents one of the most serious forms of human
rights violation or abuse. For all these reasons, tackling violence
against women and girls is central to the Government’s work
overseas. We agree with the noble Lord, Lord McConnell, that women and
girls must continue to be at the heart of whatever replaces the
MDGs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130306102000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0003.htm#130306102000004">This
year, 2013, is a hugely important year for this agenda. We are working
hard with other Governments to ensure that this year’s UN
Commission on the Status of Women, whose focus is on violence against
women and girls, is a success and agrees a set of robust global
standards to protect women and girls from discrimination and violence.
My honourable friend Lynne Featherstone is leading the UK delegation.
We also want to see women and girls at the heart of the new millennium
development goal framework to be published later this year. Their
inclusion is critical to achieving our goal of ending extreme
poverty.</hs_para>

greater government action to address the use of sexual violence in
conflict as we further develop and implement the Foreign
Secretary’s preventing sexual violence initiative, to which
noble Lords have
referred.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T21:19:37"></hs_TimeCode> In our
own lifetimes, millions of women, men, and children have endured this
horror, including in the Democratic Republic of Congo, to which noble
Lords have referred, in South Sudan, in Colombia, as the noble
Baroness, Lady Coussins, said, in Bosnia and in Syria. The truth today,
as the right reverend Prelate pointed out, is that the perpetrators of
these appalling, life-shattering crimes more often than
not<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T21:20:07"></hs_TimeCode> go
unpunished.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="130306102000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0003.htm#130306102000006">We believe that more
must be done to combat the use of sexual violence in conflict. We want
the international community to address the culture of impunity that has
been allowed to develop for these crimes and to increase the number of
perpetrators brought to justice, both internationally and nationally.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T21:20:27"></hs_TimeCode>As other noble
Lords have mentioned, the Foreign Secretary has placed this issue at
the top of the G8 agenda for 2013. We want G8 Foreign Ministers at
their April meeting to speak out against those who use sexual violence
in conflict and to declare that rape and serious sexual violence amount
to grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions. This is a very significant
step in the development of international humanitarian law. Declaring
that serious sexual violence and rape amount to grave breaches sends
the message that these crimes are to be treated in the same way as the
most serious category of war crimes. I can therefore reassure my noble
friends Lady Tonge and Lord Alderdice that these crimes will become the
most serious category of war crime in international
law<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T21:21:24"></hs_TimeCode>. I can also
assure my noble friend Lord Alderdice that they can be taken to the
International Criminal
Court<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T21:21:38"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T21:21:38"></hs_TimeCode>.
Consultation with prosecutors at the ICC has clearly identified that a
lack of clarity over investigations and collection of evidence led to
the low number of prosecutions in the ICC and other international
tribunals. The protocol will directly address
this<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T21:21:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

are also proposing a set of practical G8 commitments that, taken
together, will promote justice and accountability and provide greater
support to victims. I hope that my noble friend Lady Hamwee, the noble
Lords, Lord Parekh and Lord Judd, and others will welcome them. These
commitments are, first, to improve investigations and the documentation
of sexual violence in conflict, including through endorsing a new
international protocol; secondly, to provide greater support and
assistance to survivors, including child survivors, of sexual violence,
so that they can rebuild their lives and attain justice for what they
have endured; thirdly, as the noble Baroness, Lady O’Loan,
emphasised, to ensure that the response to sexual and gender-based
violence is fully integrated into wider peace and security efforts; and
fourthly, to improve international co-ordination, including through the
UN, because a co-operative approach to addressing sexual violence will
have a much greater long-term
impact<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T21:23:06"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T21:23:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130306102000008" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0003.htm#130306102000008">To
underpin these international efforts, the Government have established a
new specialist UK team of experts, to which the noble Lord, Lord
Sheikh, referred, who can be deployed to conflict areas to help local
authorities and organisations address sexual violence. This team has
already been deployed to the Syrian border to help 
<?notus-xml column=1591?>train local health professionals. In answer to the right reverend
Prelate, we aim to work with, and support, those who can document these
abuses in that area. We also plan to deploy the team to at least five
other countries this year. It will go to Libya, to support survivors of
sexual violence committed during the revolution; to South Sudan, to
work alongside the UN and the Government to strengthen local justice;
to eastern DRC, to help doctors and lawyers to investigate crimes
against the hundreds of women and girls who are raped each month; to
Bosnia-Herzegovina, to help courts and prosecutors address the backlog
of war crimes cases; and to Mali, to provide human rights training to
the Malian armed forces on preventing and responding to sexual
violence. As the noble Baroness, Lady O’Loan, emphasised, in
order to address these issues, we need first the law to protect and
then we need to work with those who can help to ensure the
implementation of those laws: the police, the judges, civil society and
the
media<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T21:24:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130306102000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0003.htm#130306102000009">Our
plans for the initiative have been developed in consultation with UN
agencies, other international bodies, NGOs, and—I can also
reassure the right reverend Prelate—representatives from faith
groups. These groups have a particular role, not least because of their
ability to reach out across communities. We want to continue to work
closely with them as we challenge the myths and stigma associated with
victims of sexual
violence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T21:25:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

questions. My noble friend Lady Tonge asked about the proposals we
brought forward earlier this year in terms of international
humanitarian law. In conflict situations, even if it is contrary to
national law, abortion care can be offered where its denial would
amount to torture or cruel treatment. We need now to focus very much on
bringing our international partners with us on this. We are very
forward-looking on this, as we have been in the area of safe abortion
as well, and it is extremely important that we take others with us.
However, if the noble Baroness has any evidence that UK aid is not
being used appropriately and is not reaching women, will she please let

but groundbreaking. By working with our international partners we have
moved this forward in a very significant way, and we now need to take

which I suppose is a form of light relief from earlier parts of the

will have noticed that the Minister has been a prolific correspondent.
In case full details are not provided on all the amendments we have put
forward, those outside the House should know that letters were passed
on 25 February to the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson of Balmacara, on the
orphan works aspects of Clause 69 and on Clause 67; to myself on 11
February, and on 4 March on Clause 68; and, most recently,
on 5 March there was a letter on extended collective licensing. I thank

Lord Howarth, said. I quite agree. It is refreshing to be able to have
that communication. It is not always a game of ping-pong or tennis. One
can resolve some of these issues as we go along. In particular, this
probing amendment is designed to elicit further information from the
Minister. I thought we had a very good assurance from him that the IPO
would publish an annual report which would be laid before Parliament,
and that this could include a progress report on work towards a digital
hub for licensing purposes.</hs_para>

been able to do in the light of the Committee debates and of the
several meetings that he has been kind enough to hold. Indeed, there
are now amendments on the Order Paper in his name, which I think will
be extremely
welcome<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T21:41:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

remember that, when we started debating the copyright clauses in Grand
Committee, I moved a new clause to set up what was in effect intended
to be a champion for IP. I was gratified by the support I had from all
parts of the Committee for that new clause. I have not retabled it for
the very good reason that I think my noble friend Lord Younger has gone
a long way to prove that he will be an effective champion of IP. He
made it clear in his reply to the debate that he was, in fact, in
charge of IP at his department, and he has been as good as his word in
the amendments that he has tabled.</hs_para>

can assure him that the correspondence that I have had since the end of
Committee, and in particular since the government amendments were
tabled, has entirely changed in tone. Those who were very deeply 
<?notus-xml column=1596?>concerned beforehand at what the Bill appeared to portend for the future
of copyright property rights seem to have been greatly reassured. For
that reason I have not retabled the amendment asking for a champion
because I think my noble friend has gone a long way to satisfying me
that he will do his best to perform that function.</hs_para>

my noble friend’s speeches and letters, to which my noble friend
Lord Clement-Jones referred, have made it very much clearer than it was
before what the Bill is intended to do and what the Government’s
policy on this issue is. I like to think that there has been
not only a change in tone but a change in substance, and recognition
that IP is indeed a hugely important economic factor in this
country’s economy, involving many billions of pounds and many
hundreds of thousands —indeed, millions—of people whose
livelihoods depend on it. If the Government have really hoisted that
one on board, that can only be a credit to the debates that we had in
this House and, above all, to my noble
friend.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-06?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_06_PT_1/62C0249CD188071B66DB4EC24136170C1743E201" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 6 March 2013">Wednesday,

I have spoken on this Bill previously, I have said that it has much to
commend it, and I am still of that view—very much so. Close
scrutiny through Grand Committee has given the Government the
opportunity to improve the Bill further and indeed in many cases they
have. I am particularly interested in Clauses 67 to 69, which have a
direct impact on the cultural fabric of and economic opportunity for
the UK. In particular, the creative industries have shown incredible
concern about the manner in which these proposals were formed and the
perception that there is a will within Government and the Intellectual
Property Office to unpick the intellectual property framework that
underpins many creators and rights holders, in favour of US technology
companies and others who want to use more copyright content for
free<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T21:45:31"></hs_TimeCode>. Of course,
the Minister has gone a long way to seek to allay those
fears<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T21:45:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130306102000101" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0003.htm#130306102000101">However,
commercial companies and organisations in our creative industries quite
rightly expect a financial return from investing in creating original
content and then archiving and preserving it for others to pay a
licence. They lead the way in it and in many sectors such as
audiovisual there is healthy competition, sensible pricing and
industry-driven innovation to adapt to the digital age. Therefore, it
is wholly wrong, in our view, for legislation to reduce these
commercial incentives in favour of the radical and in many cases I
believe ill-advised recommendations from Professor Hargreaves that
inform the copyright measures in this
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T21:46:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130306102000102" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0003.htm#130306102000102">One
of the reasons for putting my name to this particular amendment is that
we have to think about competition not just in terms of cross-border
and close to home but further afield. For example—I may refer to
this later when we are looking in more detail at extended collective
licensing—China has just announced that it would implement ECL
in its copyright law. It is 
<?notus-xml column=1597?>said that the details will be in regulations yet to be published. The UK
Government will not be in a position to demand appropriate safeguards
for licensing of UK copyrights by ECL in China if we ourselves do not
have them in our own legislation as the Nordic countries do. Nor will
UK rights holders or their representative bodies be in a strong
position to safeguard UK rights abused by ECLs in foreign countries if
the UK’s own statute lacks the necessary
safeguards<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T21:47:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130306102000103" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0003.htm#130306102000103">I

Howarth of Newport:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, welcome the
Minister’s commitment that an annual report should be published
by the Intellectual Property Office. It may not reach the top of the
bestseller lists, but it is right in principle that the public should
have the opportunity to be informed about what the current issues are
and what developments in policy are or may be. That is very
proper<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T21:48:09"></hs_TimeCode>. Of
course, Parliament in particular should have that information. I hope

congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Clement Jones, and his co-signatories
on the terms in which they have they expressed this amendment and the
particular examples that they have given of the kind of material that
should be covered in the annual report. The report would need to review
the state of copyright licensing in the United Kingdom. I hope that in
fulfilling that requirement it would provide a discussion about how the
Intellectual Property Office seeks to balance its absolutely right and
necessary defence of the interests of intellectual property holders
with wider interests that the public may have in the early and
extensive benefit that can be received from the dissemination of this
new information, knowledge and material. That is

am also pleased that the expectation would be that the annual report
should review cross-border co-ordination between our own jurisdiction
and jurisdictions in other
countries<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T21:49:41"></hs_TimeCode>. For
example, we would certainly want to know how the Intellectual Property
Office and BIS are looking to mesh the complementary policies that we

the European Union and other countries that may be ahead of us in some
respects.</hs_para>

that the European Union orphan works directive is very limited and
strictly curtailed in what it would allow. Only cultural sector bodies
and educational establishments, not companies, could benefit from its
provisions. Public/private partnerships, for example, would be
prevented. That represents what is at the moment too limited and
cautious an approach on the part of the European

digitisation projects are only going to be able to be carried out by
our great cultural institutions in partnership with the private sector,
and that ought to 
<?notus-xml column=1598?>be contemplated as policy-making develops both in this country and in
Brussels. The attempt to continue to draw absolute distinctions between
commercial and non-commercial purposes will prove to be too restrictive
of the ability of great institutions that are publicly funded in this
country, such as libraries, universities and museums, which ought to be
able to work freely in partnership with the private sector but which
may be constrained by legislation as it has so far appeared to
develop.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130306102000109" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0003.htm#130306102000109">The
noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, also mentioned the question of
metadata. That is highlighted in the amendment. It is excellent that,
at last, we have a working group looking at the problems that arise
with metadata and digital photography. The working group is trying to
find out why this stripping happens, why creators do not get paid and,
above all, what solutions might be found, presumably by way of new
technology but perhaps in other ways, to ensure that intellectual
property is not stolen from photographers. The fact that it is already
illegal to strip metadata under Section 107 sadly does not
prevent it happening. There is a legitimate and very important issue
there and I hope that progress on that will be covered in the report,
as the noble Lord
said.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130306102000110" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0003.htm#130306102000110">I also

hope that the annual report will include some account of how the IPO
weathers these storms and what its philosophy is in terms of receiving
and listening to representations and establishing working groups which
allow people to have the opportunity to contribute their thinking and
remind policy-makers of their legitimate interests but, at the same
time, do not cause the policy to be unduly tipped and biased in favour
of those who shout loudest. That would always be wrong. I have every
confidence that that will not be allowed to happen. However, it may be
helpful to those who have this arduous and difficult responsibility of
developing the technical details of policy in the copyright field that
we have a better understanding of what it is that they have to cope

Stevenson of Balmacara:</Member></B> My Lords, I will make a few brief
remarks in closing this short debate. First, I associate myself with
the warm expressions of thanks and support to the Minister not only for
his very assiduous work in responding to the questions and queries that
were raised at earlier stages of the Bill but for the meetings that he
has had. I am not quite sure how he has managed to keep going—he
is looking a bit shell-shocked, although that may not just have been
today. We are all very grateful to him for what he has done. Indeed, it
has brought a different sensibility to the whole way in which we have
been able to engage with this and I am very grateful for that. I am
sorry that the choir has lost his very nice tuneful voice as a result,
but I hope he will get back into it after this intensive work is
over<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T21:57:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130306102000115" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0003.htm#130306102000115">Having
said that, has the mood really changed? We have just heard that there
are still quite big guns out there, and the reference from my noble
friend Lord Howarth to the judicial review—I have benefited from
the courtesy of being shown a copy of the 36-page document that went
in—certainly suggests that there are still some people with axes
to grind out there and serious points, too, which need to be considered
and reflected. Although we are making progress and, I think, beginning
to arrive at a common position on a number of issues raised in this
part of the Bill, there are still some hurdles ahead which we have got
to think about. For instance, I got two letters and several e-mails
today from people again expressing concern about what is happening
here. They are not sighted and perhaps not up to speed with what is
going on but they certainly feel very strongly about
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T21:58:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130306102000116" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0003.htm#130306102000116">As
other noble Lords have said, there are other things going on here. We
are doing a lot of the work in this Bill but, in parallel, the outcome
of the Hargreaves report and the various pieces of secondary
legislation that will be going through, which radically change the way
in which we deal with copyright and performance rights, need to be
accommodated and brought alongside some of the movements that are here.
A lot of what we have been saying in the discussions and debates on
this 
<?notus-xml column=1600?>Bill has been contingent on a satisfactory outcome for those things, and
I do not want to prejudge where we are going to get to on parody,
exceptions for educational use and desirable things like copying for
archives. These are all important parts of the ecology that this Bill
touches on but does not completely encapsulate.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T21:56:19"></hs_TimeCode> must
therefore be careful not to overcall what we are achieving
here.</hs_para>

third example on that list would perhaps be the one raised by the noble
Baroness, Lady Buscombe, which is that we are not alone here; lots of
other people are working on their copyright registrations and
legislation and moving forward. That will always affect how we do
things. We will not make the progress that we want to make in terms of
this industry, and the work that goes into this type of activity in the
UK will be for nothing, if we are outsmarted and outgunned by those who
either have a much more advanced concept of copyright and licensing or
none at all. These are important
points.</hs_para><hs_time UID="130306102000156" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0003.htm#130306102000156">10

do not want to be the odd one out in this party. In general I want to
support what we are doing in moving forward. In relation to the narrow
point about what we are doing to welcome the report, may I just make
three or four points? First, while I have the greatest respect for the
IPO and for the work of the department to which it is attached, it is
not the only part of government that deals with copyright issues. We
were graced with a fleeting visit from the former Secretary of State at
the DCMS, the noble Baroness, Lady Bottomley. I am sure that had she
been able to stay she would have said that her
department—indeed, the Minister was briefly in that
department—has a lot to offer in terms of copyright and
intellectual property, and that not all of it is entirely on a par with
what is emanating from BIS. I am sure these issues can be resolved, but
I am not sure that the Whitehall structure has got that to the best
possible pitch. It would be interesting to know whether the Minister,
could say whether the point of view that is quite often
expressed—with slight variance—by DCMS will be included
in the reports that he will bring forward to Parliament. It is
important that we should hear what is being said in the
round.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130306102000119" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0003.htm#130306102000119">That
leads me to another point, which slightly follows up on what the noble
Lord, Lord Jenkin, said. His suggestion that there should be an
identifiable post within the structure was an interesting one, which
provoked a very good debate. I was startled by discussions in
Committee, and I am still thinking about some of the issues raised. For
instance, there was a vogue a few years ago when there was a
cross-cutting issue to try to identify who would champion that activity
within each and every department in Whitehall. So there was an
architecture champion in every department, because in some senses every
department of state is involved with ensuring that the public realm is
better and more appropriately designed and built than it is. It makes
no sense to lock that away in one department. I wonder whether in
today’s debate there might not be a case for having not one
champion, but lots of champions, because this is really important
stuff. There is intellectual property in every aspect of the work that
the Government 
<?notus-xml column=1601?>do, in every sector of the economy. We should think hard about how we
can best advocate that across the whole area. Again, perhaps the
Minister might do
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130306102000120" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0003.htm#130306102000120">In
Committee we discussed the general feeling out there that somehow
copyright—the licensing and use of rights created by those with
the gifts and skills to work in the creative industries—has not
until now been given quite enough attention by Parliament. We ought to
try to reflect that in what we are doing. A lot of the angry letters I
have received reflect the fact that this is a once-in-half-a-generation
opportunity for a debate about what they do and why it is important. It
would be really nice to find a way to leave the door a little bit more
open, so that their views can be taken into account. I think that will
pay off in the long run. Everybody would welcome the chance to have
their views expressed, to hear people talking about them and to have
their views tested and put to rest in terms of the overall
debate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130306102000121" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0003.htm#130306102000121">Photographers
certainly feel left out in the cold at the moment, and I know a lot of
work is taking place on that. Again, I appeal for us to think hard. It
is not just metadata; there is a wider concern there, which comes from
photographers’ sense that their work is ephemeral and not of
value. Yet we all know that is not true. The image still speaks more
powerfully than a thousand words, as they say. Their work is
influential in so many different aspects of our commercial and cultural
life that we would be wrong to ignore what they say to us, and they are
certainly saying it. I look forward to the Minister’s
response.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130306102000122" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0003.htm#130306102000122"><B><Member ContinuationText="Viscount Younger of Leckie" PimsId="4709" UID="130306102000169" xid="2037" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-0003.htm#130306102000169">Viscount

comments that have been made by my noble friends Lord Clement-Jones,
Lord Jenkin, and Lady Buscombe, and also by the noble Lord, Lord
Howarth. I agree that it is highly desirable from the
Government’s perspective to understand and resolve issues
outside the Chamber. I very much hope that will continue; I am sure it
will. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, for the collegiate
approach that he takes to these issues. It is much appreciated on this

to focus, as other noble Lords have done, on the report—or
perhaps I should say the response to the informal consultation, a copy
of which I have here —which I have read with interest. It is
refreshing to read that views were in general very positive on having a
report. I noted that the Motion Picture Association thought that the
report should be developed in full and open dialogue with the copyright
sector. That is all in the right spirit. Certainly, the Government
believe that the proposed annual report will increase the transparency
of IPO activities and they welcome the support from the respondents.

accompany each of the regulations introducing new exceptions. While I
normally follow the noble Viscount with ease and find his presentations
pellucid, I did not find the answer to his question without ambiguity.
While I recognise that the impacts of some of the regulations may
overlap, I think that it is extremely important that, when Parliament
is considering this very important secondary legislation, we should
have in each and every case the best impact assessment that the

The language of the exceptions document before

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Energy and
Climate Change (Baroness Verma):</Member></B> My
Lords, the renewables obligation is currently the Government’s
main mechanism for supporting large-scale renewable electricity
generation in the UK. Since it was introduced in 2002, the renewables
obligation has succeeded in tripling the level of renewable
electricity, from 2.9% of total UK generation in 2002 to 9.4% in 2011.
It supports some 11.5 gigawatts of accredited capacity. As such, the
renewables obligation plays a major role in helping the UK meet its
renewables targets and carbon reduction goals.</hs_para>

obligation places an annual obligation on licensed UK electricity
suppliers to source a specified proportion of the electricity that they
provide to customers from eligible renewable sources. The scheme is
administered by Ofgem, which issues renewables obligation certificates
to electricity generators in relation to the amount of eligible
renewable electricity they can generate. Generators sell their ROCs to
suppliers who use them towards meeting their
obligation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000013" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000013">The
banding of support—allowing different technologies to receive
different levels of subsidy—was introduced to the RO in April
2009 to drive greater and more rapid deployment of renewable
electricity generation. This order will implement the
outcome of the second major four-yearly review of banded
renewables obligation subsidy levels, which took place between 2010 and
2012. The review attracted more than 4,000 consultation responses and
substantial amounts of new evidence from a wide range of stakeholders
across four separate consultation exercises, which was used to refine
our original proposals. The results are set out in the government
responses to the RO banding review, published on 25 July and 18
December last year. The order will set the support levels in England
and Wales for the next four years from 1 April 2013 until 31
March 2017 for new developments or capacity added to existing
generating stations accredited under the RO during this
period.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000014" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000014">Before
I outline the key changes being introduced by the order, it is worth
reflecting on the importance of the UK renewables electricity sector
and how the new subsidy package will help us achieve our goals. The
changes in subsidy levels in this order recognise the key role of
renewables in the UK’s future. Renewable energy generation is a
crucially important low-carbon technology with a central role to play
in helping us reach our carbon emission reduction targets. It is also
essential to our economic growth and energy security. It reduces our
reliance on imported fossil fuels, and helps keep the lights on and our
energy bills down. We have some of the best renewable energy resources
anywhere in the world, and the Government are absolutely determined
that the UK will retain its reputation as one of the best places to
invest in renewables. We have also legally committed to ensuring that
15% of our energy will come from renewable sources by
2020.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000015" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000015">The
subsidy package balances growth and affordability, providing
reassurance to investors and value for money for consumers. The subsidy
levels introduced through the order provide certainty for developers
and will ensure continuity of support as we transition towards the new
contracts for difference to be introduced as part of our electricity
market reforms. It will help unlock generation and network capital
investments worth around £20 billion to £25 billion at
today’s prices in the period 2013-17, and deliver the kind of
sustainable, long-term growth and green jobs that we need to get the
economy moving again. This represents a very significant part of the
£110 billion that we need to attract this decade to overhaul our
ageing power system.</hs_para>

Government’s policy to support renewables at any price. Our
ultimate aim is for renewables to become competitive without the need
for subsidy. The 
<?notus-xml column=266?>Government’s decisions on RO subsidy levels send a strong signal
to industry that we expect this to happen over time. To get this moving
in the right direction, we are reducing support where it can be
done, while bringing on the deployment that we need from key
technologies such as offshore wind, onshore wind and biomass, to
achieve our aims.</hs_para>

are setting the level of support for offshore wind at two renewable
obligation certificates per megawatt hour in 2014-15, reducing that to
1.9 ROCs in 2015-16 and to 1.8 ROCs 2016-17. This is consistent with
our consultation proposals and reflects our expectation that the costs
of offshore wind will fall as mass deployment takes place and industry
innovates. We are already working closely with key representatives from
industry to reduce costs. The new support levels will ensure that the
UK retains its position as the leading location in the world for
offshore wind
deployment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000019" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000019">Onshore
wind is one of the most cost-effective forms of large-scale renewable
electricity generation. The Government are committed to onshore wind as
part of a diverse energy mix. We believe it is right to continue
supporting onshore wind through the renewables obligation, but propose
to reduce support by 10% to 0.9 ROCs per megawatt hour for new
developments coming online from 1 April this year. This cut in support
is in line with evidence of falling costs. We also know that the cost
of onshore wind may fall faster than expected. To ensure that support
continues to reflect costs, we are running a call for evidence and if
we find that there is a significant change in costs, the Government
will expect to review onshore wind support rates again. Any new
arrangements arising from a potential review would not take effect
before April 2014, and financially committed projects would be
protected through grandfathering and grace
periods.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000020" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000020">We
understand that some people have concerns about the pace of wind
turbine developments in the British countryside and believe that
communities should have a greater say over, and stake in, onshore wind
developments in their area. Our planning reforms are already putting
local communities in the driving seat by giving them new powers to
write their own plans. However, because this is a priority, our call
for evidence is also looking at what should be done to improve
engagement with communities and ensure that communities that host
onshore wind receive appropriate benefits. We expect to publish in May
a final report on costs and, in the summer, a final report on community
engagement and
benefits.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000021" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000021">Around
30% of our total renewable energy in 2020 could come from biomass heat
and electricity. To ensure that we support the most cost-effective and
sustainable forms of biomass, we are creating several new support bands
for coal plant converting fully to biomass generation or increasing the
amount of biomass they co-fire. These offer the quickest and cheapest
ways to decarbonise electricity from biomass and will extend the life
of existing assets, thereby helping to maintain the security of
electricity supply.</hs_para>

dedicated biomass plant remains cautious because this technology is a
relatively costly means of decarbonisation. Support levels are set at
1.5 ROCs from 2013-14, reducing to 1.4 ROCs in 2016-17. Last
December, we announced our intention to introduce a 400 megawatt cap on
the deployment of new dedicated biomass plant. We are currently working
with industry to develop a process requiring developers to preregister
potential projects. We will bring forward legislation later this year
to introduce the registration requirements into law.</hs_para>

support innovative technologies that can play a long-term role in our
energy future, such as energy from wave and tidal stream and innovative
processes for generating electricity from waste, such as anaerobic
digestion and advanced conversion technologies. Both AD and ACTs will
continue to receive two ROCs in 2013-14 and 2014-15. Support will
reduce to 1.9 ROCs in 2015-16 and to 1.8 ROCs in 2016-17 in

will welcome the news that support for wave and tidal stream
technologies will more than double from two ROCs to five ROCs from 1
April this year. This level of support will be available for installed
capacity up to 30 megawatts at each generating station. The UK has an
unrivalled abundance of marine energy and is currently the world leader
in developing wave and tidal stream technologies. Increasing supporting

separate bands for solar PV under the RO: one band for building-mounted
solar PV and the other for ground-mounted solar PV. We want to see a
healthy solar industry that grows in a sustainable way and moves away

why the lower support levels for these new bands reflect the
substantial fall in technology costs in recent
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000026" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000026">We have
listened to industry about the need to differentiate support between
building-mounted and ground-mounted installations, and we have
introduced two bands as a result. In order to incentivise solar

projects on commercial buildings will encourage businesses to consider
solar PV as a serious option for meeting their power

makes an important contribution to our renewable energy generation.
While opportunities for further large-scale developments are limited,
we believe it is right to incentivise as much of the remaining
cost-effective hydro-electricity potential in England and Wales as we
can. For that reason, and following careful consideration of new
consultation evidence, we are proposing to set support at 0.7 ROCs
instead of the 0.5 ROCs that we proposed in consultation.</hs_para>

consumers through their energy bills. For that reason, delivering the
best possible deal for consumers has been at the heart of the RO
banding review. In considering the final shape of the banding package,
we have focused on the need to balance cost-effectiveness with the
range of objectives that the RO must deliver. This package therefore
reduces 
<?notus-xml column=268?>the lifetime subsidy cost of the renewables obligation per megawatt hour

proposals cost around £900 million less than implementing the
consultation bands while driving higher deployment. The banding
changes, therefore, will deliver more clean power at less unit cost,
representing better value for money than the current RO subsidy levels.
They will also reduce consumers’ energy bills by £6 next
year and £5 in 2014-15 compared to the current

Grantchester:</Member></B> I thank the Minister for her comprehensive
explanation of the order before the Committee. She has correctly
identified it as the main financial policy mechanism for encouraging
large-scale renewable electricity generation to put it on a sustainable
footing as part of the UK energy mix. The order updates the band
support levels, introduces new power sources and increases the
importance of certain fuels such as biomass. I certainly support the
order. A lot of what the noble Baroness has said is eminently sensible
and can agreed by noble Lords all around the Committee. It will help to
deliver the UK target of 15% from renewable generation by 2020. It will
help UK energy security by reducing reliance on imported fossil fuels.
It will assist in the conversion to cleaner generation and it will
deliver on decarbonisation targets. It will also help to secure
necessary capital and supply chain investment and, not least, it will
help to deliver good value for money for consumers.</hs_para>

Government have presided over a rather disruptive process. There have
been public disagreements between Ministers in the noble
Baroness’s department and challenges with the Treasury. These 
<?notus-xml column=269?>do not engender the certainty that is so necessary to the industry if it
is to invest with confidence. Uncertainties remain over elements of
biomass and solar generation which will be subject to further separate
consultation and orders. It is extremely damaging to the
industry’s confidence if it experiences constant downward
revisions of its support and to the targets of the renewable transport
fuel obligation as well as the carbon reduction targets. Can the
Minister confirm that the target under the renewables directive is
safe? New renewables stations will be ineligible from 1 April 2017.
This amending order increases generation per annum to 79 terawatt hours
a year by 2017, as explained in the Explanatory Memorandum. However,
the target for 2020 is 108 terawatt hours a year. By what
measures is the Minister confident that the shortfall of 29 terawatt
hours per year will be
generated<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T16:17:31"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

of the order before us is that from 2014 onwards, support for
large-scale renewable electricity will be through a new feed-in tariff
with a contract for difference scheme, as proposed under the
forthcoming Energy Bill. Does the Minister agree that there is a need
for a smooth and well managed transition from the renewables obligation
to the contracts for difference regime? If there is any delay for
whatever reason, can she confirm that the RO scheme can be extended to
give investors the certainty that projects which need longer timeframes
have the necessary clarity in terms of levels of support that are
needed for their
investment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T16:18:19"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

this order, the Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee noted that the
lives of some existing coal-fired generating plants, which had been
expected to close due to carbon emissions reduction targets, may be
extended through support to convert to cleaner biomass generation. The
committee asked for clarification on how the banded support would allow
this to happen. In its reply, the Minister’s department pointed
to Ofgem’s Electricity Capacity Assessment 2012, which
identifies a tightening of generating margins from 15% this winter to
4% in 2016. While it makes sense to utilise existing stations and
convert them, perhaps I may suggest to the Minister that not only may
this delay decarbonisation targets, it will delay the necessary urgent
investment in fit-for-purpose energy generation. Are the Government
seeking the flexibility that will allow them to rely on coal as a
back-up supply to help keep the lights on? Is that the more pressing
reason, and will it comply with the industrial emissions directive,
which replaces the large combustion plant directive with more stringent
emissions limits, that is to come into force from 1 January
2016?</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13030683000037" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000037">Having
made that point, I note that both the Committee on Climate
Change’s bioenergy review and DECC’s own energy strategy
conclude that coal firing with biomass offers a cost-effective way to
decarbonise existing coal-fired power stations. The Explanatory
Memorandum is also correct to point to energy efficiency and demand
reduction as important elements in the calculation of targets that
renewable generation needs to fill. However, I do not see any figures
in the Explanatory Memorandum to clarify that. Previously, I have asked
the noble Baroness for her assessment of the success 
<?notus-xml column=270?>of the Green Deal and other measures to reduce demand. Is she now able
to come forward and put any figures on these
measures?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000038" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000038">There
is much in this order to consider and I welcome the support increase to
five ROCs for both tidal stream and wave. That should help reduce the

final issue of importance concerns bioenergy crops. Quite rightly,
there is anxiety over land use that may be taken away from food crops,
and deforestation may also result. The use of palm oil has already been
excluded from supply chains. Could the Minister clarify that her
department’s bioenergy strategy has now taken account of the
sustainability standards recommended in the RO recognition of the
environmental assurance scheme’s requirements? To sum up, I
support the order and would be grateful if the Minister could give

again. It took me back I will not say how many years to that dreaded
moment. I passed in the end but it was quite a struggle. The formulae
in the order as I went through it got more and more complicated:
E=MC<Sup>2</Sup> was rather simple by comparison. I hope the people

my noble friend for going through the order and particularly for
highlighting something very important to the south-west and my part of
the world: the wave side. Yes, DECC and the Government have put that
back up to five ROCs but what is important about this, which my noble
friend did not mention, is that that has put it back on a par with what
they pay in Scotland. We in the south-west can now compete with our

the particularly good things about this is that we are moving into a
much more professionally and better managed transition in terms of ROC
values. I know that ROCs are about to disappear anyway but we are able
to make measured and predicted changes in the regime to keep investor
confidence, yet knowing that we will have the mechanism to, we hope,
keep these numbers within what I thought was a very good settlement in
terms of the levy control framework between DECC and the Treasury. That
was a good outcome. I hope this approach now means that we will not
have that backwards and forwards in trying to second-guess in the short
term, and that we have an environment where the investor community is
able to put its money where its mouth is—and where our mouth
is—in getting renewable capacity, and that that actually
happens.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000043" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000043">My
main question is very much the same as that of the noble Lord, Lord
Grantchester. We have a marvellous list here of all the technologies
that there are in renewables, some of them which even I forget about.
Some, like co-firing bioliquids sounds definitely like
something 
<?notus-xml column=271?>I would not want to get involved in but there are some really
interesting technologies there. A number of them are biomass-related
and I would also be interested to know where the Government have got to
in terms of these quite complicated supply-chain issues around
sustainability. It is sometimes all too easy to condemn everything and
to give excuses for things not to happen, rather than to bring them
forward. However, sustainability is important, and I am very interested
to hear my noble friend’s comments in response to my question
and to that of Lord

Duke of Montrose:</Member></B> I would like to raise a couple of small
questions. One is out of curiosity. We all understand that Scotland
administers its own renewable energy regime and the quantities of ROCs
that are administered. However, when it comes to providing the
certificates, can the Minister tell us whether this is done centrally?
Is a Scottish ROC equivalent to an English ROC, and able to be traded
across the border? When we get to this horrible question of a
referendum in Scotland and Mr Salmond asks whether the Scots want to be
devolved, will they suddenly find themselves having to set up ROC
administrations that they do not presently have? I am sure that if that
is the case, it will be one of many aspects that have not been
costed.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13030683000045" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000045">The
other point comes from what the Minister said about the extent to which
the Government expect to have a conversion of coal power stations to
biomass. If conversion does take place to the full extent that the

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord Taylor of
Holbeach):</Member></B> My Lords, these regulations are a technical
measure to implement the EU directive on electronic commerce, known as
the e-commerce directive, in respect of the new Section 59A
of the Sexual Offences Act 2003, on trafficking people for sexual
exploitation, and amended Section 4 of the Asylum and Immigration
(Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004, on trafficking people for
labour and other exploitation. These changes to trafficking offences
were made by the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012.</hs_para>

directive supports free movement in the provision of information
society services; broadly speaking, commercial activities that take
place online in Europe. It covers online activities, such as selling
goods and services, hosting a website or providing web or e-mail
access. The trafficking offences can be committed online where the
arranging or facilitating takes place over the internet. Therefore the
e-commerce directive needs to be implemented in respect of the human
trafficking offences.</hs_para>

of the history regarding the implementation of the e-commerce
directive, which was originally implemented by regulations in 2002.
Those regulations applied the directive to all offences that existed at
that time. For offences created after that date, as in this case
arising from amendments to the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012, we have
to implement the directive on a case-by-case basis.</hs_para>

some of the details of the regulations. Regulations 3 and 4 implement
the directive’s country of origin rules. These rules broadly say
that a provider of information society services must be regulated 
<?notus-xml column=274?>by the state in which the provider is established, not the state in
which the services are received. This is provided for by Regulation
3.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13030683000065" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000065">Similarly,
the country of origin principle means the UK must not restrict the
freedom of service providers established in another European Economic
Area state to provide their services in the UK unless certain
conditions apply. Such providers will generally be regulated by the
state in which they are based. We would expect EU member states, all of
which are bound by the human trafficking directive, to pursue
prosecutions under their relevant domestic trafficking
offences.</hs_para>

that proceedings may not be brought against a service provider
established in another European Economic Area state, unless specific
public interest conditions are satisfied. The key question for these
purposes will be whether a prosecution is proportionate. The CPS will
take into account all relevant factors, including, first, whether a
prosecution is to be brought under the domestic law of the state in
which the service provider is established—if such a prosecution
is to be brought, it will be difficult to show that it is proportionate
to prosecute here as well; secondly, where the evidence is located; and
thirdly, the nature of the offending that has taken place, for example,
whether the service provider part of an organised crime gang focused on
trafficking persons into the UK. Overall, the CPS will need to decide
whether the conditions are met on a case-by-case
basis.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000067" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000067">Regulations
5, 6 and 7 implement the requirements of the directive in relation to
intermediary service providers which carry out certain activities
essential for the operation of the internet: those that act as mere
conduits and those providers that cache or host information. The
directive requires us to limit the liability of such intermediary
service providers in specified circumstances. For example, a host is
not liable if it had no knowledge, when the information was provided,
that it was part of the commission of a trafficking offence. It is
important that we do not unnecessarily criminalise service providers
that will not always be aware of the use being made of their
services.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13030683000068" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000068">The
UK has always been a world leader in fighting human trafficking and has
a strong international reputation in this field. In July 2011, the UK
applied to opt in to the EU directive on human trafficking. Opting in
sends a strong message that the UK is not a soft touch on this issue
and supports the collaborative international work that is a vital
element in dealing with such complex international organised crime. The
UK already has a strong basis for such collaboration through the work
the Serious Organised Crime Agency undertakes with foreign law
enforcement agencies. In recent years, police forces have participated
in a number of joint investigation teams, in support of the
investigation and prosecution of
traffickers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000069" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000069">The
Government’s human trafficking strategy, published on 19 July
2011, identified four core themes: improving identification and
care of victims; enhancing our ability to act early before harm reaches
the UK; smarter action at the border; and more co-ordination of our law
enforcement efforts in the UK. An update on the strategy was
included in the first

its heart, human trafficking involves the movement of individuals for
the purposes of exploitation. That movement and exploitation,
particularly when it has an international dimension, can involve
extensive co-ordination in the planning, recruitment and transportation
of victims. It is likely that criminals are using new technologies, or
old technologies in more complex ways, to facilitate their
communications and avoid detection. It is not known whether the use of
new technologies has increased trafficking in persons, but it is
believed that increased use of technologies has made trafficking
activities much easier to
perform.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000071" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000071">We

you will follow all the information they contain. Therefore, the
Minister’s explanation was helpful. Although the regulations are

preparing for today’s discussion, I read some accounts of people
who had virtually been sold into slavery to provide cheap labour for
companies or often to engage in illegal activities and prostitution. It
really is horrendous. Modern technology is usually a way forward, but
it is not always a force for good. In this case, it is a force for evil
and enabling illegal activities, which is why these regulations are so
necessary. Therefore, I welcome the regulations and am pleased that
they have been brought forward today. One of the reasons why we are
pleased to see them is because the Government were rather tardy in
bringing forward the relevant measure as regards the previous EU
directive on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and
protecting its victims. In fact, they were going to opt out of those
provisions. However, I am pleased to say that the Government
subsequently changed their mind, for whatever reason, and rightly
decided to opt into that directive. These regulations extend that
commitment, and we are grateful for
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T16:43:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

press the Minister a little further on opting in and out. An issue that
has concerned me, and which the noble Lord and I have discussed across
the Floor of the House, is that the Government intend to opt out of
policing and criminal justice measures. I am worried that if they do
so, these regulations would no longer be valid because they would have
opted out of these provisions. I entirely agree with the noble Lord
about their importance and am very concerned that we may face a
situation whereby the Government decide to opt out of these provisions,
having already opted in—a bit of a hokey-cokey, really. I hope
that we stay in.</hs_para>

have specific questions in relation to these regulations and to the
other anti-trafficking orders that the Government have brought forward.
My understanding is that the Government are now consulting on and
preparing for measures to opt out of police and criminal justice. In
that case, what consideration are the Government giving to interim
measures? As the Minister and I know, those who are subject to
trafficking in this way are among the most vulnerable of humans, in the
most vulnerable position and need protection. If we are to opt out, it
is all very well looking to opt back in in six months, a year or
whenever we are given permission to do so by other member states, but
there would be an immediate problem that these regulations would not be
valid because we had opted out. I am not clear whether, in that
situation, the Government would need to revoke these regulations
individually or whether there would be a general opt-out and we would
automatically be opted out of all EU police and criminal justice
matters. I hope the Minister is able to say something about that. I
agree with him about the reasons why he has brought these regulations
forward today and about why they are so important.</hs_para>

is on the review. What will be the timescale for it? Will it coincide
with the Government’s plans to opt out of police and criminal
justice or will there be a set period? Normally such regulations say
that they will be reviewed within three or five years, but there is no
timescale in these regulations, and I wonder whether that is connected
to the Government’s intention to try to opt out of policing and
criminal justice. We support the regulations and think they are right,
which is why I am concerned about this opt-out hokey-cokey that the
Government have announced.</hs_para>

Gardiner of Kimble:</Member></B> My Lords, legal deposit is the
statutory requirement for individuals or organisations to deliver
copies of their publications to designated institutions, known as legal
deposit libraries. They are the British Library, the National Library
of Scotland, the National Library of Wales, Cambridge University
Library, the Bodleian Library, Oxford and Trinity College, Dublin. The
legal deposit regime is crucial in enabling these institutions to
preserve and maintain a comprehensive record of our published heritage
for future
generations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000083" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000083">Legal
deposit was first introduced in this country in the 17th century and
requirements changed little during the monopoly of the printed word.
However, publishing has evolved considerably over the past 20 years,
with the rapid rise of digital publishing and the phenomenon of the
internet revolutionising how information is made available. Legal
deposit arrangements now need to address the UK’s digitally
published output in order to maintain a comprehensive record and to
avoid the scenario described by deposit libraries and the wider
research community whereby such output is lost to a “digital
black
hole”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000084" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000084">The
Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003 was one of the first pieces of
legislation worldwide to regulate for the deposit of non-print
material. The regulations considered by the Committee today allow the
full framework of legal deposit envisaged by the 2003 Act to be put
into practice, and specifically for works published in a medium other
than print to be preserved on a systematic basis for the first time.
Following extensive consultation with the publishing and research
sectors, the Government are now in a position to introduce the landmark
extension of the legal deposit regime to cover non-print works. These
regulations 
<?notus-xml column=278?>will enable the full range of this nation’s published
intellectual and cultural output to be preserved and secured for
posterity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000085" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000085">The
regulations have been designed to allow a light-touch means of
archiving non-print works which balances the needs of both publishers
and deposit libraries. This has involved designing, on the one hand, a
manageable and efficient system for the deposit libraries to build a
comprehensive archive of digital content, and on the other, a clearly
governed, practical system which does not impose any disproportionate
burdens on publishers, offers potential to realise savings and protects
the commercial interests of publishers and rights
holders.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000086" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000086">The
regulations apply to both work published online, such as content from
the internet and e-books, and work published offline, such as CD-ROMs
and microfilm. The requirement for depositing offline works mirrors the
existing requirements for printed works, namely that publishers must
deliver a copy to the British Library within one month of publication
and that the other deposit libraries can also request a copy of any
offline
work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000087" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000087">Generally,
works from the internet will be collected by a process of web
harvesting. Web harvesting uses computer software to search the
internet automatically and copy content from targeted websites.
Importantly, this process imposes no burden on publishers. In addition,
where a book, for example, is published as an e-book and a print
edition, the regulations allow the publisher to do away with depositing
the print edition, with obvious cost savings to both the publisher and
deposit library. Although the collection of work from the internet will
generally be cost-free for publishers, the delivery of offline material
such as CD-ROMs will have a small
cost.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000175" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000175">In line
with government policy to avoid any disproportionate burden on the
smallest businesses, new businesses and micro-businesses in the
publishing sector will be exempt until April 2014 from the parts of the
regulations that have the potential to impose a cost burden. This
phased implementation is important as over 80% of publishers are
micro-businesses, and their inclusion within scope is therefore
essential to meet the objectives of the regulations in

will cost the deposit libraries money, but they will have the benefit
of a shared archive and potential savings from no longer needing to
archive a proportion of printed works. Reader access to non-print works
will be limited to computer terminals on premises controlled by the
deposit libraries. In order to mirror the level of access to printed
publications, at each deposit library only one terminal will show the
same material at any one time. Where it is reasonable, in the
commercial interests of publishers, to prevent reader access to

some specific questions with regard to audio-visual works. First, as
the Minister will know, the British Film Institute already has a

preserving “incidental” audio-visual works. Does the
Minister agree that the logical recipient of such works should be the
BFI National Archive and, as such, the regulations could be extended to
list it as a beneficiary? Secondly, does the Minister accept that the
preservation of web pages that include audio-visual works is outside
the current specialisms of the six legal deposit libraries, and that
therefore the BFI should have a more clearly defined preservation role
in the regulations? Thirdly, now that we have a detailed plan for all
other non-print works, does the Minister agree that there should be an
urgent plan to extend the scope of the regulations to include
audio-visual works which are, after all, a

continue to be so? I look forward to the Minister’s

copyright restrictions, the Government recognise that the scenario of
restrictions on access to content following the expiry of copyright is
a concern for the research community. This is an important issue, but
will arise only once the copyright term of 70 years has ceased, so in
practice the issue will not affect legal deposit for many years to

raised embargoes. The regulations specify that an embargo may be
imposed for a specified period of up to three years if a rights owner
demonstrates that a reader viewing the publication within that period
would unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the person
making the request. Requests for further embargoes may be made for the
same publication provided that, as before, the case for an embargo can
be demonstrated at the same time. I reassure the noble Baroness that
the operation of the embargo arrangements will be scrutinised as part
of the post-implementation review of the regulations to ensure that
they are working as intended and that embargoes, where imposed, are

justified.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000098" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000098">Audio-visual
works are undoubtedly an important aspect of our cultural heritage. The
noble Baroness, Lady Jones, asked whether the BFI National Archive is a
logical recipient of audio-visual works and, as such, whether the BFI
should be a beneficiary under the regulations. The BFI would not be
able to receive such works as it is not possible to extend the
institutions entitled to receive works under legal deposit arrangements
without changing the primary legislation. Furthermore, non-print works
consisting solely or predominately of film or recorded sound, or both,
are excluded from legal deposit arrangements under the primary
legislation. Audio-visual content within non-print works will be
collected only if the accompanying text is more than merely incidental
to the audio-visual element. The definition of
“incidental” in this case refers to audio-visual material
being a feature of the main body of work rather than its main
purpose.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13030683000099" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000099">The
noble Baroness asked if the preservation of web pages is outside the
current specialisms of the deposit libraries. I can reassure her that
the British Library’s UK Web Archive project, which has been
operational since 2005, has allowed for the successful selective
archiving of approximately 6,000 UK websites. This initiative, in
collaboration with the national libraries of Scotland and Wales, the
National Archives and others has allowed the British Library to make
inroads into web archiving and to develop the infrastructure 
<?notus-xml column=281?>required to preserve efficiently and securely web pages in anticipation
of the regulations that we are debating

noble Baroness also asked if legal deposit arrangements should be
extended to all audio-visual works. Any extension to the types of work
covered under legal deposit arrangements would involve changes to
primary legislation. In relation to film, the Government’s view
is that a statutory scheme may not be appropriate at this stage but
they are exploring with the British Film Institute other ways to secure
more films. One option may be for the BFI to work with public funders
of UK film to make supply to the BFI archive a condition of grants. In
relation to recorded sound, the British Library’s Sound Archive
has built up an impressive archive through existing voluntary
arrangements. While future arrangements for the legal deposit of
audio-visual works are not to be ruled out, the Government would need
to look carefully at the need for further statutory intervention. It is
a question of finding the most appropriate means of securing the
preservation of all these different types of media, important though
they undoubtedly are. I reiterate that these regulations will ensure
that the nation’s intellectual record and published heritage is
preserved and maintained for future
generations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000101" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000101">The

Turnberg:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful for the opportunity to
open this debate, even though I suspect that many noble Lords might
share a faint sense of déjà vu about this topic. However,
the fact that care in the community keeps reappearing on our agenda
suggests that, despite numerous impressive reports and repeated debates
in this House, we are not yet anywhere near solving the
problems.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000103" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000103">I
suspect that few here will admit to any ignorance of the facts, so I
hope noble Lords will forgive me if I start by reiterating the nature
of the difficulties we face. It may save others having to repeat them.
First, the country has entered a prolonged period of severe economic
constraint, so there is little new money 
<?notus-xml column=282?>available centrally. Secondly, we have no control over the demand for
social care that is growing at a remarkable
rate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000104" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000104">The
population is ageing as life expectancy goes up in an inexorable
straight line. The current 3 million people over the age of 65 will
rise to almost 5 million in the next 20 years, while the number of over
85 year- olds will double from 1.3 million to 2.6 million. We would
celebrate this extension of life were it not for the fact that the
number with multiple chronic diseases will also increase by about a
third, while the number of those with dementia is set to double from
the current estimate of 800,000. If that is not enough to frighten you,
there is the statistic that one in three people over the age of
85 will develop dementia. That is what I am told. Many of these people
end up in an acute hospital, the place least suited to their needs,
and the number lingering there unnecessarily is huge. Of the
over 85 year-olds admitted, some 140,000 stay for more than 30 days,
and the numbers are rising. A diagnosis of dementia is the primary
reason for admission in some 55,000 patients a year, in the majority of
whom the diagnosis had not been made before admission. Where, I wonder,
were the
GPs?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000105" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000105">These
patients are admitted, but too often there is nowhere else for them to
go. Social services departments are sorely underfunded and about
four-fifths of local authorities are now said to be restricting social
care to those with needs graded as substantial or critical. There is a
black hole of some £16.5 billion looming in social care funding
over the next few years. The gap between the money needed to meet
demands and that available is growing year by year. Here we have the
nub of the problem—increasing demand from an ageing population
acquiring multiple long-term illnesses and a veritable epidemic of
dementia, together with social services departments stretched way
beyond their capacity now and with a future in which they will be
unable to deliver even the basics of care, and all against a background
of severe constraints on the money available from
government.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000106" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000106">We
cannot simply go on as we are and try to patch up the current system of
an NHS designed for acute hospital care, essential though that may be,
while the desperate need is for prevention and the long-term care of
the elderly. We must start now to develop a long-term plan to meet
these problems. My first question to the noble Earl is: is there any
sign that the Government are thinking along the lines of long-term
future
planning?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000107" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000107">At
the end of the day, we must ask ourselves where the money is to come
from. Of course, some measures could be taken that would help a little.
The poor co-ordination between care workers in hospital and in the
community has been resolved in a number of well recognised places
around the country and more should be done to spread that good
practice. Of course, there may be efficiency gains to be made somewhere
in the system. Then there is the recent government initiative in the
wake of the Dilnot report to help the elderly pay for their care. Will
that ease the financial burden on local authorities? I fear not,
because although it offers some help to the elderly themselves, it
seems more likely to add to the problems of local authorities than to
help them.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=283?><hs_para UID="13030683000108" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000108">Then there are the usual
calls for funds to be transferred from the supposedly cash-rich NHS to
social services. I am very supportive of proposals that NHS and social
service budgets should be pooled to fund care for the elderly. That
makes a lot of sense and I was happy to see something along those lines
in Andy Burnham’s recent speech about a future Labour health
policy. We need to think, too, not only about merging budgets but also
medical and nursing staff so that they can work across the boundaries
between hospital and community. We also need to look critically at how
we can incentivise and support GPs who are really the key players in
the community. It is far from clear whether they are prepared in the
CCGs for commissioning long-term care. Will the noble Earl tell us
whether any attention is being focused on the role of GPs
there?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000109" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000109">What
about closing hospitals or beds and transferring the savings? Data
showing that up to a third of acute hospital beds are occupied by
patients who should not be in hospital at all provide ammunition for
those who see considerable savings from cutting bed numbers. That is
not easy. If we try to go along that route, we have to look at where
the costs of acute hospitals really lie. They lie largely in the staff
and relatively less in the number of beds. The workload for the medical
and nursing staff of acute hospitals is not determined by the number of
beds, or even by the number of long-stay patients, but by the rising
tide of acute emergency admissions. It is hard to escape the conclusion
that we are not well off in NHS hospital services. Hardly a day goes by
when we do not hear of failings in the care of the acutely
ill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000110" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000110">If wards
or even whole hospitals were to close, that acute workload would not
diminish. Indeed, the more rapid throughput of patients through a
smaller number of hospital beds would increase the intensity of the
work. I am not saying that there would not be any savings made on, for
example, heating and lighting bills and perhaps on administration, but
the savings to be made, especially on doctors and nurses, would be
rather less than one might hope. That may account for the intriguing
piece of research evidence from Julien Forder, who published a paper in
the <I>Journal of</I> <I>Health Economics</I> in 2009 in which he
showed that for every pound spent on community services it was possible
to save only a third of a pound on hospital services. Caring for
someone in the community is not a cheap
option.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000111" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000111">Meanwhile
the NHS itself is under remarkable cost-saving pressures as it seeks to
answer the Nicholson challenge. Hospitals are barely coping in many
instances, and the prospect of diverting even more funds is likely to
be impossible to bear. I am not suggesting that rationalisation of
services into a smaller number of specialised centres is not a good
thing—it clearly is—but closing acute hospitals to save
money simply to transfer it into the community does not bear too close
examination. In any case, there are the calculations suggesting that
there will be a shortfall in NHS funding of some £30 billion per
annum by 2020 on current trends, so the question remains: where will
the funds for social services come from? It is difficult to see much
coming from simply integrating NHS and social service budgets,
desirable though that may be. Simply 
<?notus-xml column=284?>pooling two inadequate sources of money does not sound like an answer to
me. We have to face the idea that the Government of the day, whoever
they are, will have to give a higher priority to care in the community
than they have currently been able to do. It is a political decision,
and we must think more broadly than simply within the box of the
Department of
Health.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000112" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000112">Are
there are any discussions going on between government
departments— housing, transport and so on—on plans for
future care in the community? How much priority are Governments as a
whole willing to give to this compared, for example, with a high-speed
train or nuclear submarine, desirable though some may think they are?
Do they have a higher priority? These are decisions that only a
Government have to face. I do not envy them for that, but in a
democracy such as ours I do not believe it is entirely wishful thinking
to feel that a clear majority of the population would strongly favour a
diversion of resources to areas that they think are of high priority,
and I can think of few higher priorities than the way we care for our
elderly.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-06?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_06_PT_1/17CCE1D3A94E7E6E9694BF314CF57BF8AC65EFD8" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 6 March 2013">Wednesday,

Jolly:</Member></B> My Lords, I start by thanking the noble Lord, Lord
Turnberg, for bringing this important issue to the attention of this
Committee. He has adequately covered areas of the economy, so I shall
leave that. Care in the community is a critical component of our
current health system and an even more critical component of our future
health system, and we must ensure continued support for those who
require and provide this vital
service.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000114" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000114">Today
I wish to touch on a few distinct aspects of this issue. First, I want
to highlight the growing demand for care in the community for the
elderly population. As we are all certainly aware, the elderly
population are particularly vulnerable to conditions that require
long-term care which, if left untreated, can lead to a revolving door
of hospital care for the elderly, which is both unhealthy and costly.
Building on this, I want to draw attention to the ways in which the
newly established clinical commissioning groups can work to improve the
quality of care in the community as well as to encourage the use of
this type of care. Finally, I will pose three questions to the Minister
that reflect my concerns and hopes for the future of care in the
community for elderly
individuals.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000115" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000115">Older
people already represent the largest cohort of patients in the NHS,
accounting for 60% of hospital admissions. Hospital days are dangerous
for elderly people and expensive. Patients are susceptible to
infections in the ward and often fail to eat properly while staying in
the hospital. Moreover, these stays can encourage a loss of
independence, which leads to added problems on discharge. Home
healthcare is proven to deliver better outcomes for patients. There is
evidence that it can lead to lower costs and reduce admissions to
hospital. Home-based models of care have proven to be effective for
patients with multiple diagnoses and comorbidities with a high risk of
hospitalisation. According to Department of Health statistics, during
September and October 2011 some 128,517 hospital 
<?notus-xml column=285?>bed days were lost as the result of the delayed
discharge of people who could have been cared for in the community had
the right support had been
available.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000116" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000116">In
order to provide care in the community that is of the same quality as a
hospital environment, CCGs must ensure collaboration between acute
care, community care and social care. This was clearly called for in
the Health and Social Care Act 2012, and we expect CCGs and local
authorities to be actively pursuing this practice. It is particularly
important for elderly patients as long-term conditions associated with
old age are particularly complex to treat and often involve several
different types of health and social care intervention. These services
are provided over months and years by a range of organisations in the
public, private and voluntary sectors, and it is hard to split them
into single episodes. Pathway design is a critical and urgent task for
CCGs to engage in.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13030683000117" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000117">In order to delay acute
care for our elderly citizens, we must also refocus our energy on
prevention. Joint strategic needs assessments must emphasise the value
of preventive care for the elderly, including simple things: measures
to decrease falls, improve nutrition to prevent diabetes and encourage
community-based programmes such as Dementia Friends. Here the
involvement of the voluntary sector can often be
critical.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000118" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000118">Part
of the prevention agenda is about combating loneliness. Isolation is
associated with poor physical and mental health in older people, both
conditions that undermine the health we seek to provide our citizens.
Local providers work together to address this issue and must not fall
short in this critical area of care, because it is care. Social
isolation affects about 1 million older people and has a severe
impact on people’s quality of life in old age. Mentoring
projects, befriending schemes and computer classes form part of a
solution built to engage an elderly population in their
community.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000119" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000119">The
patient must be at the centre of every health and care system we
create. The location and community in which we choose to spend our
later years deeply affects our quality of life. By supporting people to
remain in their homes for as long as they wish, we provide an
invaluable service to those patients we serve. In light of these
remarks, I ask the Minister to confirm the following three expectations
that relate to CCGs. CCGs will be expected to work alongside local
authorities on integrated care pathways for the older population in the
community, which might or might not involve shared budgets. CCGs will
be expected to enhance preventive services in the community to reduce
unnecessary hospitalisations. They will also be expected to embrace a
campaign against isolation in the community, working with local
authorities, especially among the elderly who wish to stay in their
homes.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13030683000198" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000198">5.31

Care Act will be enacted in one month. There is a mandate from the
Secretary of State to the Commissioning Board and guidance from the
Commissioning Board to the CCGs. We have the theory and we must now
enter the practice. The demand now and in the future, as has already
been mentioned, will increase among the growing number of the elderly
in the population, and we need to ensure that their health is
maintained, disease prevention addressed and high-quality, safe,
acceptable care given when required, with the emphasis on independent
living in the community and, where necessary, adequate support given to
allow this to happen. For example, prevention of admission to hospital
teams can supply the necessary support to the elderly living alone to
remain in their home surroundings, where they will benefit more than
they would from an admission to hospital that would be more costly and
open to possible cross-infection, leading to a longer recovery period.
This is a cost-effective and care-effective way
forward.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000122" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000122">My
first question to the Minister regards integration of organisational
services and professional boundaries. What steps are the Government
taking to ensure that the theory of the Act, mandate and guidance is
being followed, with required training for all concerned? The reason
for this question is that currently in many places there is a chaotic
situation where, through the lack of training and understanding, care
pathways are disrupted and there is evidence that services are not
running smoothly and the safety of the patients is in
question.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13030683000123" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000123">Currently the ambulance
services are on red alert due to winter pressures and there are reports
of ambulances that are unable to unload patients causing a backlog,
with patients being cared for either in the ambulance or in a cold,
draughty corridor for long periods before A&amp;E takes over because of
the four-hour wait deadline. Those ambulances therefore are not free to
take any calls or discharges home. About 10 days ago at 10 pm, there
were eight ambulances stuck for over an hour at our local hospital.
Last night at 9.30 pm, I checked the local situation. There
were four ambulances outside the hospital. One had been waiting for one
hour and 15 minutes, one for 36 minutes, one for 20 minutes and the
other for 10 minutes, with the crew looking after the patients. It
appears that sometimes, to alleviate the logjam, one crew will care for
two patients—two ambulance loads—in order to free up an
ambulance. It would seem that there are insufficient staff to relieve
the ambulance crews and, if they do, it starts the four-hour waiting
time clock. The circumstances that I mention involved a majority of
elderly patients. Can the Minister assure noble Lords that the
Government will take steps to ensure that every opportunity is taken to
improve the integration of services in health and social
care?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000124" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000124">Innovation
and research is my next area of concern. The care of the elderly has
lacked funding for research into physical and mental conditions, and
this situation needs to be rectified as a priority. However, there have
been examples of excellent innovations being developed through specific
studies undertaken by healthcare professionals as part of scholarships
or fellowships. Two come to mind; one involved a nursing scholar who,
on an international study, was able to learn 
<?notus-xml column=287?>about the early detection and diagnosis of melanomas and, on return to
this country, has followed this up with a training programme for GPs.
The second example was someone who, on her return from the USA, aimed
to reduce the mortality rates by introducing specific care bundles.
Medical and nursing staff became engaged on her return, with excellent
results and, in many places, there is a marked reduction in mortality
rates as a result. Can the Minister assure us that there will be an
equitable amount of funding for multiprofessional research and
innovation specially allocated to physical and mental health, including
social care for the
elderly?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000125" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000125">No
Act, mandate or guidance will be effective unless there is
inspirational leadership. In my experience, such leadership is not
learnt by attending a course for senior managers; it has to be bespoke
and fitted to the person’s potential and ability to set the
values necessary for high-quality, safe and cost-effective delivery of
care. I am president of the Florence Nightingale Foundation and we are
able to fund 19 leadership scholars each year. They go through a
bespoke leadership programme, funded mostly by the Burdett Trust for
Nursing, as well as by contributions from other smaller charities. This
has resulted in scholars being promoted and successfully leading
services. I ask the Minister if this matter could be explored further
with the NHS Leadership Academy and Health Education England to examine
bespoke approaches to specific services, especially, and as a priority,

Warner:</Member></B> My Lords we are all grateful to my noble friend
for securing this debate and for his usual masterly introduction and
analysis. Whatever our views on the right size for the total health and
social care budget, it will always have a cash limit and, in the long
period of fiscal austerity we face, that limit will be very
constrained. That makes it imperative that we get our expenditure
priorities right, especially in relation to the NHS. Our failure to do
this is damaging care of the elderly at a time when we are all living
longer and, on present demographic evidence, will continue to do so.
The number of over 85s will double to 3 million by 2030, with
increasing numbers suffering from dementia, as my noble friend has
mentioned.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13030683000127" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000127">I
will confine myself to three strategic points. First, we may be living
longer but we are not living healthier lives when compared with many
other affluent countries. We are 12th out of 19 such countries,
according to a recent study by the Institute for Heath Metrics and
Evaluation in Seattle. We can expect in this country 68.6 years of
healthy life from birth before disease and disability take their toll.
This compares with 70.9 years for Spain, which is top of the
pops. Better healthcare is unlikely to change our position much, but a
higher priority for expenditure on public health and prevention
services is more likely to do
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000128" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000128">Secondly,
the balance of what we spend on the NHS and social care is
fundamentally wrong for our demographic and disease profile. Under
successive Governments we have overfavoured the NHS and have neglected
adult social care. There is, however, an opportunity to change this
with the proposed Care 
<?notus-xml column=288?>and Support Bill, now undergoing pre-legislative scrutiny. Here I
declare my interest as a member of the Joint Select Committee that will
report shortly. That Bill has received a wide measure of support,
publicly and politically, especially for its provision for an
overarching principle of securing well-being for the recipients of care
and support
services.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000129" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000129">We
will no doubt debate the committee’s findings another day. All I
want to do here is register the widespread concern that exists that the
Bill’s reforms, including the Dilnot changes, will not be
adequately funded because of the existing shortfall in funding that has
developed over the years. I do not blame this Government particularly
for that. In my view, that shortfall now stands at about 10% of the
adult social care annual budget, or approaching £1.5 billion,
and I suggest it is growing despite the Government’s partial
efforts to close the gap. We must not pass a reforming Bill without
appropriate funding to implement those much needed
changes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000130" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000130">Thirdly,
and finally, we need to re-engineer and rebalance our healthcare
services and associated expenditure away from our preoccupation as a
country with 24/7 services delivered through acute hospitals to more
community-based services integrated with social care. Here I may
diverge a little from the approach of my noble friend. The core
business of the NHS is care with an acute treatment adjunct, not the
other way round as it has been for 60 years. We cannot carry on with
this pretence that it is in the best interests of patients to have so
many clinically and financially unstable and unsustainable district
general hospitals claiming to provide a wide range of 24/7 acute
services. Do not believe me: listen to what specialist clinicians are
saying, particularly the current president of the Academy of Medical
Royal Colleges. Sir Terence Stephenson said last
July:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13030683000180" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000180">“I
don’t think it is possible in quite a small country ... to have
200 to 300 24/7 acute centres offering every single discipline …
we need to move to a smaller number of bigger centres giving treatment
that’s either hi-tech, risky and
rare”.</hs_quote><hs_para UID="13030683000131" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000131">I
do not have time to develop this theme today but will return to it in
one of our NHS debates next week. Suffice it to say that we need to
start educating the public on the need, in their interests, to
consolidate these acute services on fewer hospital sites and to create
a 10-year development programme and funding for integrated 24/7
community-based services embracing primary community health
services—including mental health services—and adult
social care. I recognise that none of this will be easy for elected
politicians but this direction of travel is inevitable if we are truly
interested in preserving our NHS and meeting the needs of our growing
elderly population in a sustainable way. I hope the Minister will feel
able to reflect seriously on this kind of reorientation as the
Department of Health prepares for the next public expenditure
review.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13030683000200" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000200">5.42

Roberts of Llandudno:</Member></B> My Lords, I also appreciate the
opportunity to take part in this debate. Other noble Lords have much
more expertise than I have, but I put my finger very gently into the
water because this is something I experience. I am a Methodist minister
and all my life I have been involved in the care of older 
<?notus-xml column=289?>people. I look now in my daily newspaper at the births, marriages and
deaths, and whereas some years ago the majority of people died in their
60s and 70s, now we have them at 80, 90 or touching 100. This has
changed the whole atmosphere and situation that we need to come to
terms with.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000133" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000133">In
rural areas particularly these needs are very acute. A village
community will support a person in that village. That person will feel
part of that community. Some have lived there all their lives. They
know the village and the people around them. Then suddenly everything
has changed. I can think of a mixture of places where there were once
shops. One village at the end of the war had 29 shops but has no shops
now. If you do not have a car, you cannot get away to get your
shopping. You cannot get to the post office now, but in any case the
way pensions are paid has changed. The bakery has gone. We used to
enjoy the bakery and friends of mine ran it. We had five chapels in the
area and now four of them have closed and the village church is
struggling. The choirs and bands that we used to have belong to
yesterday. I did not think that I would ever support the case for
keeping pubs open—Methodist ministers do not do that
usually—but every week 16 pubs close. They, like the chapel or
the church, were a vital part of the community where people could meet,
but that is no longer the case. The doctor’s twice-weekly
surgery is no more. Two banks used to come on a Friday morning. The
banks do not come any more. In many cases, the small neighbouring
hospital is already closed and in other places there is great anxiety
because the hospital is under threat of closure. In Wales health is
devolved, and I wonder whether we could not somehow relocate some of
the specialist services that do not need as big a back-up as others,
such as rheumatology or dialysis, so that those services would be the
core that would justify the existence of that hospital which could then
be involved in wider care in that community. I know the arguments for
big hospitals. They are great arguments, but families have to
travel.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000134" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000134">In
rural areas, bus services have been decimated. Your friends are elderly
and cannot travel very far. We have these problems. In North Wales, we
have problems with hospital closures. I ask that people think about
whether we can do something in order to have beds available near the
community from which that person comes. My mother-in-law kept the local
bus service going. She lived in a village four miles from where I live.
I used to offer her a lift home when she was 88. She would say,
“I’m not having a lift with you. I’m the only
passenger on the bus, so I’ve got to keep going on it”,
but when she went, the service went as
well.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000135" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000135">Every
part of the community is weakened by the change in lifestyle and so on,
especially for older people. There must be intervention to improve the
quality of life, the well-being, of the individual. The person needs to
feel safe and comfortable in his or her local village. When you
retire—I have experienced this, as have some other noble Lords
in the Committee—what information do you get? You get
information about pensions, but do you get an information pack about
the services available in the local community and about how you will
get help if you are in urgent need? 
<?notus-xml column=290?>Some of our organisations do this, but those who retire should be given
not only financial information but community information about bus
services and so on, if there are any, and volunteer organisations. I
must not overstep the mark here all the time, but the best thing we
have in Wales and the rest of the UK is the free bus service for
elderly people. It has kept routes going. We have services that we must
support, but there are ways, not always financial, in which we can help
our older
people.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-06?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_06_PT_1/F302CD260AEDB18A99B47393BA244713DD21BE0D" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 6 March 2013">Wednesday,

Greengross:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord
Turnberg, for so vividly portraying the crisis that is preventing us
celebrating, as we should be able to do, the aging of our
population. We can all expect to live to a great age. The noble
Lord, Lord Roberts, has described very movingly that life is
not always so good. Certainly it is not so good with the number of
people who need appropriate care. We have an opportunity to get
things right now, and we must
do.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000137" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000137">I was the
lead commissioner for the EHRC inquiry into the needs for care and
support of people living in their own homes. We found that half the
people in this country were satisfied, but that means a huge number
were not getting an adequate service, most of them elderly women. We
are just about to celebrate International Women’s Day. It is
appalling that they are not getting the sort of care and support that
they need. We should be able to do something about their isolation,
loneliness and the bad situation that they face, particularly with the
impending—if it is not already with us—crisis of
dementia.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000138" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000138">As
chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Dementia, I am aware of
this issue every day as this group has the highest attendance of MPs
and Peers of any all-party group. People are recognising that this is a
huge issue and we have to get it right. I would like us to look at how
we can prevent things going as wrong as they have done up to now and
get this right, with the help of the draft Care and Support Bill that
will come to us shortly. We need to look more broadly at alternative
ways of meeting the needs of a huge number of people in our population.
I hope that the Government will do
this<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T17:50:07"></hs_TimeCode>. One way of
meeting these needs is to look at the Scandinavian model of hospital
hotels, which brings in another sector to help provide appropriate
care. This happens almost automatically in Scandinavia. I hope that the
Minister will agree to look further at that model. I have a
group studying ways of implementing
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T17:50:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000139" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000139">We
must also prevent people going into unsuitable hospital care, as the
noble Baroness, Lady Jolly, clearly pointed out. We should not do
anything to stop people with acute needs going into acute hospitals but
it would be far better to transform some of them into local hospitals
which deal more effectively with people suffering from one form or
another of dementia and other chronic conditions. No MP would ever
agree to a hospital closure but they might agree to the
transformation of a hospital into one more suited to meet the needs of
many patients today. Those patients are badly cared for in hospitals
that are unsuited to 
<?notus-xml column=291?>their needs. It is also very unsuitable for patients with other
conditions to be on the same ward as patients suffering from some form
of dementia, which is usually the case. The latter ought to be able to
stay in the community, but to make this work we need more collaborative
working and integration between health and social care. The draft Care
and Support Bill will facilitate this to some extent but other measures
are also
necessary<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T17:54:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000140" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000140">We
have to hope that local authorities will use the flexibility they
have—they do have some—to allocate their money in a
different way. However, health, social care and housing need to be
integrated under the law, where possible, to enable more co-operation
to take place. One way of doing this is to provide more preventive
care. Local authorities must realise that they can save the NHS a lot
of money if they keep people who have multiple needs, but not acute
ones, out of acute hospitals. There has to be co-operation in this
regard and local authorities must use any flexibility they have. There
is not enough money but there is some money which they could use in
this respect. Integration is terribly
important<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T17:53:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000141" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000141">Another
important aspect of the draft Bill is that for the first time
self-funders will be included as users of services. A fact that is not
publicised is that very often when those self-funders have to go into a
care home they pay over the odds. The local authority has negotiated a
very low rate per patient but the self-funders are charged more than
their care costs. We may approve of that “Peter and Paul”
situation but it is not publicised and we should not have that sort of
secret “tax” in this country. That has to be looked at by
the Government who should make clear what is and is not appropriate as
regards cross-subsidies. I hope that the Minister will look at
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-06T17:54:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000142" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000142">In
summary, will the Minister look at the savings that can be made to
acute NHS budgets through the provision of adequate care? Will he also

will he look at

Lord Turnberg. When I knew I was going to be able to speak in this

the politician, ‘community care’ is a useful piece of
rhetoric; to the sociologist, it is a stick to beat institutional care
with; to the civil servant, it is a cheap alternative to institutional
care which can be passed to the local authority for action—or
inaction; to the visionary, it is a dream of a new society in which
people really do care; to social services departments, it is a
nightmare of heightened public expectation and inadequate resources to
meet them. We are only just beginning to find out what it means to the

1972?”.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13030683000144" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000144">What
has changed hugely, as many noble Lords have reminded us, is the
numbers. There are many more people now in need of community care, but
we 
<?notus-xml column=292?>can agree that the key thing needed for the care of the so-called rising
tide is a sufficient supply of good quality community care focused on
the needs of the user and their carers. I hope the Minister will agree
that this is the most urgent problem facing our society today. It is
bigger than education, defence or, above all, the acute sector of the
NHS, although sometimes one feels like a traitor for saying
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000145" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000145">The
Francis report on Mid Staffs may be a very worthy document, but I
submit that it has done us no favours by focusing our attention on the
care of elderly people in hospital. Just sort it out, goes the view:
appoint a hospital supremo and all will be well. As we all know, that
is nonsense. Hospital care provides a tiny proportion of the need, and
the real problem so far as older people are concerned is that far too
many of them languish in hugely expensive hospital beds, as we have
heard, simply because not enough care in the community is available. As
one of the witnesses to the Joint Committee on which several of our
colleagues have been serving said, community care is always the poor
sister of the NHS. The social care system is in crisis, as we have
heard, and we shall never solve it, perhaps, unless we learn to
rebalance spending and attention between NHS care and social
care.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13030683000146" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000146">Social
care is very good value if we do it right. Am I hopeful? Do I
still feel as depressed as I did when I read that quote from Kathleen
Jones? I think some progress has been made. The Government have made a
step—perhaps a small one—towards accepting the proposals
of the Dilnot commission. The Care and Support Bill will come to us
during the course of this year, we hope, which gives not only new
rights for users and carers but new responsibilities to local
authorities to give information, advice and advocacy when assessments
are being done. The committee called more than 60 witnesses, and every
one of them raised the issue of resources.</hs_para>

community care, we always hear that we cannot afford it, but as Andrew
Dilnot has powerfully said, it is not a question of cannot afford it
but of will not afford it. The noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, has given us
some ideas about how we could find the money, and I remind the
Committee, as I have done before, that when we accepted the proposals
of the Beveridge committee, we were absolutely skint as a nation. We
were in the middle of the Second World War and had no money and no
prospect of getting any, but we still accepted that visionary report. I
maintain that we can do it again. I also maintain that getting care in
the community right could be a vote winner because it is no longer
about poor services for poor people. It touches everybody. I am sure
that everybody in this Room has experienced trying to find community
care for themselves or their relatives—or they will within the
course of the next year or so. I believe it is something that affects
everyone, and therefore it is a very attractive idea for political
parties to embrace as we approach a general election. I am sure many of
us will be looking at what is said in manifestos about that.</hs_para>

residential care—helps to prevent people going into hospital and
to centre care on preserving the best quality of life. Our future

debate on the detail is for another time, but I was particularly struck
by the contributions from housing associations and voluntary sector
providers stressing the importance of sharpening up the interface in
the Bill between primary care, general practice, social care and
housing. There are clearly pockets of excellent practice of NHS, local
authority and voluntary sector co-operation and integrated working in
the provision of specialist housing and housing support, for example,
housing associations providing personal support in sheltered housing,
thereby avoiding the need for residential care. I hope that the
committee’s recommendations will help to take this agenda
forward in an urgent and coherent way and that the Bill generally will
provide the framework for enabling many issues that noble Lords have
highlighted which would genuinely facilitate the delivery of more
effective community and primary care.</hs_para>

frustratingly short debate that it is impossible to cover much at all,
but it has provided us with the opportunity to focus on the need for a
longer-term strategy on primary and community care. Noble Lords are, as
usual, to be congratulated on providing a thorough debate and including
the “big picture” issues of Dilnot implementation, future
social care funding and the current crisis resulting from huge cuts in
local authority budgets that make meeting existing and future demands
impossible. We are, of course, also in the midst of the soul-searching
and determination to do things better that come in the aftermath of the
Francis report on the situation where frail, vulnerable older people
received the worse care possible, as was referred to by my noble friend
Lady Pitkeathley. I echo her concern that while the serious issues of
failure of hospital care raised by Francis need to be addressed, we do
not want the NHS to turn its full focus on to NHS hospital care and
turn away from the need for primary care to step up to the plate if
there is to be a dramatic shift to care in the community.</hs_para>

important to acknowledge the emphasis that Francis places on the
importance of primary care and GPs. He points to the vital continuing
relationship that GPs have with patients and the need for GPs to
undertake a monitoring role on behalf of patients who receive acute
hospital and other specialist services. As he puts it:</hs_para>

is one of the key questions for today’s debate. Are the
Government confident that CCGs can meet the challenges of providing
primary and community care? How is their focus to be shifted from
hospitals to supporting community care? I look forward to the

Lords.</hs_parafo> <hs_para UID="13030683000156" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000156">On
commissioning, I am getting to be a bit of a broken record on
highlighting the need for effective commissioning of the community
services that mainly benefit older people, such as chiropody, falls
prevention, continence care and audiology. These are vital services
that help to maintain well-being and independence, both in the
community and in residential care. Yet, as Age UK has repeatedly
pointed out, they are currently significantly undercommissioned and
there are huge problems and variations in standards and availability of
services.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13030683000157" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000157">I
suspect that my recent experience locally when I took my disabled
partner for his chiropody appointment and learned that Virgin Care
would be taking over the previously supplied NHS services and would be
dealing with problems only, not routine care such as clipping toenails,
is rapidly becoming standard practice. The Department of
Health’s guidance underlines the 
<?notus-xml column=295?>importance of foot care and the difference it makes to the lives of
older people leading to reduced pain, increased mobility and a reduced
risk of falls. Continence care support is also vital. If you talk to
carers, it is such a major issue and can often tip them over the edge
so that they stop caring. Of course there is also the impact it has on
the person who is cared for. What action are the Government taking to
ensure effective commissioning of chiropody, continence care and other
key services such as audiology? Will GP commissioning seek to increase
the number of district nurses who are under enormous pressure at the
moment but who are so vital to community care support for people with
long-term health conditions? Will it be able to reverse the current
alarming decline in the number of specialist nurses, such as diabetic
and epilepsy nurses, who play such a vital role in helping patients
self-manage their condition in the
home?</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-06?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_06_PT_1/831D5534B9E33FA06A2D172C1B2892799AACDC53" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 6 March 2013">Wednesday,

from listening to care users, their carers and voluntary organisations
how care and support needs to change, and how the system has yet to
adapt properly to meet the new demands and expectations of modern
Britain. I was very struck, as I always am, by the clarion call sounded
by the noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley, on that theme. As the noble
Lord, Lord Turnberg, highlighted, the system will face further demands
with an aging population at a time when we face financial

year’s care and support White Paper is an important step in
changing that. It will sustain and promote what works and challenge and
change what does not. It will promote well-being and independence
instead of waiting for people to reach a crisis point. The White Paper,
together with the draft Care and Support Bill, will shape the care
sector for years to come. The noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, was
right to say that this is an opportunity. This is the most
comprehensive reform of social care legislation in over 60

all welcome the fact that we are living longer but, as the noble Lord,
Lord Warner, reminded us, managing the fiscal consequences of this will
be a key challenge of the coming years. However, we must recognise that
for the foreseeable future government funding will be constrained and
we must plan on that basis. We want to get the engine working as

know that care and support needs to adapt to respond to changes in
demand and expectation. These challenges create an opportunity for
local authorities to innovate and explore new ways of working, better
meet the needs of their local populations and optimise the use of
available resources. Many local authorities are already innovating and
we are committed to supporting them to deliver further service
improvements and to helping other authorities learn from what works. We
want local authorities to maximise the use of reablement services that
help older people recover from acute episodes and reinvest money from
high-cost residential and nursing home care into other services. We
also want local authorities to embrace the potential of new technology
because we know that at least 3 million people with long-term
conditions and social care needs could benefit from the use of
telehealth and telecare
services.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000164" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000164">One
of the biggest changes that the White Paper sets out is moving from the
reactive service that we have at the moment to a proactive service that
helps people stay healthy and independent in the first
place—change that better meets and manages future demand and, as
the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, and my noble friend Lady Jolly
emphasised, prevents people needing to go into acute hospitals and
supports them to regain independence after they leave. As people live
longer, the advantages of that approach, focused on preventing or
postponing care needs, are both immense and glaringly obvious. That
approach is part of our mission to improve the health of the nation as
a whole. That is why we have built an approach that will enable local
authorities and GPs to innovate and devise local solutions to tackle
not just the symptoms but the wider determinants of health. On my noble
friend Lady Jolly’s three questions, the answer in all cases is
yes.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13030683000165" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000165">To
support this, we will include in the Bill a duty on local authorities
to take steps to prevent delay and reduce needs for care and support in
their area. The noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, mentioned the pooling of
budgets between the health service and social care. All too often the
discussion on integrated care is focused around the integration of
structures, funding streams or processes rather than the perspective of
patients and service users. This has led to excessive focus on the
means to achieve integrated care rather than the end of a better
experience for patients and service users. We want to encourage and
support local experimentation to allow local areas to provide
integrated care at scale and pace. We are working with the sector to
support local initiatives and identify what needs to happen to drive
this at a national level. We want to learn what works well, how to
overcome barriers and promote best practice. For example, Torbay
commissioned and provided care for local areas as a single organisation
and has shown comparatively lower levels of emergency admissions,
shorter hospital stays and minimal delayed transfers of care.</hs_para>

Turnberg, talked about the role of GPs in caring for elderly people.
The quality outcomes framework, which is part of the contract with GPs,
provides incentives that reward practices for how well they care for
patients, including for long-term conditions that often affect elderly
patients. The Government have proposed changes to the GP contract, and
a stakeholder consultation has recently finished. Under these
proposals, and in addition to the QOF indicators, we would invite GPs
to participate in a new directed enhanced service that would further
encourage GP practices to co-ordinate and manage the care of frail
older people and other high-risk patients predicted to be at risk of
unscheduled hospital
admission.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000167" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000167">The
noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, also spoke about out-of-hours care. Earlier

out-of-hours
care.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000168" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000168">The
noble Baroness, Lady Emerton, focused on the social care
workforce, its skills and the need to promote leadership. The care and
support White Paper recommends increasing capacity, enhancing
capability and developing leadership in the social care workforce. The
department is working with partners to attract more people to, and
increase apprenticeships in, social care, as well as raising standards
and improving leadership. Working with the National Skills Academy for
Social Care to publish the leadership qualities framework for adult
social care is another important aspect of our programme. That
framework sets out the attitudes and behaviours needed for high-quality
leadership at all levels which, as the noble Baroness rightly said, is
rather different from passing an exam. There is no single, definitive
model of integrated care and support, as I am sure the noble Baroness
will accept. Some localities are further advanced than others. We are
developing the concept of pioneers to support rapid dissemination and
uptake of lessons learnt, and are keen to maintain momentum and
accelerate the adoption of new models of co-ordinated care and 
<?notus-xml column=298?>support across the country. Our ambition is for person-centred
co-ordinated care and support to become the norm over the coming
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030683000169" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130306-gc0001.htm#13030683000169">Returning
to the draft Care and Support Bill, it will introduce important powers
and duties that will further integrated working, including a duty of
co-operation, integration and ensuring that people have clearer
entitlements. We are also committed to developing a measurement of

outcomes frameworks. This has been included as a placeholder in the NHS

by reaffirming the Government’s aspiration to make this country
one of the best places to grow old in, where older people get excellent
treatment, care and support when they need it. Our biggest priority
must be to transform what we offer to meet the challenge of an ageing
population. If we fail to address this, our health and care system will
not be sustainable for older people, or indeed for any of us. We must
develop and promote a culture of compassion across the health and
social care landscape, where quality of care is considered as important
as quality of treatment and where every person can be confident that
they will be treated with compassion, dignity and respect by
skilled staff who are on top of their game and have time to

many firms are not complying with the legislation and guidance in

am not announcing a cap on the total cost of credit. The Government
asked Bristol University to consider the impact of such a cap. This
Government’s view is that a cap would not be the best solution
now to the problems that have been identified by the Bristol report and
the OFT payday compliance review. The Bristol report’s findings
indicate that such a cap could reduce access to credit, reduce the
supply of credit and weaken competition. It could also lead lenders to
shift more to charges which fall outside the cap and to optional fees
which are generally less transparent to consumers. However, the
Government recognise that a cap might be appropriate at some point in
the future. This is why we have provided the FCA with
specific powers to impose a cap on the cost and duration of
credit, should they deem it appropriate once they take over the
responsibility for consumer credit in April 2014.</hs_para>

that tough enforcement and compliance action today, combined with a
