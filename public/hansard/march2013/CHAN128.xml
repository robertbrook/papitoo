having one of the least competitive business tax systems in the world

The economy shrank by 6% when the shadow Chancellor was in the Cabinet,
and we are picking up the pieces of the mess he and his party left
behind. One of those pieces was the deeply uncompetitive business tax
system which meant that companies were moving their headquarters out of
the United Kingdom. Companies are now moving into the UK because of the
changes we have made.</hs_Para>

Andrew Tyrie</B> (Chichester) (Con):</Member> It is small businesses in
our constituencies that will hold the key to Britain’s economic
revival. Does the Chancellor agree that they are simply not getting the
support they need from the banks at the moment and that although the
funding for lending scheme is good, most of the money is currently
going into mortgages rather than businesses? I realise that he will not
want to say much now, just before the Budget, but can he at least
reassure the House that the needs of small businesses are right at the
top of his agenda for this Budget?</hs_Para>

Osborne:</Member></B> My hon. Friend has that assurance. The funding
for lending scheme, joint with the Bank of England, is now supporting
the small and medium-sized business sector as well as the mortgage
market, and is repairing the damage to the financial system caused by
the financial crisis. He is also right to say that small businesses are
the bedrock of our economic revival, which is why we have cut the small
companies tax rate, which before the general election the Labour party
wanted to put up. We have also carried on the relief for small
businesses from business rates, and in the autumn statement we
increased tenfold the annual investment allowance, so that small
businesses can invest for the future and create jobs. The Government
understand that there needs to be a private sector recovery in order
not to repeat the mistakes of the past.</hs_Para>

Osborne:</Member></B> The manufacturing sector halved as a share of the
British economy when Labour was in office and we had the fastest
decline in British manufacturing in British history. The steps that we
have taken to support manufacturers, to help with investment allowances
and to ensure that they have access to fast-growing parts of the world,
such as China and India, are all part of rebalancing and rebuilding the
British economy. I was in the west midlands a couple of weeks ago, and
there are 67,000 new private sector jobs in that region alone; I
mention the region because private sector employment fell during the
boom years under the previous

up. We can borrow at historically low rates, which means low rates for

and that unemployment is a concern right across our economy.
Unemployment rates across the economy have been coming down. She refers
to the experience in her constituency. Since 2008-09 the number of
apprentices in Halifax doubled, so some of the measures that the
Government are taking, such as the investment in apprenticeships and
the Work programme, are making a difference to her constituents. The
most important thing that we can do to continue to support unemployment
moving in the right direction is to maintain the credible fiscal policy
that this Government have put in place, and not give up on it, as the

action through the G20 and the OECD to tackle the issues of

the British armed forces and their achievements. Of course, I am moving
this motion on Commonwealth week, and I am delighted to note all the
hard work that goes into this celebration, but I would like to push it
forward with the formation of a new day. Sometimes unwittingly, these
achievements, and the debt that the nation owes, are forgotten. History
is written by the victors, they say, yet many acts of bravery have
disappeared from our country’s consciousness, which, I believe,

Government need to take more active steps to ensure that we recognise
and reward those contributions, just as we honour those who are born on
these shores. That is why I propose to create a day to commemorate
contributions made by members of the Commonwealth in military action.
It would be a day to consider not just the contribution to the world
wars, but to look further back, a day for schools to encourage and
teach alternative accounts of war and a chance for us to draw together
communities whose families fought for Britain and countries across the
globe that still contribute to our military and civilian
life.</hs_Para>

reposition an understanding of how modern Britain has come to take the
shape it has. Thirdly, I would like the Ministry of Defence to review
cases where heroism has been overlooked in a manner not befitting the
contributions
made<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T12:37:38"></hs_TimeCode>. To

Green, was not a soldier or sailor, did not fight with musket or blade
and was not a military strategist or a straight shooter, but her
contribution to the Crimean war came from a compulsion to aid the
wounded and sick in the face of discrimination. Mary Seacole is often
known as “the other Florence Nightingale”, but her dogged
determination to care for British troops overcame the prejudice
ingrained in our society at the time. Rebuffed in her attempts to join
the nursing unit that had travelled 
<?notus-xml column=160?>to the Crimea—now part of Ukraine—and to gain charity
funds, she travelled to the battlefields and financed her project
herself. Her dedication to saving lives gained her prominence in
contemporary London, but she was never formally recognised for her
contribution and has only found recognition in recent years. The Mary
Seacole award is an NHS award fund for specific health care projects

second example concerns the battle of Saragarhi in 1897. This is a
relevant example of a contribution made and swiftly forgotten. On 12
September, 21 members of the 36th Sikhs regiment were guarding the
signalling post of Saragarhi between Fort Gulistan and Fort Lockhart
when they were besieged by some 10,000 Afghan tribesmen. Saragarhi is
recognised by military historians as one of the great last stands, with
all 21 men choosing to fight to the death. When news of the
battle reached this House, so extraordinary was the tale and so valiant
the actions that the Members in this Chamber rose to their feet and
gave a standing ovation. All the men were posthumously awarded the
Indian Order of Merit, first class, which at the time was the highest
gallantry award given to Indian troops. It was not until 1911 that
Indian troops qualified for the Victoria Cross.</hs_Para>

many of my hon. Friends will know, some of my main interests include
British military history, football, beer and business. It is therefore
of great significance to me to bring to the House’s attention
the story of Walter Tull. I fully expect his name to come to further
prominence this year, as a campaign for recognition of his achievements
is taking place. Although he was born in England to an English mother,
his father was from Barbados. As a footballer, he suffered considerable
prejudice for his heritage, playing for Tottenham Hotspur and
Northampton Town, before enlisting in the Army at the outbreak of world
war one. Despite the ingrained prejudice that dictated that a man could
become an officer only if he was of entirely European descent, Walter
Tull became just that.</hs_Para>

years on from his death, he has become the unlikely subject of a new
play by Michael Morpurgo, author of “War Horse”, and
there is a petition for him to be finally awarded the recognition he

the more compelling, there is now even an ale brewed in his name by a
Northampton brewery.</hs_Para>

initial interest in this issue came many years ago, when I visited the
largely forgotten western front battlefields of 1915 at Loos and
Neuve-Chapelle with the late, great military historian Professor
Richard Holmes. Prime Minister Harold Macmillan fought and was wounded
in the arm at the battle of Loos. Neuve-Chapelle was 
<?notus-xml column=161?>one of the first organised attacks, in which the Indian Army played a
significant part. Today there stands the magnificent and imposing
Indian memorial, dedicated to the 4,500 men killed in action and the
hundreds of prisoners of war who ended their days in German
prisoner of war camps, down coal mines a long way from
home<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T12:42:08"></hs_TimeCode>. Although

are just a few examples of the phenomenal contributions made to the
Britain Isles. I sincerely hope that these lesser known stories will
allow us to reflect on the histories that are less well remembered. To
better remember how we became the nation we are today, it is essential

have a day to commemorate the contribution of Commonwealth countries to
British military campaigns.</hs_Para>

but we are still within the period of the 50p rate. Of course we want
to see the details of what has been happening. However, while the
Conservatives have the notion that for those who are very wealthy, the
higher tax rates are a deterrent and create avoidance, they do not say
the same about the poorest and the middle-income families in the rest
of the country. They can pay VAT at 20%; they can pay higher taxes. The
hon. Lady takes a view that is taken by so many Conservatives. There is
one law for those who are very wealthy, but everyone else must suffer

collapse, compounded by the financial crisis, it became clear that we

way that deals with those exceptional circumstances—the Liberal

addressed, and the Deputy Prime Minister answered it in his
“Call Clegg” radio slot on London’s Biggest
Conversation, which I know is becoming a popular, regular and welcome
fixture in the media diary. He said that individuals in such
circumstances might be able to defer payments until the house was sold
or to “leverage” the value of the property by
remortgaging. I am not sure that that strategy provides the complete
solution to the conundrum, but I do think that those in the Treasury

one end of the spectrum but when the Deputy Prime Minister comes up

with the so-called granny tax, which is more accurately described as a

fund a cut in the higher rate of income tax. That is not fair and it is
not right, and it certainly should not be part of the society we want

assessment process or reducing the value of the tax credits on which so

in office for 4,758 days. For all but 36 of those days, the highest
rate of income tax was at 40p. Then it moved to 50p. There is a good
question to ask the Opposition about why they kept it at 40p for so
long. Why did they leave it until the fag-end of their Government, when
it was clear that they would not be in government any more? The reason
is that the 50p rate, predictably enough, did not do what it was
supposed to do. It did not raise revenue, and an income tax that does
not raise revenue is not something that a sensible Government would

intervention. If 1 million more people are in work but there is zero
growth—in other words, there has been no overall increase in
production—that implies that people who had been in full-time
jobs are now in part-time jobs and that aggregate production has not
increased, which is a complete failure. It is symptomatic of Tory
Britain, with people scratching around for anything they can find in

has been some discussion of the 50p rate of tax. As I have mentioned,
the reason the Treasury thinks it would not make any money from a 50p
rate is that it knows that millionaires can move money between tax
years, which is precisely what they have done. They knew that their
Tory mates would reduce the top rate of tax the next year and so simply
shifted their income to that year. The point that I had wanted to make
in another intervention—I appreciate that two were
taken—relates to the idea that the 50p rate does not work and is
therefore dead. However, people earning between £32,000 and
£42,000 already pay 52% marginal tax—12% for national
insurance and 40% for income tax—but of course no one talks
about that. How does that change their behaviour, and why is it fair
that they pay the higher rate while people on £150,000 do not
because they have accountants? It is

problem we face is that there is no growth in our economy because there
is no consumer demand, and although the deficit—the rate at
which the debt is increasing —has gone down by 25%,
as we are constantly reminded, the overall debt continues to rise to
unprecedented levels. We are almost back to a pre-1997 situation in
which we are paying people to stay on the dole and, at the same time,
cutting services. That is the old Tory vicious cycle. We want to get
back to Labour’s virtuous cycle, with people in jobs and paying
tax and with unprecedented
growth<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T14:03:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031241000418" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/debtext/130312-0002.htm#13031241000418">The
other point that is always made is that the banks were unregulated and
that is why everything went wrong. The reality is that the Financial
Services Authority—I know that it has had a bad name—was
introduced in the teeth of opposition from the Tories, who said that
there was too much regulation already. Then, when the banks started
going bust, the Labour Government said that we had better nationalise
them so that people could still get money out at the hole in the wall.
The Tories said, “No, let them fall.” That would have
been a complete catastrophe. So in other words, the previous Labour
Government did a very good job. We now have a situation in which,
instead of confronting the deficit, which is what we should be doing,
the Government have the wrong balance between growth and cuts, and
within the cuts there is the wrong balance—80% cuts and
20%
tax.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031241000419" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/debtext/130312-0002.htm#13031241000419">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T14:09:19"></hs_TimeCode>
for the claim that we are all in this together, we are now in a
situation in which the poor are paying the most. I mentioned in a brief
intervention—I also raised this in Prime Minister’s
questions—a man who came to see me who had £20 a week,
after utility bills, for food and clothing. He now faces a further hit
of about £7 a week for having an empty bedroom. How will he
survive on £2 a day? Allegedly, that change will save the
Government about half a billion pounds, but of course it will not,
because obviously people will move to the private sector, where rents
are higher, and there will be empty houses in the public sector because
councils will be forced to evict people. It makes no economic sense at
all. However, if it did raise half a billion pounds, which is about one
twentieth of what the Chancellor is investing in the tax thresholds,
the hit to the very poorest will be similar to the gain to a very large
number of people, and that will cost a great deal of
money.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031241000420" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/debtext/130312-0002.htm#13031241000420">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T14:09:19"></hs_TimeCode>
point I am trying to make is that what will probably result in no
savings will inflict enormous hardship on the most vulnerable, which is
unnecessary and wrong. Those people, because they are very poor, have
no option but to spend all their money locally, which helps to boost
growth. If that money is redistributed from the very poorest to the
squeezed middle, which is obviously good for votes—a callous and
cynical manoeuvre in difficult economic times—then clearly that
is not in favour of growth either. In so far as it will push money 
<?notus-xml column=186?>right up the income scale to the millionaires who live in
mansions—the people we have been talking about—what will
they do with the extra money the Government will have bunged to them?

productive economy, but what is a fair way to do that in a—dare
I say it—one nation way? Britain wants a one nation future that
works and a future that cares, and the question for us all in difficult
times must be how we deliver that. How do we invest, as I
mentioned during Treasury questions, in super-connectivity for the city
of Swansea? We do it on the back of investment in universities,
electrified rail and communications and by marketing city regions, and
indeed Britain, for inward investment. Those are all important.

activity where it occurs, whether we are talking about Google, Amazon

the example of Apple phones and all the technology in the phone I am
holding in my hand. The internet was invented here, and the other
stuff, such as touch-screen and voice-activated technology, was
invented in the national institute of science in California. So Apple
is being taken to court by California for $26 billion
because it does not pay any tax. Apple has taken innovation from the
public sector, repackaged it, branded it, manufactured it overseas and

of these people obviously live in mansions. The issue about the mansion
tax, of course, is that it is part of a more general review of council
tax, as other Members have mentioned, which has not been uprated. There
needs to be a progressive system of taxation. Obviously the mansion
tax, which is a Liberal Democrat proposal, had not been completely
thought out in all its intricacies, but it is a direction of travel. If
someone lives in a £2 million house, it is not that difficult to
find ways of getting income out of it. It can be rented out and, with
the rental income, the owner could have a palatial place in south Wales
and a profit, so they could sit by the sea and enjoy themselves. For
those people who are stuck in £2 million cupboards in London,
allegedly, and we feel sorry for them, there are ways of releasing
equity, as they could be rented out and people will pay the market
rate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031241000425" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/debtext/130312-0002.htm#13031241000425"><Member ContinuationText="Gordon Birtwistle" PimsId="5525" UID="13031241002322" xid="1037" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/debtext/130312-0002.htm#13031241002322"><B>Gordon

key sentences in the Opposition motion and in the coalition Government

effective way to cut taxes for people on low and middle incomes was to
raise the income tax threshold to £10,000. That policy was
accepted by our coalition partners and it has now been delivered by the
coalition Government. I listened carefully to what the Leader of the

reason the Business Secretary—our shadow Chancellor, as he then
was—proposed a mansion tax towards the end of 2009 was that
property wealth in our country is woefully under-taxed. Our only
property tax is council tax. In England, the top council tax band, band
H, is twice the rate of the broadest band, band D, and three times that
of the basic band, band A. That means, in effect, that in our only
property tax the rate for a £10 million mansion is only three
times the rate for a bedsit. That is clearly a ludicrous way to tax
property. The band H top rate is only £320,000. Let us take as
an example the royal London borough of Kensington and Chelsea, just
along from where we are now. A £90 million
mansion—I can see no other way to describe a
£90 million house—in Kensington Palace gardens
pays council tax of £2,151. That is the top rate of council tax
that can possibly be paid in the London borough of Kensington 
<?notus-xml column=189?>and Chelsea—exactly the same as the rate for a small flat in that
borough. That is a nonsensical property tax.
That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T14:15:57"></hs_TimeCode> is why my
party, the Liberal Democrats, backs the introduction of a mansion tax
on properties with a value of over £2 million, with an annual
levy of 1% on the excess over £2 million. That means that
someone who had a £2.1 million mansion would pay mansion tax of
£1,000 tax a year, while someone with a £3 million
mansion would pay mansion tax of £10,000 a
year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T14:16:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031241000442" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/debtext/130312-0002.htm#13031241000442">The
Minister and several other Members have asked what would happen to
people who are asset-rich but income-poor. We have always had a very
simple answer to that. In those cases, the tax would be rolled up and
would crystallise once the property was sold and then be met from the
sale price. That is a very simple concept for a very simple tax. We
have also said that it should be a national tax, not a local tax. We
have not hypothecated it to any particular tax measure, and we have not
tied it to the reintroduction of a 10p tax rate as the Opposition have,
which is why we do not support their motion.
However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T14:17:15"></hs_TimeCode>, it
could take us to the final milestone of getting to the £10,000
income tax-free threshold that I am reasonably confident will be
announced very shortly. It could certainly contribute to getting the
Liberal Democrats to where we wish to go next—that is, to making
sure that every adult on the national minimum wage, which is currently
£12,071, should not be caught in the income tax net. We may be
able to make progress towards that in the latter days of this
coalition, but it will certainly be in the Liberal Democrat manifesto
in 2015; we are completely clear about
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T14:17:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031241000443" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/debtext/130312-0002.htm#13031241000443">Labour
Members have linked their mansion tax proposal—at least the
concept, as they have not fleshed out what it really is—to the

Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Mr Brown) in which he announced
the abolition of the 10p tax rate. That was met on the then Government
Benches with wild cheers and waving of Order Papers because it was to
finance a cut in the basic rate of tax from 22% to 20%. Why was that
being done? What was so crucial about its timing? As we know, the then
Chancellor was heir apparent to the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair. He
thought that there was going to be an autumn 2007 general election and
that an income tax cut for better-off people in society, financed by
the poorest, whom he assumed would always vote Labour, seemed like a
good piece of populist politics—but it backfired and blew up in
his face<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T14:18:46"></hs_TimeCode>. Six

flatlined over the past two years, and the deficit is going up.

Prosperity will be achieved only when everyone plays their part in
building the economy—a recovery made by many, not just a few at
the top who believe they are aiding some recovery. That is the lesson
of history. In the industrial revolution, which I know was way back, it
was those who went down the mines, spun the cotton, built ships and
constructed bridges who drove the economy forward. The nation is crying
out for a fairer tax system, which we will put at the heart of our new
priorities. As well as cancelling the millionaires’ tax cut and
the changes to tax credits this April, a Labour Budget would tax houses
worth more than £2 million and use the money gathered to cut
taxes for working people. A fairer tax system would send a message
about how Britain will succeed in the years ahead that says:
“When you play your part and make your contribution to the
economy, you will be
rewarded.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031241000462" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/debtext/130312-0002.htm#13031241000462">The

will confine my remarks to the taxation of high-value property. The
motion refers to a mansion tax on properties worth more than £2
million. A serious problem with the motion is that the Government have
already brought in a range of measures to increase the incidence of tax
on the owners of properties worth more than £2
million. No definition of “mansion tax” per se
is provided in the
motion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T14:34:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031241000474" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/debtext/130312-0002.htm#13031241000474">The
Leader of the Opposition hypothecated the revenues that would
purportedly be raised by the mansion tax to reintroduce the 10% rate of
tax, which was abolished by the previous Government. The cost of that
would be some £7.3 billion. Research that was published recently
shows that to raise that amount of money, a so-called mansion tax would
have to be introduced not on properties worth more than £2
million, but on properties worth more than £415,000. It may be
that the Opposition wish to tax people in that class of income more.
Perhaps they think that they are rich, are benefiting too much and need
to pay more to the Government. I look forward to their fighting the
next election on that
basis<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T14:35:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031241000475" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/debtext/130312-0002.htm#13031241000475">Meanwhile,
our coalition partners have said that there should be a
mansion tax that applies only to residential property worth more than
£2 million. However, we have also heard from the Liberal
Democrats—I am not sure whether it came from the federal policy
committee or quite how they develop these policies—that it would
apply not just to mansions above £2 million, but to property
generally above £2 million. It is therefore just as important
for somebody who has 10 flats worth £200,000 each to pay the
extra tax as somebody who has a so-called mansion worth £2
million. Apparently, they are going to go further and inspect the
contents of jewellery boxes and levy taxes on those as
well.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031241000476" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/debtext/130312-0002.htm#13031241000476"><B><Member ContinuationText="Stephen Williams" PimsId="4842" UID="13031241002343" xid="813" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/debtext/130312-0002.htm#13031241002343">Stephen

of a net wealth tax that allows HMRC to look beyond people’s
front doors. On the property portfolio, if somebody owned 10 flats, the
nine that they did not live in would probably be attracting rental
income and so would already be taxed. A mansion tax would apply to

the Member for Bristol West (Stephen Williams) has given assurances,

federal policy committee of his party. It is difficult as an outsider
to judge how formal and important that is, but there are clearly
Liberal Democrats who are talking about a broader tax on wealth and
capital, including on jewellery. I think that would be a

is unfortunate that the Opposition with this motion and our friends on

Democrats seem to want to confine their efforts to rein in tax
avoidance to those who own houses worth more than £2 million. I

more than £2 million there will be a 7% charge, or do they
expect the sale to be from a controlled company to the person
controlling that company, perhaps at a nominal rate that will not
attract stamp duty, in order to recoup some of the avoidance they may

Some industrialised countries do not do it, but none of those have such
a pool of property that acts as a free piggy bank for overseas
residents. We keep their wealth and capital completely secure in

Obviously, I do not expect answers about what will be in the

I am not generally in favour of that, but where people avoid tax by
putting houses into companies, even if they are worth less than
£2 million, we should try and get the proper tax. Where overseas
residents are doing nicely by securing capital in the UK but paying
very little for the privilege, by taxing the capital gains they make on
later sales of those houses it would be welcome to see them paying
their share and doing a little to help us close the deficit, which, of
course, is the great uniting purpose of the

seems to have been spent in an argument between the two coalition
partners about how they would define certain types of taxation, and the
problem with the amendment is that it has to look two ways at once. The

this matter is clearly not one of those. Interestingly, it is often on
crucial financial or welfare issues that they do not break ranks but
keep voting with the Tory-dominated Government, which is

an interesting coda to that report from some of those who were

lead to increased investment in this country, because that is what is
really important? Many of the tax people thought it was crucial to turn
improved tax relief on capital expenditure into investment in this
country, and that it should be the No. 1 priority for the UK. In 2010,
the Chancellor abolished capital allowances for investment in his first

council tax—about people who are asset rich and income poor. It
is usually raised as a reason for not putting up
council tax banding, for example. In the old days, it was used as a
reason for not making changes to the rating system. Yes, we can all
come up with examples of people who are in that
position. Usually, the example is a widow who cannot afford
to pay. However, we cannot design our entire system of taxation around
that, and there are ways it can be mitigated, as there are with council
tax. If someone is genuinely as income poor as has been suggested, they
would—at least until the Government decided to change the rules
on council tax benefit—have been eligible for assistance with
their council tax. There are always ways to help such people.</hs_Para>

again, Government Members have challenged us to make clear what tax
changes we would make to rebalance the unfairness in the tax system. I
am delighted, therefore, that the Labour Front-Bench team has backed
the Lib Dem policy of a mansion tax, while going further by saying that
the money could be used to fund a 10p tax rate, which would bring
immense benefit to the lowest-paid in our communities. It would be a
tremendous boost to many of the lowest-paid people across Teesside and
the rest of the country, including all the people who have landed one
of these low-paid, part-time jobs that the Government gleefully boast
about. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T15:00:03"></hs_TimeCode>Those
people are to be praised and helped. Their pay is derisory, yet they

them. They already face the prospect of a cut in income from the

Dems, and others, could join us in helping to correct that unfair tax
change and recognising their commitment to hard work.</hs_Para>

mansion tax might mean £5 a week for some families. That would
not buy a small glass of wine in a Canary Wharf bar, but it could make
a huge difference to the people at the bottom of the earning scales. It
would buy enough bread from Asda for a family of four for several days,

miss the opportunity to put bread in the mouths of poor families by
failing to send a message to the Chancellor that he should adopt this
mansion tax in next week’s
Budget<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T15:02:08"></hs_TimeCode>. I am
sure that people who own property worth more than £2 million
could afford the extra charge to help the poor. If not, they can move
to a less expensive property and dodge the tax. Like my hon. Friend the
Member for Edinburgh East (Sheila Gilmore),
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T15:02:22"></hs_TimeCode> see a parallel
with the bedroom tax. Thousands of people in my area are facing a cut
in their income. The answer, apparently, is to move to a smaller
property. Those with homes valued at more than £2 million but
who cannot afford a mansion tax should do what the poor have to do and
downsize.</hs_Para>

am one of those who supports higher taxes, particularly when people can
afford to pay, so I plead guilty as charged. Earlier today, a Minister
said that the Government were focused on the causes of poverty, but all
the time cash is being shifted from the poorest to the wealthiest, just
as the funds available to local authorities in the north of England are
being shifted to the richer areas in the south. I said that
unemployment was not falling in my constituency, but in some parts of
the south it has fallen, albeit owing to part-time, low-paid jobs. The
Government’s austerity measures have devastated local
authorities in the north-east, and the contractors who build roads and
houses and promote and deliver other services are the losers, being
forced to pay off skilled workers who want to work and support their
families.</hs_Para>

Wednesday, the Chancellor will deliver his Budget for 2013-14. It is
probably his last chance before the general election in 2015 to come up
with a set of policies that could make a real difference to
people’s lives. The biggest difference he could make would be to
abandon his plan A, under which growth has stagnated, unemployment in
areas such as mine has grown and deficit and debt reduction has become
even harder, but we know he will not do it. He is tied to his ruinous
plan A because he has staked his credibility on it—but there is
no credibility in it. The Tories still talk about what will happen if
the economy turns around, but if we return to growth, will ordinary
people suddenly stop feeling the strain of higher costs and less money
in their pockets? I very much doubt it.</hs_Para>

ignores the fact that the Chancellor’s plan has already failed
on its own terms. Not only is the national debt far higher than it was
when he took office, but he has failed, and failed again, on growth.
The reason is that without a good level of growth it is difficult to
reduce deficits and debt, and as the Chancellor’s own Office for
Budget Responsibility pointed out last week, cutting spending and
hiking up taxes for ordinary people has slowed and stopped economic
growth. As the ratings agency Moody’s pointed out when it
downgraded the UK’s credit rating, the country’s lack of
growth has made it nearly impossible for the Government to meet the
only real goal they set themselves, which was eradicating the
structural
deficit<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T15:05:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031241000522" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/debtext/130312-0002.htm#13031241000522">Although
a return to growth would be welcome, only strong growth would be enough
to make up for the lost years of economic stagnation under this
Government and to keep up with the growing and ageing population.
Unless economic growth is above population growth, we are all getting
poorer. Add to that the fact that the Government are
redistributing from the bottom to the top by cutting the top rate of
tax for millionaires while capping welfare, increasing VAT and cutting
public services, and the scale of their failure becomes all the more
apparent.</hs_Para>

we know all too well the impact of the Government’s policies.
Long-term unemployment has more than doubled in the past 12 months and
youth unemployment remains stubbornly high. Next Wednesday, the
Chancellor has a chance to change course, cut spending less quickly and
focus on taxing obscene wealth in order to invest in young people. He
is very keen to point to the past and the failures—as he sees
it—of the Labour Government, but he has been in his role
for nearly three years and has failed abysmally.

much for a Labour Government to do in 2015 to address the unfairness

help us get our fairness agenda under way by backing a mansion tax and

Unfortunately, he left the Chamber—no doubt for a celebratory

turn to speak. I remember that, on the day of the election, I was
knocking on doors for the Labour party, as he would expect. We were

Labour was not one of the two horses, but I was slightly comforted by

fairness is the subject of this debate, and I very much welcome the
moves that our leadership is making in that direction. The decisions on
the mansion tax and the 10p rate are important. They might be straws in

tax is perhaps something of a slogan—an eye-catching, or
thought-catching, idea—but I believe that property taxes are
appropriate in a civilised society.

ensure that such taxes are equitable. If there is inequity between
regions, that should be looked at. The taxes have to be carefully
designed to ensure that equity. Personally, I would like to go further
and talk about a wealth tax. My party used to talk about that some
years ago, and I would like to see a more general tax on wealth in
order to do something about the grotesque inequalities in our society.
Those inequalities have grown enormously during the time I have been
active in politics. Had I been told when I was first active in my party
in the late ’50s and early ’60s that we would be in this
position now, I would not have believed it. We have moved in this
direction, however, and it has been a retrograde step.</hs_Para>

doubt some hon. Members will have read a book entitled “The
Spirit Level”, which identifies a strong correlation between
income inequality and a whole range of social ills. I want to see a
society that is much more equal in income terms, in order to reduce
those social ills and because it is right in principle. It is
interesting to note that that correlation applies in all societies,
whatever the income levels. It does not just apply in rich societies or
poor ones. In any society, income inequality correlates with greater
social ills. I hope that when my party gets into office at the next
election—that is “when”, not
“if”—we will seriously address that question and
try to make Britain a much more equal society again.</hs_Para>

I was disappointed in the previous Government. I was one of a small

rightly due from them. We have heard from the tax justice movement, and
from Richard Murphy in particular, an assessment of the tax gap as
being something like £120 billion. Some suggest that it could be
even more than that. Even the Government accept that the figure is in
the tens of billions. Small advances have been made in collecting that
tax, but if were really to make inroads in that area, we would not need
to look at changes in the tax rate because there would be so much more

Hopkins:</Member></B> We have seen successive Governments going in for
what is called light-touch regulation on all fronts. I have never
believed in light-touch regulation; I believe in tough regulation. I
believe in employing thousands more tax officers to ensure that we
collect the taxes. At the beginning of my time in Parliament, I visited
our local VAT office, and the inspectors there told me that if they had
more tax inspectors, they could collect billions more in tax. Each of
those VAT inspectors collected more than five times their salary.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T15:26:25"></hs_TimeCode> wrote about
this to the Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time, and got a letter
back from a civil servant saying that the Treasury was trying to reduce
costs by reducing staffing levels. That was a completely
illogical non sequitur; it was complete nonsense. Reducing the number
of tax officers will reduce income by more than the amount
of their salaries.</hs_Para>

have made the point many times—and I shall continue to make
it—that we need more tax officers and more rigorous regulation.
We need more control over what the corporates and the fat cats get away
with. The reality is that ordinary working-class people have to
pay tax through PAYE. They cannot escape paying their tax,
but the corporates and the fat cats can. So, I have agreed with

kowtow to the IMF or to impose those strictures. In fact, remarkably,
the economy survived quite well during that time, although a mistake
was made at the end. I shall not go into that now, Mr Deputy

let me remind the House of the context of today’s debate. Many
of our constituents are struggling to make ends meet, due to a
combination of under-employment, stagnating wages, rising food, fuel

VAT. Our constituents will be further hit by a £6.7

Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, the
right hon. Member for Bath (Mr Foster)—the Liberal Democrat
Minister—is groaning but that is the reality for many families
up and down the country. At the same time, we read of hundreds of
bankers at different financial institutions, including one owned by the
state, earning more than £1 million per year. We have a
Chancellor seeking but failing to use his ever-diminishing influence in
Europe to fight against proposals to limit bankers’ bonuses to
“just a year’s salary”. We have a coalition
Government who will give the 13,000 people in this country earning more
than £1 million a year a tax cut of £100,000 next month.
No wonder people are angry and no wonder our economy is not growing
when ordinary people cannot afford to spend and invest. We—or,
more accurately, the Prime Minister—heard only last week from
the OBR that fiscal consolidation measures have reduced economic growth
over the past couple of

is worth repeating yet again that the Opposition put the 50p tax rate

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T15:53:23"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Exchequer Secretary made clear, a recent review showed that the
additional rate is a distortive and economically inefficient way of
raising revenue. So we have decided—sensibly, in my
view—that it is neither efficient nor fair to maintain a tax
rate that is not effective at raising revenue from high earners and
risks damaging growth. That is why we have introduced a top rate of
45p, which will be higher than the top rate that existed under Labour
for all but 36 days of their 13 years in
office.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031241000626" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/debtext/130312-0002.htm#13031241000626">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T15:54:01"></hs_TimeCode>
is not true to suggest, as some have done, that the Government are not
requiring the wealthiest to pay more. We have continually increased the
tax contribution of the richest since the election. The 2010 Budget
introduced a higher rate of capital gains tax; the 2011 Budget tackled
avoidance through disguised remuneration; and the 2012 Budget increased
stamp duty land tax to 7% on residential properties costing £2
million or more. We are also the Government who took action in the
autumn statement to reduce the cost of pensions tax relief, and we
introduced a 15% rate of stamp duty for properties owned through a
corporate vehicle. I am grateful to

a result of the Government’s actions, the richest pay more tax

the rich are now paying a higher percentage of income tax than at any

restricting tax reliefs; further notes that both parts of the Coalition
continue to support tax cuts for people on low and middle incomes;
notes that the part of the Coalition led by the Deputy Prime Minister
also advocates a mansion tax on properties worth more than £2
million, as set out in his party’s manifesto, and the part of
the Coalition led by the Prime Minister does not advocate a mansion
tax; and further notes that the top rate of income tax will be higher
under this Government than under any year of the previous

paid less and the poor paid more in tax than now, meaning nobody will

Secretary, my right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen,
announced that we would require all companies bidding for Government
contracts above £1 million to put in place a scheme to create
apprenticeships before they could get them. That is an initiative to do

Churchill’s “action this day”. Are this Government
so supine, so conflicted and so hung up that they prefer taking away
people’s employment rights to creating career opportunities for

that we can compete and thrive in the 21st-century world. It is no
wonder that my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition made the
expansion of apprenticeships with employers and other stakeholders, and
the introduction of the “tech bacc”, the central focus in
his speech to the Labour party conference last year. He has also spelt
out the way in which a future Labour Government could apply the same
criterion to major infrastructure projects such as High Speed 2, with
the objective of creating at least 33,000 additional

in Surrey, and on the M275 in Portsmouth—with a combined
contract value of more than £400 million, from which hundreds of
apprenticeship places could be created. If the Government really want
to expand apprenticeships, why will they not practise what they preach

there be for the two thirds of businesses that still do not offer

Members believe that this apprenticeship route has to be a

addressed by our Labour skills taskforce. It is taking forward details
of our proposals, which the Leader of the Opposition announced last

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T16:56:28"></hs_TimeCode>the Government
have been dithering nationally about how to expand apprenticeships and
ignoring procurement policies, Labour local authorities have been
leading the way. A number of Labour-run authorities are going ahead
with public procurement to create new apprenticeships for
young local people eager for those opportunities. For
example, Sheffield city council has identified
233 additional apprenticeships that it can create via public
procurement where it has set its requirements at £100,000.
Sandwell’s council has done something similar, aiming
to create just under 200 apprenticeships through public
procurement in the next three years. Other councils, such as my local
authority in Blackpool, are boosting numbers in other innovative ways.
It already has 48 apprentices on the books, but my local council is
working with other local public sector bodies, such as the police force
and the NHS, to create shared apprenticeships across those bodies. One
could add to that other Labour councils such as those in Reading and
Plymouth that are actively engaging with local businesses to boost
apprenticeship opportunities across their boroughs, as well as the city
skills hubs of Manchester and Leeds.</hs_Para>

is telling about that story of activity in local government is that, as
we have heard, even Conservative-run local authorities realise the
merits of that approach. For example, Kent county council has put in
place criteria whose details closely mirror ours: procurement for all
contracts worth more than £1 million should create at least one
additional apprenticeship place. Northamptonshire county council has
also put in place mandatory requirements on all contracts over the
value of £2
million<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T16:58:16"></hs_TimeCode>. In
addition, there are those in the Prime Minister’s own
parliamentary party who have argued that something has to be done, with

apprenticeships.</hs_Para>

the economy, apprenticeships improve productivity. For employers,
apprenticeships increase morale and retention, not to mention the

political differences that we may have between the parties, it is
important that we take the opportunity to demonstrate and recommend to
young people the advantages that come from an

figures show that it is anticipated that there will be about
£3.4 billion worth of additional growth per year in 2022 if we
adopt a certain target for apprenticeships. Similarly, apprentices can
expect to earn about £150,000 extra during a lifetime. Those are
key figures that the House should be highlighting in order to underpin
the Government’s drive to get more
apprentices<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T17:14:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031241001855" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/debtext/130312-0003.htm#13031241001855">However,
the Government have to recognise that there is also a perception
problem. Fewer than one in five 16 to 19-year-olds think that
apprenticeships offer the best career option for them, and the great
majority still think that GCSEs and university do. Fewer than one in 10
parents support apprenticeships. They still prefer the higher education
route and still think of apprentices as being blue collar workers,
whereas in fact the great majority are white collar
workers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T17:15:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031241001856" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/debtext/130312-0003.htm#13031241001856">Notwithstanding
the obvious economic benefit and the drive and support from all parties

some of the recommendations made by the Opposition and the Business,

solution lies, first, in not just trying to drive up the number of
apprenticeships, but in looking at our education system. The Prime
Minister talked yesterday about an alternative career option. If we are
to get young people to take it up, we must have some sort of parity of
esteem between higher education and the apprenticeship route. The most
depressing thing that the Committee heard was when an apprentice in
Sheffield told us that he had the option to go to university, but when
he told his school he wanted to take an apprenticeship, it ignored him
and did not even invite him to its awards ceremony. That is symptomatic
of a culture within our schools and education system that must be

given? All too often the institutional interest of the school and the
individual interest of the young person are not the same, and that is
why we need some kind of arbitration to make sure that the interests of

that that can be achieved through apprenticeships. Some of the
strongest recommendations in the Select Committee’s report

focus on them in careers advice. It also points out the need to
increase engagement between the National Apprenticeship Service and

Members here today, I welcome national apprenticeship week. Last night
I was pleased to be able to attend an event organised
jointly by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders and Semta on
apprenticeships in the motor industry, where I met Carolyn Lee and
James Doughty, two new apprentices working for Jaguar Land Rover. If
anybody ever doubted the value of apprenticeships and what they can do
to raise aspirations among young people, they just need to listen to
the kind of things they were saying to me.</hs_Para>

chair of the all-party motor group, I have regular discussions with
motor manufacturers and others in the motor industry. It is a sector
where apprenticeships are taken very seriously and where a great deal
is being done. The automotive sector is one of the largest providers of
apprenticeships in our country. People in the sector certainly welcome
a number of the initiatives that have taken place, but last night they
told me something that it is important for us to bear in mind: we must
not think that rhetoric about apprenticeships is exactly the same as
reality, because they are different. We can support some of the things
that are being done and still recognise
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031241001892" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/debtext/130312-0003.htm#13031241001892">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T17:32:18"></hs_TimeCode>
am sorry that the Minister did not seek to engage with Labour Members
on the issues that they wanted to raise with him. My first point about
rhetoric not always matching reality is that people involved in the
automotive sector and elsewhere are saying that small and medium-sized
firms, in particular, have genuine concerns about how they can engage
with the system: how they access apprenticeships, what they mean for
them, and whether it is too difficult for them to get involved. The
system is not joining up in the way that it should, and it
is important that the Government listen to what those in industry are
saying. They are not making political points; they are talking about
the health of their businesses and the opportunities that should be
available to young
people<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T17:33:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

point on the rhetoric is that it is okay for the Government to talk
about the expansion in the number of apprenticeships that has occurred
over the past few years, but often those apprenticeships are not
tackling the issue of youth unemployment, even in terms of numbers. In
the last academic year, the number of 16 to 18-year-old apprentices
fell in four of England’s nine regions, including my own, the
west midlands. Youth unemployment has sky-rocketed in my constituency;
1,260 young people are currently without a job and long-term youth
unemployment has more than doubled. If we overlay that with access to
apprenticeships, it does not make good reading. The Prince’s
Trust has highlighted the fact that in some cases just 14% of
apprenticeships were obtained by unemployed young people.</hs_Para>

are examples of good practice. I welcome the work of Birmingham city
council. Last year it established a commission on youth unemployment,
which produced pretty staggering and disturbing results: we are one
of the youngest cities in Europe but we have 15,000
unemployed young people, 3,000 of whom have been unemployed for more
than a year. The council and its partners set up a youth jobs fund to
target funding on tackling long-term youth unemployment. There are
issues involved in targeting funding: should it be targeted on young
people, on the areas in which they live or on the areas in which
employers operate, which form the catchment area for the young people?

believe that apprenticeships enjoy parity of esteem, whereas we must

are all aware of the tale of educational under-attainment from which we
have suffered for many years. I worked in a university for about 20

dropped. It became too easy to go to university, and when I started
work in the 1980s there was no one in the class who did not want to be
there, but by the time I left many young people were there simply
because they did not know where else to be—it was a deferred
decision. The most difficult thing I faced in dealing with admissions
in the summer was my awareness of the huge attrition rate in the autumn
as students drifted into other things and did not stay on the course.

right across the national newspapers and broadcasters, whereas it was
very hard to get journalists to write even a small story about the
importance of apprenticeships. That is largely because people in that
sector, as is now the case with many politicians, have not experienced
apprenticeships themselves. It has also been the case that many
middle-class people in this country have not considered apprenticeships
to be a preferred option for their children.

and solutions. I was there to shadow one of the six first-year
engineering apprentices, 18-year-old Darius Bahrami from Sunderland.
Darius had studied A-levels at school, but unlike many of his friends
he had decided to take up an engineering apprenticeship, as opposed to
going to university. He told me that a number of his friends
wished that they, too, had taken up an apprenticeship, as opposed to
following a university career. Apart from experiencing how software is
used in engineering, I attended a “Lesson learnt”

industry, is fighting to fill a skills gap. One third of its staff are
over 55. That is because businesses in the oil and gas industry cut
back on the number of trainees and apprentices they took on in the
’80s and ’90s. Given the rapidly diminishing window to
recruit people quickly enough to replace the ageing work force while
still “downloading” skills and experience from people
currently in post, companies such as Fabricon are battling. Because of
the skills gap and its commitment to skills and development, Fabricon
has launched its own dedicated offshore services academy, which is
providing full training for apprentices and working with the
universities in the area.</hs_Para>

Doyle-Price</B> (Thurrock) (Con):</Member> It is a pleasure to
participate in this debate, which has been characterised by positive
and constructive contributions from all parts of the House. That shows
just how much support there is for more and better
apprenticeships.</hs_Para>

am proud to represent a constituency with a strong manufacturing base
and a strong and vibrant logistics industry. Apprenticeships have
always been a feature of these industries. When I meet the wealth
creators in Thurrock, without exception they are people who have
learned their skills in the workplace. That fact needs to be
understood. For many people, choosing an apprenticeship will be the
most effective route to their personal advancement. I would like to
highlight some successful local programmes and, in doing so, highlight
some areas where the Government could do more to encourage better
apprenticeships.</hs_Para>

port of Tilbury has always offered a number of apprenticeships each
year, placing a high emphasis on skills and even establishing its own
logistics academy to provide bespoke training that suits its business.
This year the port has developed a new apprenticeship in health and
safety, which is central to its business, as ports are hazardous
places. The port has advised me, however, that the apprenticeship
framework can often prove inflexible for the kind of training that it
wishes to offer. I suggest to the Minister that we need to ensure that
the framework focuses on equipping workers with the intended skill,
rather than just ticking
boxes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T18:04:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031261000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/debtext/130312-0003.htm#13031261000023">In
addition to the established industries, Thurrock also has an emerging
centre of excellence in the creative industries.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T18:04:50"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Minister saw this for himself only last week, when he visited the
new Backstage Centre, which will provide a great deal of training
through putting on live musical and theatrical events.
Th<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T18:05:16"></hs_TimeCode>e creative
industries are a growing sector, but it is also a sector that is
characterised by self-employment and small and medium-sized
enterprises. That is another area in which the Government really need
to do more work. It can be daunting for a sole trader to take on the
onus and responsibility of managing an apprentice, but the National
Skills Academy for Creative &amp; Cultural has provided a collective
framework to enable a number of SMEs and sole traders to come together
and offer training to young people. There is a need to pass on those
skills to other people if we are going to make the most of that growing
industry, in which Britain leads the world.</hs_Para>

want to highlight the example of a particular individual who is
currently going through his apprenticeship with the Royal Opera House.
Not all Members will know this, but the Royal Opera House’s
production park is in my constituency of Thurrock. Everything that
those Members who enjoy going to the opera see on stage has been made
in Thurrock—and very proud of that we are,
too<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T18:06:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031261000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/debtext/130312-0003.htm#13031261000025">The
Royal Opera House’s current apprentice is a young man named
Jamie Ashwell. He decided to take up the offer of an apprenticeship
rather than doing a stage management degree at university. For Jamie,
the choice was simple. He is working for a world-leading arts
organisation, getting experience of real projects and working with
leading practitioners in the industry—and he is being paid, to
boot. I envisage that, in the future, some of the strongest
apprenticeship places will be as hotly contested as some of our most
prestigious university

apprenticeship route also suits the Royal Opera House. It needs people
with real practical skills in the type of work that it does. People
with arts degrees who apply for jobs in its costume or make-up
departments,

offering apprenticeships, the Royal Opera House can train people up in
areas such as bespoke tailoring and wig-making—true crafts that

Mactaggart</B> (Slough) (Lab):</Member> I have had the privilege of
visiting the set-up at Thurrock, but there was one thing that I really
missed. Under the former future jobs fund, the Royal Opera House
created a programme that went wider than the apprenticeships as a way
of bringing in young people to learn the skills that the hon. Lady is
describing. It had a wonderful group of young people studying there as
a result of that scheme but, sadly, it is no longer available to young
people who would like to learn about working at the Royal Opera

Doyle-Price:</Member></B> The hon. Lady makes a good point, but the
Royal Opera House continues to engage in a really big outreach
programme involving local schools. She makes an important
point, however, because one of the ways of attracting young people and
demonstrating the opportunities afforded by apprenticeships is to open
their eyes. It has been pointed out that schools often place an
emphasis on universities, but we really need to ensure that they take
advantage of every opportunity to open young people’s eyes to
what is on offer.</hs_Para>

encourage the Minister to look at what more can be done to support the
efforts of smaller firms and, in particular, sole traders to offer
apprenticeships. We need to unlock and encourage the entrepreneurism in
those growing industries, and to look at the apprenticeship framework,

congratulate themselves on the renewed emphasis that we have placed on
this important way of providing our young people with the skills that
they need to make the best of themselves.</hs_Para>

Iain McKenzie</B> (Inverclyde) (Lab):</Member> As we have heard today
from Members on both sides of the House, the debate is extremely
welcome in what is currently a tough economic climate, especially for
young people. I shall refer not only to this apprenticeship week but to
the apprenticeship week that we shall celebrate in Scotland in May, so
I shall get two bites at the
cherry.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031261000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/debtext/130312-0003.htm#13031261000033">I
served a formal indentured apprenticeship. That meant that I was tied
to my employer for the first five years of my working life, for which I
received an extra £5 a week. I am therefore well aware of the
value of an apprenticeship, and I believe that it means more than just
learning a skill or trade. Like many other Members, I have been working
with companies in the constituency, encouraging them to consider taking
on more apprentices and starting apprenticeship programmes themselves.
It has been successful to a degree, and it is one of the reasons why we
in Inverclyde have so far escaped the worst ravages of youth
unemployment. That, however, is not the case in Scotland overall or, as
we have heard, 
<?notus-xml column=254?>in the United Kingdom as a whole, where youth unemployment has never
been higher. The country’s youth continue to bear the brunt of
the lack of jobs in the UK. We desperately need to get our young people
into training and apprenticeships. They must be given every possible
opportunity to improve and hone the skills that they require in order
to obtain jobs in the future.</hs_Para>

heard, the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee, in a report
published in the autumn of 2012, gave its backing to public procurement
to boost apprenticeships. That would create tens of thousands of jobs,
and would help to alleviate some of the vast youth unemployment that is
currently rife throughout the UK. I implemented a procurement policy in
2007, when I was leader of my council in Inverclyde, and that may be
where the Government got the idea. When we were renewing our school
estates, we saw the need not just to have new schools but to secure
jobs and apprenticeships for the pupils, and we wrote that into our
terms and conditions. It was very successful, which is one of the other
reasons why youth unemployment is being kept low in Inverclyde. It fell
then by over 20%. We asked firms not only to take on apprentices, but
to commit themselves to a percentage of local labour.</hs_Para>

private sector, I have been supporting technology, most recently the 4G
network. This week our local mobile phone company, Everything
Everywhere, announced the launch of 13 modern apprenticeships. It is
committed to continuing to employ young people, and to introducing an
apprenticeship programme that we hope will run for many years and give
them long-term
jobs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031261000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/debtext/130312-0003.htm#13031261000036">Another
initiative that has been extremely successful in Inverclyde is our
award-winning Recruit programme. As we have heard from many Members
today, schools need more than just brief career advice from industry.
We brought schools and industry together, and young people gave up
their time to participate in what was probably the longest interview
that they would ever have. The initiative has been running for more
than five years and has been extremely successful, putting tens of
young people into jobs and giving them the best possible start in life.
It has been replicated by some neighbouring authorities, and has been
seen across Scotland as a trail

some sectors, apprenticeships are not a new development, but have been
around for a long time. For many years plumbers, construction workers
and electricians have undertaken apprenticeships, whether centrally led

and earning money, all at the same time, is valuable and appealing to
many young people.</hs_Para>

have been much slower to cotton on. Some remain entirely in the dark.
It has been argued that companies are not taking on trainees because of
the difficulty of offering places when there is no set qualification to
work towards, but that has not actually been the case. I checked the
National Apprenticeship 
<?notus-xml column=255?>Service website today. The “types of apprenticeships” are
broken down into 10 categories covering everything from agriculture to
the arts and from leisure to law. There are now hundreds, if not
thousands, of different apprenticeships, which rather prompts the
question to the companies “What is

am happy to support today by wearing a similar pin. Sir
William is known for his straightforward ways; in his words,
“2.9 million publicly listed companies. 1.3 million unemployed
youths. You do the maths.” He seeks to motivate and inspire
organisations of all capacities to play their part in addressing the
needs and aspirations of the young. One flagship idea that he has
launched is that of “green champions”, whereby young
people are employed by large companies to promote sustainable building
management, and energy and resource efficiency practices. Given that
40% of the UK’s carbon emissions are down to the way in which
our buildings are lit, heated and run, it is easy to see how the green
champions could soon pay their own way. In 2009, the audit of
Government buildings—264 of them—found that they had an
average F rating, with only two Departments managing a rating of D or

Jamie Reed</B> (Copeland) (Lab):</Member> We should see apprenticeships
as one of the hallmarks of a good society. It is all well and
good—probably in a stereotypical fashion—to consider
apprenticeships to be the domain of blue-collar families. It is true
that decades ago securing a good apprenticeship with good employment
prospects was the pinnacle of achievement for many working-class
families. De-industrialisation changed the dynamic, as did the rise in
the number of students from working-class families attending
university, but the situation is changing again. Where we used to
describe young people from working-class families and communities as
“blue-collar”, admittedly using an American political
affectation, we should now see them not as blue-collar workers but as
blue-scholar workers from blue-scholar families. They understand the
need to learn constantly, to innovate and to change in order to keep
themselves, their families, their communities, and our country and its
economy among the world’s leaders. If we do not seek to provide
opportunities for these young people, their communities and their

apprenticeship schemes; we need an apprenticeship culture, which should
be embedded among our public and private sectors, and we should be able
to interchange between the two. Looking to the future, we have to
recognise that planning for economic growth and planning for economic
success is not the same as having a planned economy. The energy sector
will command billions of pounds of public money over a very long

others like it, which are in receipt of public investment, should
reciprocate with effective apprenticeship programmes.</hs_Para>

as we have the Minister here. We have talked about schools and I am

I work very closely with the secondary schools in Eastbourne, which are
very pro-apprenticeships, but they say, bluntly, “Stephen, there
is not a lot of point in our selling apprenticeships because we
don’t get any bonus for getting 100 apprenticeships.” I
urge the Minister to discuss that with
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T18:23:35"></hs_TimeCode> Secretary of

second issue is quality, particularly when expansion is so rapid, and
everybody recognises that we must keep an eye on that. I ask the
Minister to keep focusing on quality. In seven or eight years, if we
keep up our commitment to apprenticeships, they will have the same
gravitas as apprenticeships in Germany. We should not forget, however,
that some young people do not have the most academic education or
background, and we do not want to set the lower rung for
apprenticeships so high that they cannot get on to it. We must keep a
close eye on that.</hs_Para>

the challenges in the economic envelope, I urge the Government to keep
expanding the scheme over the next few years. Many SMEs have taken on

in Wales with £40 million being given by the Labour-led Welsh
Assembly for expanding apprenticeships. Has the Minister had the chance
to read the statement by the Welsh Assembly Minister announcing a
one-off payment of £500 to small and micro-businesses to
overcome the barriers to employing apprentices? I hope that he will

idea of apprentices always conjures up romantic images from the
’50s and ’60s of the draughtsman, the plumber
and the electrician taking a five-year apprenticeship. As much as I
welcome apprentices and apprenticeship week, I am concerned that a
number of people believe that they are following an apprenticeship when
they are doing nothing of the sort. It is not the regeneration of
apprenticeships, but the rebadging of apprenticeships. I think of
Morrisons as the largest employer of apprentices in this country. One
in 10 apprentices work at Morrisons, but what are they apprenticed to
do? What profession will they come out with? Is it a meat cutter, a
green grocer or a fishmonger? I do not know, and I hope that we will
look into that.</hs_Para>

have only a minute. At the moment we have box-ticking, and many
companies do not appreciate the worth of apprenticeships. I hope that
the Minister will look at the

apprenticeship, like a driving test. There is a qualification standard

Rotherham, we are particularly short of apprenticeship places for

this national apprenticeship week we want to see a commitment to using
the powers of Government to boost apprenticeship numbers

facing almost unprecedented challenges in the workplace. It is simply
not good enough that just 7% of young people see apprenticeships as a
post-GCSE alternative. It is not good enough that two thirds of large
companies do not provide an apprenticeship programme. It is not good
enough that the message on the ease of delivery of apprenticeships has
not got through to nine out of 10 small and medium-sized employers. We
must do better at making sure that the barriers in their way are
removed.</hs_Para>

trades that most of us recognise as being at the heart of an
apprenticeship programme and that will enable us to compete in the

providing apprenticeships at three, four or five times the rate

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Skills (Matthew
Hancock):</Member></B> It is a great pleasure to be here, in national
apprenticeship week, celebrating apprenticeships. We have had an
extremely positive debate, with almost all contributions being positive
and huge support on both sides of the House for apprenticeships.
Success has many fathers. We heard first the claim that apprenticeships
really got going in 1997. I had planned to say that they were in fact
first mentioned in Chaucer 651 years ago, but then we heard the even
greater claim from
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T18:48:31"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Tottenham (Mr Lammy) that they are as old as human
beings.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031261000106" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/debtext/130312-0004.htm#13031261000106">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T18:48:41"></hs_TimeCode>
has been a great national apprenticeship week so far. At 5.30 this
morning I was learning from Morrisons apprentices how to fillet fish,
and what brilliant apprentices they are. It is quite a skill they have
with knives—I certainly cannot match it. I have only one note of
mild disappointment, because the speech we just heard from
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T18:49:05"></hs_TimeCode> Opposition
Front Bench was rather disappointing. I thought that the hon. Member
for Westminster North (Ms Buck) sounded rather like the sultan of
scepticism or the Eeyore of apprenticeships, only seeing the worst and
determined to dampen, downgrade and darken the mood. But we will not
darken the mood, Mr Deputy Speaker, because apprenticeships are a cause
to celebrate, and celebrate them we
will.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031261000107" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/debtext/130312-0004.htm#13031261000107">Let
me turn to the many issues raised by Members across the Chamber. First,
careers advice is vital, as the Chairman of the Select Committee,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T18:49:34"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for West Bromwich West (Mr Bailey), said, as did the right hon. Member
for Tottenham, in a powerful speech, and
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T18:49:44"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Worcester (Mr Walker) and
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T18:49:49"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Inverclyde (Mr McKenzie). We have introduced a new
statutory duty on schools that came into force in September, and Ofsted
has said that it is making it a priority to consider that. The new
destination data that were brought in this summer not 
<?notus-xml column=266?>only highlight, as they have in the past, the proportion of pupils going
to university but, for the first time, publish for all schools the
proportion going into apprenticeships. That is an important step, as
Members in all parts of the House will recognise. We look forward to
Ofsted’s report in the summer on the implementation of the duty
to provide independent and impartial careers
advice<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T18:50:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031261000108" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/debtext/130312-0004.htm#13031261000108">The
second issue, which was raised by many Members, is the importance of
the link between youth unemployment and apprenticeships. It is a
scandal that youth unemployment is as high as it is, falling though it
may be, when there are skills shortages in key parts of our economy
such as engineering and computing. This shows that the linkage between
the education system and the skills system, on the one hand, and
employers, on the other, has not been strong enough. As
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T18:51:13"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Thurrock (Jackie Doyle-Price) so eloquently explained,
increasing that employer focus is a vital part of the reforms that we
are pursuing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T18:51:18"></hs_TimeCode>.
Another<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T18:51:48"></hs_TimeCode> part of
those reforms is the introduction of traineeships so that as
apprenticeships become more rigorous and more high-quality, there is a
programme of support, alongside the DWP programmes, to make sure that
people get the skills they need, including in English, maths and work
preparation, to get a good job and to hold down a
job<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T18:51:39"></hs_TimeCode>.

West (Mike Crockart)
and<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T18:51:44"></hs_TimeCode> for
Eastbourne (Stephen Lloyd) also talked about the link between youth
unemployment and apprenticeships. Several Members mentioned their local
jobs clubs, and I wish them well. I am having a jobs club in Newmarket

third issue is how much apprenticeships are valued. The Chair of the
Select Committee mentioned the recently published statistic that, on
average, a higher apprenticeship increases lifetime earnings by
£150,000. Let that figure go out there and let us all present

norm in our country whereby school leavers go to university or into an
apprenticeship so that we have a high-skilled economy and a
high-skilled work force, not only so that every individual can reach
their potential—their personal best—but so that our
economy can compete in the global race. I am glad to see cross-party

Members discussed the cross-party desire for parity of esteem among

quality. We need to increase quality throughout the apprenticeship

steps to increase quality: we have insisted that people need
to continue with English and maths if they do not have a C grade at
GCSE, and have said that there needs to be a minimum of a year in
almost all circumstances and a job as part of an apprenticeship. The
removal of programme-led apprenticeships has taken out 18,000
apprenticeship places, which is a far higher number than that for the
decrease in apprenticeships for 16 to 19-year-olds over the past year.
Under the previous Government some apprenticeships did not
involve a job, so apprentices were training with no prospect of a job,
and astonishingly, some apprenticeships involved jobs without training.
At their heart, apprenticeships are about earning and learning at the
same time. Increasing quality is vital and I will not apologise for

progression from level 2 to levels 3, 4 and beyond to new

petition signed by hundreds of my constituents, who, like me, are
concerned about the increasing number of food banks up and down the
country and about the fact that the number of people visiting food
banks has increased dramatically since last year. I visited a food bank
in my constituency, the i58 project, run by a local church, and was
astounded to find out that it had dealt with more than 1,000 people
since last September. It assumed that demand for assistance would peak
around Christmas, but that has not happened, and the numbers have
continued to escalate. It was asked to sign this petition on the
ongoing problems facing constituents having to attend food banks to
make it through the week on their low incomes or benefits. The

and the growing number of people in the UK in the 21st century having
to resort to them to feed themselves and their families. I pay tribute
to the organisations that run food banks, such as the Trussell Trust,
but particularly to the Gate, which operates a food bank in Alloa, and
to Activ8 and WISH—women in sport and health—which do
likewise in Sauchie, both in my constituency, and for which I am

too, wish to present a petition on food banks on behalf of my
constituents. The signatures were collected in the centre of Leith, a
part of my constituency where, according to the latest figures, up to
30% of the population are income deprived and below the poverty line.
Unsurprisingly, it is also where Edinburgh’s latest food bank is
being set up. I pay tribute to those in the community who are helping
to set it up and deal with the growing crisis of hunger that is
affecting so many of our citizens, particularly families with children.
Those setting up the food bank, like those who signed the petition,
also want the UK and Scottish Governments to take action to ensure that
no families go hungry.</hs_Para>

overwhelming wish is to maintain the islands’ status as a
British overseas territory. The referendum was not some crude public
relations stunt, as the Argentine Government sought to portray it. The
islanders organised it not to indulge themselves in establishing the
obvious, but to send the clearest possible message to those who either
do not know or do not care about what future they want. Today’s

Arena, the Ponds Forge international swimming and diving complex and
some great community sports facilities. Given their reputations, we
have secured more investment over the years, with the establishment of
the English Institute of Sport and iceSheffield. Such investment has
delivered a huge return. For example, we have beaten the trend
nationally in increasing swimming participation and in engagement in
other sports. The facilities at Don Valley have inspired a generation

investment in sport has also demonstrated economic benefits. In the
first 12 years of the new facilities, sporting events brought in almost
640,000 visitors  to the city and more than £46 million,

therefore, it is ironic and deeply disappointing that barely six months

very, very much hope that the local council, when they consider this,
this afternoon, realise that London 2012 has created a unique
opportunity for sport in this county, and I know it’s tough, and
I know it’s difficult, and I know there are no easy answers, but
it would be a huge, huge shame—it’s such an emblematic

need to be clear, however, that the responsibility for the closure lies
not with the city council but with the Government, who have given it no
alternative. The stadium costs the council £700,000 a year to
run. It is a national asset and, as the Sports Minister said, “
an emblematic facility”, but its costs are borne by one council.
When the council is being forced to take £1.6 million
out of libraries and £3.5 million out of early years, there are
no easy options. Over the past two years Sheffield city council has
been forced to make £140 million of cuts due to Government
policy, with a further £50 million in both this year
and
next<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T09:36:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031229000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/halltext/130312h0001.htm#13031229000017">The
cuts are unfairly targeted at cities such as Sheffield. That is why the
Bishops of Sheffield and of Hallam, together with other faith leaders
and community and voluntary sector leaders, have launched the campaign
for “A Fair Deal for Sheffield”. In 2011-12 alone,
Sheffield council’s revenue spending power reduced by
£47.5 million or 8.15%, while Richmond upon Thames,
which by any measure is a much wealthier part of the country, had a cut
of a mere £1 million or 0.61%. If the Sports Minister were
present, he might find it hard to appreciate the impact that that level
of cuts can have. His constituency 
<?notus-xml column=3?>covers parts of the boroughs of Swale and Maidstone. Their cuts per
person between 2010-11 and 2014-15 are £73
and £51, respectively, far less than the £200 cut per
person imposed on Sheffield

of that severity mean that Sheffield city council and many other local

to a stage where it doesn’t suddenly require a huge bill at the

trust is the charity that runs Don Valley and our other major
facilities on behalf of the council through our operating subsidiary,
Sheffield International Venues. As a trust and a city, we maintained
Don Valley to the highest standards. There is absolutely no lack of
investment, and there has been no decline over 20 years. I have the
capital and maintenance budgets for the last five years, which show
that £1.6 million was invested in keeping it as a top
international stadium. There is a capital requirement in forward costs,
not because of under-investment, but simply because it is sensible to
anticipate future
need.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031229000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/halltext/130312h0001.htm#13031229000023">It

Minister<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T09:40:05"></hs_TimeCode> who

council to keep the stadium open. It is perhaps reassuring to know that
the Liberal Democrats are consistent in a perverse sort of way. They
are now against closing it, but they were opposed to opening it in the
first place. The Deputy Prime Minister’s arithmetic does not
stack up. He argued that one-off closure costs could be offset against
running costs simply to delay the closure, leaving no money to deal

to maintain services, it is increasingly difficult for them to support
and sustain facilities such as Don Valley. We need a national strategic
plan for sports facilities and for the Government to work with councils
to keep facilities such as Don Valley open and genuinely to help to

Government have given the council no alternative to the existing use of
Don Valley, but the council is looking at alternatives to provide a

nearby Woodbourn Road athletics track to provide good-quality outdoor
facilities in partnership with local athletics clubs at a much lower
cost. It invited my predecessor, Richard Caborn, who is also one of the
Sports Minister’s predecessors, to look at alternatives for the
site. He has been in discussion with the two universities, Sheffield
college, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Sheffield
city region local enterprise partnership, the Baker Dearing Trust and
Sport England to explore the creation of a new advanced sports and
well-being park to provide comprehensive delivery of the Olympic legacy

adding an indoor straight at Woodbourn road to the facilities that the
council is planning, and by linking to a medical devices advanced
manufacturing research centre and a life sciences university technical
college. This morning, at a press conference at the English Institute

the city centre was also magnificently restored as part of the cultural
events for the games. Some £147 million was spent not just on a
one-off occasion, but for the people of Sheffield to enjoy, which they
have done for the last 22 years. They have done so as spectators and
participants, and just by looking at the stadium, because its
architecture is
magnificent.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031229000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/halltext/130312h0001.htm#13031229000031">Don
Valley was part of the city’s regeneration, and we must remember
where we were at in the late 1980s when we thought about building
sporting facilities for the event. Sheffield city had gone through a
horrendous time and had lost 40,000 steel engineering jobs in the Don
valley alone, and that had a cataclysmic effect on the city, its
industrial structure and its social life. Doing something new and
showing that new things could be built on the rubble of the old steel
works was extremely important in changing the city’s psychology
and thinking about moving forward rather than reflecting on what had
gone before in our proud history and heritage in steel engineering,
although that is still alive with major companies and organisations
such as the advanced manufacturing research centre keeping us at the
forefront of new technology. Don Valley stadium is about not just
sporting events, but physical and psychological
regeneration.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031229000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/halltext/130312h0001.htm#13031229000032">Don
Valley has seen many great athletic events. It has seen world champions
compete, and it has been home to Jessica Ennis, a local Sheffield girl.
I was fortunate to be at the Olympics on the first day of her
competition and saw what she had achieved, which was great. It was
emotional, and when she came to thank the people of Sheffield she made
it clear that she had not had to go abroad to access top-quality
training facilities because they were available in Sheffield, and that
she was proud to have used those facilities. We understand that, and I
feel a personal attachment to the Don Valley stadium for a variety of
reasons.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031229000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/halltext/130312h0001.htm#13031229000033">Some
people ask why we did not think in advance about whether the stadium
would ultimately have sufficient use to justify its existence. At the
time and before it was built, we talked to Sheffield football clubs
about the potential for them to move into it afterwards. That is
recorded in minutes that are now in the Sheffield archives. Sheffield
Wednesday said from the beginning that it was not interested, but we
talked to directors of Sheffield United, who expressed an initial
interest, but eventually decided that it was not for them to continue
and they wanted to redevelop Bramall Lane. That was entirely 
<?notus-xml column=6?>the proper decision for the football club to take, but it shows that we
did not simply dismiss the possibilities for other uses at some stage
in the future. It simply was not going to happen, and all the issues
around the future of the athletics stadium in Manchester, and in
relation to the Olympic stadium in London, showed that that is not an
easy way forward.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T09:50:21"></hs_TimeCode>However, we have
had Sheffield Eagles play there and Rotherham United for a period of
time, which helped keep the club going, so the stadium has had other
uses over the
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T09:50:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031229000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/halltext/130312h0001.htm#13031229000034">The
reality is that it costs £700,000 a year to maintain the
stadium, which still provides superb training facilities and a base for
many community activities, but no longer gets major national or
international events. At a time of real funding cuts for the local
council in Sheffield, can we continue to afford a national and
international venue, when national and international events do not come
there? That is a major question. We have to say to both the Government
and the national sporting bodies that if they want a national stadium
to hold national and international events, there has to be national
support for it. Clearly, there is no sign or evidence that that is the
case and that the Government want to come forward with
assistance.</hs_Para>

us make this clear: unlike Manchester and the Commonwealth games, for
which the Labour Government at the time provided an awful lot of
support, Sheffield funded the world student games itself. All the costs
have been borne by the people of Sheffield. Good facilities have been
provided for our people, as well as national facilities, so we are
truly a national and international sporting city.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T09:51:51"></hs_TimeCode> £147
million was paid by the people of Sheffield. The only bit of Government
support that we got—I gave him credit at the time, and have done
since—was from the then Minister, David Trippier, who gave an
urban development grant to help renovate the flats that formed the
basis of the student village. Those flats are still in use today, but
that is the situation that we face.</hs_Para>

will make a passing reference to the situation of the Liberal
Democrats, which is even more convoluted than
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T09:52:27"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Sheffield Central gave them credit for. They voted in
favour of the games to begin with. When the facilities, including the
Don Valley stadium, were half built, they changed their mind and voted
against them—what they were going to do with the half-built
stadium I am not quite sure. They have since voted twice to remortgage
the facilities and use the money on the remortgage for other things,
and then blamed the cost of the games for £650 million of debt,
which is nonsense. The games never had £650 million of
debt—that includes a roll-up of interest and the two remortgages
used for other purposes, not even for the facilities themselves. The
Liberal Democrats were then in favour of Government cuts, which is
forcing the council into its current financial position, and then they
were in favour of keeping the stadium open, without saying what else
they would cut instead. That is a pretty consistent position—for
the Liberal Democrats—to be in over a period of
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T09:53:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031229000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/halltext/130312h0001.htm#13031229000037">That
is the current situation for the council. The facts are clear: more
than £200 million of cuts need to be made. There will be library
closures and cuts to advice centres and early years provision. We are
on alternate weekly collections for our refuse. I am sure that the
Minister will tell us how awful that is—at least reflecting 
<?notus-xml column=7?>the views of the Secretary of State on matters so dear to his heart.
However, the council has to do those things to
balance its books.</hs_Para>

all have our examples; I like the one about Windsor. There have been
cuts of £200 a head for the people of Sheffield, but £40
a head for the people of Windsor. I know that historically, Windsor has
had less grant, but it has also had fewer needs and more resources,
which is why northern cities are getting bigger cuts—they have
more grant to cut. Why? Historically, they have had greater needs. They
still have greater needs and fewer resources, but they are still being
penalised. Given the council’s position, it is very difficult to
see how we can justify—despite the stadium’s history, the
attachment that I feel to it, and all the good things that it has done
for Sheffield—keeping the Don Valley stadium.
Of<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T09:54:27"></hs_TimeCode> course, the
rest of the world student games legacy will be there—the Lyceum
theatre, the Arena, Ponds Forge, Hillsborough leisure centre, Graves

is important that we do not simply stand still. We can have our
disagreements with the Minister about Government funding, and we will
no doubt continue to. We can all hold our heads in our hands and say,
“Woe is me. We can’t do much about it”. However,
the fact that Sheffield has a can-do attitude is shown by Richard
Caborn, the former sports Minister, who still is very much my friend,
and who is leading a group of people with the support of the council,
the local enterprise partnership and the two universities, to look at
bold and imaginative potential regeneration, involving rugby and other
sports, the college, and a link-up with universities on sports
medicine. With those sorts of things, we can really look to the future.
It is not merely about combining sports, medicine and education
together, but about that acting as another powerful vehicle for
regeneration of the area.</hs_Para>

the area regenerated.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T09:56:22"></hs_TimeCode> ending of

important that we use it constructively and keep the links with sport.

should look at the regional growth fund and other potential sources,

Government, to take the area forward. We can say, “Don Valley,
you have performed a great service for our people in Sheffield. You

I also pay tribute to

the Member for Sheffield South East (Mr Betts). Don Valley stadium is

want to direct most of my contribution to two specific areas of
sporting provision in Sheffield: local leisure facilities and sporting
provisions in schools, both of which are key elements of sports
provision not only in the city but across the country, especially for
young people. Unfortunately, both are under attack, because of the
self-defeating scale of the austerity being implemented by the
coalition Government. However, before I venture into discussing those
areas, I would like to briefly reiterate some points made by my
Sheffield colleagues.</hs_Para>

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T09:58:24"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Sheffield South East, we have, as he said, a former
leader of Sheffield city council. Although he would not say so himself,
more than anyone else, he and Councillor Peter Price, who was deputy
leader of the council at the time, are responsible not only for making
Sheffield the country’s first city of sport, but for the
construction of the original three facilities—Ponds Forge, Don
Valley stadium and Sheffield Arena. As my hon. Friend mentioned, there
were also other facilities, such as Hillsborough leisure centre. All
were built for the world student games in 1991.</hs_Para>

people’s opinions of the staging of those games—I have
always been consistent in supporting them, the investment that they
brought with them and what they have achieved—I want to pay
tribute to both my hon. Friend and Councillor Peter Price for the
foresight and leadership that they showed, not only in taking the city
of Sheffield through some very difficult times, but in developing a new
future for it as a major sporting city. Anyone who remembers the lower
Don valley at it was when the steelworks had gone can only agree that
it was a major achievement to put in place Don Valley stadium and all
the other infrastructure that has developed on a major scale around it.
In later years, and thanks to the investment put in place by the Labour
Government, Sheffield added the English Institute of Sport and
iceSheffield to its portfolio. Of course, iceSheffield and the EIS are
in effect next door to Don Valley. We now have an impressive array of
facilities in the city. Because of that, as my hon. Friend the Member
for Sheffield South
East<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T09:59:43"></hs_TimeCode> said, we
have managed to stage national and international events, from grand
prix athletics—Kelly Holmes made her last ever appearance at the
Don Valley stadium; I was there on the day—to world swimming
events. The national junior swimming championships were held at Ponds
Forge only the weekend before
last.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031229000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/halltext/130312h0001.htm#13031229000046">As
a result of these investments, Sheffield became the first city of sport
in 1995. It has seen rates of participation in sport rise—by
almost 6% just in the past three years, 3.5% above the national
average. One in seven of Britain’s Olympic athletes for 2012
trained at some point in Sheffield’s facilities. Of course, the
pin-up girl for Team GB, Jess Ennis, comes from the city and developed
her talent in Sheffield’s facilities. I pay tribute to her for
being announced as world sportswoman of the year 
<?notus-xml column=9?>only last night, and I place on the record our congratulations to Jess
on that achievement. Next week, she will rightly be given the freedom

all the developments I have mentioned came at a cost—one that

Sheffield Central pointed out. We are still bearing the cost, but the
cuts being made now to Sheffield’s local government budget makes
it all but impossible to keep all the facilities open. In that context,
the decision to close Don Valley stadium is inevitable. That is
something that Lord Coe sympathised with yesterday. He made it clear
that he entirely understood the reasons why the council has taken the
decision that it

even if the Government’s funding decisions are so careless of
the legacy made possible by Sheffield’s investment and by the
investment in elite sport put in place by the previous, Labour
Government, it is clear that Sheffield is not, hence the alternative
proposal now being shaped and taken forward by Richard Caborn, an
ex-Sports Minister with a record second to none. I therefore echo the
challenges laid down by my hon. Friends; we need to see the Government
supporting Sheffield as it attempts to secure its future as a provider
of opportunities for elite sport. I look forward to hearing the

summer of 2012 was probably the greatest summer of sport that this
country has ever witnessed, but Team GB’s success in both sets
of games—the Paralympic games and the ordinary, if I can call

year. To develop and nurture the talent that blossomed so beautifully
last August and September takes many years. Often—in fact,
nearly always—future Olympians start their sport as youngsters,
taking up their interest at local facilities and in local schools. It
is the cuts in funding for those local opportunities that lead many of
us to fear that 2012 might have been a false dawn—a high

long-term renaissance of British

are hearing of local authorities closing leisure facilities throughout
the country. For many, the choice is unenviable—close a leisure
facility or cut back on adult care or another statutory service. A
significant number of local authorities are seeing 30% reductions in

its budget. Next year’s budget, as from April of this year, will
see another £50 million cut as the council attempts to balance
the books and, in common with what is happening in many other local
authority areas, it is leisure and sports facilities that are finding
themselves in the firing

example is Stocksbridge leisure centre, in my constituency. The centre
was paid for by public subscription by local people and opened in 1970.
It was a genuine case of local people clubbing together to provide
their own facilities—the big society, if you like. However, the
local council, because of the financial pressures that it finds itself
under, has decided that it will no longer fund the subsidy required to
keep the facility open. That is  a not inconsiderable sum; it
is about £400,000 a year. People will agree that the centre is
expensive to run, but most will agree that it still provides a
critically important service to the local community. That point was
agreed 
<?notus-xml column=10?>by Sport England itself only yesterday. Sport England has produced a
report on sports facilities in the town and has made it clear that
there is a need for a facility along the lines of what is already in

good reason, local people have been concerned—indeed, very
angry—about the proposal to close the leisure centre. An
impressive working group, led by a very capable and dedicated local
businesswoman, has opened negotiations with the council on an
alternative way forward. I remain hopeful that the council can find a
way of keeping the current facility open for a period long enough for
the development of a sustainable plan for the future of sports
provision in the town. However, that will not be easy, given the scale
of the cuts faced by the local

worst funding settlement for local government in our lifetimes. They
are the big society writ large. It is not only the local authority that
owes them, but the Government. They are doing that not just because
they understand the importance of sport for the health of their
children or because they understand that children should be given the
opportunity to learn to swim. They are also doing it because they know
that youngsters living in their community may well have the potential

the area surrounding Stocksbridge is home to the world downhill biking
champion. Already, it has strengths in key areas such as rock climbing,
mountain biking and cycling more generally. But, who knows, perhaps the
real tragedy will be that if this facility closes, the country loses
the next Rebecca Adlington or Sharron Davies. That may happen if the
community loses the facility. The council and the community need to
find a way forward, and these transitions are never cost-free. Whether
or not the way forward is a refurbishment of the current facility or
the building of a brand-new facility that is cheaper to run and managed

<?notus-xml column=11?>There is clearly a problem relating to small, isolated communities such
as Stocksbridge. Although the trend towards creating fewer and larger
facilities to cover any given area may well be fine for densely
populated areas, for rural or semi-rural communities the model falls
short of what is

am therefore adding to the requests that we are making today of the
Minister. After all, if we are asking for Government support to find a
way forward on Don Valley, clearly it is also imperative that we ask
for effective Government support for communities such as Stocksbridge.
Will the Minister recognise that point, and will he commit today to
looking at the issue and to trying to establish the transitional funds
necessary to enable communities and local authorities, working
together, to remould their current sports provision in order to develop
sustainable solutions to the funding challenges building up in rural
and semi-rural areas? It is often forgotten that south Yorkshire is
broadly rural. Sheffield is to a large extent rural; one third of the
city is in the national park. This is not only an issue for the south
of England—Sussex or Kent—it matters as much to south
Yorkshire as anywhere else. We may be metropolitan, but we are in some
aspects fundamentally rural.</hs_Para>

England itself agrees. Its report, issued only yesterday, on the sports
facilities in Stocksbridge makes it clear that while it is important to
deal with the current situation by developing new district sports
centres—there is a clear idea in Sheffield about what those
centres might look like—areas such as Stocksbridge need local,
albeit small, facilities due to their
isolation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031229000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/halltext/130312h0001.htm#13031229000061">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T10:10:59"></hs_TimeCode>
shall conclude with one more point. The funding problems faced by
sports facilities in areas such as Sheffield are being made a whole lot
worse because of the coalition Government’s decision to cut
funding for school sport partnerships. The £162 million cut to
the school sport partnership programme, alongside cuts  to
specialist sports colleges, was a devastating blow to sport in schools.
It means that 60% less time is now being spent on organising school
sport than was once the case. Almost half of local authorities have
recorded a decrease in the number of school sport partnerships
operating, with a staggering one-third of local authorities having no
school sport partnerships in operation. Under the previous Government,
record investment in school sport saw huge increases in participation,
in both competitive and non-competitive sport. The last school sport
survey, in 2009-10, found that 78% of pupils took part in intra-school
competitive activities, up from 58% in 2006-07. Unfortunately, the
current Government do not see sport in the same way, but I would be
pleased to hear the Minister prove me wrong on that. They have even
axed the two-hour participation target, claiming that it was just a
box-ticking exercise.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13031229000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/halltext/130312h0001.htm#13031229000062"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T10:12:27"></hs_TimeCode>London
2012 was a glorious achievement. It built on the success we enjoyed in
Beijing. It did not, however, happen by accident. It happened first and
foremost because of the impressive performances turned in by a talented
generation of athletes, but they could not and would not have achieved
that success without funding from Government and political will from
the Government of the day to achieve great things. However, sport is
not solely about winning medals; it is about competing, a healthy
lifestyle and having fun. When we, as a nation, 
<?notus-xml column=12?>should be investing in physical activity to alleviate the obesity
crisis, the Government are instead doing the opposite. Cuts to local
authorities will inevitably fall disproportionately on our sports
facilities—Sheffield is not an isolated case. The Local
Government Association has produced a report that says that there is
evidence of more participation, but the worst of the funding cuts have
yet to come, and if the facilities are not there, participation levels
will decrease. Sheffield’s participation rates will almost
certainly decrease if both facilities—Don Valley and
Stocksbridge—close. Cuts to sporting bodies and Sport England
will affect elite and non-elite sport. The cumulative impact of the
cuts will, I fear, mean that instead of the London Olympics being the
springboard for greater things, they will be seen merely as the high
water mark, with a steep decline in performance on the international
scene<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T10:14:01"></hs_TimeCode> to

the summer, I had two amazing weeks in London, and being a proper
Yorkshire person, that is not something I say lightly. The first
amazing week was at the beginning of August, when I was privileged to
be there on super Saturday to see athletes win three gold medals,
including Sheffield’s very own Jessica Ennis. A month later, I
had tickets to the Paralympics, and I was there on thriller Thursday to
see another great Yorkshire woman, Hannah Cockroft, and two other
brilliant athletes win golds. We know that the wonderful stadium in
which I spent much of my amazing time in London is struggling to
continue and cannot continue only as an athletics stadium. The facts of
life mean that athletics stadiums are very difficult to support, and
yet Don Valley has kept going through the will of the people of
Sheffield for more than 20 years, but that involves a
subsidy of £700,000 a year, which is no longer
sustainable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031229000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/halltext/130312h0001.htm#13031229000065">Don<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T10:15:53"></hs_TimeCode>

the Member for Sheffield Central said, although the stadium is in
Sheffield, it is a national asset. The previous Government and the
current Government were both clear and determined that the legacy of
2012 should not just be a legacy for London. In many areas of
life—transport, communication, media or whatever—the
majority of money is spent in the region we are in now. If we want to
be one nation— dare I say it?—money should be
available and spent in  the north.</hs_Para>

hon. Friends the Members for Penistone and Stocksbridge and for Eltham
(Clive Efford) have often spoken about school sport partnerships,
because legacy is not only about facilities, but about our investment
in young people. For a couple of minutes I want to focus on the effect
of the cut to school sport partnerships funding to Sheffield. Prior to
the cuts, Sheffield had four thriving partnerships, each working
closely with their schools, providing training, development, resources,
curriculum support, coaching, competition and participation events for
them. A key feature of the work was the network that supported it: the
profile of PE and sport in school was raised and time was given to
release a member of primary staff to assist the process, to enable
valuable development work to take place. We now understand, more than
ever, that getting children active from primary is key to keeping them
active through life.</hs_Para>

the removal of funding, partnerships have been forced to set up as
private enterprises, which means that they are no longer directly
funding. Schools have had to make tough decisions, when their budgets
are under pressure, on whether they can afford to buy in the service
for their children.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13031229000070" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/halltext/130312h0001.htm#13031229000070"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T10:19:48"></hs_TimeCode>Not
only did the funding end in 2011, but so did the PE and sports strategy
for young people, which supported the partnerships’ work. As
part of the strategy, partnerships undertook a full audit annually to
monitor the engagement of their schools in PE and sporting activity. It
is a bit disingenuous of the Government, while we are trying to
encourage participation, to say, “As part of our cuts to
paperwork, partnerships will no longer have to monitor that.”
Some of us might think that that is just a way of covering up the fact
that, as we know, participation will decrease.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13031229000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/halltext/130312h0001.htm#13031229000071"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T10:20:27"></hs_TimeCode>During
the school sports partnerships era, schools that were previously
unengaged became more engaged, as they had dedicated funding to do so.
As soon as the funding went, along with the network, the engaged
schools continued to be involved at some level, but less-interested
schools started to become unengaged once more. That impacts most
greatly on families in which PE and sports are not common parts of
their daily life and on families that are financially
constrained<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T10:29:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031229000072" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/halltext/130312h0001.htm#13031229000072">An
important part of the partnerships was that there were clear links
between schools and clubs in the community. I know from my constituency
that although clubs were available—some are not that expensive,
such as the Beauchief tennis club—families were not used to
going there, so the link was not made. The school sports 
<?notus-xml column=14?>partnership identified children who were interested and keen and helped
them into the local clubs. The removal of the funding has therefore
been a huge blow. In some areas of Sheffield, provision has started to
disappear. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T10:21:38"></hs_TimeCode>As my

the Member for Sheffield South East was on Sheffield city council,
Sheffield was showing the way for planning for sport for a generation.
We have all celebrated what has gone on in Sheffield over the past
year, but it did not come either cheaply or at a moment’s
notice. It started back in the 1980s, when Sheffield planned for the
World student games. It has built on that legacy, showing an innovative
way of approaching sports development—years ahead of other local
authorities. It planned to have not just a centre of excellence for
sport, but a place where major entertainment events could take place
and to use the income generated from that to cross-subsidise a
state-of-the-art sports facility.</hs_Para>

has caught up with that; competition from other venues has meant that
it has not been possible to sustain that business plan over many years.
However, if the people of Sheffield look back, they will see that they
have been extremely well served by the forward thinking of the people
who planned the student games and the facilities back then. Last year
showed what that sort of long-term planning can deliver. The Olympics
were a great event not only for London, but for places such as
Sheffield, which have been providing state-of-the-art facilities for
our best athletes to train in so that they could compete at the top of
their sport and bring an enormous amount of national pride to the
United Kingdom. We all owe a debt of gratitude to the pioneers back in
the 1980s who planned for the student games and delivered a legacy for
us last year. That is why it is important that we support their
endeavours in

are—I choose my words carefully—not appropriate. It is
difficult to make a fair comparison between some of the metropolitan
city councils in the north that get a per dwelling spend of around
£3,500 to £3,700 with a council such as the one in the
Prime Minister’s west Oxfordshire constituency, which has a per
dwelling spend of £1,800, or even to  a council in a
constituency such as mine, which has a couple of the most deprived
wards in the country, and has one of the highest per dwelling spends in
Norfolk, but is still only at £2,200. It is wholly inappropriate
to compare such authorities, and the changes in their expenditure, to
authorities that get substantially more in the first place because
their baseline is much higher.</hs_Para>

addition, more than £100 million of lottery and public funding

£500,000 is being invested in youth sport over the next five
years through the youth sport strategy, with £150 million being
invested through the Places People Play programme to upgrade
1,000 local sports venues. Some 15.5 million people aged 16
and over are now playing sport at least once a week, which is 750,000
more than a year ago and 1.57 million more than when London won the
Olympic and Paralympic bid. In the current economic climate that is a

all schools are taking part. Indeed, the national finals are being held
in Sheffield this year. The programme is getting young people to play
sport regularly and not creating bureaucratic, top-down networks.
However, we must not be complacent. We share the desire to inspire a
generation to take up and enjoy sport throughout their lives. I can

sport will be made

the specifics of Government spending and the legacy for Sheffield,
naturally nobody wants to see a sports facility close, but local
authorities need to make tough decisions to ensure that they are
providing the best possible services to all their communities, and that
includes strategic management of the public estate at a cost that is
affordable within their budget constraints. The hon. Member for Eltham
alluded to how much money is out there, but the reality is we are
having to deal with the previous Government’s atrocious legacy
of deficit and debt, so we must start to live within our means. Local
government accounts for around a quarter of public expenditure, so it
has its part to play in this process. That is why councils must make
decisions about what they are doing and how best they provide
facilities for local people. I suspect that is also why Lord Coe
himself has said, in support of the decisions that Sheffield city
council has to make, that he understands why a local authority must
look at these situations and make decisions.</hs_Para>

Therefore, it is for Sheffield city council to make the decision about
which of these facilities they can afford and to justify that decision
to their people locally, without central Government dictating whether
it is a right or wrong decision.</hs_Para>

various people, whose opinions and good advice I sought before this

archaeological investigations in my constituency. The licence issued to
the Leicester archaeologists contained broadly the same terms as a
licence that would normally be issued to any archaeological society or
group with a decent reason to dig. It mentioned “persons
unknown”. If a mediaeval tailor had been found, it might have
been appropriate to keep his remains in the county archaeological
museum in Leicester or to rebury them nearby. In the case of a
king’s remains, reburial is absolutely necessary. The remains
should not be kept in a museum in Leicester or anywhere else. The state

Gentleman suggests, but it is a constructive idea, and it is entirely
consistent with my view that we should look at ways to bring together
people from York and Leicester, rather than set them against each

Government have the power to amend the licence; indeed, they frequently
amend licences. Back in the 1980s, when the York Archaeological Trust
was excavating at Jewbury, in York, the plans were changed as a result
of representations from orthodox Jews, who took the view that the
Jewish skeletons that were discovered should be reburied quickly, in
line with Jewish practice. Four years ago, the Ministry, under the
previous Administration, issued advice that, generally speaking, human
remains should be reburied quickly. However, that has been found to be
impractical in some cases, because it impedes archaeologists’
scientific examination of the remains. The Ministry has therefore

examinations.</hs_Para>

Yorkshire dales. Richard also spent some of the best years of his life
as his elder brother’s lieutenant in Yorkshire, and he clearly
identified himself with the city of York and its minster. He drew much
of his support and power base from York and Yorkshire. In return, York
clearly held a very special position in his heart, and that was

for York Central did, by congratulating the university of Leicester,
the city of Leicester and the Richard III Society on an outstanding
research project that has brought history alive to so many. I note that
the archaeology journal <I>Current Archaeology</I> has hailed the
search for Richard III as its archaeological project of the year. I
therefore congratulate all those who have been directly or indirectly
involved in the project on the remarkable results that their work has
achieved.</hs_Para>

has concentrated on the licence. By way of background, the Ministry of
Justice has responsibility for burial law and policy. The law is old
and well established. Under section 25 of the Burial Act 1857,
exhumation of human remains is permitted only with a licence from the
Secretary of State. In this case the project was a joint venture
between the university of Leicester, Leicester city council and the
Richard III Society and all three parties contributed towards the
excavation. All have, as I understand it, been involved in the
application for the licence. The director of the university of
Leicester archaeological services applied for a licence on 31 August
last year and it was granted on 3 September. I emphasise that the
application was treated in the same way as any other archaeological
application would be. Such applications do not require the consent of
the next of kin as they are invariably for unnamed remains buried a
long time ago. The Secretary of State has a broad discretion to issue
exhumation licences and may attach any conditions considered
appropriate. Those invariably include conditions on where the remains
should be reinterred, as well as that the remains should be treated
with due care and attention to decency. In this case, as the hon.
Member for York Central made clear, the licence gave permission to
exhume up to six sets of remains, one of which could be those of King
Richard
III.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031231000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/halltext/130312h0001.htm#13031231000045">A
project of this nature clearly required a significant degree of
contingency planning. The director of the project thought that it was
unlikely that the king’s remains would be found. Nevertheless,
the application carefully considered the various possibilities and what
would happen in the unlikely event that the remains were uncovered. It
therefore indicated various options for reburial, which were dependent
on what was eventually
found.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031231000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/halltext/130312h0001.htm#13031231000046">The
hon. Member for York Central made reference to the tests that were
carried out. On 4 February, the announcement was made that the remains
were indeed those of King Richard III, as it was put beyond reasonable
doubt. In its application to the Secretary of State, the university
indicated that it intended to reinter the remains in Leicester
cathedral, which is one of the possible locations the licence mentions.
The licence actually states that the remains are to be
deposited</hs_Para>

conditions attached to the licence were therefore very broad,
envisaging both that the remains might be those of Richard III but
also, as was thought last summer, that they might not be. Now that the
exhumation has been completed, it is the university of
Leicester’s responsibility as holder of the licence to decide
where the remains are finally laid to rest. That is the law.</hs_Para>

made, not least today, of the fact that the people of York want Richard
III’s remains to be buried in York, and I understand the
strength of feeling in York and in Yorkshire more widely. However, I
should make it clear that York minster has openly supported the
reinterment of the remains in Leicester cathedral. It is also right to
point out that the default position of the Church of
England—the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T11:28:22"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Leicester South (Jonathan Ashworth) made this
point—is that the remains should be interred at the nearest

cathedral.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031231000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/halltext/130312h0001.htm#13031231000049">As
I have said, the conditions of the licence were widely drawn. They gave
a wide discretion on where the remains could be reinterred. The licence
stated that</hs_Para>

can be amended, but that is unusual. The university of Leicester could
apply to vary the terms of the licence if it wanted to. However, the
broad terms of the licence allow it to reinter the remains effectively
where it wants, with due regard to decency and the dignity of the
deceased. It is right that the state has an interest in that, but our
interest must surely be that there is a suitable location for the
remains. I do not think that the hon. Member for York Central is
arguing that Leicester cathedral would be unsuitable. He is simply
arguing that there may be a preferable site, which I entirely
understand.</hs_Para>

is that Leicester university has made it clear that it is happy to
receive representations on this issue. Many of the hon.
Gentleman’s points deserve further consideration, and I hope and
expect that those at Leicester university with that responsibility will
take into account what he has said. We would be happy to facilitate a
meeting between the people he identifies and the university to enable
that to happen. I am sure that we would all agree that wherever the

change. Frankly, on a wet Thursday afternoon in an inner-city school,

necessarily present in an academy, although I am prepared to
acknowledge that some academies exemplify those ingredients, and they
are not necessarily absent in other sorts of schools that happen not to
be academies. My conclusion is that the best thing we can do with a

have seen, why do they not just make all schools academies and make the
case for abolishing LEAs, thereby ending the division, disruption and
death by a thousand
cuts?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031245000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/halltext/130312h0001.htm#13031245000020">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T14:39:45"></hs_TimeCode>
have pondered that, and the only answer I can give is the answer the
Government normally give, which is that they want schools to choose
whether to be autonomous. I understand that is the rhetoric surrounding
the programme, but as the programme has rolled out that particular
answer has come to seem odder and odder. First, choosing has been
confined to a limited group of people. Parents and staff were excluded
by the Academies Act 2010, and during its passage I moved an amendment
on the Floor of the House that sought to allow parents some sort of
voice, but the amendment was not supported. So we moved from a position
where parents decided to one where only a limited number of people
decide.</hs_Para>

choice is constrained by the fact that opting for autonomous
independence is linked to another choice about funding, because the
funding packages are not the same and depend on whether the school
chooses to stay a local education authority school or become an
academy. Thirdly, the choice to be an academy is being linked with a
choice to be inspected less and have less bureaucracy and prescription
from Whitehall. What is actually involved in the choice argument is a
skewed choice, vested in those who have the most to gain from making
that choice in terms either of power, in the case of the governors, or
of remuneration, in the case of the head teacher. Unsurprisingly, the
choice to become an academy has gathered some momentum. That is the
current state of play as we can best understand it.</hs_Para>

Secretary of State has gone one step further and, with gifts bordering
on the prophetic, has told us that by a certain date, a fixed number of
academies will be in place, with primary schools firmly within that

would like to draw attention to the well documented fact that some of
the brokers’ behaviour is markedly aggressive. One governor of
fairly robust temperament described a broker as “seriously
scary”. I find the process appalling. Regardless of what one
feels about the academy programme, I find it distressing that people
who have the interests of children and their schools at heart feel that
they have been put in that situation. It strikes me that it is
bullying. The intention is to close the contract and sign it there and
then, which is the worst kind of sharp salesmanship, if I can put it
like that. It is obviously wide open to corruption; it is about making
offers that people cannot refuse, straight out of the Vito Corleone

was on the local authority at the time. It has kept its central costs
low. It has always prioritised education and schools. It stands
favourable comparison with other LEAs. Its schools are good and, better
still, there are good relations between the LEA and the schools, which
themselves cluster together harmoniously and supportively. There is a

understand that there is a rationale for that, and I do not want to be
unkind to Government policy. Schools must be in certain categories,
failing or failing to improve, and in such circumstances arguably
someone must intervene. The categories, however, have in practice been
extended beyond the permanent sink schools or those that are sinking.
In one case in Sefton, an otherwise good school had four heads in six
years, which caused temporary instability over a short period, but the
school and the authority could deal with that. In another case, to

seek sponsors some appreciable distance away? A school in the northern

run out of any coherent educational rationale when encountering
arguments to suggest that a change in leadership will help a school
whose main problem is that it has had too many changes in leadership;
that is when my brain starts to hurt. What appears to have happened is
that academies have become ends in themselves, not a means to an end.
Instead of academies being a means to school improvement, success is
measured by the number of academies, not their products. Can the
Minister confirm whether new secondary schools converting will not only
be paid for attracting pupils—for success—but be given an
under-occupancy payment of £18,000 for three years for failing
to attract pupils? In the old days, I am not sure what the Audit
Commission which taxed us about surplus places would have had to say
about that; fortunately, we have taken the precaution of

hunters. There is a real worry that the neutrality of Ofsted might be
under pressure and, equally, there is a worry about Ofsted’s
reliability. If it delivered a rogue inspection, as it occasionally
will, given the nature of things, that could have significant
consequences for any school that is the victim of such an inspection.
The broker who came to Sefton was asked by a head teacher what would
happen if an academy chosen to sponsor a school was failed by Ofsted.
The broker said that that will not happen. I do not know how the broker
could know that it would not happen but clearly, if so, that seems to

reality of the situation is that Northumberland has few academies; my
constituency does not have a single one. We must ask why. All of us, of
course, want our children to receive the best possible education,
whether at an academy or a maintained school. The great William Yeats
described education as the lighting of a fire, and the question that
follows is how best to achieve
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031245000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/halltext/130312h0001.htm#13031245000053">In
Northumberland, we have a three-tier system, of which I am an
unadulterated supporter, particularly in a rural context, but at the
heart of the issue for Northumberland is a middle school. The Minister
is a small hero of Hexham middle school, which I visited two weeks ago
to meet Mrs Parker and her three star pupils, Elizabeth Nixon, Amy
Hawke and Anisha Bannister, all of whom wrote to the Minister
requesting a change of mathematical calculation, from chunking to long
division. They are deeply pleased that she listened to their pleas and
are looking forward to meeting her when I bring them and their teacher
to the House in the near
future.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031245000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/halltext/130312h0001.htm#13031245000054">I
welcome the chance to debate academies today. Surely it cannot be a bad
thing that they can set pay and conditions, deviate if necessary from
the national curriculum, change the length of terms and school days,
reduce classroom sizes, introduce new disciplinary techniques, target
resources to the most appropriate areas, and allow the school to be run
by head teachers and governors rather than by a local authority, which,
in my case, is some 50 or 60 miles away. That is my opinion, but I
could give my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T15:01:26"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Southport ample examples, including the
Harris Federation, the schools in Newcastle, and ARK Schools, which
runs more than 18 separate academies throughout the country. Since they
took over those schools, grades have gone up by more than 200%, and the
standard and quality of education have improved immeasurably. Local
people are voting with their feet and deluging those schools with
applications.</hs_Para>

deem it unfortunate that, contrary to my hon. Friend’s
assertions, Northumberland schools are not being forced to convert to
academies. They are being preventing from converting. I will give three
specific examples. Allendale middle school was a failing school, and
the council chose to close it instead of converting it to a sponsored
academy. It will close in the autumn, notwithstanding the assurance

said

Haltwhistle middle school has chosen to go down the path towards
academy status, but it is being prevented from doing so by the county
council’s approach on pensions. That is what I want to address
in my last few minutes today. In Northumberland, the county
council 
<?notus-xml column=39?>is requiring an extra pension contribution from an academy, of between
12% and 26%, whereas for a standard maintained school in the UK the
average pension fund contribution for teachers earning less than
£75,000 is approximately 8%. There is no financial justification
for the measure, and no other county in the country is following that
course of action. Either the council’s pension fund panel is
driving that unfair proposal forward to prevent schools from becoming
academies, or the council is fundamentally opposed to academy status.
There can be no other reason, except that it would like to obtain
greater sums from a would-be academy than from a maintained
school.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031245000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/halltext/130312h0001.htm#13031245000057">The

than those which they themselves previously enjoyed. In those
circumstances, either there is an impact on their financial
calculations because they are paying larger contributions, or they are

me be clear: failure and unacceptable performance in our schools cannot

the evidence points to a Department that is ideologically wedded to the
promotion of academies for all, rather than the best education for all.
In our education system, only 10% of all state schools are academies
and free schools, and the figure for primary schools is only 5.3%. Yet
one third of Department for Education staff are assigned to the
academies and free schools programme, which accounts for 18% of the
Department’s revenue and capital budget—a level
completely disproportionate to the size of the
programme<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T15:14:29"></hs_TimeCode>. Then
we come to the £1 billion overspend. No doubt that
money is being taken from the budgets for non-academy schools, many of

conflicted mercenaries—these brokers—are running round
the country offering inducements of £40,000,

from the head teacher and governing bodies, with investment in schools
buildings and school resources, irrespective of whether the school is

is not too much of a secret, certainly in some quarters, that I am not
a great fan of academies. I opposed them under the previous Government,
and I oppose the academy regime under this Government. Within a few
months of coming into the House of Commons, I voted against the
Academies Bill. That was for a couple of reasons. First, many
supporters of academies, who want to push for academy status, are
seeking to control admissions. For them, it is about who goes into the
school, not what goes on in the school.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13031245000092" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/halltext/130312h0002.htm#13031245000092">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T15:18:49"></hs_TimeCode>
a private meeting with the Secretary of State, I said, “You
should be far more radical and make every school an academy in terms of
some of the freedoms that are proposed.” However, for those who
support 
<?notus-xml column=43?>academies, and who are pushing for them, that would not really work,
because the secret of academies is that some schools are academies and
some are not. Alongside freedoms in relation to conditions of service
and so on, there would need to be some control over admissions, which
would defeat the purpose of going to academy status for many sponsors,
and the same applies to free schools.</hs_Para>

to the academies also because there is an overemphasis on the impact
that the structure will have on raising achievement and attainment in
schools. It is interesting that many of the new academies have not
taken up some of the new freedoms: they have taken the money and
stayed, rather than taking the money and running with the new freedoms.

something works, generally speaking it is okay. I do not feel that
there are too many strong, politically different issues or matters of
principle. Most of them are about what works in a situation, with some
fundamental underpinning of values. I am not clear where the evidence
is for academies. In a sitting of the Education Committee a few weeks
ago, I asked the Secretary of State whether he believed in
evidence-based policy and he said that he very much does, but I do not
see any evidence for
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031245000095" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/halltext/130312h0002.htm#13031245000095">The
success of the academies project
seems—my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T15:21:06"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Southport referred to this—to be
judged by how many academies there are. That has almost become an end
in itself. There has been much talk about needing to convert. A school
is in a particular situation, and the idea of need is always
introduced; but it does not mean the school will benefit from a
conversion. The evidence base is not there. The idea is that the school
needs to convert because it meets the criteria; but it is the Secretary
of State who sets the criteria. It is like saying, “I will
decide when it is raining, and I will decide what to wear in the
rain.” He is doing the same, because he is saying, “I
will decide the criteria and whether they have been met.” That
is the same idea as, “There is a need to put on a coat when it
is raining; it is raining so we need to put a coat on.” The
false logic behind the whole academies programme is: “An
intervention is needed and an academy is an intervention, so you need
an academy.” It is all false logic. Using a coat when it rains
is an intervention, but it is not the only form of intervention and
there is no evidence that that intervention is the one that would
work.</hs_Para>

sorts of interventions, which could include setting up an
academy—but where is the evidence? Local authority support would
be a possibility: many authorities are not, as has been suggested,
dreadful, and are effective at providing support. The intervention may
be a new head for the existing school. It may be an integrated
post-inspection plan, or an interim executive board to turn the school
around. There is evidence to show that all those interventions work in
certain circumstances. They all have an evidence base, but there is no
evidence that the academy structure works. It is false
logic.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031245000097" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/halltext/130312h0002.htm#13031245000097">In
my constituency in Bradford, there are two schools that are going
through intervention academy conversions. My two sons went to one of
those schools many years 
<?notus-xml column=44?>ago. If someone went to a local estate agency 10 or 15 years
ago, the window would have adverts stating that properties were close
to the school. The school was one of the largest and most successful in
the Bradford district and it was why people moved into that area, but
it has had a difficult time. It was not so long ago that the head
teacher of that school, before retirement, was the executive head of
another school that was failing and has now become successful. I was
chair of governors at a school that was in special measures, and it
became the first secondary school in Bradford to be rated as
outstanding. All that was done without academy status and on the basis
of interventions by an extremely good head teacher, who was able,
through a new management team, to turn the school
around.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031245000098" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/halltext/130312h0002.htm#13031245000098">In
Bradford, a secondary partnership has been established. The whole
principle behind it has been to offer support to other schools and
negate the need for academy conversions. The partnership was formed
about 18 months ago and all 28 secondary schools from the district are
involved and pay an annual subscription to join. It involves developing
a rigorous system of performance review. It will provide effective
school-to-school support and deliver school-led professional
development. Those schools do not need to be academies. There are other
ways forward that do not require a change to a school’s
structure.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031245000099" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/halltext/130312h0002.htm#13031245000099">Ideology
has been mentioned a few times, but I do not think that is the issue.
It is about ego. All schools can be improved, but it takes time and
requires hard work. It is not glamorous and a slog is involved. It
takes 18 months to two years to get the right people in place to turn a
school around, but where is the glamour in that for a Secretary of
State who needs to be seen to do dramatic things? Where is the glamour
in that hard graft that happens day in, day out up and down the country
in turning around schools that need to improve?</hs_Para>

is that that egocentric project comes with a cost. The House of Commons
Library briefing shows the actual cost involved in investing in the
schools and bribing them to take up academy status, as well as the
opportunity cost of the money that is not available for other schools.
It is frankly sickening to see schools in Bradford unable to afford
basic repairs while a bottomless pit of money appears to be available
to support the free schools and academies programme. That programme is
a costly distraction—devoid of evidence—from the
principal concern of an authority, which is to raise educational
achievement and attainment through the well-established methods that
already exist for turning schools around and providing the quality

where I am coming from on the issue by reference to my constituency. I
had a quick tot up and I have nine secondary schools in my
constituency, including one that is 100 yards outside. They range from
leading independent schools, such as Latymer Upper school and St
Paul’s Girls’ school, to leading Catholic schools, such
as Sacred Heart high school and London Oratory, which former Prime
Ministers and current party leaders seem keen to send their children
to. There is also the West London free school, which was set up Toby
Young, and two academies that were part of the Labour
Government’s academies programme: Burlington Danes academy,
which is a new build, and Hammersmith academy. There are two
outstanding—I should say that all those that are subject to
Ofsted inspection are outstanding—community schools: William
Morris school, which is a sixth-form school that I helped set up
20 years ago and am a governor of, and Phoenix high school,
which is run by Sir William Atkinson, who is a famous head teacher,
known across the
country<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T15:29:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031245000103" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/halltext/130312h0002.htm#13031245000103">The
reason I mentioned those is because there is a vast range of schools,
and I do not discriminate between any of them. I go to them all, invite
their pupils here and I am very proud to have every single one of them

indeed, I helped to set them up, under the previous Labour Government.
It is a shame that the £50 million that went into those was not
replicated by the Building Schools for the Future programme being
continued, so that community schools could also have
benefited.</hs_Para>

I find surprising is the attitude of—I have to call them
this—the ideologues in the Department for Education and in some
Conservative local councils, including my own. They take it to be their
mission to ensure that there is academisation wherever possible,
without regard to the reasons why they are doing it. I hope that from
what I have said it is clear that I have no particular beef about
whether a school is an academy or not. All those schools are doing well
in their own way.</hs_Para>

illustrate that by reference to ARK Schools, which is a well known
academy chain, and is the governing foundation for Burlington Danes
academy, which, historically, has been a grammar school, a successful
comprehensive school, and a Church of England school. It is now an ARK
academy and I was part of ensuring that that happened.
On<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T15:32:30"></hs_TimeCode> the back of
that, west London is now populated by a dozen-plus new ARK schools, and
again, I have no particular objection to that. I was at one of the

I have difficulty with, however, is the attitude of Conservative local
authorities, who, whenever they see a possibility in relation to an
existing community school, pressurise that school into becoming an ARK
academy. We had an early example of that with Kenmont primary school in
my constituency. The head left, which is a perfectly normal thing to
happen. The local authority then said that it could not afford to
employ a new head and that the school would therefore have to become an
ARK academy. It was only because the parents and governors
objected—in the end, a new head was
recruited —that that did not happen, and it is now, once
again, a very successful community primary school.</hs_Para>

schools have been pressurised; indeed, one is being pressurised at
the moment, and I use the phrase advisedly. There
are primary schools in my constituency that have effectively been told
that their only option is to become an academy. I feel that in some
cases, those schools are set up to fail, and they are not given the
requisite support. Perhaps a head teacher leaves, there is a temporary
head for a year or two, and the school is allowed to drift into special
measures. I am not going to name particular schools—I do not
want to name schools that are having difficulties—but I see that
pattern repeated, and it is not what a local authority should be doing.
It should be supporting all its schools, including those for which it
is not directly responsible.</hs_Para>

be, despite the fact that very successful community schools also wish
to expand and see investment put into them. I object to those double

of that would matter if there were no adverse consequences, but let me
explain some of the consequences. First, there will be a
perception—it may be a reality, but it is certainly a
perception—that we are creating a two-tier system in education,
in which academies are the preferred type of schools. Parents will
therefore gravitate, reasonably and understandably, towards those
schools, because they believe that the schools will be
preferred—with money, resources or simply the attention that
they receive from local education authorities and the DFE. That then
leads to a form of separate development. A number of academies are now
for pupils aged three to 18, and they therefore monopolise children
within an area. Equally, I have noticed a trend whereby secondary
academies will select—particularly if they are in the same
group—from their primary feeder schools, so it may be that there
is no longer an interchange between primary schools in that way. I am
beginning to get a lot of complaints from parents of children in
community primary schools who might want to send their children to
secondary academies, and they find that they are refused or are a long
way down the waiting list.</hs_Para>

also fear that there is a possibility of politicisation of the academy
system down the road. There is a strong association between the academy
system and not only Conservative local authorities, but Conservative
funders, peers and so on. Lord Nash has been mentioned. Lord Fink, who
I think is still the Tory party treasurer, was the chairman of ARK, and
he is the chairman of one of the schools in my constituency. Both of
those gentlemen are very substantial funders of the Conservative party.
One of them, Lord Nash—or rather, his wife, Lady Nash—was
the principal funder of my opponent at the last election. It is a free
country. Anyone can do as they wish, but the association of particular
schools, chains of schools and individuals with a particular political
party is not healthy in education. I see that as another branch of the
politicisation and there is the real prospect of our moving—with
every pronouncement that comes out of Government or those close to
Government—to 
<?notus-xml column=47?>profit-making schools. If another Conservative Government were elected,
we would see that trend continue, and I think that
would be extremely regrettable.</hs_Para>

it slightly troubling that soon it will be almost the size of a local
education authority, spread across some west London boroughs, because
it does not have the same democratic accountability as LEAs. However, I
do not blame ARK. It may be a willing recipient of the
Government’s largesse, but I place the blame squarely where it
lies: in the tram-line attitude and the “Go for academies at all
costs” policy that infects the DFE at the moment. With
hindsight, in years to come, I think that that will be seen as a very
retrograde, ideological and divisive step.</hs_Para>

criticising ARK as an educational institution. The answer is that it
has had some remarkable successes and some partial successes. Some
successes have not been quite so big, and in some cases, it is too
early to say. That is true—it is exactly why I started with a
slightly self-indulgent tour round my constituency—and I could
say the same thing about many other schools and different types of
schools there. That is not the point I am making. The point that I
thought I was making—I will make it slightly more
clearly—is that the concentration and fixation on a particular
type of school and giving schools of that type a privileged status will
undoubtedly have an unbalancing effect on education across the piece.
That is the mistake that the Government are

schools—in Sweden. The impact has been to lower standards
because of the race to the bottom that profit-making schools entail.
Also, Sweden has had to reinstate a requirement for teachers to be
properly qualified in free schools, because of that race to the bottom
for low-paid staff and maximising profit. That has happened in free
schools in Sweden, so there is a lesson for us

debate is about forced academisation. Let me say at the outset that I
am a supporter of academies and have been throughout my 12 years in the
House of Commons. Of course, the genesis for the academies programme
under the previous, Labour Government was to launch a direct assault on
the double disadvantage of social and economic deprivation. Our concern
about the current Government’s academies programme is not about
the freedoms that can be granted—that come along with academy
status—but about the loss of focus on under-performing schools
in areas of high social and economic deprivation and the fact that that
might result in the positive impact of the academies programme being
diluted. I worry that the principal foundations for the success of the
early academies—collaboration and partnership—have been
replaced by what other hon. Members have talked about here today, a
fixation on the numbers game. That is what we are seeing at the moment.

year I visited a group of schools that had formed an education
improvement partnership. One of the primary school head teachers in it
was desperate to tell me about her experience with what some people

the adviser from the Department turned up, she was told that she had to
meet them and that no one else was to be present. When she objected to
that, she was told that perhaps at a stretch she might be allowed to
have the chair of governors present with her for part of the meeting.
She wanted to have, and in the end she insisted on having, the head
teacher of the local secondary school, which was part of the education
improvement partnership, with her for the debate, but she told me
several stories about how she was leaned on—that is the only way
it can be described—and told that there was no alternative to
her school becoming an academy, despite the fact that the governors did

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education (Elizabeth

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T15:50:18"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Southport (John Pugh) on securing the debate. We have
had an interesting discussion this afternoon on the evidence behind the
academies programme and some of the issues with underperforming
schools. He outlined the elements of a good school. I agree with him,
and think everyone in this House would agree, that good leadership, a
good ethos and parental involvement are all things we recognise about
good schools. He also suggested that those attributes were completely
independent of academies, and that is where I cannot agree with
him.</hs_Para>

evidence across the OECD links school autonomy with improved
performance and, where there is a strong accountability
system—also important—strong leadership in the school and
improved results. It is notable that many of the countries that have
successfully improved 
<?notus-xml column=51?>their educational performance—Germany over the past 10 years, for
example—have done so by increasing the amount of autonomy that
schools have, setting strong standards and a strong accountability
regime. Germany has seen a marked improvement, relative to other
countries. The OECD used evidence from PISA 2006 to show that science
results for 15-year-olds had improved in countries that gave more
autonomy to schools. That evidence is generally recognised, and was
recognised by the previous Government when they established and
promoted the academies programme. There is a link between autonomy and
accountability and improved performance.</hs_Para>

Truss:</Member></B> The German system is rather more complex because
each länder has its own education system. I am happy to discuss
it with my hon. Friend in more detail in due course, but there has been
a general move across the country to have fewer decisions made by the
Government and more decisions made by school leaders. That is my
general point. The point about process he raised is a slightly
different issue.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend mentioned that our other school policies and what happens
in schools are important. He is right. The academies programme is part
of what the Government are doing to address educational standards. We
are also giving significant funding for disadvantaged pupils through
the pupil premium, which is £2.5 billion a year. We are also
improving the quality of teaching in our schools, by increasing the
number of high-quality applicants to the profession and developing
existing teachers. We are reforming the national curriculum to make it
more rigorous and more focused, so that teachers have the freedom to
design lessons that inspire and motivate their
pupils.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031245000135" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/halltext/130312h0002.htm#13031245000135">Some<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T15:58:46"></hs_TimeCode>
freedoms that have hitherto been held mainly by academies are being
extended to all schools. All schools are being given more freedom in
how they design their curriculums. We are encouraging schools to
collaborate and share best practice, so that strong schools can help
weaker schools to improve. We are increasing the rigour of the
accountability framework, including introducing the English
baccalaureate and our new floor standard measure for key stage 4.
Ofsted’s inspection framework is raising the bar on inspections,
so “satisfactory” is no longer good enough. The policies
have to be looked at in the round. The academies programme is
accompanied by other policies, in areas such as accountability, to
ensure that school leaders are accountable for what they

are encouraging all schools to convert to academy status, so that good
and outstanding schools can use the autonomy that the status provides
to drive up standards. Where schools are underperforming and leadership
and 
<?notus-xml column=52?>management need improvement, however, we cannot just stand by and allow
that to continue. The cases that hon. Members have raised in the debate
are about schools in which performance is not good enough. We are not
talking about schools in which performance is already good. There are
good schools under local authority auspices and there are good
academies, but we are talking about underperforming schools. We look
for two indicators of underperformance to determine which schools we
should approach and work with to deliver sustained improvement: low
achievement over time and whether the school is in Ofsted category
4.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031245000139" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/halltext/130312h0002.htm#13031245000139">Many<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T15:55:31"></hs_TimeCode>
schools agree to become sponsored academies, because they know that
academies are achieving dramatic improvements in results, particularly
where new sponsors have taken on formerly underperforming schools, as I
have seen that in my county of Norfolk. Sponsors bring outside
influence and a wealth of experience. They challenge traditional
thinking and have no truck with a culture of low
expectations.</hs_Para>

Members asked about the evidence. It shows that sponsored academies are
improving at a faster rate than other state-funded schools. In fact, on
average, the longer they are open, the better they do. Between 2011 and
2012 the proportion of pupils achieving five good GCSEs, including
English and maths, in sponsored secondary academies increased by 3.1%,
which compares with 0.6% across all state-funded schools, so there is a
differential rate of performance.</hs_Para>

are some dramatic case studies. Students and staff at the Accrington
academy in Lancashire, for example, celebrated a huge improvement in
results. In 2012, 60% of students achieved five or more A* to C grades
at GCSE, including English and maths. That was up 13 percentage points
from 47% in 2011 and up an incredible 42 percentage points from just
18% at the predecessor school in 2008. The school is supported by its
sponsor, United Learning. Given the opportunities, I can understand why

the Member for Hexham also outlined academies’ freedoms over
term times, the school day and pay and conditions. We have heard
positive reports about ARK academies and the fact that they have a
longer school day. E-ACT has supported the Blakely academy to set

it in mind that intervention takes place where schools are
underperforming—where there is a problem. At meetings with
governing bodies, where schools are in Ofsted categories of concern, a
broker discusses sponsorship options and aims to agree a schedule of

can sometimes appear challenging—of course, it can. We are
saying that what is happening at that school is not delivering for the
children. It is important that they receive the best possible

proceedings, the schools that we seek to intervene in and that are
suited to a sponsored academy solution are those that are
underperforming. There have been some questions about the make-up of
the departmental brokers that we employ to carry out that work. As the
schools are underperforming, the conversations are often about
challenging them to perform better. The departmental brokers have
contracts with the Department that state their terms and conditions.
They are not paid on results, and they are subject to the civil service
code of conduct.

his parents had requested no fewer than seven consultations with five
local GPs over that period as they became increasingly concerned about
his condition. Robbie had excessive weight loss and was so weak in the
last four days of his life that he could not walk. If Robbie had been
referred immediately for hospital treatment it is likely that his life
would have been saved, but a number of general practitioners who dealt
with him did not refer him to hospital for an investigation. On the
final day of his short life, his father had to take him by car to
Morriston hospital, after being refused an ambulance at the second GP

recommended that Robbie should be tested for Addison’s disease.

practice. It said that Robbie needed the ACTH test and should be
immediately re-referred if there was any recurrence of his symptoms.

Friend the Member for Wokingham wrote to me on 8 May 1994 indicating

my right hon. Friend offered to set up a non-statutory inquiry under an

of the issue. Although the family wanted a full public inquiry, they
accepted this course of action but received a notification six months
later that the family’s general practitioners had refused to
co-operate. Furthermore, at one point the medical notes in the case,
which were crucial in terms of the request for the Addison’s

set out these issues as the context of this debate, because
responsibilities in relation to health are now clearly within the remit
of the Welsh Assembly. More recently, the First Minister, Carwyn Jones,
ordered an independent review of the case, which reported last year. In
advance of ordering that review, however, the 
<?notus-xml column=56?>First Minister had asked the Attorney-General whether he would join the
Welsh Assembly Government in establishing a full public inquiry into
the case, as the matters of concern that I intend to raise in this

authorities had considered the

was about that issue that I wrote on 4 April 1996 to the then chief
crown prosecutor for Swansea expressing concern about the case and
pointing out that it might be necessary to require a full and detailed
investigation of the actions—or should I say the
inactivity?—of the prosecuting authorities. The response that I
received was directly from the then Director of Public Prosecutions in
London, the late Dame Barbara Mills QC, who set out—I am bound
to say in rather simplistic fashion—the “realistic
prospect of conviction” test. Dame Barbara indicated that the
Crown Prosecution Service had first been consulted about the case in
November 1994 and had given preliminary advice to the police, before
offering additional advice to the police in December 1994. In December
1995, following what was described by Dame Barbara as an
“extensive” inquiry, the Dyfed Powys police submitted a
further file to the CPS seeking advice, and the case again received
detailed consideration with advice being given to the police on 5
January 1996.
Dame<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T16:33:54"></hs_TimeCode> Barbara set
out in that letter that she had advised that the evidence available at
that stage was insufficient to support a prosecution, but she indicated
that she would be happy to consider any further evidence. She
reiterated this stance in a letter to me on 26 July
1996<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T16:34:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031245000165" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/halltext/130312h0002.htm#13031245000165">At
a later stage, and following complaints made by Mr Powell to the then
chief constable of Dyfed Powys police and the Police Complaints
Authority, it was decided that Dyfed Powys police’s handling of
the case would be independently reviewed by another police force.
Detective Chief Inspector Poole of West Midlands police was appointed
and his November 2000 review made 25 recommendations. The Avon and
Somerset police force was instructed to undertake a disciplinary
investigation, and in fact a detective chief superintendent and a
superintendent from Dyfed Powys police were both formally issued with
discipline
notices<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T16:34:42"></hs_TimeCode>.
However, as was sadly becoming rather familiar, both senior officers
were then permitted to retire and the investigation went no
further.</hs_Para>

investigation was called Operation Reboant, and it focused on the
handling of the investigation itself. Although Dame Barbara had spoken
about the detail of the Dyfed Powys police investigation, the
conclusion of the Avon and Somerset police force on this matter was
shockingly different. It concluded that Dyfed Powys police had been
institutionally incompetent in respect of the police investigation into
the circumstances surrounding the death of Robbie Powell. The manner in
which employees of Dyfed Powys police had dealt with Robbie’s
father was also criticised. The inquiry concluded that, as an
organisation, Dyfed Powys police had failed to investigate
professionally, efficiently or effectively the circumstances
surrounding and subsequent to the death of Robert Powell at Morriston
hospital, and that the criminal investigations were badly managed by
senior detectives.
However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T16:35:48"></hs_TimeCode>, the
inquiry did not authorise prosecution for misconduct in public office
as Dyfed Powys police was neither a body corporate nor a person 
<?notus-xml column=57?>for prosecution purposes. Furthermore, it should be noted that the GPs
who were under investigation were, at the material time, actually
employed by Dyfed Powys police as police surgeons, and that this
conflict of interest was not
disclosed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T16:36:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031245000167" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/halltext/130312h0002.htm#13031245000167">The
second investigation was entitled Operation Radiance and it was an
investigation into whether any criminal offences had been committed by
the general practitioners, whose role had been to provide health care
to the Powell family. This investigation was undertaken by DCI Poole,
who concluded that there was the potential for up to 35
individual criminal offences to be considered in the case, ranging from
manslaughter to the falsification of documents, perverting the course
of justice and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Core to
those charges was the revelation that a secretary in the GP practice
constructed a referral letter after Robbie had died requesting that
Robbie should be tested for Addison’s disease in response to the
original referral on that issue, which had taken place months earlier.
The letter was then backdated to the time that Robbie was still alive
and placed in his file of papers. Two persons in the GP practice
accepted that they had been involved in this exercise, the clear
purpose of which was to mislead the investigations that were taking
place into the circumstances that led to Robbie’s death. Another
GP confessed that she had watched a television investigative report
into the scandal that had been broadcast in Wales, and following that
broadcast she had constructed a series of notes, backdated them to a
date when Robbie was alive and then placed them in his notes. Again, it
seems clear that this action was contrived in order to give a
misleading impression regarding the medical care that was being
offered<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T16:37:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031245000168" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/halltext/130312h0002.htm#13031245000168">The
conclusions of Operation Radiance were delivered to the CPS and led to
a meeting between the CPS and their advising counsel on 2 April 2003,
the effect of which was to inform the parents that no prosecution would
be undertaken in relation to any of the issues arising from the
treatment of their son. I have rarely read a more self-serving document
than that six-page letter, but the essence of the viewpoint conveyed by
the CPS is that it would no longer be justifiable to resurrect the
offences as any case brought against the doctors for forgery or for
perverting the course of justice would inevitably be stopped as
“an abuse of

never be relied upon by the prosecuting authorities as a reason why no

serious issues arise from this. Although the use of evidence that
arises following a declaration that no prosecution would be forthcoming
might make that evidence inadmissible, is it really the opinion of the
Attorney-General that such a statement would preclude any further
prosecution of such an individual? This proposition requires
clarification. If the granting by the prosecuting authorities of what

hon. Friend’s concerns appear to fall into two categories. The
first relates to the decision of the Crown Prosecution Service not to

Powell’s death. The second is whether, in light of the Crown

full public
inquiry.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031245000182" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/halltext/130312h0002.htm#13031245000182">First<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T16:44:09"></hs_TimeCode>,
on the decision not to prosecute, it is right that Parliament holds
public services to account, including the Crown Prosecution Service,
for which I am ministerially accountable here. However, I have to
preface my remarks with a note of caution. This debate cannot be the
place to determine the guilt or innocence of those suspected of
criminal activity, and it is not the place where I can engage in
detailed analysis of the complex issues that this case involves. I must
also be realistic about what I can achieve in the short time available
to me in this debate.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T16:44:57"></hs_TimeCode> do not make
those remarks lightly or to brush the matters aside. I know that this
is a case where there have been allegations of record falsification and
cover up, and it would only fuel those concerns if I were to refuse to
engage with them. So I will engage with them, to the extent that I can
and that it is possible to do so in this

CPS reviews of evidence in the 1990s were in relation to evidence
gathered during a criminal investigation by Dyfed-Powys police, which
was later found, as my hon. Friend said, to be institutionally
incompetent. It is hardly surprising that decisions made by the CPS on
the strength of evidence gathered by an institutionally incompetent
criminal investigation may be open to criticism.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T16:45:34"></hs_TimeCode> will therefore
focus on the review of the evidence conducted by CPS in 2003, which was

medical records and a backdated referral letter, whether proceedings
could or should be brought for forgery and/or perverting the course of
justice. That review encompassed a lengthy consideration of papers over
a number of months and meetings with officers, initiating further

at the meeting that this was an extremely difficult decision, based on

2004, an inquest was finally held in this case, after the then
Attorney-General, Lord Goldsmith, consented to an application being
made to the High Court for an order that it should take place.
Following the inquest, Mr Powell complained that a number of the
doctors had committed perjury during the inquest. That was again
considered by the same reviewing lawyer and senior Queen’s
counsel. In respect of one of the doctors, such a prosecution would
have met the same problems as had been highlighted in 2003; in respect
of the other doctor, the case was significantly weakened by the medical
evidence heard during the inquest.

Friend’s point. My difficulty is that I am not in a position in
this debate to analyse the assurances that were given, their exact
terms or their effect. The CPS will have to consider that. What I can
say is that, generally speaking, although it is true that there may be
exceptional circumstances in which an assurance that a prosecution will
not be brought can subsequently be ignored and overridden, and would
survive an abuse of process application if a trial were ever to take
place, such an assurance will be a powerful argument if someone wishes

to be
brought.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031245000192" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/halltext/130312h0002.htm#13031245000192">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T16:59:29"></hs_TimeCode>

hope I have been able to explain. It is not the sole argument; there
are also evidential issues, and I do not think such things can be

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T16:52:46"></hs_TimeCode> hon. and
learned Friend the Member for Harborough (Sir Edward Garnier), in the

starting point for those Law Officers who have previously considered
the case is that a public inquiry is unnecessary, not because the
matter is not serious—the matter is undoubtedly extremely
serious—but because issues surrounding the circumstances of
Robbie’s death have already been the subject of intense
scrutiny. In 2003, there was an inquiry into Dyfed-Powys
police’s handling of the case by Avon and Somerset constabulary.
In 2007-08, the Independent Police Complaints Commission 
<?notus-xml column=62?>conducted two further investigations into complaints relating to
Dyfed-Powys police. Additionally, the Welsh Assembly Government
commissioned their own report, published in February 2012, into the
handling of the care and treatment received by Robbie
Powell<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T16:53:38"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
difficult to see that a public inquiry would uncover anything that has

it was the view of Lord Goldsmith and
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-12T16:53:48"></hs_TimeCode> hon. and
learned Friend the Member for Harborough that a public inquiry is
unnecessary, they both agreed that, if the Welsh First Minister
maintained that such an inquiry needed to be established, they would
not stand in his way provided that any inquiry encompassed the actions
of both the police and the CPS. The main concern was that a public
inquiry would be seriously impeded if it were not able to consider the
actions of all those involved. It would serve no purpose for some
participants in the Powell case to be within the scope of the inquiry

Home Office took the view, however, that a public inquiry into the
activities of the police was not necessary given the number of existing
inquiries into the police arising from the case. The Home Office
accordingly now takes the view that any new inquiry into the actions of
the police is unlikely to produce any fresh information about the role
of the police in this tragic case. For that reason, the Home Office is
not convinced that there is a need for a joint inquiry. The decision is
for the Home Office, but from the information available to me as a Law
Officer, I have no reason to dispute the Home Office’s

the Home Office agreed to an inquiry, it would have been a further
condition of the Law Officers’ consent that the inquiry did not
extend to question the correctness or otherwise of a prosecutorial
decision. That is because it is a fundamental constitutional principle
that decisions by prosecutors are taken independently of the Executive
and are free from political influence. If such decisions are reviewed
anywhere, they have to be reviewed in a court of law. Any other
approach risks the perception that the Government are holding the
threat of an inquiry over the head of prosecutors to push them into

the dispute between the parties over the rent level has been in the
public domain for many months, and much innuendo and allegation
inevitably surround such disputes, one key aspect has not had any
public exposure. If we are to go forward, it must be flushed out. The
football club’s owners are seeking to challenge the validity of
the original rental agreement made back in 2002, and are using that
challenge in an attempt to discredit the city council’s motives
for paying £14 million to Yorkshire bank in December for the
stadium’s debts. I cannot see what right the club owners have to
issue threats on that front as they bought the club more than five
years later. They had the opportunity for due diligence, and I would
hope that the principle of caveat emptor meant something in that case.

right hon. Member for Coventry North East asked about supporter
representation on the board. I will come to the bigger ticket way that
that is being dealt with in a moment. I have worried about this, having
looked at it during most of my three years as a Minister, and it can
become a bit of an Aunt Sally. It is not much use having one supporter
on a board, if there are 10 others who can vote him or her
down on each and every occasion. It is about the message it sends out.
The drift from the Government and the Select Committee on Culture,
Media and Sport is that this is an area that needs to be addressed, and
that until now supporters have been under-represented in and
under-consulted on the running of football clubs, and their views on
how football clubs are run have not been sufficiently taken into
account.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031245000242" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/halltext/130312h0002.htm#13031245000242">The
football authorities—I will come to the process in a
moment—have been invited to make proposals. It remains to be
seen precisely where they get to. If this area was working well,
different solutions would probably work for different clubs, depending
on their ownership 
<?notus-xml column=69?>structure and the history of their involvement with supporters. If that
does not happen, the Government will have to take action, and I will
come to
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031245000243" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/halltext/130312h0002.htm#13031245000243">The
fourth question, which wraps all this up, is whether the Government are
happy with football governance. The honest answer is no. That leads to
a question about what we have done about it. There has been some
progress over the last couple of years. All  92 professional
clubs are adopting the financial fair play proposals—I will come
to the Culture, Media and Sport Committee’s process in a
moment—and the Football Association has finally set up a
regulatory authority that will have power to determine applications
under FA and Football League licences and directors’ criteria,
and to look after
moves.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031245000244" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/halltext/130312h0002.htm#13031245000244">Soon
after I became a Minister, I turned up for a Wednesday morning debate
in Westminster Hall to find the best part of 60 Members of Parliament
wanting to speak, and it is clear that football governance is an area
that is causing concern throughout the House. To try to maintain a
cross-party position, we asked the Culture, Media and Sport Committee
to look at it. In the middle of 2011, it produced a report, which I am
sure the right hon. Gentleman has seen, with a series of
recommendations for the football authorities. They were challenged to
go away and work together, which was something they had not done very
successfully until then. There is often friction between the Football
League, the Premier League and the Football Association. They have
worked much more constructively together in this instance, and produced
an interim response to the Committee. They agreed  
<?notus-xml column=70?>that there was a need to change, and that they would bring forward new
regulations by August. With our encouragement, the Select Committee
invited them back to review progress at the end of last year or the
beginning of this year, and produced a report that basically said that
some progress had been made, but not quickly enough. It contained a
straightforward recommendation to the Government that if further
progress was not achieved by the middle of this year, the Government
should not hesitation in
legislating.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031245000245" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/halltext/130312h0002.htm#13031245000245">Those
of us who have been in government would be properly wary of that move,
but if it is the only to achieve proper progress, we are prepared to do
it, albeit that I would want it done on a cross-party basis. There
would be little point otherwise because if the Government changed, the
regulations might move about. An absolutely key part of any legislation
would be the regulations on supporters’ involvement in their
football
clubs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031245000246" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/halltext/130312h0002.htm#13031245000246">Those

out, so I will not read my script. If he is happy with that and does
not want to ask me anything else, I will simply finish where I started
and thank him for the debate. I wish him and his local MPs well with
Coventry football club. It is a great club, and it does not deserve to
have got into its present position. I wish him and others every success

report makes it clear that failures by police forces, particularly in
respect to the quality of investigations and the sharing of
intelligence, enabled Savile to act with impunity for over five
decades. It is also clear from the report that Savile could and should
have been apprehended earlier and that there is more to do to ensure
that the police have a fully effective and victim-centred approach to
tackling child abuse. HMIC raises the possibility that such failures
could be repeated. It calls for preventative action, and the report
makes a number of specific recommendations which fall largely to police
forces and the College of Policing.</hs_Para>

outlined further measures to overhaul the way our criminal justice
system responds to victims of child sexual abuse. And I have asked my
officials to conduct a thorough review of Home Office policies to
ensure a robust and strengthened longer-term approach to delivering
child protection within the Department and the police. This urgent work

Secretary of State for Wales (Mr David Jones):</Member></B> In May
2012, the Wales Office published “A Green Paper on future
electoral arrangements for the National Assembly for Wales” (Cm
8357). It sought views on four issues: whether the link between
parliamentary constituencies and constituencies for elections to the
National Assembly for Wales, a link broken as a result of the
Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011, should be
reinstated; whether the length of an Assembly term should be moved from
four to five years; whether the prohibition on a candidate at an
Assembly election standing in both a constituency and a region should
end; and whether Assembly Members should not also be able to sit in
Parliament.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13031234000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/wmstext/130312m0001.htm#13031234000038">A

a result of the Electoral Registration and Administration Act 2013, the
four UK boundary commissions will now report in 2018 on their
recommendations for new parliamentary constituencies. The boundaries of
parliamentary and Assembly constituencies will remain the same until
then, and there is no longer an immediate need to re-establish the link
between the two sets of constituencies. The Government do not therefore
intend to proceed with the changes to Assembly constituencies proposed
in the Green
Paper.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13031234000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/wmstext/130312m0001.htm#13031234000040">We
do, however, intend to take forward the three other proposals in the
Green Paper. First, we will move the Assembly from four to five-year
fixed terms. The 
<?notus-xml column=9?>term of the current Assembly is, exceptionally, five years, but the
Assembly is set to revert to four-year terms after the next Assembly
elections in 2016. A permanent move to five-year terms would make
a coincidence between parliamentary and Assembly elections

likely.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13031234000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/wmstext/130312m0001.htm#13031234000041">Secondly,
we will end the prohibition on candidates at Assembly elections
standing in both a constituency and a region at the same time. The
Government believe that, in principle, candidates should not be barred
from standing in a constituency and a region, and the current
prohibition impacts disproportionally on smaller
parties.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13031234000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/wmstext/130312m0001.htm#13031234000042">Thirdly,

Barker:</Member></B> Onshore, wind farm developers make decommissioning
arrangements with the relevant local planning authorities and other
parties who have a particular interest, for example, the landowner.
Decommissioning conditions are applied to onshore wind farm planning
permissions to ensure restoration of the site to the satisfaction of
the local authority once the planning permission lifetime has expired.
It is common practice for developers to enter into agreements pursuant
to section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 to
ensure funds are available for such decommissioning
work.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031267000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/text/130312w0001.htm#13031267000052">Offshore,
the statutory decommissioning scheme for renewable energy installations
provides security that their removal can be undertaken by developers.
Under sections 105 to 114 of the Energy Act 2004, the Secretary of

installations to submit (and eventually carry out) a decommissioning
programme for them, and to submit details of the security they propose

to actively encourage people to switch on parental controls if children
are in the household and will be using the internet. “Actively
encourage” means making the decision of whether to set up
parental controls is an unavoidable step for
parents.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031267000101" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/text/130312w0001.htm#13031267000101">In
addition, the Government has asked that internet service providers put
in place appropriate measures to check that the person setting controls
is over the age of 18 and is pressing for all of the information and

providing free internet access is not held centrally, as it is a matter
for individual authorities. The Universal Offers initiative launched,
in January this year by the Society of Chief Librarians (SCL),
commented that most public libraries provide digital access for the
community and have done so for some time. The SCL initiative, developed
in partnership with Arts Council England and The Reading Agency
defines, as part of the Universal Digital Offer, the minimum that a
public library authority should provide and that customers should
expect from their public library. This includes free access to the
Internet for every customer (for a minimum period of
time).</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-12?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_12_PT_1/08AFA3C9F751D628C66A7E2B01BCE5D62D50ECAA" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>1</System><Sitting short-date="12 March 2013">Tuesday

VisitBritain, the industry is projected to achieve 33% growth in the

of 200,000 new jobs. Recent figures show that we are on track to meet
these targets. VisitBritain activity delivered £503 million in

growth. In the eight-month period from early March to the end of

Gauke:</Member></B> The Treasury has worked closely with industry
representatives to consider the impact of a VAT cut for the tourism
sector on growth and jobs. The conclusion the Government has reached is
that a VAT cut would not produce sufficient economic growth to outweigh
the revenue shortfall. A VAT cut for this sector would therefore need
to be funded either by additional borrowing or by raising other taxes,
both of which are likely to have a negative effect on the economy. The
Government therefore has no plans to introduce a VAT cut for this
sector.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-12?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_12_PT_1/D3622566BFAF81E7B3B6C6D24126950D09E82E9C" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>1</System><Sitting short-date="12 March 2013">Tuesday

universities use a range of information and evidence about applicants
for admissions purposes. Even within individual universities, there may
be a variety of approaches between subjects. Changes to the AS and A
levels mean that some universities may need to make changes to
admissions processes. However, Ofqual's consultation on A level reform
found that for many universities, the removal of AS would not have a
major impact on selection processes.</hs_Para>

assessment published in April 2012. It is estimated that 58% of dogs in
England are currently microchipped with the preferred option leading to
80% of currently un-microchipped dogs becoming microchipped. The
Government, working with animal welfare charities and others, is making
the provision of microchipping as simple and cheap as possible. In
addition, any owners of dogs that are brought to the attention of the
authorities and that are not microchipped after April 2016 will be
reminded about the law and that the cost of microchipping is cheaper
than paying a
fine.</hs_Para><Question><hs_Para UID="13031270000302" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/text/130312w0001.htm#13031270000302"><B><Member PimsId="1124" UID="13031270000840" xid="662" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/text/130312w0001.htm#13031270000840">Huw

preserved awards and these will be paid in accordance with the relevant
scheme rules. Members of the Armed Forces Pension Scheme (AFPS) 75 or
AFPS 05 are entitled to add these separate periods of service together
if they so choose. This means that when the pension becomes payable it
will be calculated on the total number of days reckonable service from
both periods of service. However, if a member of the scheme has more

of service to their current

by the Association of Train Operating Companies (ATOC). Eligibility for
these railcards is governed by a contract between the Train Operating
Companies (TOCs) and the Ministry of Defence (MOD), and any extension
of the eligibility criteria to include Reserve Forces would require the
full consent of the TOCs. As a commercial organisation, ATOC has to
carefully consider the financial implications of issues such as ticket
pricing and railcards. While it would not be appropriate to
comment in detail on these commercial aspects, we understand that ATOC
consider its current product range, including a variety of railcard
products and advance tickets, with reduced fares, to represent a fair
and appropriate balance

applicants will be women. The Government is taking forward measures in
the Crime and Courts Bill to promote diversity, including flexible
working and a 'tipping point' provision, which allows for diversity to
be taken into account where two applicants are of equal merit. There
will be a new statutory duty placed on the Lord Chancellor and the Lord

McVey:</Member></B> We have not tightened the criteria in the
‘Moving around’ activity between the second and final
drafts of the personal independence payment (PIP) assessment criteria.
We had always intended that being unable to walk more than 50 metres
should lead to entitlement to some rate of the Mobility component.
However under the second draft of the assessment being unable to walk
50 metres did not automatically entitle claimants to the enhanced rate.
Within the group who could walk up to 50 metres we wanted those who
face the greatest barriers to mobility to receive the enhanced rate and
the remainder the standard rate. In the second draft of the assessment
criteria we differentiated by the type of aid and appliance an
individual needed. In the final version of the criteria we
differentiate by distance, which we feel is
clearer.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031273000930" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130312/text/130312w0003.htm#13031273000930">In
the final draft individuals who cannot walk 20 metres can be
certain they will receive the enhanced rate, regardless of whether they
need an aid or appliance. Individuals who can walk distances longer
than 20 metres could still receive the enhanced rate,
depending on whether they can do so safely, to an acceptable standard,

where claimants' ability to carry out activities is affected on the
majority of days in the year, at any point on those days. We will be

Prisk:</Member></B> There are 249,000 overcrowded households in the
social sector, while nearly 1.5 million under-occupy. The removal of
the spare room subsidy should encourage more effective use of social
housing by encouraging tenants to move to properties suitable for the
size of their household, or taking in a lodger to occupy a spare
bedroom. The Localism Act, and the introduction of ‘Homeswap
Direct’, has made it easier for social tenants to
move.</hs_Para>
