Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Mr Iain Duncan
Smith):</Member></B> I welcome the Budget, which reiterates this
Government’s commitment to restoring the damaged economy that we
inherited. I remind hon. Members that the deficit—11.2% of
GDP—was the largest since the second world war, higher than that
of Germany, France and even the USA. The important point is that the
deficit fuelled a high debt burden—which had been set to rise
dramatically—of 65% of GDP and rising. In fact, if nothing had
changed, it was forecast that borrowing would have risen by more than
£200 billion during the course of the spending review. The
deficit has cost more than £42 billion in interest payments each
and every year since we entered office.

Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr Byrne), who is chuntering from a
sedentary position, says that he is concerned about borrowing. The
truth is that under Labour’s plans borrowing was set to rise by
another £200 billion, and under its existing plans its solution
for the problem of borrowing is to borrow more. Perhaps the right hon.

Member for Edinburgh South West (Mr Darling). Labour Members have been
banging on about capital spending over the past 48 hours, but it is
worth reminding everyone that while they now claim to want more capital
spending, it was set to fall by 7% under the Darling plan. The honest
truth is that, notwithstanding the euro crisis and the fact that the
rest of Europe is mired in recession, as shown by the situation in
Cyprus, the idea that there would have been a continuum and that all
would have been well is complete and utter
nonsense<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-22T09:37:05"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-22T09:37:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032262000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130322/debtext/130322-0001.htm#13032262000014">We

actually happening. I remind him that Labour’s capital spending
programmes would have resulted in a real cut of 7% compared with our

but under the plan they left, capital spending was falling fast. We are

the eurozone is expected to remain in recession throughout the year,
the UK is forecast for a slight increase in growth. This Budget will, I
believe, stimulate growth further still, so let us look at a few of its
important measures. We are further reducing the main rate of
corporation tax, which we had already lowered to 21%, to 20% from April
2015, down from the very high 28% inherited from Labour. It will now be
the lowest rate in the G20. We are also—this is really important
for my right hon. and hon. Friends, and for me it is the most important
measure in the Budget—merging small company and main rates of
tax at 20p. That had

are increasing capital spending by a further £3
billion more than our existing plans from 2015-16, meaning that the
Government will never cut capital to the levels planned by Labour
which, I remind hon. Members, would have reduced spending by 7% more
than our plans. We are taking measures to dramatically reinvigorate
both house buying and the construction industry in this country by
extending the excellent right-to- buy scheme, building 15,000 more
affordable homes and increasing fivefold the funds available for
building for rent. I remind colleagues that one of our biggest problems
in getting housing benefit under control is due to the failure of the
previous Government to allow enough houses to be built for rent, so
that measure will be a huge help. We are introducing Help to
Buy—a two-part scheme set over three years, committing
£3.5 billion into shared equity loans for new builds,
and offering new mortgage guarantees to support £130 billion of
mortgages. That is really important.</hs_Para>

conclusion, the Labour Opposition vote against our reforms again and
again. On welfare alone, they have voted against savings of £80
billion. That money needs to come from somewhere. They do not say where
it would come from, apart from borrowing. Once again, that is backward
logic: borrow more to cut borrowing; spend more to cut spending.
Meanwhile, the Government are changing the culture of welfare and
Government spending in the country. We are backing people who

it, Wednesday’s Budget was the final, definitive, categorical
proof that plan A has failed. Growth has halved; it will be lower this
year and next year than was forecast. The deficit is not falling; it is
static. The IFS said yesterday that the only way for the Chancellor to
bring the deficit down this year and ensure that it is lower than last
year would be to pay this year’s bills next year. Paul Johnson

concluded:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13032262000341" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130322/debtext/130322-0001.htm#13032262000341">“The

debt is not down; it is going through the roof because the
Government’s fiscal plans are in tatters. Borrowing is set to be
£245 billion higher than was forecast. We were promised that the
books would be balanced by 2015. That is a promise broken. According to
Wednesday’s figures, the national debt will not be falling until
2017-18.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032262000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130322/debtext/130322-0001.htm#13032262000089">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-22T10:08:34"></hs_TimeCode>
am glad that the Secretary of State raised the idea of the global race.
The House will have seen from the OBR’s figures on Wednesday
that the fabled rebalancing that we were promised is simply not
happening. Our exchange rate has fallen by 20% since 2007. Exports have
grown by 1%. Once upon a time, in its early days, the OBR said that the
export boost to GDP was set to be 1.2%. It now admits that net
trade is dragging down our economy by 0.8%. What a contrast that is to
20 years ago, when sterling depreciated by 18% and exports
grew by more than a third. Contrary to what the Secretary of State
says, the OBR says that our market share is deteriorating not because
the growth of our trading partners is slowing, but because our
exporters have become less competitive.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-22T10:09:59"></hs_TimeCode> Chancellor
was right to say on Wednesday that we are in a global race. The problem
is that we are set to lose it by setting sail for a low growth, low

as bad as the lack of action on the Work programme in the Budget were
the new surprises about universal credit. The Secretary of State and
others have given frequent assurances that the programme is on track,
but that raises the question: what on earth is the track? Earlier in
the week, we heard in the <I>Financial Times</I> that small businesses
were so badly prepared by HMRC for the introduction of real-time
information—the method by which payrolls will be updated to
calculate universal credit—that the Government have had to
U-turn again, only a few days before the change is being introduced.
The RTI system for businesses employing fewer than 50
people—covering about 7 million—will be slipped back by
six months. There are worries now, not just about the Work programme
and the lack of action on bringing down unemployment, but on universal
credit.</hs_Para>

I said earlier in the week, the ultimate test for the Secretary of
State is this: when he went to Easterhouse all those years ago, he
talked about the need for a jobs revolution in this country, but if we
now look at the 1% most-unemployed estates in our country, we
see that unemployment has not fallen over the first half of the
Parliament but gone up. It has gone up in three quarters of estates,
and long-term unemployment, which we are so worried about, has risen on
two thirds of those estates. This welfare revolution is falling apart,
and we needed a Budget for jobs this week to fix it.</hs_Para>

greatest tragedy is who will pay for this failure. We know that a host
of cuts, not least the bedroom tax, that are arriving in a couple of
weeks will hurt some of the most vulnerable people in our country.
Yesterday in Great Yarmouth, together with Lara Norris, I met a woman
called Sandra who had cerebral palsy. She has brought up five children,
but for reasons of her disability she sleeps separately from her
partner, who is her carer. She will be hit by this bedroom tax in a
couple of weeks. She now has to take decisions about switching off the
heating for half the week because she can no longer afford to heat her
home. She has to go to bed and snuggle up in an electric blanket in
order to stay warm. That is what is happening in our country, yet these
cuts will start on the same day as Britain’s richest citizens
are given a tax cut. It is wrong and we should have had action in the

Chancellor gave away a lot of things in the first year of the next
Parliament. Although we saw a little of how he will pay for
it—he is going to fast-track the flat-rate pension—this
is one of the great mysteries of this Budget, and we have not heard
much about it yet. When the Minister winds up, I hope he will confirm
at what rate the flat-rate pension will be introduced. The original
White Paper set the figure at £144, which I notice is lower than
£145, which is the combined total of pension credit and the
state pension set out in the Budget book on Wednesday. As we know, the
advance of the flat-rate pension offers the Treasury a huge national
insurance windfall of about £5.5 billion in 2016-17 and 2017-18.
What is

from public sector employers. The Library was able to tell me earlier

will face a bill for £1.6 billion in higher national

previous Government gave away £250 that could be put in a child
trust fund—either a cash fund or an equity fund. This Government
did not think that was affordable and introduced junior individual
savings accounts. As all those changes were unwrapped, some anomalies
emerged. Most people did not put in more money, which was what the
previous Government desired; rather, most people’s children had
just the £250. Firms are putting up their charging rates
disproportionately—for what is, in the case of equities,
essentially an index tracker—and people are locked into the

be frank, I feel a degree of sympathy for the financial services

does not even pay for the stamp on the statement at the end of the

converted into junior ISAs. I have not seen the detail—I am not
sure whether it has come out of the Treasury—but I would also
encourage the Treasury, as well as looking at actual transfers, to
consider allowing people, if they choose, to leave the fund to one side

Efford</B> (Eltham) (Lab):</Member> I want to talk
about housing, particularly in London, but before I do let me refer to
the millionaires’ tax cut that will come in in April.
It will benefit 13,000 individuals who earn more than £1 million
and have a combined income of £27.4 billion, and I am grateful
to the trade union Unison 
<?notus-xml column=1200?>for providing me with that figure. Those 13,000 people earn £27.4
billion, and the Government somehow think that in these times that cut
should be a priority for public expenditure. It is outrageous. The
Government are freezing child benefit for the third year running, and
the money could have been used to benefit 12 million children if child
benefit had been increased in line with the consumer prices index. I
wonder what the cash injection to the economy would have been if that
money had been given to families who would have spent it rather than on
providing a bonanza to 13,000 people. Imagine the letter from the
Chancellor of the Exchequer saying, “You’ve been selected
as one of 13,000 people to share in a £1.2725 billion payout
from Her Majesty’s Exchequer and all you have to do to qualify
is confirm in writing that you earned more than £1 million this
year.” What an absolute disgrace.</hs_Para>

look back on the criticisms of our benefit changes when we were in

changes and rules for people with disabilities—but now they sit
there, and that tax cut is their priority. At a time like this, when
the bedroom tax is being introduced, when wages are being frozen and
when unemployment is going up, as we have heard, this
Government’s priority is a tax cut for millionaires. I find that
absolutely shocking.</hs_Para>

about the impact of the Government’s planned assistance in the
absence of a significant improvement in the supply of housing. I know
they will say that they are planning to supply housing and that they
have a house building programme, but we have been hearing those honeyed
words since they came into office in 2010. In London we have seen a
slump in house building and we now have the lowest level of starts
since the 1920s. The Secretary of State has attacked the Labour
Government and made a great deal of saying that they built too few
homes—they did, and they certainly built too few socially rented
homes—but this Government are going even further.</hs_Para>

make sure that we build houses that are affordable, not just so that
people can live in those parts of London and fill the essential jobs in
the economy at the lower end of the pay scale but so that they can
become savers for the future. Unless we create that capacity in the
rental market so that people can live in houses that they can afford to
rent and, at the same time, afford to save, we will not have a

Budget and, indeed, the performance of the Chancellor and his team at
the Treasury have much to commend them. If we remember, three years
ago, UK plc was on the verge of economic collapse. We were living far
beyond our means, and the Chancellor’s emergency Budget in 2010
sought to address that problem. Two and a half years later, where are
we and what progress has been made? First, the deficit is indeed down
by a third. Annual borrowing has come down from £159 billion and
is almost under £120 billion. We have more men in work than ever
before, and we have more women in work than ever before. Indeed, the
amount claimed in jobseeker’s allowance in Braintree, my
constituency, has dropped by 11%. We have created more than 1.25
million jobs in the private sector. We have created 250,000 new
businesses, so the Chancellor, the Treasury and the Government have
much of which to be proud.</hs_Para>

is true, however, that growth has not been as robust as we would like,

and the inflationary impact of energy costs—a fact acknowledged
by Mr Chote and the OBR. The bottom line for many of our constituents

which has been raised to £10,000, will help, as there will be a
tax cut for more than 24 million families—or, in my
constituency, 38,391 families. Families, in fact, will pay roughly
£700 less than they did in 2010—2.7 million families will
be taken out of tax altogether, or, in my constituency, 3,905 families.

addresses future pensioners. Although the Budget did not address
directly the current pension generation, it is worth
remembering—as a Member of the House for nearly 15 years, I do
remember—that one of the early Budgets of the previous
Government resulted in a 25p increase in the basic pension, a miserly
sum which certainly angered my constituents at the time. We as a
coalition wanted to make sure that that could never happen again. That
is why the introduction of the triple lock ensures that there is always
a significant and generous increase in the basic state pension, and why
we have seen the biggest ever cash rise, which is worth £650
every year to people on the basic state
pension.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032262000218" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130322/debtext/130322-0001.htm#13032262000218">It
is also worth saying that the Government are making real progress on
social care reform, something that has long languished in the
“too difficult to do” drawer and has not been tackled by
successive Governments. As a former Minister, who was responsible for
setting up the Dilnot commission, I was convinced by its arguments and
argued inside Government for the implementation of its recommendations
for a cap on reasonable care costs and a more generous means test. It
is worth stressing that in our social care system today, for
residential care we have one of the meanest and most pernicious of
means tests anywhere in our welfare system, and it is good news that
the Chancellor has accepted that we should move on this and start the
new scheme from 2016. That is a long overdue reform that will give
peace of mind and encourage people to plan and prepare for their future
care needs. As I say, it has been a can that has been kicked down the
road for far too long. Yet one in 10 of us who need care will be faced
with the prospect of lifetime costs of more than £100,000, a
catastrophic cost and a lottery that we cannot insure ourselves
against. That again is why the introduction of the Dilnot proposals is
so
important<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-22T11:10:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

that the means test is amongst the meanest in our welfare state. At the
moment, one’s wealth—everything we have ever worked

cap at £72,000 and that means test gives individuals much more
certainty, and ensures that more than half of what a person starts with
will be protected, compared with losing 80%-plus under the current set
of arrangements. But 450,000 people fund their own care, and they will
need to come into this system. There is an essential need, which the

report of the Joint Committee on the Draft Care and Support Bill,
particularly its recommendation of an awareness campaign, which is
needed to ensure that people understand how those changes affect them
and their families, and that they get the right financial advice at the
right time. At the moment, 40% of people self-fund their care, and only
7% of them get financial advice. If they did so, we could probably

indeed from throughout the world. However, unemployment rates remain a
considerable source of concern. In the last year in my

representatives that they are doing all that they can to work with
employers to protect jobs, but that often comes at the cost of reduced
hours and pay cuts. This proportionate increase in part-time male
workers places greater strain on families who are already struggling to
make ends meet, and it goes some of the way to explaining the rising
tax credits and housing benefit bill. Families are being forced to turn
to the state as hours and pay are cut at the same time as living costs
rise, and that is before we consider the impact of under-employment in
the economy. The Office for National Statistics estimates that the
number of people who are under-employed has risen by 1 million since
2008. That is 1 million more people who want to work more hours, but

one of the biggest barriers that parents, particularly mothers, face,

possible start in life. But parents face the triple whammy of fewer
child care places, rising costs and reduced Government support. The
measures set out by the Government in the Budget do not even kick in
until the next Parliament and do nothing to help parents now. Even in
2015, the £750 million that the Government have identified pales

undermine the quality of child care, and are a real cause for concern.

adults and too many little children. There is no guarantee that the

that squeeze and rising costs, but I am not convinced that changing the
ratios is the answer. The Government need to ensure that the proposals
do not have the impact of driving down quality and making parents so
concerned about leaving their children in child care settings that they
opt not to return to work because they are worried about the time that
a carer will be able to spend with a child. I agree that this area
concerns us all. I am sure that it concerns the hon. Lady’s

comfort from what those outside the House say, such as the Federation

the Budget and the contribution that it believes it will make to
creating jobs, which is fundamentally what this is about. The CBI has
welcomed many of its initiatives on a micro-economic level. The main
people who are doing the business, not talking about it as we are
doing, are broadly supportive of many of the measures and recognise
that they will bring growth. I suspect that it is they who can give us
a non-partisan, objective look at what will happen. The measures on
national insurance, housing, fuel, the business bank—we await
further details on that—corporation tax and anti-avoidance are
significant moves towards what we all want: more jobs and people being

will now turn to the specifics. Over the past few years, particularly
the past two and a half years, there has emerged a thirst for social
enterprise, the use of local community development finance initiative
funds and housing to help drive change in local communities. At
present, the tax system does not go far enough to help to encourage
that. I and others have lobbied the Chancellor to encourage tax changes
so that we help mobilise private capital towards local community
development finance initiatives. CDFIs are vital, since the non-bank
CDFIs—this is a crucial difference—are running out of
money at a time when demand for their funds has never been higher, as a
result of the need for alternatives to high-interest lenders for
disadvantaged and financially excluded
communities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032262000234" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130322/debtext/130322-0001.htm#13032262000234">What<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-22T11:21:08"></hs_TimeCode>
does that actually mean in practice? Let me set the scene. Capital
funding for CDFIs has more than halved in the past two years. That
means that they do not have enough money to support the requests for
funding from CDFI initiatives. In fact, the demand for lending from
CDFIs rose by two thirds over the same period that their capital was
halved. The disbursals remain unchanged, but that poses a threat,
because 
<?notus-xml column=1210?>their balance sheets are getting weaker as a result of lending more
money. Members might be surprised to learn that barely 20 CDFI houses
have less that £500,000 left each for lending, which means that
at least half the sector is struggling and we are facing a
problem.</hs_Para>

some of the tax measures, such as the aptly named “community
interest tax relief”, with which I am sure all Members are
familiar, private sector support for those CDFI houses is low. Money is
going to the banking institutions that run community development
finance initiatives—banking CDFIs—which, of course, are
not focused entirely on lending to those who are slightly more
disadvantaged or to more of the social enterprises. However, under the
present tax regulations for CITR, those banks are claiming 70% of
virtually all the relief available. The wrong people, who are not
lending at community level, have most of the money and are getting most
of the tax relief. The Treasury has listened, or so it indicated in the
Budget, about the challenge that presents, and I am pleased to draw
Members’ attention to page 74 of the Red Book, where the
Treasury sets out that it will look at CITR and consider measures to
help social investment tax relief from private

I am arguing that we should tailor tax changes to the non-banking CDFIs
that would allow private capital to come in, in very small amounts if
necessary, as well as from small businesses that might want to take
their corporate social responsibilities to a level at which they just
want to fund local activities and be assured that those funds can go
into just those activities and that they do not necessarily have to
manage the whole programme. If the Treasury, as part of its review,
looks at measures that are more flexible and allow multiple different
types of vehicles to attract the tax relief, there will be advantages
for the investor and it will increase the capital of the CDFIs, some of
which are in danger of being unable to function for much longer.
A<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-22T11:24:54"></hs_TimeCode> more realistic
tax scheme would mobilise private capital towards those institutions,
and we could even start mobilising capital from very successful crowd
funding
exercises.</hs_Para><hs_Para tab="yes">That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-22T11:25:05"></hs_TimeCode>
brings me to an example that we are putting together in north London,
which alerted me to this problem in the first place. I have been ably
assisted by the local Member of the European Parliament, Syed Kamall,
and by my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-22T11:25:15"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Friend the Member for Richmond Park (Zac Goldsmith). Essentially, we
have been working on a scheme for north London crowd funding so that we
can back start-ups, particularly for young entrepreneurs who are
looking at it as an alternative to full employment. It is based on the
Kiva model— I recommend that 
<?notus-xml column=1211?>Members look at it—which derives capital from small loans from
individuals, and even an option for small and medium-sized enterprises
and corporations to meet their corporate responsibility ambitions. Kiva
is aimed at the third world.
An<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-22T11:25:51"></hs_TimeCode> individual
can give as little as £25 to the scheme and choose someone to
support. They do not make a profit, but they are lending at a
reasonably attractive rate to people starting small businesses, such as
shops. I want to change that and bring the model to north London so
that people can have a stake in investing in their community and roll
it out worldwide.
All<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-22T11:25:51"></hs_TimeCode> that I am
asking the Treasury to do, in its review, is try to introduce
attractive tax investment incentives, perhaps as simple as ticking a
box, so that the £25 can become £30 or the £10,000
can become £12,000. I think that it is a win-win
situation.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-22?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_22_PT_1/CEBF87E8D6B35E43E88EC25C5EF983EC47B078DB" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="22 March 2013">Friday

William Bain</B> (Glasgow North East) (Lab):</Member> In a previous era
of austerity presided over by a Tory-dominated Government, the slogans
on Conservative party posters in its failed 1929 general election
campaign included “Safety First” and “Trust
Baldwin he will steer you to safety”. Having presided over the
worst recovery in over 140 years, with an economy that is increasingly
plagued by low investment, falling real wages, low productivity, dismal
demand, stalled deficit reduction and surging public debt, the one
guarantee is that the Conservative party will not be using either of
those slogans in the name of the current Chancellor or Prime Minister

£10.47 a week in reduced support for child care for ordinary
families since 2011; the higher VAT, which is costing ordinary families
four times more in this Parliament than they will get back through the
rise in the personal allowance to £10,000 from next year; the 1%
cap on most benefits and tax credits being introduced in weeks, hurting
5.l million working-age households by as much as £5 a week on
average; and, most cruelly of all, the vicious bedroom tax. The
cumulative loss to ordinary families’ living standards in
Scotland resulting from the tax, benefits and wages policies pursued by
the Government has been quantified by Landman Economics for the TUC 
<?notus-xml column=1212?>as £28.63 a week, or £1,488 a year, by 2015. What has it

G20, the fifth worst industrial production in the European Union and
the fourth biggest slump in real wages in the EU. The judgment of the
Office for Budget Responsibility on the Budget has been
brutal—growth downgraded this year and next, by 0.8% of GDP,
even since last December’s autumn statement; this Budget adding
nothing to growth all the way through to 2018; borrowing £245
billion more than promised in 2010; and the national debt doubled by

three quarters of economic output. Real wages have slumped by 3.2%

lower in real terms since 2009. This week’s OBR projections mean
a further loss of £200 a year in wages—four times more
than any benefit from the increase in the personal tax allowance next
year. The Chancellor should have eased that burden by cutting VAT to
17.5% in the Budget and putting back some of the £480 a year on
average that he removed from average families in the June 2010 Budget.

costs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032262000250" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130322/debtext/130322-0001.htm#13032262000250"><B><Member ContinuationText="Jane Ellison" PimsId="5710" UID="13032262000506" xid="1010" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130322/debtext/130322-0001.htm#13032262000506">Jane

a different path. Continuing with the fiscal policy that the Government

I was saying, HMRC has shown that in the year to last December, the
amount of additional support, through the tax and benefit system
provided to ordinary Scottish families with their child care costs,
amounted to a miserly 1p a day extra. For this year, next year and the
year after, the message from the Chancellor in the Budget was,
“Not a penny
more.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032262000253" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130322/debtext/130322-0001.htm#13032262000253">Under
the plans unveiled on Tuesday, households require all earners to be
working and paying income tax to benefit either from the child care tax
relief or the additional resource through universal credit, which will
have to be found from elsewhere in the welfare budget. We see the gross
unfairness of a two-earner couple with 
<?notus-xml column=1213?>children, working part time on a combined income of £19,000 a
year, receiving nothing under the plans, whereas a household with two
earners on a combined income of £299,000 a year receives a tax
break of £2,400 a year if they have two children. How on earth
can that be

Chancellor should have brought forward more capital investment in the
Budget. He should have announced a major social and affordable house
building plan to begin this year. All he announced was a plan to
reallocate capital spending from 2015, which will be of no help to the
struggling construction sector now. He should have taken the
opportunity to scrap the bedroom tax affecting nearly 90,000 households
in Scotland.</hs_Para>

Chancellor has spent the past few months searching for escape velocity
for the UK economy. Wednesday was the day when he finally crashed to
earth. He will not change course because he puts his pride before this
nation’s economic fall. He would rather that the living
standards of millions were diminished than admit the scale of his
mistake or take action to put it right. Only with a new policy to
promote growth and boost investment will we generate the tax revenues
to cut our debt. After this Budget, that can come only with the
election of a new Government to replace this disastrous
coalition.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13032262000384" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130322/debtext/130322-0001.htm#13032262000384">11.34

Baker</B> (Wycombe) (Con):</Member> I am glad to follow the hon. Member
for Glasgow North East (Mr Bain), who talked about bad economics, which
will be the central theme of my speech. He also asked why there has not
been growth. I refer him to the report “Thinking the
Unthinkable”, which has the unfortunate subtitle “Project
Armageddon—the final report” by Tullett Prebon. It
explains that three of the UK’s eight largest
industries—real estate, financial services and
construction—accounting for 39% of the economy, are incapable of
growth now that net private borrowing has evaporated.</hs_Para>

goes on to say that another three of the top sectors—health,
education and public administration, plus defence—account for a
further 19% and cannot expand now that growth in public spending is a
thing of the past. That means that 58% of the economy is ex growth, a
figure that could rise to 70% if, as seems probable, growth in
retailing is precluded by falling real consumer incomes. That is why
there is no growth, and it is important to understand properly why we
are in this mess.</hs_Para>

£10,000 personal allowance and so on. I am sure that my
constituents will be glad to know that fuel duty will be 13p lower per

want to talk mostly about credit market interventions and monetary
activism. I am particularly reminded of the curious fact that the
general disinclination to explain the past boom by monetary factors has
been quickly replaced by an even greater readiness to hold the current
working of our monetary organisation exclusively responsible for our
current plight.</hs_Para>

it might last indefinitely because prices did not rise, now believe

superficial view sees no other harmful effect of a credit expansion but
the rise of a price level now has it that our only difficulty is a fall
in the price level caused by credit contraction. I thoroughly recommend
the preface to “Monetary Theory and the Trade Cycle”,
published in 1932, since which little has changed when it comes to the
error of the monetary
stabilisers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032262000260" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130322/debtext/130322-0001.htm#13032262000260">We

particularly to feedback from Stewart Linford chair makers in my

remained competitive by increasing the quality of his product and
exporting. Yesterday, he said to me:</hs_Para>

battle going on? If we look at debt in the past 10 or 13 years, we find
that the big story of banking and money is a great transformation in
borrowing. In about 2002-03, under the previous Government, mortgage
lending rose substantially. Eventually, the banking system blew itself
up and mortgage lending collapsed and deficit spending by the
Government took over.</hs_Para>

the money supply back to 1997, we find that under the previous
Government it tripled. In 1997, M4 was £693 billion; by 2010, it
had risen to £2.2 trillion before stagnating. That
chart, if well understood, is remarkable. It tells us that there was an
accelerating rush to destruction in debt. Shortly, we will realise that
while we were originally told that this was a banking crisis and then
that it was a debt crisis, we will have to face up to the reality that
what we use as money is debt—debt that was loaned into existence
in response to incentives created by central bankers lowering interest
rates.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032262000264" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130322/debtext/130322-0001.htm#13032262000264"><Member ContinuationText="Mr Kevan Jones" PimsId="1213" UID="13032262000509" xid="318" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130322/debtext/130322-0001.htm#13032262000509"><B>Mr

when the Labour Government came into office in 1997, debt stood at 42%

reason for its increasing was the fact that we had to bail out the

bound to create an increase in trade and housing and to create a small
housing boom. The problem is the damage it does to the rest of the

problem being that for far too long people have persisted in believing

to increase the supply of money in order to pump up the GDP figure and
so manipulate people’s expectations. It is hoped that by
manipulating people’s expectations the economy will come back

Government’s housing stimulus fails to recognise that the
economy in the regions is not just stalling but in recession, and that
rebalancing the economy is about boosting the construction industry in
places like east Lancashire. This Budget fails to achieve that. It does
nothing to tackle the shocking state of much of the housing stock in
constituencies such as mine. It is worth putting it on the record again
that there are wards in my constituency with over 70% non-decent homes
in the private sector. Cutting VAT on property refurbishments would
have been a much better move in these areas, because it would have

statement he released, we would not have a housing crisis. As a result
of all these Government announcements, house building has fallen, rents
are rising, home ownership is becoming a harder, not an easier, goal
for young families to achieve, and homelessness has risen. The new
homes bonus announced by the Government in 2010 was supposed to unleash
growth and build at least 400,000 additional homes, but it has failed

to be reduced further, because, on average, it is very hard for
Governments to get more than 38% of GDP in taxation—if it

Rees-Mogg:</Member></B> There is a union of people whose seats have
“North East” in their names and who make helpful
interventions. I am extremely grateful to the hon. Gentleman because he
leads me right to my next point, which is about the absolute essence of
where growth will come from. I refer right hon. and hon. Members to
page 56 of the “Economic and fiscal outlook” produced by
the Office for Budget Responsibility, which contains charts on
household leverage indicators. That is crucial because about
three-quarters of the economy is dependent on private consumption. What
we needed, and what has taken time, is for household budgets and
balance sheets to rebalance at the same point as the Government balance
sheet and budget.</hs_Para>

these charts we see that income leverage—interest payments as a
percentage of income—is now at an historic low. That is
important because it means that households can now afford to spend.
Even more important, asset leverage is back alongside historic
averages, so households are no longer over-geared in the way they were
in 2007 and 2008. I actually think that the figure on household
leverage is overstated because there is still a lot of bad debt in the
system that the banks have been reluctant to write off because of
concerns over their balance sheets.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-22T11:56:23"></hs_TimeCode>That is what has
happened over the past few years. By following stable and sensible
policies, the Government have allowed households to shore up their
balance sheets, which means that they will now be in a position to
begin to spend again should they wish.</hs_Para>

looked at the big macro picture of two crucial things—Government
expenditure under control, and household balance sheets
restored—it is worth considering some of the positive detail
within the Budget. The £2,000 cut in national insurance for
businesses is fantastic. We know that small businesses are the ones
that create new jobs—a series of data from the United States
show that, on average, large companies shed 1 million jobs a year,
while small companies create just over 1 million jobs a year. The
reason for that is straightforward: large companies are always looking
to cut costs, but small companies are where new ideas are built up.
Anything that helps small businesses is welcome and national insurance
is a very bad tax on jobs. I hope that ultimately the Government will
look at national insurance in the round, but that will need to be in a
time of boom, rather than a time of austerity.</hs_Para>

other policy that is relevant to today’s debate, which was
opened by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and
Pensions, is the £10,000 tax threshold. That is a joy to behold
because it gets us away from the taxation and benefits merry-go-round
where people on low incomes are taxed and then given back some of their
own money, once the Government have taken a cut for administration. We
want to get that threshold as high as possible so that we do not tax 
<?notus-xml column=1220?>people and then give them benefits. We want to get people out of that
altogether, and out of the dependency culture that exists when we tax
people on low incomes.</hs_Para>

measure has a further benefit if it can be extended and if the national
insurance threshold can be raised, because that will reduce the
administration of employment. If the national insurance threshold can
be raised towards the £10,000 tax threshold, employers will be
able to pay their employees without having a big administrative burden
on top. I hope the Government will look at that as it would be a
fantastic boost to employment. I think it could possibly be paid for
simply by shifting the band for employees national insurance into line
with the increase that would be made from the current level to
£10,000. I accept there would be a gap on employers, but that
might be minimised by doing it in the way I

hon. Member for Hyndburn (Graham Jones) spoke of the
Government’s housing scheme. It is potentially a very exciting
scheme, and the most important part of the Budget. There has been some
talk of the risk, but I believe there is very little risk. I have had a
look at the house prices figures produced by the Land Registry from
2008 to date, and at inflation over the same period. If we combine the
two, we see that house prices on the Land Registry index have fallen in
real terms by nearly 25% since 2008, which means that the scheme is
being introduced at a point when house prices are sustainable, and when
the risk to the Government’s balance sheet is limited. The
scheme has the great potential not only to allow people to buy
properties for the first time or to move into better properties, but
all that goes with that, such as refurbishment, extra spending on DIY
and so on. The measure could be a boost to consumer expenditure as well
as free up the housing
market.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032262000305" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130322/debtext/130322-0002.htm#13032262000305">I

Karen Buck</B> (Westminster North) (Lab):</Member> We have
heard a great deal in the Budget debate—not
unreasonably—about public debt, but less about the private
sector crisis that generated the public sector debt crisis. We have
also heard about the impact of private debt and deleveraging, including
from the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-22T12:01:20"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Member for North East Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg). In that context, it
might be worth mentioning that private debt and deleveraging are
connected with the substantial decline in the number of people who can
afford their own homes because of house price inflation in the past
decade. That feeds into the core of my argument on the extent to which
housing and housing costs have led us to a crisis in the welfare
state.</hs_Para>

less in the debate about flatling growth, the crisis in unemployment
and under-employment, and the crisis in real wages and living
standards. It is worth noting that real wages fell by 0.7% last year,
and that average earnings will have fallen by 2.4% over the course of
this Parliament. That fall in purchasing power is contributing to the
continued stalling of
growth.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032262000309" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130322/debtext/130322-0002.htm#13032262000309">Unfortunately,
housing costs are at the heart of the living standards crisis,
particularly in respect of first-time buyers, younger people, and those
in what we call generation rent. Home owners have benefited for a
decade or so from low interest rates. The tragedy is that many people
are not aware of the fact that low interest rates are sustaining lower
mortgages. A third of home owners have interest-only mortgages, and are
extremely vulnerable to a future rise in interest
rates.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032262000310" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130322/debtext/130322-0002.htm#13032262000310">Shelter
has demonstrated consistently the crisis in home affordability. Some
7.8 million people struggle to pay their rents and mortgages, and 2.8
million people rely on unauthorised overdrafts and payday loans on a
regular basis to cover the cost of their mortgage or rent. With
underemployment and the continuing flatlining of real wages, that
situation will only get
worse.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032262000311" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130322/debtext/130322-0002.htm#13032262000311">In
turn, that has contributed to a dramatic rise in the number of people
who are caught in generation rent—they cannot save for a deposit
and cannot get a mortgage because of the high house prices we have seen
for generations. Two million more people now rent in the private sector
than 10 years ago—26% of all Londoners now rent privately. That
driver into the private rented sector has led to an escalation in
rents, particularly in London. London rents now average £2,200 a
month. Naturally enough, people are unable to afford such bills. That
explains why the housing benefit bill has risen. It is due not to
Government policy, but to the increased case load in the private rented
sector, together with unemployment and flatlining wages. The
Government, despite their rhetoric, will spend £12 billion more
in real terms on housing benefit in this comprehensive spending review
period than the last Government spent under the previous comprehensive
spending review. That was the figure before the Office for Budget
Responsibility upgraded that expenditure this

175,000 new homes and a £30 billion boost

buyers and second home owners, rather than the young. Mervyn King, of
the Bank of England, has warned that the mortgage guarantee is not the
answer to the housing crisis. It will stoke up house prices and
continue to freeze younger homebuyers out of the housing market, which
will keep them locked in generation rent. That will in turn lead to an

they have been told to reach— 25 sanctions per week,
when they are only finding six. They are clearly frightened for their
own jobs. I blame the Government who are asking everyone but themselves
to take the blame for their failed economic policies. They are now
setting up my community to fail, just so they can meet their own
targets.</hs_Para>

is why the independent review into the use of sanctions in the Work
programme is critical. I trusted Ministers when, on Tuesday, they
claimed that there are no targets whatsoever. I now see that that means
that they are either simply admitting that they do not know 
<?notus-xml column=1224?>what goes on in their own Department, or that they were not giving us

to get to the bottom of this problem, and to understand just how out of

right hon. Friend the Member for East Ham (Stephen Timms) set out 10
questions for the inquiry. I would add another: are sanctions being
made to reach a target to help ensure that the Department for Work and
Pensions reaches its own budgetary requirement? The clock is ticking
for Ministers to come clean about what is going on, and to stop saying
that there are no targets for sanctions in the Department. They
admitted to newspapers last night that the whistleblower e-mail that I
brought forward was true, yet today the Secretary of State has tried to
claim that it is not. The clock is ticking. I urge others not to be
frightened and to use the whistleblower legislation to come forward and
tell the truth, so that the independent review can hear what is really
going on.</hs_Para>

too important. We must get welfare right. We have a system that, yes,
offers something for something, and, yes, uses sanctions where
appropriate, but this is not appropriate. This is not about behaviour;
this is about budgetary targets. This is about telling people,
“However hard you are working does not matter to us, we will
penalise you.” That is not fair. That is not right. That is not
appropriate in the 21st century. It will do nothing to help this
country get back on its feet, and the Government should be ashamed that
this is happening.</hs_Para>

want to focus on the importance of jobs and of getting people back to
work, and I will pick up on the proposed child care scheme. Two things
in particular struck me about Wednesday’s Budget, the first
being the level of complacency among the Government about the economic
challenges facing the country and the second, no less concerning, being
the lack of imagination, leadership and vision in coming up with
solutions to get our economy moving and get to people into
work.</hs_Para>

thinking about what to say, I read the transcript of the last two
days’ Budget debate. The speeches fell into two categories.
Government Members welcomed initiatives such as the 1p cut in beer tax
and the cancelled rise in fuel duty—all fine, as far as it
goes—and Opposition Members talked about the tough reality of
their constituents’ lives, about people struggling to make ends
meet and to find or stay in work. Government Members would then attack
us, claiming that we were talking our country down. I ask myself,
“What underlies this difference between the speeches?”
There might be an element of political points scoring or a desire to
get a headline, but in truth—perhaps I am being too
generous—we all see our country through different
eyes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-22T12:17:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

stagnating, flatlining economy affects different parts of the country
dramatically differently. When the Chancellor and the Prime Minister
slap each other on the back about private sector job creation, I
realise that they do not see the queues outside their local jobcentres
that I see every week. When the Chancellor argues against capping
bankers’ bonuses, I realise that he does not immediately think,
as I do, “Hang on a minute. There are hundreds of bankers in
this country who will earn more in one year than my father will earn in
his lifetime.” When he proposes a scheme to help people buy
second homes, I realise he will not be sat in an advice surgery this
afternoon, listening to people so far from being able to afford to buy
a home, that all they say to me is that they just want to be able to
rent a decent property at a price they can afford.</hs_Para>

see little in the Budget that will bring genuine hope to my
constituents, particularly those already paying the heaviest price for
the mistakes of others. Last month, in Lewisham East, 3,517 people were
claiming jobseeker’s allowance, which compares with about 900 in
the Prime Minister’s constituency. There are 500 more people on
the dole in my constituency than there were in 2010, and youth
unemployment and long-term unemployment are up. So where was the good
news for those people on Wednesday? The Government have at least
listened to the Opposition’s calls for national insurance
reductions for small and medium-sized businesses—and about time
too—but where is the vision for the jobs of the
future<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-22T12:19:00"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032264000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130322/debtext/130322-0002.htm#13032264000007">The
Government pay lip service to creating a low-carbon economy, but then
fundamentally undermine investment in renewables with other decisions,
whether on feed-in tariffs or planning policy. When they talk about
removing barriers to work, such as the sky-high costs of child care,
they say, “Sorry, you have to wait two and a half years until we
introduce it.”</hs_Para>

to help people with child care costs is welcome, but it has to be seen
in the context of real-terms cuts to tax credits and maternity pay. It
is a case of giving with one hand and taking away with the other.
According to a Daycare Trust survey, child care costs—whether
for nursery care, childminders or after-school clubs—have risen
by over 5% in the last year. In London, nursery costs for children
under two are 25% higher than elsewhere in the country. In fact, the
average cost for nursery care of this sort is £5 an hour, so a
full-time working mum buying 50 hours of nursery care a week has to
find £14,000 a year. No wonder people say it is like having a
second mortgage. Will the Minister say how far the new child care
scheme will make inroads into the costs that parents have to pay? How
do we know that it will not just drive up prices further? How much of
this money is actually
new<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-22T12:20:33"></hs_TimeCode>? Child care
is one of the biggest barriers to accessing the limited jobs that
exist. When I speak to my constituents—by and large, people who
are desperate to get back into work—it is clear that what they
need is real help with meeting these costs.</hs_Para>

hope this change is part of a broader shift on energy-intensive
industries. I think we have realised that we can no longer tax such
businesses out of production in the UK. It does no good for our economy
or our manufacturing base if we export these jobs. The production then
goes abroad, where environmental controls are less rigorous and
pollution is often greater, so we increase global carbon emissions and
also lose worthwhile jobs. We have already lost the aluminium industry
in this country thanks to cumulative taxation and we do not want to see
the glass, paper, steel or ceramics industries go the same
way.</hs_Para>

also welcomed the new tax regime for shale gas in the Budget. I regard
shale as a potentially important new energy source that we need to see
exploited in an environmentally sound manner. We are seeing it
exploited right around the world. The technology behind it is improving
at every stage. People have rightly expressed fears about contamination
of water supplies, which are beginning to be addressed, but shale has a
potentially paradigm-shifting capacity. What we have seen in America
will not necessarily occur in the UK. It is absolutely right that we
begin to explore shale—just as the Chinese and other European
countries are—both onshore and, potentially, offshore. We need
the technology and innovation to do that and we need a suitable
taxation system.</hs_Para>

involved in shale gas production need to take the communities with them
and to have a social licence to produce it, but I urge Ministers to
think more creatively. The great loss from North sea oil was that
unlike Norway we did not create a sovereign wealth fund out of our oil
riches. If we gain riches from shale, should we not consider a
sovereign wealth fund? I will leave Ministers to mull on that
idea.</hs_Para>

I am focused on industry and energy, let me highlight a contemporary
crisis affecting industry here and now. As we speak, gas storage in
this country is under 10% and this morning the Bacton gas connection to
Belgium broke down. The price of gas hit £1.25 per therm when it
is usually about 60p per therm. There is a real danger that kilns will
have to close in north Staffordshire and that brickworks will close
down, and I do not think that there is the necessary urgency from
Ministers in Department of Energy and Climate Change or the Department
for Business, Innovation and Skills about what is happening with the
gas supply. That points towards a broader issue about gas storage: if
we want rebalancing and want our industries to improve, we must ensure
that we have a much greater system of gas storage in this
country.</hs_Para>

am proud to represent an industrial constituency and I welcome some of
the pre-Budget announcements on an industrial strategy, particularly
that about the aerospace technology institute. I also welcome the
adoption of 81 out of 89 of Lord Heseltine’s recommendations,
particularly those on a single local growth fund. That is exactly the
devolution of funding we want to see and a rightful acknowledgement
that those in town halls often know a great deal more than those in
Whitehall. As the Financial Secretary is on the Front Bench, let me say
that we look forward to the upcoming announcements on city deals. I
know that Stoke-on-Trent and Staffordshire have been working very hard
to ensure that the Treasury is happy with what they are doing.

that <hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-22T12:26:59"></hs_TimeCode>must lie
the acknowledgement that it is all too little, too late. The spending
on infrastructure should have happened at the beginning of the
Parliament, not more than halfway through it. As the Deputy Prime
Minister has said, the Government should have not come to power and
unleashed such capital spending cuts. The local growth fund could have
been managed by regional development agencies, but the Government came
in and abolished them. They are now realising that local enterprise
partnerships often do not have the capacity and co-ordination to

Budget and beginning again. Over the past few years, we have seen a

the product of slashing spending, sucking demand out of the economy,
the rhetoric of doom and gloom and the undermining of confidence. That

because millions of people face declining living standards while
millionaires get a tax cut; it is incompetent, because the Chancellor

clarify the details of the spare homes subsidy; and political game

billion-worth of revenue underspends, and £2.1 billion of
capital underspends in Government Departments—a staggering
£9.8 billion in total. All of that was apparently done so that
the Chancellor could present the illusion of a tiny drop in public
sector net borrowing and make up for other accounting errors such as
the 4G auction, which raised £1 billion less than he promised in
the autumn statement. The consequences are serious. Opposition Members
have rightly demanded to know which services, which spending, which

appears, however, that that is precisely what they have done this year,
with the Department for International Development underspending by a

Doughty:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman has clearly not looked at the
record, because in fact we tripled the aid budget, made a commitment to
the 0.7% target and, indeed, made a commitment to a law on 0.7%, which
this Government have done, too, but have not put into
practice.</hs_Para>

Government will get full credit from me if they meet the 0.7% aid
target, but given the revelations on the underspend and the fantasy
figures elsewhere in the Budget, why should we accept their assurances?
There is another serious consequence of the underspend. We already know
the stark facts that the OBR has halved its growth forecast for this
year, and downgraded its forecast for next year. Since the
comprehensive spending review in 2010, the UK economy has grown by just
0.7%, compared with 5.3% predicted at the time. The economy shrank 0.3%
in the last quarter, and we now face the stark prospect—although
I seriously hope not— of a triple-dip recession, which
is why this forced underspending is deeply irresponsible, as by itself
it could further hasten a slip into a triple dip, particularly in the
absence of serious measures in the Budget to promote
growth.<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

constituents who will face the consequences, the unfairness and the
hardship over the coming months, such as the nearly one in 10 young
people locally in Cardiff South and Penarth who now have to claim

longer. The number of those claiming for 12 months or more
is up by 22.6%. Each month of that 
<?notus-xml column=1230?>is another month of frustration, anger, hardship, wasted talent and
wasted value. Others affected are the constituents whom I met in the
east of Cardiff, who have lost their jobs in the construction industry
because of this Government’s failure to deliver infrastructure
or housing, the disabled couple in Grangetown who fear the bedroom tax,
while they see millionaires offered a spare home subsidy and a tax cut

could not be a starker representation of the Chancellor’s and
the Prime Minister’s Britain than the staggering rise of food
banks, which have seen an eye-watering 198% increase in use in Wales in
just the past year. No wonder the Prime Minister wants to keep the
cameras away on his visit. The reasons for people in Wales having to
use food banks say it all: 43% of people going to a food bank say they
are doing it because of benefit delays or changes, 25% are doing it
because they are on low income, and 10% are doing it because they are
in debt. So we see debt rising at the top and debt rising at the
bottom. That is life in Tory and Lib Dem

instead of leaving only seven out of 576 projects completed. They could

could have delivered a VAT cut that would have done far more for
hard-pressed consumers than small duty cuts, however welcome. They

Nottingham beer drinkers, local pubs and our excellent local breweries
have been pressing for a review of the tax on beer, and I have raised
it with Treasury Ministers on numerous occasions. I am delighted that
the Chancellor has taken the decision to cut the price of a pint. I
know that the Prime Minister has promised to take action to tackle
multi-buy offers on alcoholic drinks. It is not at all clear how he
intends to do that, now that his Home Secretary has turned him over on
minimum unit pricing, but he has allowed the Chancellor to offer this

there was not much else to cheer in the Chancellor’s

challenges facing our economy. He seems oblivious to the need for bold
action to kick-start the economy and so create the jobs that we badly
need in Nottingham. Yesterday on Radio 4 the Chancellor blamed his
dismal economic failure on 
<?notus-xml column=1231?>the difficult conditions he has faced as has tried to plot a course
towards the peak of growth. But, as any mountaineer knows, there is no
such thing as the wrong weather, only the wrong clothes. The Chancellor

rather than adopting a disastrous austerity programme which left the UK

will not shift in the 12 months ahead. It has stayed where it is thanks

who are sick or disabled, things are even worse, as they face cuts to
services, cuts to council tax support, and the unfair and unworkable
bedroom tax, which will leave more than 1,500 of my constituents with
nowhere to go. Families are turning to food banks as they struggle to
cope with the impact of higher VAT, cuts to tax credits and the freeze
on child benefit. The Chancellor promises help with child care, not now

crisis, historically and all over the world, we have seen people moving
towards blaming scapegoats, attacking weaker and poorer communities and
trying to damage the interests of those who are not in their own
environment. Today the potential for this global economic crisis can be
seen in Europe with the rise of neo-Nazi groups in countries such as
Hungary and Greece in the EU, and potentially in some other countries.
We have to remember that it started in 2008 in the United States with
the Lehman Brothers collapse, not with a policy determined and decided
by the Labour Government in this country, as some Government Members
would have us believe. It was a global, western European, north

the 1930s, at the time of a similar global economic crisis, bold
measures were eventually taken by some countries in an attempt to solve

spend 0.7% of GDP on international development and aid projects. Over
the past couple of years we have seen some fudging at the edges, as

also want to highlight what is happening with levels of unemployment.
At a superficial level, because more people are in work the Government
are claiming that everything seems to be fine. We have the paradoxical
situation in which real living standards and real wages are falling,
yet despite the double-dip recession and the flatlining economy more
people are in work. However, if we dig into the statistics for the
Ilford South constituency this week, we see that between February 2012
and February 2013, although the number of young people unemployed and
registered for the claimant count is down, the number over 12 months of
people out of work has gone up by 44%. The number of over-25s who have
been claiming for more than two years in my constituency has gone up
from 140 to 420—a 200% increase in one year. It seems to me that
the organisations being used by the Department are concentrating on
getting people into low paid jobs quickly but not on those who might
have mental health or alcohol problems, poor work records or a lack of
confidence. The difficult cases are there, and they will add up in the
future. That is really worrying.</hs_Para>

the effects of the downturn for housing on other sectors. The emergency
Budget slashed housing spending and capital expenditure on schools and

spent in the same period. There is an idea that this is somebody

main concern—I think this is true of all other London
Members—is the housing problems and the housing crisis in
London. My borough of Islington is one of the smaller London boroughs,
but it has at least 13,000 families on the priority needs list. The
council, to its absolute credit, is doing a great deal to build new
council housing, which is of high quality, innovative, energy efficient
and imaginatively designed, often in restricted and small spaces.
However, it is nowhere near meeting the demands and needs of large
numbers of people in priority need. Therefore, my borough, like every
other borough, puts people into the private sector, where rents are not
restricted. The benefit cap will make it impossible for tenants to pay
those rents and they will be asked to make a contribution
themselves<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-22T13:04:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032264000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130322/debtext/130322-0002.htm#13032264000079">A
local authority report notes that a large number of our
schoolchildren—1,000 of them—are affected by the benefit

asked to find £200 a week to contribute to their private sector
rent. If they are on benefits, it is obviously impossible for them to
find that money—it is £10,000 a year. The only way they
can be accommodated is to move them out of the borough. Those in my
borough are always offered a place in Greater London. Nevertheless,
that means disruption for children in schools, and the break-up of
family and community networks, which is damaging and corrosive to the
whole of our society.</hs_Para>

private rented sector and on the levels of rent charged, but to deal
with this housing crisis—and it is a crisis—we must
empower local authorities to take over private rented accommodation
that is badly run or ludicrously expensive, and also give them enhanced
powers to take over the large numbers of empty properties that are part
of land banking throughout London. We have the insulting aspect of
people in desperate need living in overcrowded accommodation while
nearby properties are often deliberately kept vacant by wealthy, often
foreign, investors, who see it as land banking for some speculative
gain in the future. What is going on is simply wrong. Housing must be a
priority and a right for everyone. If every child had somewhere decent,
safe and secure to live, that would be a real legacy, not this gift to
those who wish to make a great deal of money out of housing
speculation, which is what the Budget offers.</hs_Para>

Front Benchers kindly describe our current situation as the economy
“flatlining”. Actually, we are in an ongoing recession.
Some 2.5 million people are unemployed. I am considerably older than
everybody else in the Chamber and remember the days of full employment.
In my youth, unemployment of 2.5 million would have been seen as a
catastrophe. At times, unemployment fell to a tenth of its present
level. Let us not be too kind to the Government. The economy is not
flatlining; we are in an ongoing

must focus on the continuing economic illiteracy of the Treasury. Its
consistent mistakes over decades have put us in this situation. Two
years ago, I made a speech in this Chamber in which I referred to the
view of Paul Krugman, among others, that the Government were going in
precisely the wrong direction. I agreed with him then and I keep
repeating that because in politics, one has to repeat things to ensure
that they register. It is instructive to look at the history.</hs_Para>

was a similar situation in the 1920s. After the first world war
there was big government debt, and the Government introduced what
became known as the Geddes axe—pubic expenditure
cuts—which drove up unemployment and poverty, and resulted in
low growth. At the end of the 1920s—surprise,
surprise—deficits were bigger, not smaller. In the 1930s, we had
a period, similar to now, when the Conservatives and their friends were
in charge. In Prime Minister’s questions, I asked the Prime
Minister whether he wanted to be remembered as the President Hoover of
our times, whose draconian cuts drove the world, not just America, into
the great depression. He made a sarcastic reply—I suppose that
was understandable; I was being slightly humorous with him—that
I understood later to be a reference to Benny Hill. I would rather
refer to John Maynard Keynes and to Paul Krugman, but obviously the
Prime Minister is more inspired by the wisdom of Benny Hill.</hs_Para>

contrast, in 1945, government debt was three times what we have now,

1950s they carried on with the same sorts of policies. In the 1940s,
1950s and 1960s, we saw full employment most of the time. We had the
occasional 
<?notus-xml column=1242?>hiccup, but essentially it was a full-employment era. We saw living
standards rise and poverty fall, and a much better world than we had
ever had before. Indeed, the world was being run so well, I thought we
should carry on like that. Instead, somebody reinvented the
19th century, and went back to the kind of neo-liberal

superficial analogy with personal household incomes has been drawn time

expenditure is greater than their income, we get the mea culpa effect,
because people finish up in penury, but Governments and economies are
not like that. One person’s spending becomes another
person’s income, and so on, and we get this circular flow of
income, which generates jobs, wealth and tax revenues. Economies do not
work like family incomes, as Keynes explained many times in very simple
terms. I used to try and explain it to my students as well. Economies
are not like households, so I hope that we can dismiss this simplistic

have to invest, to start building again and to reflate the economy. We
will do that by driving up employment in labour intensive areas, and
the most labour intensive sectors are those such as construction and
public services. We get much more bang for our buck from investing in
those areas than from cutting taxes. The money saved by doing the
latter leaks away to the better-off and frequently into tax havens,
which brings no benefit to the economy, whereas direct spending on
building more houses, for example, has beneficial and rapid effects on
the economy. The other great advantage of construction and public
services is that they have a low import content, which means that we do
not get leakages in imports—not in the first round at least. It

they do not have the opportunities that people such as him took for
granted when they were growing up. I meet people in Croydon North week
in and week out who are desperate for a job so that they can make more
of their lives. I met a young mum on the steps of a supermarket in
South Norwood who burst into tears when she told me that she and her
husband, both in low-paid work, could no longer make ends meet because
of the rising cost of housing, heating and child care, all of which
have been made worse by the Government’s decision to clobber
them with the strivers tax and a hike in VAT. She told me that they had
done everything the Government had asked them to—worked hard for
qualifications, got themselves jobs and bought a modest home—but
now they felt desperate and abandoned by a Government who do not seem
to care. This Government do not offer them aspiration, only
desperation.</hs_Para>

want to concentrate on welfare issues, given the subject of
today’s debate. At every opportunity, the Government appear to
be undermining the economic foundations that are the route to recovery
in the most deprived communities in our country. Constraints on family
budgets, wage cuts, and decimated social security budgets have led to a
loss of confidence, which in turn has pushed demand out of the local
economy. The latest figures detailing the impact of Government cuts and
benefit changes on those on the lowest incomes show that a single
parent working full time on the minimum wage will lose £415 this
year; taken with the previous two years, the total loss is nearly
£1,000<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-22T13:41:16"></hs_TimeCode>.
Over the same period, a single person working full time on the minimum
wage will lose £706, and a family with two children, and two
parents working, one full time, one part time, will lose £1,197.
Those examples do not take into account other cuts that have affected
working families. Child tax credit for babies under one was cut from
April 2011; and the child trust fund has been cut, as has the health in
pregnancy grant and the education maintenance allowance. Housing
benefit has been capped, and the bedroom tax will affect more than
1,600 households in my constituency, with an average loss of
£728.</hs_Para>

to social security have undermined economic recovery by driving demand

the changes to social security will take £150 million a year out
of the local economy in County Durham. It is my constituents in east
Durham who are living with the consequences of the dark shadow cast by
the age of austerity that grows longer and longer after every Budget.
We need to restore demand, which has been sucked out of the economy by
the past three years of austerity. That has had a monumental impact on
unemployment in my constituency. Government Members have proclaimed
that unemployment has fallen, but in my constituency the claimant count
has risen by 900—yes, 900—since the Government came to
power in May 2010, and it currently stands at 3,501. As things stand,
there is little prospect of reducing the unemployment figures to the
pre-recession levels of 2008, when 2,000 fewer people were looking for
work in my constituency.</hs_Para>

have absolutely no doubt that austerity is failing, and that the cuts
have made it increasingly difficult for people to meet everyday
expenditure on life’s basics such as food, energy and housing.
With less money in the local economy, it is no wonder that jobs and
growth have stalled as a result of the Government strangling demand.
The Budget seems to promise a further assault on the welfare state. The
prospect of capping annually managed expenditure, a large part of which
is spent on 
<?notus-xml column=1248?>social security, is frightening for low-income families. A “super
cap” limiting social security provision would mean that in times
of greatest need benefits could be spread more thinly or restricted,

Ministers should realise the monumental consequences of taking away
what they may consider to be relatively small sums, such as £14
a week with the bedroom tax, and the impact that that can have on
families and individuals living off low and increasingly limited fixed
incomes. The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions demands that the
unemployed “get on the bus” to look for work. But what do
they do when the Government cut their income to such an extent that

year the Chancellor told us that his Budget was one that supported
working families and those looking for work, unashamedly backed
business and was on the side of aspiration. However, a year later it
proved to be a Budget that led to the stalling of the economy, the
downgrading of the country’s credit rating and more U-turns than
can be counted on one hand or perhaps even two

and the OBR has stated that people will be worse off in 2015 than they
were in 2010, when the 
<?notus-xml column=1249?>Government took office, the Chancellor has trotted
out the same lines about aspiration and setting free the aspirations of
the nation. I find myself repeating the same lines about how this
Budget will adversely affect my most vulnerable constituents, who
through no fault of their own have to depend on welfare benefits in one
way or another. Last year the Chancellor said that he expected to make
further spending cuts of £10 billion by 2016. This year he has
raised the amount to £11.5 billion, and as spending
on schools and health is to be protected, the welfare budget is bound
to be hit.</hs_Para>

the first time, the Chancellor has decided to limit annually managed
expenditure, which includes the welfare budget, as well as debt
interest and payments to the EU. His main claim for limiting AME is
that in order to spend more on the services that we value, including
the health service and our armed services, he must cut the growth in
spending on the welfare budget. Of course, this stands in stark
contrast to the increased tax cuts of £3 billion for the most
wealthy in our
society<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-22T13:48:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032264000166" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130322/debtext/130322-0002.htm#13032264000166">What
will these cuts to welfare involve? We know that all will be revealed
in June, but what more can be taken away from the poorest in the
country, both the working poor and those who have to rely entirely on
benefits? There is speculation that these cuts could realise
suggestions flaunted by the Prime Minister in his welfare speech made
last summer—things such as paying benefit in kind instead of
cash, reducing benefits for the long-term unemployed, and the abolition
of housing benefit for the under-25s.
But<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-22T13:49:26"></hs_TimeCode> I ask: what
do the Government care for the unemployed? Only this week, they pushed
the contemptible Jobseekers (Back to Work Schemes) Bill through the
Commons. My constituents from all walks of life are firmly against it,
and have contacted me with their serous concerns about the
Government’s actions. However, a Government who will stoop so
low as to take rightful benefits from claimants and force jobseekers
into workfare are unlikely to have any conscience when it comes to
making deeper cuts and causing further hardship to the worst-off in
society<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-22T13:50:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032264000167" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130322/debtext/130322-0002.htm#13032264000167">Moreover,
as millions of the poorest workers look forward to being taken out of
income tax, they also have to look forward to increased rents because
of the bedroom tax, and they will find that they now have to pay more
council tax because of changes to local government finance. In reality,
they will feel that the Government have robbed Peter to pay Paul. Many
low-paid workers are in the public sector, and after a two-year pay
freeze will see their pay rise by only 1%. No doubt many of those
hard-working people will have aspirations to own their own homes, but
poverty pay and loss of tax credits and child benefits will mean that,
despite the Chancellor’s Help to Buy scheme, a home of their own
remains out of

Chancellor said that the Budget does not duck our nation’s
problems, but I think it compounds them. It is not a Budget for an
aspiration nation; it is a Budget that will bring mixed fortunes for
people across the United Kingdom. It will not bring the growth needed
to see everyone prosper, to see everyone get jobs. The low-paid worker
strives hard every day, but their aspirations are often crushed by the
need simply to make ends meet, and this Budget will not change that. At
the Conservative party conference, the Chancellor said:</hs_Para>

I recognise has been produced in difficult economic times. I should
like the Government to make further tax cuts, but I realise that that
may not be acceptable to some of our constituents who are feeling the
increases in their cost of living. As a consequence, I am pleased that
the Chancellor has decided to abolish the 3p rise in a pint of beer. I
am also pleased that he has decided to cut the price of a pint by a
further 1p. Only last week the Adam and Eve pub in Mill Hill and the
Bodhran bar in Hendon thanked me for lobbying the Chancellor to do just
that. Perhaps on Sunday night we will all say “Cheers” to
the Chancellor.</hs_Para>

Most significantly, raising the amount of money that people can earn
before paying tax—the personal allowance—to
£10,000 is welcome. In my constituency, 49,360 will benefit from
paying £700 less in income tax than they did in 2010, and 4,967

is interesting that in many contributions from Opposition Members, I
have heard repeated mentions of the so-called bedroom tax. The use of
the word “tax” just goes to show how out of touch Labour
Members are. As many people who work in this country will know, tax is
levied on income earned. Housing benefit is paid to those who either do
not have an income high enough to pay their appropriate accommodation
costs, or do not have an income at all. In both those scenarios, if
someone finds that they do not have enough income, they need to change
their accommodation circumstances. I must make special mention of an
hon. Member who spoke about her 17-year-old constituent who will
receive a reduced income for his two-bedroom flat. The most shocking
aspect of that to Government Members is that the Government are paying
a 17-year-old to live in a two-bedroom flat. I wonder how many of my

availability of the housing stock. My constituents’ children
find it hard to buy a property, or indeed to rent one, when they return
from university or go to work. We should not forget that not everyone
is given a deed of variation by mummy and daddy that allows them to
stay in part of the family’s house in places such as Primrose

Jamieson</B> (Kilmarnock and Loudoun) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> We have had
an interesting debate. There have been 27 Back-Bench speeches, of which
19 have come from Labour Members. There have been passionate speeches.
A lot of information has been given about constituencies and
constituents’ experience in the real world rather than the world
that some on the Government Benches would like to believe
exists.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032264000190" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130322/debtext/130322-0002.htm#13032264000190">We
started off with a typically bullish performance from the Secretary of
State for Work and Pensions, who seemed reluctant to accept that,
notwithstanding what he tried to claim the Chancellor is doing, in fact
the Government will borrow £245 billion more than planned. That
borrowing is to deal with failure rather than to invest for future
success.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032264000191" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130322/debtext/130322-0002.htm#13032264000191">The
Government seem to fail to recognise that the situation has happened on
their watch. It is not good enough, halfway through a Parliament, for
the Government continually to come to the Chamber and harp back to what
went on in the past without taking any responsibility whatever for what
they are doing and their own actions.</hs_Para>

interesting that Government Front Benchers seem to have an obsession
with the shadow Chancellor. Perhaps it is because he has been proven to
be correct. The economy is flatlining, there is no growth, the deficit
targets have been missed, the triple A rating is lost and the Office
for Budget Responsibility has confirmed that people will be worse off
in 2015 than in 2010. There is no plan—it is more of the same

they are not seeing the benefit of that job creation and are finding
that jobs are not available, that only part-time jobs are available, or

not only targets, but league tables. I cannot imagine why jobcentre
staff would say such things if pressure was not being put on them to
work in that way. Ministers seem to be saying one thing in public while
something else is going on in private behind the scenes. That suggests
either that Ministers do not know what is going on, or that they do
know but have not been able, for whatever reason, to get the

Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury (Mr David Gauke):</Member></B> We
have had a well-attended and at times lively debate on the Budget, and
I will begin by thanking my hon. Friends for their contributions.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-22T14:14:42"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Rochford and Southend East (James Duddridge) spoke about
the steps taken in the Budget to help businesses and ensure growth, and
he rightly highlighted measures relating to stamp duty for shares on
the alternative investment market.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-22T14:15:01"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Braintree (Mr Newmark) highlighted the extension of
capital gains tax policy for seed enterprise investment schemes, and I
thank him for his excellent work in promoting those schemes. They are
an excellent opportunity to enable start-up businesses to expand, and
for investors to find good investment opportunities to help grow jobs
in this country.</hs_Para>

thank my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-22T14:15:32"></hs_TimeCode> right
hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam (Paul Burstow), who I know
had to depart early. He highlighted the further substantial progress
that the Government have made on the personal allowance, benefiting
millions of taxpayers and taking many others out of income tax
altogether—a contrast to the record that we inherited. He also
highlighted the work on social care reform that the Government have
progressed, again in contrast with our predecessors. I know that my
right hon. Friend was heavily involved in that process.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Enfield North (Nick de Bois) highlighted
specific matters relating to community investment tax relief. I know
that he has had discussions with the Treasury about his ideas, and we
welcome his engagement.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-22T14:16:25"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Wycombe (Steve Baker) dealt with monetary
policy—an issue in which he takes a close interest—and we
are grateful for his views.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-22T14:16:37"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for North East Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg) highlighted the
progress that the Government have already made in dealing with the mess
that we inherited, and particularly the fact that we have reduced
borrowing by a third since we have been in office.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Northampton North (Michael Ellis)
highlighted to the House the expression, “There is no money
left”, although I have forgotten for the moment who coined that
phrase—<I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I> I am told that it
was Winston Churchill. I was thinking of

temporary accommodation; and a 29% increase in the number of families

heard a number of speeches from the Labour party, and two points about
the fiscal situation were consistently raised. First was the concern
that borrowing is higher than we had wanted and expected it to
be—borrowing is too high and debt is increasing too fast. We
then had a number of speeches that called for more spending and said
that we should not worry quite so much about borrowing and should be
prepared to borrow more. Remarkably, a number of speeches made both
points at the same time, but the reality is that the Labour party
believes that the right approach to our current difficulties in the
economy is to borrow more. The proposals from the shadow Chancellor
involved £33 billion more spending.</hs_Para>

a particular area, and
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-22T14:19:33"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Battersea (Jane Ellison) intervened to ask how he would
do that in a fiscally neutral way. At that point the hon. Gentleman
paused and said, “Well, we are on a different path.” He
is an articulate and eloquent speaker, but rather than say what that
path was, he refused to answer. Labour Members are on the path that
dare not speak its name. Their path is simply more
borrowing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-22T14:20:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032264000226" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130322/debtext/130322-0002.htm#13032264000226"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Bain" PimsId="5470" UID="13032264000414" xid="936" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130322/debtext/130322-0002.htm#13032264000414">Mr

Gauke:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right to point that
out. That would be the consequence of pursuing the policies advocated
by Labour. That does not take into account the concerns about what
going down that route would do for international confidence and the
price we pay for our borrowing—interest rates. Such borrowing
would jeopardise the
economy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032264000230" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130322/debtext/130322-0002.htm#13032264000230">We
have made progress on, for example, unemployment. Since the first
quarter of 2010, the private sector has increased by 1.25 million jobs
and total employment is up by 890,000 in the period. A number of hon.
Members, including
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-22T14:22:01"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Houghton and Sunderland South (Bridget Phillipson), described the
conditions in their constituencies. It is worth pointing out that, in
the north-east of England, employment has risen by 1.4% and
unemployment has fallen by 1.5% in the past
year.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032264000231" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130322/debtext/130322-0002.htm#13032264000231">We
are therefore making progress, but I will not deny that we, like most
major economies in western Europe, do not have the level of growth we
would like. Two big challenges face all of us. First, how do we get
growth when there is no money left, and secondly, how do we live within
our means—what do we do to get the deficit down? To deal with
that question, we must first acknowledge that the problem essentially
is that spending is too high, and not that taxes are too
low.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032264000232" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130322/debtext/130322-0002.htm#13032264000232">We
must take steps to address that, which means taking difficult
decisions, as the Government have done, on departmental spending. Our
decisions have, by and large, been opposed by Labour. We have had
support on one element of departmental spending—the public
sector pay freeze. We have announced that we have had to extend that
for a further year into 2015-16, but I am not sure whether Labour
supports that policy. I believe that freeze is essential if we are to
meet our
targets.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032264000233" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130322/debtext/130322-0002.htm#13032264000233">We
have also had to take steps to reform welfare. I
congratulate my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and
Pensions on the leadership he has shown and on his bold vision for
reforming welfare. We must address welfare. In the decade before the
financial crisis, and despite a growing economy, welfare spending
increased by 40% and has continued to rise—it went from 11% of
GDP in 2008 to 13% of GDP in 2012. Put simply, welfare spending still
costs the UK taxpayer more than £200 billion a year, which is
almost £1 in every £3 raised in taxes, and more than the
budgets for health, education and defence combined. We need to find
savings across the government. Inevitably, savings on welfare need to
be part of that. If we are to spend more money on other services, we
need to tackle our growing welfare
budgets.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032264000234" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130322/debtext/130322-0002.htm#13032264000234">As
my right hon. Friend the Chancellor explained on Wednesday, the
previous public spending framework divided Government spending into two
halves: fixed department budgets and annually managed expenditure. We
decided in the Budget to introduce a new limit on a significant
proportion of the latter. That will be set in a way that allows the
automatic stabilisers to operate, but brings control to areas of public
spending that have been beyond our control. My right hon. Friend the
Chief Secretary to the Treasury will provide an update on that at the
spending
round<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-22T14:25:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

recognise that we are in a global race. There will be economies that
succeed and those that fail. We must ensure that we are competitive.
That is why we have cut the corporation tax rate again to
20%—the lowest rate in the G20. It is striking how the UK is now
recognised as having a very competitive tax system. That is also why we
are making it easier for start-ups. I have touched on the seed
enterprise investment schemes and the measures on stamp duty on AIM
shares.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032264000236" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130322/debtext/130322-0003.htm#13032264000236">From<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-22T14:26:12"></hs_TimeCode>
April 2014, every business and charity in the UK will be entitled to a
£2,000 employment allowance each year to reduce their
employer’s national insurance contributions. I can tell the
House that we have set up a website to help businesses
understand how that will work, with an online calculator to
illustrate the effect of the allowance on the employer’s
national  insurance bill in 2014-15. It can be found at

hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Cathy Jamieson) said that the
Labour party has proposals in this area, but the employment allowance
is much simpler and is permanent, not temporary. It applies to all
businesses and charities, not just the smallest, so there will not be a
cliff-edge problem whereby people face disincentives in taking on a
10th employee. It will benefit all businesses and charities, not just
those that are taking on new staff. It will be very simple to operate
through the real-time information system. It could not be simpler. It
is also worth pointing out that the Labour party fought the last
election with the intention of increasing employer’s NICs. They
wanted to put the jobs tax up, not cut
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-22T14:27:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

have partially reversed. They now complain to us that capital spending
should be higher. They put in place a fuel duty escalator, but have
subsequently called for it to be scrapped. This Government have managed
to freeze fuel duty and it is falling in real terms. The previous
Government put in place a beer escalator. I think that the Opposition
are supporting us in cancelling that as

the years ahead. The truth is that the Labour party always wants to

from Salisbury. Allowing time for the 15-minute walk between bus and

ensure arrival in time for the 7.19 train. This is the latest service
north to Chippenham that will enable someone to be at court before the
10 o’clock start. Even within Salisbury, there will be problems.

are the difficulties faced within the major settlements. The situation
in the towns and villages, where more than half of south
Wiltshire’s population is based, is far more problematic. For
instance, although villages such as Shrewton are geographically closer
to Chippenham, the transport links are such that the journey still
requires a 40-minute bus journey to Devizes, a further 40-minute wait
and then another 45 minutes on a bus to cover just 23 miles.</hs_Para>

problem with these travel times will also be apparent when defendants
remanded into custody have to attend hearings in Swindon. In those
areas, the impact will be on solicitors and family members supporting
bail. If a defence solicitor has been dealing with a client in
interview who is then taken into custody, they will be faced with 24
hours to clear their appointments for the following day, including
three hours simply to travel. If that defendant is then released in
Swindon on bail, they will be expected to find their own way back home,
either in the form of a 92-minute train journey or a two-hour bus
journey.</hs_Para>

strong is the divide between the north and south of the area that there
is a probability that the defendant will never have been to Swindon

the Salisbury plain, the risk of non-attendance is higher, if
individuals are reliant on public transport connections running on time
or the roads being clear. In order for a trial to proceed as planned,
three magistrates, court staff, a defendant, a solicitor and all
witnesses must be

now turn to the second major issue: the financial implications of the
process. I do not believe that the expected savings from this process
will be fully realised. If we assume that a defendant is funded by
legal aid, getting their solicitor to Swindon would add approximately
£116.70. When they are bailed, there is a further £24 for
a single train ticket to return them to Salisbury.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-22T14:39:23"></hs_TimeCode>If their trial
is scheduled in Chippenham, their travel costs will be £26 and
their solicitors will be £98. In addition, there will be mileage
claims for three magistrates from across the county and witnesses,

transporting those involved in one case across the county reaches a
staggering £323.</hs_Para>

costs will quickly chip away at the financial savings accrued through
centralisation, especially where cases collapse or adjourn more
frequently. Moreover, the consultation document does not provide a
breakdown of the estimated savings to the courts. They will be
dependent on reducing the number of collapsed trials—something
that is not proven yet and that many local magistrates do not believe
will happen. My local magistrates association tells me that it believes
that the impact on the justice system is not acceptable and will worsen
the situation. There will be a large increase in the number of
ineffective trials because defendants and witnesses have been unable to
attend. It seems that the gains in throughput due to administrative
efficiency will simply be cancelled out.</hs_Para>

recognise, as do my constituents, that savings have to be found, but
they should not be made at the expense of a logical local justice
system. In a single day last December, Wiltshire police and civilian

there is a strong case to be made that the proposals are designed for
the convenience of the court system without fully considering the needs
of victims, witnesses, magistrates or advocates. It is easy to picture
the chaotic scenario whereby a case that originated in Salisbury goes
to trial in Chippenham. Three magistrates are called. One is based in
Swindon, one in Chippenham and another in the south of the county. The
defendant drives to the north of the county on the A360, the main road
connecting Salisbury to Chippenham, and gets stuck in traffic due to an
accident. The victim has no access to a car. Even though they manage to
catch their bus and walk to the station, their train is delayed due to
a fault on the line. The trial would collapse and the case would have
to be adjourned<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-22T14:42:31"></hs_TimeCode>.
The frustration of those involved would be extremely understandable. A
victim who had done nothing wrong might find themselves unable to get
to court and would have to arrange further time off, child care and
transport to go through the extremely stressful process all over again.
The same is true for defendants. Let us imagine someone who was felt to
be a crucial witness being stuck in traffic. We would be left with the
prospect of the case proceeding in their absence. Magistrates,
advocates and staff would have wasted considerable time and effort on
an ultimately fruitless
exercise<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-22T14:43:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032264000267" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130322/debtext/130322-0003.htm#13032264000267">It
is also critical that we retain the confidence of serving magistrates
in Wiltshire. I pay tribute to them and all the vital work they do.
Introducing the matrix as it stands will inevitably act as a barrier to
new magistrates, by effectively requiring them to have access to their
own transport. Asking currently serving justices of the peace, who
freely give up much of their own time, to spend up to three additional
hours travelling to court is a tall order. I know from personal
experience how challenging it is to juggle a hectic working schedule.
Had I been asked to travel such distances regularly, I simply could not

further point to consider is the implications for advocates in remand
cases. Only 16% of in-custody defendants are brought before the
Salisbury court. Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service sees
that as a justification for moving such cases to the north of the
county; I see it as a reason to retain them. It seems ludicrous to send
such a small proportion of cases 43 miles away when the

doorstep.</hs_Para>

me make three things clear from the outset. First, no decisions have
been made on this matter. The local area is conducting a consultation
on the proposals and I would not want to prejudge the outcome
of that consultation in the Chamber today. Secondly, the proposed
merger of benches and the proposed changes to the court matrix are
completely different matters and are not related to one another, except
for the fact that they are taking place according to a similar
timetable. Thirdly, the maintenance of appropriate arrangements for the
deployment of the judiciary in England and Wales and the allocation of
work within courts is the statutory responsibility of the Lord Chief
Justice, not the Lord Chancellor.</hs_Para>

with and supported by clerks through the justices’ issues group,
which I shall refer to as the issues group, local magistrates ensure
that there is sufficient court time available to meet demand and that
the right facilities are provided for the cases that come before them.
That includes reviewing the sitting programmes of magistrates courts in
the area.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13032264000278" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130322/debtext/130322-0003.htm#13032264000278"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-22T14:48:38"></hs_TimeCode>In
line with those in other areas, Wiltshire magistrates review the
sitting programme for the courts in each area every six months to
ensure it is properly aligned with the work load. Criminal work load in
Wiltshire’s magistrates courts is falling. In north-west
Wiltshire, it has decreased by 25%, in south-east Wiltshire by 26% and
in Swindon by 8%. That reflects a national trend and the forecast is
for further reduction, but family court work is increasing in the area
and it is right that local arrangements are made to accommodate
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-22T14:49:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032264000279" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130322/debtext/130322-0003.htm#13032264000279">The
low volume of criminal cases, particularly in rural areas, means that
some courts are not fully occupied. Steps are being taken in Wiltshire
to consolidate similar business and are designed to help make the best
use of the estate, accommodate a growing family case load and tribunals
work load, and reduce the inconvenience to court users caused by
sitting patterns changing, often at very short notice. The proposals
have been subject to wide stakeholder consultation, which closed on 15
March 2013. The responses to that consultation are being considered
by<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-22T14:50:05"></hs_TimeCode> the local
area, and the issues group will meet shortly to discuss the proposals.
The final decision as to how to arrange the business will rest with
that
group<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-22T14:50:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032264000280" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130322/debtext/130322-0003.htm#13032264000280">The
consultation has been designed to draw out specific impacts on various
groups, which will be considered carefully and a full equality impact
assessment will be carried out before implementation. The clerk for the
area and the bench chairmen have held meetings with local defence
advocates and a representative of the Legal Services Commission better
to understand their concerns. The issues group will consider carefully
the impact on magistrates’ rotas, and those considerations will
take into account the need to balance travel time and costs against the
need to maintain competences and sittings across a wide range of work
areas.</hs_Para>

the concern that some changes may result in increased travel for
victims and witnesses. Wiltshire is a rural county, and public
transport links are often limited. That is why the local area is
working closely with criminal justice partners to look at ways to
overcome that, especially by making the most of video technology. It is
important to remember that proposals for Salisbury court suggest that
some trials will remain in that locality and that start times for those
held in Chippenham can be flexible, accommodating the needs of court
users wherever possible.</hs_Para>

deciding how we meet the needs of victims and witnesses, we need to
weigh up whether an increase in journey times to court is offset by the
benefit of increased certainty for the victims and witnesses that the
trials they are called to attend are much more likely to go ahead as
planned. There is an opportunity to focus facilities at Chippenham for
accommodating victims and witnesses, as it will be a dedicated trials
venue, and we must make better use of court time for magistrates and
court users to ensure that best use is made of their valuable
time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-22T14:52:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury has raised some serious issues,
and I should like to comment further on one or two of them. I want to
reassure him as far as possible that these appear to be sensible and
proportionate proposals that accommodate a change in the legal
landscape. It is not just about a diminishing workload but about a 45%
increase in family work in the area, which must be accommodated. I
remind him that all responses to the consultation will be considered
very carefully indeed, including the response to the consultation from
him and my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-22T14:53:11"></hs_TimeCode> hon.

Minister<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-22T14:53:29"></hs_TimeCode> to put
the interests of victims and witnesses at the heart of the justice
system. We recognise that there may be some inconvenience with
increased journey times, but that must be weighed carefully against
benefits such as increased certainty of trials proceeding, increased
expertise and the proper use of court resources and magistrates’
skills. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-22T14:53:57"></hs_TimeCode>Criminal
business in magistrates courts is reducing. We have a duty to court

city, and that courthouse hearing every type of business. Quality,
speed and efficiency of the service that we provide, which commands
respect for the justice system, are much more significant to the
delivery of effective local justice across our communities. We will

narrowing the range of options to a particular type of site, that is,
by deciding whether Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) or MOD and
industry sites should be considered further, and discounting the other
types. However, based on the findings of the public consultation,
alongside recent legal advice, it has been decided that the process of
selecting a specific site for the interim storage of ILW should
consider all UK nuclear licensed and authorised sites that might be
suitable. This will therefore include MOD sites, industry sites and NDA

Thurso:</Member></B> The House of Commons negotiates pay for staff in
pay bands A to E and catering pay bands separately. No offer or award
has yet been made for senior staff, whose pay has been frozen for the
last three years, and whose numbers have been reduced as part of the
savings programme. For other staff a pay offer has been issued to the
House trade unions which seeks to meet the statutory duty of being
broadly in line with the civil service and to facilitate the
introduction of a new contract for staff which increases the length of
the working week from 34 to 36 hours (as in the civil service) and
replaces a wide variety of overtime entitlements and various unsocial
hours payments which have accrued over the years with a more equitable
system. Under the offer, all staff would receive a 1% consolidated pay
increase in each year, except for those in pay bands A to E who are
paid at the maximum of their pay band who would receive 1%
non-consolidated (non pensionable) one-off payments each year. The
lowest paid staff who earn less than £21,000 per annum would
receive a consolidated increase of at least £250 a year, which
is equivalent to an increase of at least 1.2%. A number of staff in pay
bands A to E would receive additional consolidated increases as part of
implementing pay reform. The amount each member of staff receives will
depend on their individual situation, including how far they have
progressed within their
payband.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032267000113" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130322/text/130322w0001.htm#13032267000113">The

the responsibility of individual train operating companies. However,
the Act does not necessarily require changes to physical

allow disabled passengers to

2005 and 2012 is not available. The population varies during the year
from around 20,000 per colony in the winter to 60,000 per colony in the
summer. A study carried out by ADAS Consulting Ltd in 2001 estimated
that there were 230,000 managed honey bee colonies in England. We are
not aware of any subsequent estimates that have been published.
However, the National Bee Unit, part of the Food and Environment
Research Agency, has a voluntary database of beekeepers. Data for 2005
is not available but in 2006, there were approximately 12,000
beekeepers managing approximately 100,000 colonies registered compared
to over 29,000 beekeepers managing over 139,000 colonies in
2013.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032267000857" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130322/text/130322w0001.htm#13032267000857">In
addition to the honey bee, there are many species of wild bee in our
countryside, a number of which have been the focus of conservation
action. Information on the distribution and status of wild bees is

Heath:</Member></B> While many animals and farms in GB may have been
infected, clinical signs in adult sheep and beef cattle to date have
been non-existent. The signs in dairy cattle of a raised temperature,
reduced milk yield and in some cases diarrhoea are mild/moderate,
short-lived 
<?notus-xml column=853?>and similar to other endemic diseases due to their non-specific nature.
In an individual dairy cow these mild clinical signs may last up to
five days, and across the herd as a whole for several weeks. The main
impact is in pregnancy on the developing foetus. The virus attacks the
developing neurological system and limbs of foetal lambs or calves
resulting in malformations such as domed heads, fixed bent limbs and
jaw deformities. The affected newborns are often born dead or die
shortly after birth. Birthing may be difficult due to the foetal limb
presentation and care needs to be taken in assisting the mother,
seeking veterinary assistance as appropriate. Post partum after care
should be provided as with any other difficult birth.</hs_Para>

for the current lambing season in England for Schmallenberg Virus. This
gives an expected cost of £2.3 million, of which £1.9
million (80%) falls upon farmers and £0.5 million (20%) which
includes research, is Government spending. This can be compared to
enzootic abortion and endemic disease in the UK flock with an annual UK
cost of £17.7

Heath:</Member></B> As with many viral infections, we would expect that
unaffected offspring born to Schmallenberg infected animals will have a
certain level of protective immunity lasting a few months as a result
of maternal antibodies. These antibodies are received in the first milk
from the mother when the newborns' gut is, for a few hours following
birth, able to absorb them into the body. These antibody levels will
drop over the following weeks and months and the offspring will then be
unprotected until they themselves are either infected or vaccinated.
This is the situation with related viruses, such as Akabane virus in
Australia, where each year the offspring are at risk of
infection.</hs_Para>

representatives from Big Lottery's England Committee due to the joint
nature of the programme, consider the heritage focus of the park or

works closely with local authorities particularly where there have been
lower levels of spend historically. All Parks for People applicants are
encouraged to set out where there is real need for our

there are social, economic or environmental needs in the local
community. When decisions are taken, they consider whether
“communities will be a better place to live, work or
visit” alongside the need to assess the heritage merit of any
application. Through this approach 60% of our funding awarded to parks

Burt:</Member></B> Our position on Israeli settlements in the Occupied
Palestinian Territories (OPTs) is clear: they are illegal under
international law, an obstacle to peace and make a two-state solution,
with Jerusalem as 
<?notus-xml column=873?>a shared capital, harder to achieve. Settlements also impact on the
Palestinian economy in a number of
ways.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032267001140" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130322/text/130322w0002.htm#13032267001140">According
to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in
the OPTs, about one third of land within the outer limits of
settlements is privately owned Palestinian land. Settlements therefore
increasingly reduce the amount of land, including agricultural land,
available for Palestinian use, and restrict access to water
sources.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032267001141" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130322/text/130322w0002.htm#13032267001141">Settler
violence can also impact on Palestinian livelihoods. There have been
incidents of settlers damaging or uprooting olive trees, the sole
source of income for many Palestinian farmers. According to OCHA the
olive oil industry makes up 14% of the agricultural income for the OPTs
and supports the livelihoods of approximately 80,000
families.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032267001142" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130322/text/130322w0002.htm#13032267001142">Settlements
contribute to the fragmentation of the West Bank and impede movement
and access around the West Bank. For example, 124 km of roads in the
West Bank are exclusively for the use of Israeli settlers and armed
forces and closed to all Palestinians. This makes it difficult for
Palestinians, particularly those who live close to settlements, to move
around and to access agricultural land, or to travel for employment
purposes.</hs_Para><Question><hs_Para UID="13032267001143" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130322/text/130322w0002.htm#13032267001143"><B><Member PimsId="1569" UID="13032267001607" xid="370" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130322/text/130322w0002.htm#13032267001607">Ian

restrictions on movement and access in the West Bank and Gaza are the
single biggest obstacle to trade and economic development, and hence
one of the most important causes of the current financial difficulties
of the Palestinian Authority along with the withholding by Israel of
customs revenues due to the Palestinian Authority. This is in line with
