that we do not need a change in the Bank of England Act because its
basic provisions—namely, of inflation-targeting, and this year,
as in previous years, we have a 2% inflation target—remain in
place. The Chancellor has suggested, in changing the remit, that it
would be appropriate for the MPC to deploy new explicit forward
guidance, including intermediate thresholds, in order to influence
expectations and meet its objectives more

England’s remit, I warmly welcome the fact that the Government
have firmly decided not to move away from the inflation target to a
nominal GDP target, and have given very good reasons why that would be
a disastrous course. Will the Minister take this opportunity to make it
clear that neither the Government nor the Bank of England are pursuing

Peston:</Member></B> May I break the habit of a lifetime by saying how
much I agree with the opening remarks of the noble Lord,
Lord Lawson? In all the years we have known each other, I
think that is a one-off. As far as I recall, the Minister did not take
part in the deliberations on the 1998 Act. He is indicating that he
did. Then he must remember that the noble Lord, Lord
Barnett, and I spent a large part of our time trying to move the
Monetary Policy Committee’s remit in exactly the direction in
which the Government are moving it; and claim to be moving it, let me
add—the relevant words are there in the speech of the Chancellor
and that of the noble Lord, Lord Deighton. They have updated it. My
knowledge of the English language is not that large, but I think that
“update” means change. How have they produced this most
remarkable sleight of hand? The noble Lord, Lord Barnett, and I were
told regularly that we could not change the remit because amendments
were not acceptable to the Government. How has the Chancellor produced
an extraordinary sleight of hand and changed the remit without bringing
it before

Newby:</Member></B> I do not think that there is any sleight of hand.
Since 1998, the Bank of England has introduced a number of innovative
measures within the remit and the terms of the Bank of England Act.
Quantitative easing, which, in 1998, many of us could hardly spell, far
less understand, has happened on a big scale and finance for lending
has been introduced. These innovative things have been introduced under
the terms of the Bank of England Act. The remit change reflected in
this year’s statement by the Chancellor accepts that there have
been a lot of changes since 1998 and suggests that the Bank should look
at introducing further innovative
operation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-27T11:11:38"></hs_TimeCode>s.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032735000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130327-0001.htm#13032735000009"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Kramer" PimsId="5891" UID="13032735001258" xid="2104" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130327-0001.htm#13032735001258">Baroness
Kramer:</Member></B> My Lords, the Minister will be aware of a recent
speech by Spencer Dale, the chief economist of the Bank of England,
which identifies the constraint on growth, not on the demand side but
far more on the supply side, because the banks are not back to normal
lending, so does he see monetary activism as a mechanism to return to
normal lending or are we relying much more on actions such as the
business bank? Is that where the Government’s emphasis should be
placed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-27T11:12:06"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032735000010" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130327-0001.htm#13032735000010"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Newby" PimsId="2095" UID="13032735001259" xid="1358" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130327-0001.htm#13032735001259">Lord

of animal feed and has incredibly high sustainability standards. We
need biofuels to contribute towards our legally binding renewables

if I explain the problem to the House. The noble Baroness and

emissions. The problem, however, is that if we increase the level of
obligation at the moment, there may be undesirable, indirect land-use
change problems right around the world, and that could increase the
level of carbon emissions. It certainly would not reduce them to the
extent that we would like. We have the same objectives as the noble

There are what are termed “advanced biofuels”, which do
not have a land-take impact—certainly not in terms of taking
land out of agricultural use or requiring a reduction in rainforest.

reputation for being hard working, I am surprised that this issue is
related particularly to Polish people. Does the Minister agree that a
good many shelters are provided for the homeless in London, even in
central London? I have been involved with some myself through charity.
Does the Minister think that one of the big problems with a lot of
homeless sleepers is their additional problems, and that it is not just
about being short of money? Some have drug or alcohol problems, or some
illness. Does she not think it important that these things should be
available to people so that they can be dealt with in rehabilitation,
even here, before they go back to their own

because a number of people who sleep rough have additional problems,

when they are being helped to reconnect, those services are reconnected

Lords for intervening twice in the same Question Time, which
is not my wont, but I am very intrigued by the Question. Will the
Minister say whether her department actually collects data on the
nationality of rough sleepers? Secondly, are Poles disproportionately
represented in that database? Thirdly, is she aware that if she were
looking for a good Keynesian expansionary policy to get the economy

children under or between 14 and 18 there are very fast services to
make sure that they are not left on the street. Centrepoint, Depaul UK
and St Basils are particularly good at finding them, so anyone within
that age group should not be on the street for more than a very short
time. We know that there are problems for slightly older
people—those between 18 and 25—who make up one in 10 of
rough sleepers. Again my noble friend is correct: some of those, at
least, are people who have left care. It is one of the important
aspects with care now that we make sure that they do have a future and
somewhere to go and do not end up on the streets of

the Minister explain why the Government felt able to offer Iraqi
interpreters exceptional indefinite leave to enter the UK outside of
the Immigration Rules but cannot do the same now for their Afghan
equivalents? They have risked their lives doing a 
<?notus-xml column=1081?>professional job for us and in many cases now live
in hiding in fear of their lives. Why are our NATO allies, including
the US, Canada, New Zealand, Australia and Germany, all able to offer

We are conducting a review of our policy towards locally engaged
civilians in Afghanistan as the scale of our presence there decreases.
As I said, I expect to provide an update to the House on our formal
policy later this year. As to our NATO allies, we are working very
closely with them on this issue, especially the Danes. Not all NATO
allies have made announcements on LECs. Among those who have, there is

people with other skills. Not all of them want to come to this country.

of last year, the shadow Home Secretary called on the Government to
offer a settlement scheme for Afghan interpreters who had helped and
worked alongside British troops, in some cases suffering injury and now
facing threats from the Taliban as our troops pull out. If someone now
fears for his own and his family’s safety as a result of working
with our soldiers and helping to fight for Britain’s long-term

Minister of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord
McNally):</Member></B> My Lords, in moving the draft Legal Aid,
Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (Amendment of Schedule
1) Order 2013, I shall speak also to the draft Civil Legal Aid (Merits
Criteria) (Amendment) Regulations 2013. The Civil Legal Aid (Merits
Criteria) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 amend the Civil Legal Aid
(Merits Criteria) Regulations 2013, which I brought before the House on
3 December. These amendment regulations fulfil a commitment I made in
response to concerns about the effect the regulations, as originally
drafted, would have on the availability of legal aid for judicial
review.</hs_para>

Civil Legal Aid (Merits Criteria) Regulations 2013 provided that the
director of legal aid casework had to be satisfied that all
administrative appeals and other alternative procedures which are
available to challenge the act, omission or other matters had been
exhausted before legal representation could be granted for such public
law claims. This was drafted as a test without exceptions, and we
suggested that the director would need to consider whether such an
alternative route was, in fact, realistically available. The policy
intention underpinning Regulation 53(b) is that if there is, for
example, a welfare appeal that can overturn the decision, generally
that would have to be followed instead of a judicial review of the DWP
being
sought.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032735000067" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130327-0001.htm#13032735000067">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-27T11:41:17"></hs_TimeCode>
noble Lord, Lord Pannick, and others expressed concerns over the
differences in approach between Regulations 53(b) and 39(d). Regulation
39(d), which covers pre-proceedings alternatives, only requires that
such alternatives are pursued when it is “reasonable” to
do so. I therefore undertook to bring forward amending
regulations to introduce a discretion in Regulation 53(b) so that the
director of legal aid casework will have the express power to grant
legal aid for public law claims, even if the alternative routes have
not been exhausted, if he none the less considers that such an appeal
or procedure would be effective in providing the remedy that the
individual requires. These regulations fulfil that
undertaking.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032735000068" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130327-0001.htm#13032735000068">The
amendment does not specifically include the word
“reasonable”. Although reasonableness is used in other
areas of the regulations, we consider that it is too wide a concept to
use in this provision. Instead, we have tried to reflect the
circumstances in which it would not be reasonable to require the
alternatives to be pursued, and to base the criterion on those specific
circumstances—that is, where the alternatives would not be
effective in providing the remedy that the individual requires, in the
view of the director. That includes where alternative court or tribunal
proceedings cannot deliver the whole remedy the individual requires or
cannot deliver it quickly. I consider that that this meets the concerns
raised previously.</hs_para>

Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (Amendment of
Schedule 1) Order 2013. Before I explain the four changes that this
order makes to Schedule 1 to the LASPO Act, I wish to
address the regret Motion tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Bach. The
regret Motion relates to the concession which would have made legal aid
available in relation to a review by the First-tier Tribunal, where it
had identified an error in law in its own decision on a 
<?notus-xml column=1085?>welfare benefit appeal. This was voted down by the
House on 3 December last year and, as I made clear before the House
voted, and again on 8 January this year, the Government have no
intention to bring forward another order on this point. That remains
the case.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13032735000070" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130327-0001.htm#13032735000070">I
turn now to the order itself. First, it modifies Part 1 of
Schedule 1 to the LASPO Act 2012 and makes legal aid available for
advice and assistance for appeals on a point of law relating to council
tax reduction schemes in the High Court, as well as advice, assistance
and representation in relation to such appeals in the Court of Appeal
and Supreme Court. The council tax reduction scheme will replace
council tax benefit, which is being abolished in April as part of the
welfare reforms. This provision therefore ensures that equivalent civil
legal services are available for onward appeals relating to council tax
reduction schemes as are available in relation to council tax benefit.
To be clear, this part of the order does not change the scope of legal
aid but is a technical change that maintains the position under the
LASPO Act 2012.</hs_para>

the order amends the definition of domestic violence in the Act. This
will bring the definition into line with the updated cross-government
definition of domestic violence which comes into force on 31 March. It
adds the words “controlling, coercive … behaviour”
and “pattern of incidents” to the existing definition.
The definition of domestic violence in the Act applies to private
family law and immigration cases under paragraphs 12, 28 and 29 of Part
1 of Schedule 1 to the Act, which provide for legal aid for victims of
domestic violence in such cases. I hope that this will be welcomed
across the
House.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032735000072" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130327-0001.htm#13032735000072">Thirdly,
the order brings into scope certain applications to meet our
international obligations under the 2007 Hague convention, which we
expect will come into force in April 2013. The convention concerns the
international recovery of child support and other forms of family
maintenance. It sets out certain requirements for the provision of
legal aid in relation to the recognition, enforcement or establishment
of a decision in relation to maintenance. These are reciprocal
arrangements for signatory countries.</hs_para>

broadly equivalent to the EU’s maintenance regulations for which
services are already made available under Schedule 1 to the LASPO Act.
In fact, most countries that have signed the convention will already be
covered by the EU maintenance regulations, with a few exceptions such
as
Norway.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032735000074" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130327-0001.htm#13032735000074">Finally,
the order before us addresses a technical issue in relation to legal
aid for judicial review. In our consultation response on legal aid
reforms, we confirmed that legal aid would be available for judicial
review subject to a few, very specific exclusions. That remains our
position. This is reflected in paragraph 19 of Part 1 of
Schedule 1 to the LASPO Act, which puts within scope legal aid for
judicial review in almost any area bar the exclusions debated and
agreed by Parliament.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13032735000075" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130327-0001.htm#13032735000075">However, an arguable
effect of how the LASPO Act is drafted is that judicial review may be
in scope for any area of law listed in Schedule 1 despite the
exclusions in paragraph 19. Therefore, this order simply makes a
technical amendment to ensure that judicial review is 
<?notus-xml column=1086?>governed exclusively through paragraph 19, and the specific exclusions
have the effect intended. I beg to

story begins on 17 April last year, when, in another place
at the ping-pong stage, the then Lord Chancellor made an important
concession to ensure that the LASPO Bill got through. An amendment had
been put forward there to allow legal aid for welfare benefit reviews
and hearings, supporting an amendment already agreed in this House and
moved by the noble Baroness, Lady
Doocey<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-27T11:49:34"></hs_TimeCode>. To
prevent that amendment succeeding, the Lord Chancellor made it clear
that Her Majesty’s Government would compromise and allow legal
aid for legal advice at First-tier Tribunals in cases where a point of
law arose. He wanted time to ask his department about the best way of
implementing the pledge. He was given that time, in due course the Bill
became law, and we waited for the pledge to be implemented.</hs_para>

Written Ministerial Statement appeared on 18 September last
year. Surprisingly, this Statement did not announce how the major
concession, which had been pledged by the Lord Chancellor, had been put
into effect. Instead, in its place, a new—I would say
minor—concession was announced that would affect many fewer
people but would arise in a limited number of cases before the
First-tier Tribunal. These were called errors of law cases, and
according to a parliamentary Written Answer given to me by the Minister
on 23 November last year, there were 692 errors

the Minister just told us, on 3 December last year, the Legal Aid,
Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act (Amendment of Schedule 1)
Order 2012, which included the minor concession, was debated
in your Lordships’ House. I tabled an amendment that declined to
support the regulation because, first, it did not fulfil the
Government’s undertaking in the Commons on 17 April and,
secondly, it would mean that claimants would not receive legal help on
a point of law. The debate followed. It was crystal clear that all
those who spoke in favour wanted the Government to withdraw the
regulation and come back with something a little more generous. They
were definitely not arguing for there to be no concession of any kind,
which would have been an absurd position for them to have taken. We
were saying to the Government, “Keep your word, and if you
can’t do that, come back with something a bit more
generous”. My amendment was supported by speeches from around
the House, including those of the noble and learned Lords, Lord Woolf

the Government’s behaviour so perverse? Why am I arguing that
their line, not to put forward another regulation, is so wrong? It is
for two reasons. The first is the constitutional offence that has been
caused to Parliament. The Executive are supposed to be subject to
Parliament. Parliament’s wish that a more generous concession
was required was clearly expressed on 3 December; it cannot
be more clearly expressed than by a vote of a House of Parliament. The

this.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13032735000085" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130327-0001.htm#13032735000085">The
Government could have brought back their minor concession if they had
wanted to. For them to refuse to bring back anything else is—I
choose my words with some care—treating Parliament with
contempt. It is saying to Parliament, “We are the masters, not
you. We don’t care what you say, we will do what we
want”. I liken it to the behaviour of a spoilt child who cannot
get his way. The conduct is more that of a playground bully than a
mature, grown-up, confident, democratic Government. What has happened

second reason, which is perhaps as serious, is that two groups of
people who were led to believe that they might get legal aid for advice
for First-tier Tribunals—those with a point of law and those in
error-of-law cases—have had their legitimate expectations
removed by Her Majesty’s Government without any consultation.
Why? For the first group, the Government would cite the cost and say
that they could not afford the major concession offered by the right
honourable Kenneth Clarke in April last year, but what is the reason
for this second group? It is not a big group, but it undoubtedly
includes some people. Is cost the reason? We have never been told the

spite is reasonable, but I accept that for us apparently to deprive

seems an extraordinary error of both judgment and justice. We boast
endlessly in this country about our justice system, on the whole with
reason. I cannot begin to get my head around denying people who have
suffered a reverse in the welfare tribunals legal advice on a point of
law. I hope that my noble friend will have a compelling argument to
bring forth. In particular, it would be very helpful for the House to
know just what the cost is, or would be likely to be, if the provision
were withdrawn. I very much hope that if the Minister cannot give a

first is the regret Motion tabled by my noble friend Lord Bach, which
deals with a particular decision. I do not want to say any more about
that other than that I entirely support the magisterial rebuke that he
administers not to the Minister, who of course does not have a free
hand in these matters, but to the Government at large for denying a
modest concession to about 300 people, the cost of which, to refer to
the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, must be minimal,
in what can only be described as a governmental fit of
pique<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-27T12:03:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032735000092" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130327-0001.htm#13032735000092">Having
said that, I turn to the second more general issue that is encompassed
in the broader merits regulations and the position of welfare law
claimaints in general, who are significantly affected by the changes
that are now under way. Hitherto, about 30,000 people have benefited
from welfare legal aid and advice, usually, although not exclusively,
provided by voluntary organisations, notably the citizens advice
bureaux. I place on record my gratitude to the bureaux for furnishing
the information that I am about to relate, in part at least, to the
House. The situation now is that instead of 30,000 people getting that
advice, 3,200 will receive advice and support in respect of Upper
Tribunal matters only. There will be no assistance in their case at the
first tribunal. There are two aspects to this, a supply side and a
demand side, and I shall begin, rather perversely, with the second,
which is the demand side.</hs_para>

nationally with a group of significantly disadvantaged people. I am
informed by the bureaux that some 68% of current welfare legal aid
users have a disability. In addition, there will be many with literacy
and other problems and vulnerabilities; indeed, they are a
significantly high proportion of those who seek advice. They seek
advice about their entitlement, but also about the processes that are,
to put it mildly, complex. I can illustrate that with one of a number
of 
<?notus-xml column=1090?>cases the bureaux have briefed me and my noble friend on. I shall pick
the shortest so as not to delay your Lordships any further than
necessary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032735000094" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130327-0001.htm#13032735000094">In
one case, a Welsh bureau advised a 57 year-old woman with multiple
disabilities who received employment and support allowance and council
tax benefit. She made a claim, did not seek advice when completing it
and as a result underestimated her needs, in particular her mental
health issues. Here, again, I underline the point about the degree of
vulnerability of some of these claimants. She attended a medical
assessment and was judged to have scored no points. She appealed that,
attended a First-tier Tribunal in 2012 and was awarded nine points, but
was not awarded any help with the mental health conditions, despite a
letter from a GP saying she had a long-term mental health condition and
despite the fact that the letter said she was suicidal some months
before that decision. The bureau then advised her on looking for
options for appealing the decision to the Upper-tier Tribunal. She
would have had no help at all from the bureau in the present
circumstances if the bureau’s capacity to give it was limited,
as it is likely to be.</hs_para>

and advice is now limited to the second stage, the onward appeals
tribunal. This is not consistent with the intention Parliament
originally expressed in respect of first-tier cases where at least
basic advice and support on a number of procedural issues, such as a
request for a statement of reasons from a first tribunal, seeking leave
to appeal from the first tribunal and other aspects—lodging
documents and so on—should be covered. Unless these stages are
included within regulations, it is unlikely that anybody seeking to
appeal, assuming they know of their rights to appeal, would be able to
progress from the first tier to the second tier unassisted. That is the
second
stage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032735000096" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130327-0001.htm#13032735000096">I now
turn to the supply side. There is a growing crisis in the sector. There
is no doubt about that. Citizens advice bureaux and other organisations
are suffering significant reductions in funding from national and local
government, the latter of course having been awarded a further 2% cut
in government grant in the recent Budget, so things are not going to
get any better for some time in that context. The problem now is that
bureaux are disposing of staff. My bureau in Newcastle has had to rid
itself of the equivalent of three and a half full-time legal advisers,
the bureau in Gateshead is closing, and this pattern is being repeated
all over the country. It has to be said that some bureaux continue to
provide pretty much a full service, but increasingly the pressure is
resulting in a substantial decline in the capacity of the organisations
to meet the demand, which is likely to rise, not least with the Welfare
Reform Act changes that are about to strike hundreds of thousands, if
not millions, of people.</hs_para>

the contracts to provide this service for the only part that is to be
covered by legal aid, the Upper Tribunal, are being let in a very
curious system. I did not know about this until a couple of days ago.
Apparently there are to be only four areas in which these contracts
will be granted for the whole country. I am not sure whether Scotland
is included, but certainly England and Wales are divided 
<?notus-xml column=1091?>into four areas under which a contract will be let. A tendering process
will commence and it is intended to be completed in October.</hs_para>

the mean time, between April and October, given the pressure on the
budgets of the CAB and other advice agencies, remains to be seen, but
there must be a significant worry that there will be difficulties in
dealing even with appeals to the Upper Tribunal pending the allocation
of contracts. Certainly there is a good deal of concern in the sector
about that, because in the mean time several hundred welfare law
contracts, which are not currently distributed on the basis of just
four contracts for the whole country, will come to an end. So there is
a really significant problem immediately on the supply

contracts themselves are very limited. For London and the northern
procurement areas, only 1,035 cases are assumed to be included in the

current 3,200 people who get legal aid and advice for the Upper
Tribunal. There is no flexibility in that. If you have only that small
number of cases you will have only two or three specialist advisers
covering areas as vast as those that I have described. Remoteness is
indeed going to be evident. How on earth can two or three people
sensibly look to face-to-face contact with appellants over an area as

involve only 12 people nationally, people who are currently engaged
locally on this kind of work are going to be looking for other work. I
hope that the Government will provide some temporary support at least
for the continuation of that service. Secondly, will they look again at
this ridiculous pattern of four huge areas served by a handful of
people? I cannot believe that the Government seriously think that this

what my right honourable friend the then Lord Chancellor promised was
to use his best endeavours to look for a concession. He came back with
a concession which made its way into the final Act passed by
Parliament. If the Opposition Front Bench ever returned to this side of
the House, they would be as reluctant as we are to have reopened debate
on the final settlements in any legislation by the use of fatal
Motions. I believe that that would prolong the issue and put pressure
on every Opposition to say, “The matter is not closed. You could
pass a fatal Motion and that will get us a better offer”. I do
not think that is the way that government can operate. The offer was
made in good faith after exploring the consequences of the other
options. As I say, it would set a precedent for keeping debates running
and keeping up pressures which, quite frankly, Oppositions would
eventually find difficult to handle. The pressure groups, which quite
legitimately keep the pressure on us, would say, “Well, it is
not closed now because you could pass a fatal Motion”. That is
the point.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13032735000106" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130327-0001.htm#13032735000106">It

He was responsible for the arts budget, fortunately in happier days

The term “access to justice” is bandied around
very freely. I do not want to provoke him but I see the menacing figure
of the noble Lord, Lord Richard, just behind the noble Baroness. He
would probably agree that access to justice and access to
taxpayer-funded legal aid have never been the same thing and we must
not get them confused. Every Government have had 
<?notus-xml column=1095?>to limit this provision. Oh, my God, I see that the noble Lord wishes to
speak. As I say, they are not the same thing, but I want this
Government and successive Governments to keep the concept of access to
justice very much to the forefront of their commitments to the citizen.
However, that may be done by adapting the system in a whole
manner of ways: for example, in the way that advice is given. The noble
Lord, Lord Beecham, was rather dismissive of remote advice, but I think
that the use of new technologies will give better access to justice.
However, having provoked the noble Lord, Lord Richard, I will give way
to
him.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-27?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_27_PT_1/D53B8A25AE43681B82DB76D180649EF03F725F70" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 27 March 2013">Wednesday,

a lady said, “I know that they are bringing this legal aid to an
end”. That is what worries me. I know that criticisms
have to be strongly put but we must not make people think that we are
ending legal aid. At the end of this process, we will be spending
£1.7 billion on legal aid. We will still have a substantial
amount of taxpayers’ money going into welfare legal aid. By all

asylum law, which remain in scope—precisely £500 million.
Social welfare law was always a small part of the legal aid budget. It

Bach:</Member></B> I do not think that the Minister can really get away
with that. The Government changed their policy as a consequence of the
House of Lords vote. On this occasion, the Government have said,
“We don’t like what the House of Lords have said.
Therefore, we’ll do quite the opposite of what they wanted to
happen”. However, let us not retreat into history; let us talk
about

agreed, the regulations presented by the noble Lord will go through, of
course, and the Act will come into force on 1 April in any event.
However, if the House agrees to the amendment, it will show that it has
some distaste for the way in which the Government have behaved in this
instance. In my view, the Government have not behaved well here and the
House should, in its gentle way by a Motion of Regret, just say
that.</hs_para>

disabled people, will be in place for the gateway.</hs_para>

the existing community legal advice helpline, which already
successfully uses a number of reasonable adjustments and adaptations

specifically included in the contracts of those who will provide the
service. Reasonable adjustments will include a third party being able

callers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032735000143" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130327-0001.htm#13032735000143">My
officials have met a number of equality organisations to discuss
appropriate reasonable adjustments and further enhancements. They have
also put in place a system to monitor the take-up of reasonable
adjustments and adaptations, and to monitor the disability profile of
gateway clients. Regarding the definition of “exempted
person”, as debated and agreed during the passage of LASPO,
there are three exemptions to using the gateway for accessing legal
help, set out in regulation 20 of the procedure regulations. In
summary, these are: a child under 18 years of age; a person who has
been deprived of their liberty; or a person assessed by the gateway in
the previous 12 months as qualifying for gateway work to be provided by
face-to-face advice and who is seeking further advice on a linked
matter. It should also be remembered that the gateway provides legal
help only, not legal representation. So I do not consider that the
definition is drawn too
narrowly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032735000144" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130327-0001.htm#13032735000144">I am
aware that others feel that a further exemption for vulnerable people
would provide additional protection. I do not believe that that is
necessary. The term “vulnerable people” covers a wide
range of individuals with particular needs or issues. While some of
those to whom the term might be applied may not be able to
use the telephone or the other methods permitted to give instructions
and receive advice, others will. The Government’s view is that
the best way to test suitability for telephone or online advice is
through an assessment of each individual’s needs and abilities,
not through a blanket exemption for the extremely broad group defined
as vulnerable people. The Government are confident that the gateway
call operators and specialist telephone advice providers will be
sufficiently experienced and trained to support vulnerable
people<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-27T12:53:36"></hs_TimeCode>. We plan
to review the implementation and operation of the gateway in the

vulnerable people more

turn now to the Motion tabled by the noble and learned Baroness, Lady
Scotland. At the outset I must refute the suggestion in the Motion, and
in some of the comments made, that as a result of our reforms domestic
violence victims will be at greater risk of injury or death. This has
been suggested at various points during this debate and the passage of
the Bill, and it is entirely untrue. Let me be clear: legal aid will
continue to be available to help victims to obtain the full range of
court protection against domestic violence in exactly the same way as
now. There is no evidential requirement for legal aid for these
remedies. Those who need legal aid to protect themselves will be able
to get it.</hs_para>

issue, therefore, that is legitimately up for discussion is whether we
have made the right provisions for victims of domestic violence. In
particular, it is whether we have set the right evidential criteria for
someone to show that they are a victim of domestic violence so that
they can qualify for legal aid for their private family law issue. I am
clear that we have. We have moved a great distance in this area since
the LASPO Bill first came into Parliament. We listened to the concerns
of this House in particular, and the regulations before us today
reflect the position that was agreed in both Houses before the Act
gained Royal Assent, and in certain respects, it goes even
further.</hs_para>

the forms of evidence listed in the regulations, a finding of fact is
particularly important. A finding of fact made in proceedings in the UK
that the applicant has been the victim of domestic violence, no matter
how long ago it occurred, that gave rise to a risk of harm to the
applicant, is acceptable as long as the finding was made within the 24
months before the application for legal aid was made. Our position on
the evidence requirement was agreed by Parliament as reasonable during
the passage of the Act and I remain of the view that it is both
sensible and comprehensive. There has been a specific concern that GPs
and others may charge for producing the evidence and that people may
not be able to afford such charges. It is perhaps worth highlighting
the fact that legal aid was never designed to deal with the costs of
actually acquiring legal aid, whether this be the cost of a telephone
call or evidence. I do not think it unreasonable to continue that
policy here. Many of the forms of evidence, such as protective
injunctions, will not attract a charge at all. We expect any charges
that are applied to be modest. I cannot pretend that we have absolute
control over charges—we do not. However, we have included in the
regulations provisions for other health professionals to provide
evidence to help mitigate against possible charges by GPs.</hs_para>

guidance and a template letter following discussion with the relevant

domestic violence in the Act to reflect the amended across-government
definition that will come into force at the end of the month. This
followed the clearly expressed view in Parliament that the definition
should reflect that adopted across government to ensure clarity of
meaning. I am sure that the House welcomes this change. I would also
like to reassure noble Lords that the Government will be closely

minutes longer than face-to-face advice and provides a smaller
proportion of tangible outcomes. In 2011 it was open to debate whether
the economies offered by the lower overhead costs of telephone
provision would be sufficient to offset the cost generated by higher
advice times. I would like reassurance that the companies which will be
undertaking these services will have the appropriate number of staff to

the three areas that have been selected for telephone

although it is perhaps best to describe it as home
repossession—the Government have picked some very challenging

discrimination, cases are often extremely complex and there may be many
wider issues at play as well, such as benefit appeals, which may muddy
the waters. I am sure the Minister will offer his reassurance that in
the case of SEN the Children and Families Bill will sort out many of
the existing problems. However, in Wales the education system is

At present, the adviser will take on the work as a new case under a

that the telephone adviser may sign off the case as needing
face-to-face advice and refer it straight back to the duty lawyer, but
this is by no means certain. The client may well have to post papers to
the telephone adviser as well as dealing with legal aid means forms by

the adjourned hearing but it is less likely than if the duty lawyer
took on the case. The client will then return to court, again,
hopefully, with an agreed position. However, if the position is not
agreed, the case will have to be picked up once again by a duty

of violence against them told no one about it, and that those who had
told someone were more likely to have disclosed experiences of violence
to friends or family than to statutory or voluntary sector agencies.

representing such women over the course of my career since 1977. We
need to be very clear about the real-life consequences of the changes
that are contained in these regulations when they come into force on 1
April and the fear with which they are viewed by those who work with
victims and by victims themselves. Women’s Aid, Rights for
Women, the Law Society, the Legal Aid Practitioners Group and
innumerable others have written to me, as I am sure they have written
to many other noble Lords in this House. They have raised their voices
in alarm about the consequences that will flow from these regulations.
Women and children will be at risk of further violence, and indeed
death, if they are not able to access family law remedies. Women are at
a higher 
<?notus-xml column=1109?>risk of violence and of being killed after leaving violent partners,
which is the most dangerous moment. Domestic violence continues long
after the relationship has ended—76% of separated women
experience post-separation
violence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-27T13:25:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032735000183" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130327-0001.htm#13032735000183">I
will tell the House about just one case which has come to
attention—it happened only a couple of days ago—to bring
some of this to light. One practitioner told us of a woman whom they
saw last week. She was Bengali and was made to marry her first cousin
in the United Kingdom. She was kept under house arrest and isolated
from her family. Her every decision was taken from her, including when
she had sex and how many children she had. She was not allowed any form
of contraception. She was not allowed out of the house.
There was no physical violence—no medical report, as she never
went to her GP without her in-laws—and no police evidence as
there was nothing physical. She is pregnant with twins, has two
children under two and was treated as a domestic slave. She managed to
flee her family but her husband and mother-in-law have now applied for
a residence order. From 1 April—from next week—she will
not qualify for legal aid. Does the noble Lord wish to refresh the
comments he made about the likely consequences of these
regulations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-27T13:26:46"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032735000184" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130327-0001.htm#13032735000184">I
can give so many examples—sheaves of cases are being sent
forward by lawyers from all over the country asking, “What are
we going to do?”. On the empirical evidence currently available
to us, it is clear that these regulations will have a disproportionate
impact on women. The Legal Services Commission’s own
figures verify that. They show that more women than men apply for
family law legal aid. Calls to the community legal advice
helpline show that in the area of family law, approximately twice as
many women as men seek advice. There is significant concern that this
may place the United Kingdom, which has hitherto proudly been seen as
an exemplar in the fight against domestic violence against women, in
breach of Articles 1, 2, 3, 5, 13, 15 and 16 of its international
convention obligations under the UN Committee on the Elimination of
Discrimination against Women, and that we will be subject to inquiry
before CEDAW at the UN in July this year. As such, we are at risk of
besmirching the regard in which we have hitherto been held.
The Government’s report on adherence to CEDAW for the
July inquiry makes no mention of the LASPO Act. Can the Minister advise
noble Lords on how the Government propose to deal with this legitimate
concern<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-27T13:28:38"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-27T13:28:34"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032735000185" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130327-0001.htm#13032735000185">I
would like to ask the noble Lord very briefly whether he can clarify
some specific areas. Even as the regulations stand, there appear to be
a number of anomalies. First, can he confirm whether practitioners will
be able to apply simultaneously for an injunction and other orders as
appropriate, or will they have to make separate applications? The noble
Lord will know that when a non-molestation application is made
currently, it is quite often made in conjunction with residence orders
and other ancillary orders for children. If there have to be two
separate applications, additional expense, time and worry will be
incurred. I cannot believe that that is what the Government want, not
least because of the importance of costs in this
regard.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-27?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_27_PT_1/CC2FBB7E93A483DA26B1B9967927BD3DB0FCFEF2" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 27 March 2013">Wednesday,

will the Minister clarify the issue in relation to cross-undertakings?
The guidance, which was produced before 1 April, does not make it clear
that a cross- undertaking means a cross-undertaking broadly equivalent
to that given by the perpetrator. The situation I envisage is where the
perpetrator agrees not to assault, molest or otherwise interfere
with—normally—the woman but the woman agrees to pay the
rent on the property which had been previously been in their joint
names. I should be grateful for that

will the Minister clarify whether the Government intend to introduce a
system equivalent to that which we have in the criminal courts which
prevents the abuser cross-examining the victim? We have heard of cases
where that is already happening. Many women have said that they would

perpetrator. Can something be done about

have agreement that the two-year time limit should be extended. Would
the Minister be prepared to amend the guidance further to provide,

looking at a news programme this morning, I saw a report of a benefit
claimant—I think he was from Barnsley; it was somewhere in
Yorkshire at any rate—who has been sanctioned for not applying
for a job, but the basis of that was that he had not applied online.
Apparently, it is necessary in that area to apply online. The claimant
has never used a computer; he does not know how to use a computer; he
was not, incidentally, given any advice about how to use a computer by
the jobcentre; and he was sanctioned. That is a different context, but
it underlines that, despite the fact that many of us are up to a point
familiar with modern technology—I do not profess any particular
expertise myself in this area—many other people are simply not
used to it. That is particularly true of those with perhaps less of an
educational background and less experience of, for example, conducting
financial transactions in that way. More generally, they might be
limited in their vocabulary or not speak English as a first language,
as the noble Baroness pointed out, or in other ways find it either
impossible or difficult to access advice online.</hs_para>

clearly concerns about whether a third party can effectively represent
someone remotely. The Minister rather casually dismissed the question
of remoteness in our previous debate. The noble Lord shows his dissent.
Well, perhaps I am being unkind to him and I withdraw that. However, he
did seem rather to play down the potential problems of physical
remoteness from the source of advice. Those of us who professionally or
otherwise have engaged with people over the years in our various
capacities—as lawyers, as people in the voluntary
sector or as elected politicians—will know
that face-to-face contact is very important and by no means

is another question about remote access that I want to put to the

call-back method is not always easy or reliable as there may well be
problems in returning a call. Secondly, the initial cost will fall on
the applicant. Will the Minister undertake to look at making this a
freephone service rather than a system where one has to pay and then,
one hopes, receive a call

seems that, potentially, chaos will strike in this very important and
sensitive area of law, not in four weeks’ time but next week.
Judging by the experience of some other government changes to our legal
system—for example, the issuing of proceedings out of a single
county court, which happened last year—we can expect
considerable difficulties. That has been a most unhappy episode, which
is still not totally resolved. Of course, this now becomes an area not
simply of ordinary court proceedings, but very sensitive, difficult and
often urgent matters that affect people’s lives very
closely—the lives of vulnerable people, in particular women, and
of course
children<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-27T13:40:41"></hs_TimeCode>. I
therefore hope that the Government will pay some attention to the very
important strictures and concerns of the president of the Family

are a couple of other issues on which it would be interesting to hear
the Government’s present views. Reference was made by the
Minister to the cost of obtaining evidence from GPs. It is thought that
this might amount to some £50 or £60. The Government may
well be looking at alternative forms of evidence that might be
suitable, but as I said, this process starts in a week’s time.
It would be interesting to learn how far the Government have got in
producing a suitable procedure for people to follow. This is a
significant issue because almost by definition many of those who may
want to seek legal advice and take legal proceedings —now
without the benefit of legal aid unless they can prove in the context
of domestic violence that they are exempt—will find it very
difficult to find £50 or £60 to pay their GP. I
understand that the Government are in discussion about this with the
BMA, which is apparently unhappy, as a matter of principle, about the
expectation that family doctors, and perhaps other doctors, should be
producing reports at all for this purpose, while the Royal College of
General Practitioners has taken a more constructive attitude. Can the
Minister update us on where we are in that context? I can understand
the situation where a GP is perhaps a family doctor to both parties and
therefore might be in a position of some conflict, but in general it
ought to be almost axiomatic that a doctor would be prepared to give
evidence—no doubt brief evidence—which might assist a
woman, or man for that matter, who is claiming that he or she has
suffered domestic
violence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-27T13:43:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032735000200" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130327-0001.htm#13032735000200">The
other aspect is that the whole rationale of the Government’s
approach to family law is that mediation is a better answer; it is less
formal and less expensive. I 
<?notus-xml column=1113?>have said before, and I repeat, that in my experience as a practising
solicitor who did some family law work, it is all very well to talk
about mediation where there is a rough equilibrium in the position of
the parties in terms of their psychological strength or financial
resources. It is rather different in many cases where one party is so
much stronger than the other. Therefore, mediation is not necessarily
the best or only way. In any case, it has always been
available<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-27T13:43:58"></hs_TimeCode>. The
other aspect is that it would appear that only 5% of family law cases
are contested. In other words, matters are being resolved without
ending up in court. The support of qualified legal advisers is
essential to secure those outcomes in general in terms of family law.
But in particular it is important that people should be adequately
represented where domestic violence is part of the scene. As my noble
and learned friend pointed out, the conditions under which such victims
would be able to be categorised as exempt and obtain legal advice are,
on the face of it, certainly too narrow. At the very least I hope that
the Government will undertake to review how things are going, sooner
rather than later, because, as my noble and learned friend pointed out,
we are talking potentially not only about serious injury but about
death—about people, mostly women, being killed as a result of
domestic violence.</hs_para>

the Government do not want that to happen. Of course they do not.
However, there is a danger that it may happen if the Government do not
respond quickly and effectively to any issues that arise in regard to

sensitive areas. In those circumstances, if the noble Baroness and my

because across the House there is an abhorrence of domestic violence
and a desire to help the vulnerable, particularly the disabled.
However, I ask the House not to take that sympathy into an assumption
that all this is being put at risk by a callous and uncaring
Government. As I pointed out before, the legal aid bill will still be
running at something like £1.7 billion when all this is over,
and criminal legal aid is now at just over £1 billion. However,

violence against women in our society. It is unfair to use the figures

a wide range of provisions. I refer the House to the Civil Legal Aid

recall our debates about where we draw the line. My advice is that a

there is a continued risk, legal aid is available for a protective

of accessibility issues. I am glad that the noble Baroness has accepted
my invitation to visit the telephone gateway system at Hinckley. I was
genuinely impressed by the dedication of the staff and their
determination to be positive and helpful to those using the gateway.
The gateway is working with the Government Equalities Office to ensure
that probing questions are asked to identify discrimination. I agree

made about vulnerable people, I said as the Bill passed through the
House that we are resistant to having a catch-all term of
“vulnerable people”. The term “vulnerable disabled
people” covers a wide range of individuals with particular needs
and issues. Although some of those to whom the term might be applied
may be unable to use the telephone or other methods permitted to give
instructions and receive advice, others will. Many people who are
extremely vulnerable or disabled will do so through a third party. At
present, they have to wait for an appointment. The gateway will enable
third-party access and will often be able to signpost those eligible

Scotland of Asthal:</Member></B> My Lords, first, I thank
the noble Lord, Lord McNally, for the concessions that he has most
generously made in agreeing to look at a number of the issues that have
been brought to his attention, and to review these regulations and
their operation—and I quote him—“from day
one”. I also thank him for the enormous compliment he pays me
when he refers to my “ferocious talent” as an advocate
and the “growl of approval” that follows my every
utterance in this House. However, if there is limited approval for the
few words that I utter from time to time, I hope it is because the
House finds the evidence upon which I base my contentions sound and
meritorious and not because there are inherent flaws. Every advocate,
no matter how skilful, can work only with the material they are given.
One cannot make a commanding case built on straw.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13032735000236" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130327-0002.htm#13032735000236">It is right that we
look at the evidence we have referred to. I ask the noble Lord to look
again at the comment made by the president of the Family Division that
the family courts are “desperately unprepared” for the
consequences of these regulations. The reason for this is that for many
years the family courts have relied on the skill and assistance of the
legal representatives who appear before them, whose job in family as
opposed to other work is to work collaboratively to try to bring a
resolution to some very difficult family problems. That is why only 5%
of the cases that come before the courts are contested; all the other
cases are properly, skilfully and painfully mediated in a collaborative
and responsive way. The fact that legal aid is to be withdrawn from
family cases is why Lord Justice Munby is so concerned. He echoes what
is felt by all those who are privileged to work in this
area.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032735000237" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130327-0002.htm#13032735000237">I also
specifically thank the noble Lord for his acknowledgement that the cost
in relation to these proceedings may be increased if they are not held
together. I particularly want to thank him for that. But if the
Government believe that these regulations will save money, I, for one,
believe that they will be found to be mistaken. The cost in terms of
lives will be great, but so will the cost to the legal justice system.
I am being told by magistrates that if perpetrators are going to be
able to cross-examine their victims in court, the special procedures
that we currently have will be inadequate to protect them. Just
yesterday, a magistrate in Kent told me that that day they had a case
involving domestic violence in which the woman was reluctant to be
cross-examined by the perpetrator. They are having difficulties now.
Therefore, although I understand the Government’s position, I
still bitterly regret it. On that basis, I ask to test the opinion of
the
House.</hs_para><Division><hs_time UID="13032735000288" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130327-0002.htm#13032735000288">2.31

Following the financial crisis, the European Parliament and the Council
of the European Union laid down specific rules for credit rating
agencies operating in the EU. The regulation was adopted in 2009 and
was amended in 2011. The regulation introduced a common regulatory
approach in order to ensure that credit ratings
are conducted in accordance with a set of principles. This includes
requirements for credit rating agencies to ensure their
methodologies are rigorous, systemic, continuous and subject to
validation. It also requires credit rating agencies to disclose
publicly the methodologies they use. The European Securities and
Markets Authority (ESMA) has exclusive responsibility for supervising
credit rating agencies in the European Union. The Government are
supportive of these
measures.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13032736000036" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130327w0001.htm#13032736000036">A
further set of amendments to the regulation was agreed on 27 November
2012 and is expected to come into force later this year. These
amendments aim to encourage market participants and the European

on credit ratings, including in assessing the financial instruments

England (HEFCE). The number of full-time home and EU undergraduate
students recruited by these institutions is regulated by HEFCE,

are alternative providers that do not receive HEFCE grant but can be

to loans and grants from the Student Loans Company. There is currently
no limit on the number of students these providers can recruit but we

expected to be carried out to exonerate a wrongfully convicted person
or to provide justice for family members of victims, so the decision to
try Mr Magnitsky posthumously, against the wishes of his family, is of
utmost concern to the Government. In addition, the closure of the
investigation into Mr Magnitsky's death due to an apparent “lack
of evidence of a crime” is particularly disappointing given that
the Russian Presidential Committee on Human Rights concluded in 2011
that his death was likely the result of being severely beaten and
denied medical treatment. The Secretary of State for Foreign and
Commonwealth Affairs, my right honourable friend the Member for
Richmond (Yorks) (Mr Hague) raised this case when he met Foreign
Minister Lavrov for talks in London on 13 March. In our annual human
rights dialogue in May we will reiterate to the Russian authorities the
importance of bringing this case to a thorough and transparent
conclusion.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question"><hs_DebateHeading UID="13032736000413" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130327w0001.htm#13032736000413">Small
