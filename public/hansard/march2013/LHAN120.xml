Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, the power of national
Parliaments to issue a reasoned opinion that an EU proposal does not
uphold subsidiarity has been exercised many times since 2010, including
five times by your Lordships’ House. Only once, on the Monti II
proposals on the right to collective action across borders, have enough
Parliaments done so to trigger what is called a yellow card. However,
the views of national Parliaments have been influential on a wide range
of issues and the continuing use of this procedure should give them an
increasing
role<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-05T14:38:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Kakkar:</Member></B> My Lords, I declare my interest as a member of
your Lordships’ European Union Committee, Sub-Committee B. Under
the current test procedure, this Parliament can only challenge the
Commission on the basis of subsidiarity, as the Minister has said, if
at least eight other Parliaments also raise concerns. What obligations
does the Lisbon treaty place on national Parliaments to participate
actively in the scrutiny of directives, because without such scrutiny
and participation, the subsidiarity test cannot possibly work? Under
what circumstances would the Government consider using the red card in
the test procedure, to seek judicial review by the European Court of
Justice, where this Parliament, through its scrutiny, has raised
substantial concerns about subsidiarity and where other Parliaments may
not have participated in the
process<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-05T14:39:07"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030549000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0001.htm#13030549000004"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Wallace of Saltaire" PimsId="4501" UID="13030549000402" xid="1482" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0001.htm#13030549000402">Lord
Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, in the nature of events,
red cards are to be used in an emergency situation, not as part of the
normal procedure. Perhaps it would help the House if I point out that
last year, the Swedish Parliament issued 20 reasoned opinions; the
Luxembourg Chamber of Deputies issued seven in 2011 and a larger number
in 2012; the French Senate issued seven last year; and the House of
Lords issued five. It is not the case that we are the only Parliament
to be active in this regard.</hs_para>

operate a diplomatic network in precisely that area. I hope that
scrutiny committees through COSAC—the Conference of
Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs of Parliaments of the
European Union—also now operates actively in this regard. I am
told that it has become a much more effective body since I used to
attend COSAC meetings many years ago when I was the chairman of a
sub-committee. There is now a set of offices in Brussels of national
Parliaments which provides a network where national scrutiny committees
can get together. I hope that the Lisbon treaty arrangements will allow
that network to become more and more

past 33 years all British Governments have promised not to allow
enactment of proposed EU legislation which is still being scrutinised
by our Select Committees here and in the other place, will the Minister
confirm Written Answers which reveal that this scrutiny reserve was
broken no fewer than 403 times between January 2010 and June
2012? Does that not make 403 pieces of EU legislation that Parliament
has not agreed but which have been steamrollered through by the

Wallace of </B><B>Saltaire</B><B>:</B></Member> My Lords, the noble
Lord uses his characteristically robust and colourful language. There
is always a tension between the time that national Parliaments wish to
take for scrutiny and the pressures that national Governments,
including our own, may wish to give to taking decisions. There are
those in national Parliaments who regard the eight-week limit for
taking a scrutiny decision as unfortunate, but I am informed by those
who know the Brussels situation better than I do that the earlier
national Parliaments submit reasoned opinions in the process of
negotiation, the greater effect they have.</hs_para>

to get better at enlisting other national Parliaments when we use the
yellow card because that is the shortfall? Will he confirm that on the
one occasion when it was used, the Commission withdrew its
proposal—the Monti II proposal? Will he also confirm that the
right to take action in the Court is one for this House, not the

On the Monti II proposals, some of the reasoned opinions submitted by
national Parliaments were much more about the principle of the proposal
rather than the subsidiarity issue. Her Majesty's Government did not
suggest that we should submit reasoned opinion on subsidiarity issues

the logic of that. We are in an increasingly globalised economy. That
economy requires increasing international regulation of one sort or
another. We are in a constant situation of tension between
international regulators—not just the European Union but many
other international bodies as well—wishing to extend the process

Ramsbotham:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply.
Last week, the Justice Secretary appeared before the Justice Select
Committee in another place and said that we have a duty to supervise
offenders in a consistent way and that he wanted to make the probation
world more independent of Government and the big bureaucratic documents
that tell them how to do their job. For 100 years until recently
dissolved by its subordination to prisons, the probation service, in
partnership with the police and the courts, was responsible for the
consistent supervision of community-sentenced offenders independent of
such interference. Can the Minister tell the House how the Justice
Secretary’s proposed division of responsibility for the
supervision of different types of offender between probation and an
unknown number of untried private and voluntary sector organisations
will better honour his duty of
consistency<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-05T14:48:23"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-05T14:48:28"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

McNally:</Member></B> I hear the growl from the Benches opposite, but
it is interesting that we are using the 2007 Act to carry
through these reforms of probation, so they are not exactly being
original in terms of how we should develop these matters. I do not take
fully the point made by the noble Lord about going into the 
<?notus-xml column=1373?>unknown. The fact is, as those noble Lords opposite who have had
dealings with these matters will know, that the voluntary and the
private sectors have been involved in offender management for a very
long time. We are trying, within a very tight budget, to see whether we
can reform the probation service and dealings with offenders in order
to bring in the best of what works outside. It has been interesting to
learn that good ideas on offender management are not constrained simply
to the probation service. As I said in my original reply, the public
sector has ultimate responsibility for public protection, but we think
we can deliver a reorganisation that also makes use of the wide variety
of experience and expertise that exists in this
area.</hs_para>

the answers given by the Minister. He will be aware that one of the
most important things for the probation service is that there is public
confidence in the work that it does. Part of that public confidence
comes from the transparency of having information about the work that
it does, and understanding what works and what is most effective. In
his Answer, he said that the public sector has the ultimate
responsibility. Does that mean that all services, even those outsourced

that one of the outcomes of this rehabilitation revolution will be a

called “payment by results” for those that take on these
undertakings if they manage to achieve a rehabilitation, which means
people not reoffending within a specific time. Part of the problem we
face is that nearly half of offenders leaving prison reoffend within
one year. We hope that the system will incentivise those providing
services to think creatively about rehabilitation. The worst thing for
victims and the taxpayer is this revolving door, which successive
Administrations are faced with and which, I believe, the rehabilitation
proposals we are bringing in give us a real chance of breaking

management reasons as the Prime Minister seeks to appease his party

be raised from all financial institutions across the EU; it would be
raised only from those established in countries which levy the tax. A

through multifarious channels but, obviously, at the end of the day, a

2011 the French Government proposed such a tax at a global level in G20
and there was widespread opposition to it from, among others, the US,
China, Australia and Canada. Sadly, there is nowhere near a global
consensus on whether such a tax is a good idea, and, equally, there is
no consensus, even within the EU, about where the money should go. The
French were, and are, keen that at least part of the proceeds should go
to development aid, but the Germans, for example, propose that any
receipts from the FTT should simply go into the central tax

significant concerns about their effect. I have therefore listened to
people’s concerns and my department is acting quickly to improve
the drafting so that there can be no doubt that the regulations go no
further than the previous set of <I>Principles and Rules</I>, inherited

important is what is in patients’ best interests. Where this is
co-operation and integration there would be nothing in the regulations

Wheeler:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for reading out
the response to the Urgent Question in another place. While we welcome
the climbdown on the regulations, can he appreciate the sheer disbelief
and consternation across the House at the regulations, coming as they
do after the recent SI on local Healthwatch that even the
Government’s own supporters described as complex, draconian and
muddled? These regulations flew directly in the face of lengthy and
repeated government assurances about Healthwatch’s independence
and right to campaign. Now we have a repeat of the story with the
Section 75 regulations, which again made a mockery of the assurances by
both Commons and Lords Ministers during the passage of the Health and
Social Care Act. In the words of the Minister, GP commissioning would

the Francis report made clear, GPs must exploit their new role as
commissioners to the full to ensure that their patients get safe and
effective care. How will care be safe and effective if the
coalition’s competition policy on the NHS is in chaos? Despite
all the upheavals inflicted on the NHS, there is still no clarity in
policy. The Government’s U-turn is clearly a response to
Labour’s fatal Motion. The writing is on the wall for their
plans to marketise the NHS. Why did it take this Motion to make the

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, first, I understand perfectly the anxiety
that has been voiced about the way the regulations are worded. This is
a problem centring in almost every respect on legal drafting. Our
intention and our instructions have been as they always have: to create
a set of regulations—as expected under the terms of the Act, as
the noble Baroness knows—which reflect in every way the
assurances given by Ministers during the passage of the Health and
Social Care Act, no more and no
less.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030549000083" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0001.htm#13030549000083">However,
to the lay reader, certain parts of the regulations which, in legal
terms, do as they were intended appear not to do so. We took very
seriously the fact that perception differed from
reality—perceptions matter—and therefore, early last
week, I put in train a programme of work to revise the regulations.
However, we also determined that we could not come to Parliament with
half a story and that we would have to present our fully formed
response to the concerns by tabling a set of revised regulations. We
were not in a position to do that until this week. It was therefore not
the case that the Opposition’s Motion forced us into this
position. I was well aware that we had to respond to the concerns
voiced not only in this House but in the wider healthcare
community<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-05T15:16:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030549000084" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0001.htm#13030549000084">The
noble Baroness said that she thought our competition policy lacked
clarity. Our competition policy is based on competition law as it now
appears and as it was during the previous Administration. There is no
question of our changing that. The idea that we are trying to marketise
the NHS is, as the noble Baroness knows, not true. In the Health and
Social Care Act, we included a specific provision which prevents the
Secretary of State or anyone else preferring independent sector
providers over the NHS. That was something which the previous
Government did not see fit to
do.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030549000085" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0001.htm#13030549000085">The noble

patients?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030549000087" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0001.htm#13030549000087"><B><Member ContinuationText="Earl Howe" PimsId="1035" UID="13030549000472" xid="1749" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0001.htm#13030549000472">Earl
Howe:</Member></B> I think that everybody was agreed during the passage
of the Health and Social Care Bill that we wish to encourage
integration in the way that services are commissioned. Integration in
this context should be taken as a term that reflects the experience of
the patient. The patient has to feel that he or she is on a seamless
pathway of care. That care may be provided by a number of agencies, if
necessary, whether in the NHS or social care, but the patient’s
experience should not be disjointed. Therefore, as my noble friend will
remember, numerous provisions were inserted into what is now the Act to
ensure that commissioning 
<?notus-xml column=1382?>should be on that basis. Nothing in these regulations interferes with
that, but it is very much in our minds to make it crystal clear that
integration of services is one of the main factors which commissioners
should take into
account.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030549000088" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0001.htm#13030549000088"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Morgan of Drefelin" PimsId="1977" UID="13030549000473" xid="1700" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0001.htm#13030549000473">Baroness

permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a Statement on the future
basing of the British Army. To assist honourable and right honourable

2010, we set out in the strategic defence and security review the
configuration of forces that the UK would require to meet future
threats and we committed to have completed the return of UK troops from
Germany by 2020. Last summer, I announced to the House the structure of
the Regular Army component of Future Force 2020. Today, I can announce
the 
<?notus-xml column=1385?>future pattern of basing of the Regular Army in the
UK so that our service men and women, their families and the
communities that host Army units, have clarity about where they will be
based in the future and when moves are likely to
occur.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030549000101" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0001.htm#13030549000101">As the
House will recall, in July 2011 the then Defence Secretary set out our
initial plans for the future of the MoD estate on which we will
accommodate, train and prepare our Armed Forces. Those plans have been
significantly refined over the intervening 18 months and reflect the
fully developed military advice on the optimum affordable basing lay
down to accommodate the Army in its future
structure.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030549000102" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0001.htm#13030549000102">This
announcement honours our commitment to bring all our troops home from
Germany by 2020, with all but 4,400 of 20 Brigade home by Christmas
2016. It supports the Army 2020 structure, the integrated reserves
training model and the generation of the Army’s
future military capability. It delivers a £1.8 billion
investment in the UK economy in infrastructure and accommodation and
annual savings of £240 million in reduced costs and improved
efficiency of training and maintenance operations, on top of the
£100 million-plus annual saving generated by the previously
announced moves from
Germany.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030549000103" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0001.htm#13030549000103">The
return of the British Army from Germany marks the end of an era and I
want to put on record the huge debt of gratitude we owe to the German
Government and the German people for the support, both moral and
material, they have shown our Armed Forces over more than six decades.
In fact, that return has already begun. In 2010, there were 20,000
British service personnel based in Germany together with their
dependants and civilian staff. Already, that figure has been reduced to
less than 16,000, with significant force elements having already
relocated, such as the Headquarters Allied Rapid Reaction Corps, which
has moved to Innsworth, Gloucestershire.</hs_para>

of the return is well advanced. We are on track to reduce our presence
in Germany by more than 70% by 2015, against our SDSR target of 50%.
The long-term retention of a small training presence in Germany,
utilising NATO training facilities, is under consideration, but we will
be closing all major unit locations. But this is not just about
rebasing the Army from Germany. It is about providing a basing plan for
Army 2020 in the UK, which will allow the Army to generate its military
capability in the optimal way.</hs_para>

the plan has developed, two key principles have emerged to inform it.
First, the armoured infantry brigades of the reaction force should
coalesce around a single location. We have concluded that Salisbury
Plain Training Area is the only place in the country where we have the
capability to carry out the complex and demanding training exercises
they need to conduct. Having all three brigades located in close
proximity around the plain will enable them to train and fight more
effectively, and will present significant opportunities for efficiency
in equipment support and people management. Secondly, the Army should
retain a UK-wide footprint, maintaining the vital link to civil
society, fostering closer links between reserve units and their
partnered regular units and supporting nationwide recruitment and
engagement.</hs_para>

principles, the Army has identified the laydown that represents the
best value for money, both in terms of utilisation of existing estate
and in terms of minimisation of running costs. The focus will be on
increasing consolidation around seven centres at: Salisbury Plain
Training Area, where we will invest over £800 million;
north-east England, centred on Catterick; Aldershot; Edinburgh and
Leuchars; Colchester and Swanton Morley; Stafford and Donnington; and,
in the east Midlands, focused on Cottesmore and North Luffenham, where
£180 million will be invested—all while maintaining a
regional presence in other parts of the country. Consolidating around
these seven centres will significantly reduce the need for moves,
giving Army personnel and their families greater certainty about where
they will live and work, with real benefits in terms of increased
stability, access to long-term spousal employment opportunities,
continuity in schooling and the chance to set down roots and access the
benefits of home
ownership.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030549000107" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0001.htm#13030549000107">This
announcement will maintain the broad pattern of Army activity in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. With 45 Commando Royal Marines,
remaining in Arbroath for the foreseeable future, the measures
announced today will see an increase of about 600-plus in total regular
Armed Forces numbers north of the border as against the July 2011
baseline, even as the Armed Forces reduce in size by about 17% overall.
In both Wales and Northern Ireland, overall numbers will reduce by
approximately
400.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030549000108" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0001.htm#13030549000108">This
announcement sets out our firm plans for the laydown of the British
Army, subject of course to gaining the necessary planning,
environmental and other regulatory approvals. They are
underpinned by a capital investment from the defence budget of
£1.8 billion, including £1 billion of investment in new
living accommodation to provide 7,800 single living spaces and 1,900
new and refurbished units of family accommodation. This investment will
provide a welcome stimulus to the UK construction industry and, taken
together with significant purchasing power currently going into the
German economy that will be diverted to the UK, will help create jobs
across the regions and nations of the
UK.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030549000109" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0001.htm#13030549000109">The MoD
plays a major role in the Government’s public land release
programme and will be looking to release additional land and
surplus service family accommodation where it is no longer needed.
Under this plan, the Armed Forces will leave a number of locations. The
disposal plans will be subject to further detailed work and will be
subject to the completion of the plans for the reserve estate in due
course. However, I can confirm that we plan to dispose of Howe Barracks
in Canterbury, Claro Barracks in Ripon and parts of Copthorne Barracks
in Shrewsbury. In Scotland, we will be disposing of Craigiehall
Barracks, as well as elements of Redford Barracks and Forthside
Barracks, Stirling. Kirknewton will not now be developed as an Army
base but Dreghorn will remain as
one.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030549000110" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0001.htm#13030549000110">The MoD
intends to close Cawdor Barracks at Brawdy in Wales, which is no longer

<?notus-xml column=1387?>commercial development and job creation by the Welsh Assembly
Government, with whom we are working collaboratively in support of the
enterprise zone. The local communities in each of these areas have been
hugely supportive of the military presence over many years. The loss of

pursuing options to vacate Hyde Park Barracks and reprovide for the
Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment elsewhere within central London,
allowing for disposal of this prime development site, provided that the
regiment’s requirements can be met and that it proves value for
money to do so. These disposals, and other planned disposals, will
bring substantial receipts which have already been factored into the

costs of the MoD

a plan that is driven by the Army’s requirement to generate
military capability in the most effective and efficient way as it
reconfigures for contingent operations based almost entirely in the UK.
It represents a significant step towards the achievement of Future

United Kingdom of British Forces personnel currently based in Germany.
It also referred to reconfiguring the Army into five multirole

the SDSR, the Ministry of Defence undertook a basing review, the
conclusions of which were announced by the Secretary of State in July
2011. Under the plans announced then, RAF Kinloss would be transferred
to the Army, with some of the personnel returning from Germany being
based at Kinloss from 2014-15. RAF Leuchars was also to be
transferred to the Army, with two major units and a formation
HQ being redeployed to that site from Germany. The HQ was expected to
move to Leuchars before 2015, followed by the two units between 2015

announced a significant change in its structure based on two key
elements: reaction force brigades, centred on Salisbury Plain, and
adaptable force brigades, based on regional headquarters. We will have
an adaptable force brigade in Scotland, but it would not make sense to

and we are going to considerable lengths to ensure that that happens.
As I said in the Statement, we are spending £1 billion to
provide some 1,900 new service family accommodation units and some
7,800 single living accommodation bed spaces. The intention is that the
living conditions of those returning will be comparable to those of UK

continuity of schooling. Will the Minister reaffirm that individual
soldiers and their families will be spending

Minister has just repeated about the future basing of the Army and the
answer he gave earlier that the money involved, the capital investment,
will be ring-fenced. I assume that the Minister meant that the
£1.8 billion should be ring-fenced, which I very much welcome.
Army basing is one of the areas of doubt that now may well have been
clarified. Of course, doubt is what reduces morale in the Armed Forces,
but redundancy is another issue hanging over many members of the Army
at present. While I accept that the basing policy now brings more
clarity to where the Army is going to live, can the Minister tell us

billion which my noble friend asked me about; that is being spent on
accommodation. The noble Lord mentioned morale and I quite agree about
how important accommodation is to the morale of the members of our
Armed Forces. I spend quite a lot of time looking at the accommodation
for the three services and I do all I can to ensure that it is being
upgraded. Likewise, the noble Lord mentioned basing. We are doing
everything possible to pass messages on to members of the Armed Forces

Davies of Stamford:</Member></B> My Lords, it is the wrong decision to
bring back the Army from Germany at present, and to do so at very
considerable cost. The Minister mentioned the figure of £1.8
billion. That would have been enough to have kept Nimrod going, to have
maintained a Harrier strike force and to have bought all 22 Chinooks.
The Government have demonstrated a very perverse order of priorities in
this decision. It also deprives the Army of the training opportunities
available in Germany which are much more extensive than Salisbury
Plain, as the Minister knows very well, and of course of the
opportunity for close collaboration in Germany with the Bundeswehr and
the American army units stationed there, so it was the wrong decision.
However, perhaps I may ask the Minister for a figure that he has not
given. What is the estimate of the incremental costs in the future of
flying our troops for training in Germany, Canada or in other places
where they need more extensive training grounds—a need that
would not have arisen had we maintained our position in
Germany<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-05T16:08:25"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

noble Lord always finds something wrong with the announcements I make,
but he forgets the very difficult financial situation that we
inherited. I would point out that although we are spending a certain
amount of money on bringing our troops back from Germany, huge savings
of at least £240 million a year will be made from there on. I
would much rather see the money spent in this country than in
Germany<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-05T16:08:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Burnett:</Member></B> My Lords, the Statement confirms that 45 Commando
Royal Marines will remain at RM Condor in Arbroath. The marines of 45
Commando are this country’s specialists at mountain and arctic
warfare. Arbroath has swift access to training areas in the
Cairngorm mountains and is close to NATO’s northern flank. Since
the war, 45 Commando has deployed with great distinction these
important specialist skills on operations in the Troodos mountains in
Cyprus, the Radfan mountains in Aden, and more recently in Afghanistan.

telling me last night how impressed he was when he visited them on
winter training in Norway earlier this week. I agree with my noble
friend that remaining in Arbroath will be good for the Royal Marines
and for their families. As I said earlier, 45 Commando Royal Marines
will remain in Arbroath for the foreseeable future. We investigated the
feasibility of the move to the south-west but that option did not, at
this stage, represent value for money and Arbroath is not needed for
Army basing in Scotland. It is my understanding, as my noble friend

Suitable barracks would need to be found within the centre of London

the public procurement process—I presume—and knowing
about the delay after delay that such processes in the MoD seem to
attract? What processes have been set up to consult with the services
families organisations? Accommodation is a problem but there is also
the linked problem of an influx of young families requiring more school
places, to go on lists for local doctors and dentists, and hospital
accommodation, which was not mentioned in the Statement. What processes
are in place to deal with that and to ensure that when these families
come back, those facilities are there for them? Finally, how does this

accommodation, as did the previous Government at the end, and it is
hugely different now to three years ago. The level of Army
accommodation is catching up with the Navy’s and the Air
Force’s and, on the whole, is really good. I am very much
looking forward to going down to Salisbury Plain, I hope next

We are in discussion with Wiltshire Council about the very issues that

question. The creation of independent Scottish armed forces would not
be as simple as transferring existing Scottish-recruited or
Scotland-based units. The UK Armed Forces are a totally integrated,
pan-UK organisation and parts cannot simply be broken off like bits of
a chocolate bar. Individual members of the UK Armed Forces could not
simply be co-opted. They would have to be given a choice and it is far
from clear that Scots in the UK Armed Forces, or members of units
recruited or based in Scotland, would automatically choose to join the
armed forces of an independent Scotland. The prospect of being part of
smaller, less globally active armed forces might be seen as less

the integration of the Reserve Forces with the Regular Forces, about

are various indicators that we can use to assess benefits’
adequacy. The most basic is whether they are sufficient to keep people
out of poverty and, patently, they are not, as so many people living on
benefits are in poverty if one uses the relative income and material
deprivation measures. The income support received by, for example, a
couple with two children or 
<?notus-xml column=1399?>a lone parent with one child is around 30% below the poverty line.
Briefings from children’s charities underline the hardship that
families already experience as a result. For instance, research
undertaken by Barnardo’s among its service users found that
two-thirds were cutting back on fuel and half were borrowing money.
Three-quarters reported that food poverty was impacting on their
children’s health and well-being. Similarly, a Children’s
Society survey of teachers found that nearly half of those surveyed are
seeing children coming into school hungry. Recent peer research
undertaken by five Gingerbread community researchers in partnership
with the Poverty Alliance found many lone parents skipping meals to
feed their children. As one said, “Occasionally, I’ll
miss meals and things like that just to make sure that they get wee
bits and pieces. It makes me feel better about them having than me
having”. This is an example of a common phenomenon, where
mothers deprive themselves of basics to try to protect their children
against the worst impact of poverty, as they act as the shock-absorbers
of poverty. It is an example, too, of a point made by the noble
Baroness, Lady Howe of Idlicote, on our first day in Committee about
how women are disproportionately affected by the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-05T16:21:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

benchmark of adequacy is the minimum income standard developed by the
Joseph Rowntree Foundation. It represents what members of the public
through group discussion have arrived at as the minimum acceptable
standard of living: what you need in order to have the opportunities
and choices necessary to participate in society. I emphasise
that it is about needs, as socially determined, rather than
about
wants<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-05T16:21:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030549000174" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0001.htm#13030549000174">The
latest calculations indicate that a couple with two children, or a lone
parent with one child living on the basic safety net benefit of income
support, receive only three-fifths of the income needed to meet the
minimum income standard. A single working-age person receives only
two-fifths. The researchers, who are colleagues of mine at the Centre
for Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University, observe that,
because increases in costs have not been adequately captured by the
consumer prices index, out-of-work benefits fall even further short,
providing a lower minimum income living standard for non-pensioners
than they did in 2008 when the MIS was first calculated. They
concluded, even before this Bill was proposed, that the gap between the
incomes and needs of the worst-off households is widening, especially
for families with children. While the JRF is not suggesting that
benefits should be raised to the level of the MIS, the sheer scale of
the shortfall is indicative of how far they fall below the
decency benchmark established by members of the
public<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-05T16:22:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030549000175" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0001.htm#13030549000175">Policy
has been more successful in ensuring that pensioners can achieve
minimum income standards, which is of course a good thing, but
according to Professor Jonathan Bradshaw, the decision to uprate
pensions by 2.5% and working-age benefits by 1% for three years is
going to exacerbate further the absurd differentials in benefit rates
that have developed over time. In 1948, a single pensioner received
only 10p more than a single person on national assistance. 
<?notus-xml column=1400?>Now, a single female receives £71 per week in
jobseeker’s allowance. When they are eligible, they get
£142.70 on pension credit. A lone mother with one child gets
only £133.21 a week. These differentials, Professor Bradshaw
says, clearly have nothing to do with

brings us to the second half of the amendment, on the principles
underlying uprating policies. The significance of these policies was
underlined in an earlier JRF study. It pointed out that uprating
policies have big effects over time. They are among the most
significant decisions taken by Chancellors. Their gradual effects seem
imperceptible on a year-to-year basis yet they carry immense
implications for the future. This year’s decisions will
certainly be perceptible, and the implications for the future are even
more immense, because, whatever decision is taken by future uprating
policies, they will be uprating benefits that have been significantly
depressed in real terms over a three-year
period.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030549000177" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0001.htm#13030549000177">The
report called for a more open debate about this often hidden area of
public policy, so that decisions that prevent the poorest members of
society keeping up with rising living standards would not be taken in
the dark. Unknown to most people, uprating policies have resulted in a
significant erosion of relative living standards among benefit
recipients over most of the past three decades. Recently, this has been
exacerbated by the use of CPI rather than RPI as the measure of
inflation, particularly during the period when prices of
necessities that represent a disproportionate share of spending among
benefit recipients have risen faster than prices generally—a
point that we made on the first day in Committee. As Donald Hirsch of
the Centre for Research in Social Policy comments, in this context, the
index used to uprate benefits has become a highly imperfect mechanism
for preserving their real value and a rather arbitrary means of raising
benefits by an amount that politicians feel that the country can afford
rather than of protecting living
standards<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-05T16:25:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030549000178" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0001.htm#13030549000178">Of
course, assessments of affordability cannot be ignored. They can also
be contested, as we are doing in relation to this Bill, but looking to
the future I agree with Donald Hirsch that there is a need to establish
principles linking benefit uprating to some stable concept of what is
fair, rather than just ad hoc decisions about what can be afforded. He
suggested that, as a start, this might involve reasserting the
principle of human decency whereby the real value of benefits is
genuinely protected and that, in the longer term, if prosperity starts
to grow again, we need to consider how those in greatest need can share
in such
growth<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-05T16:26:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030549000179" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0001.htm#13030549000179">I

advice bureaux and the like of the uncertainty which is being
introduced by this Bill. It is 
<?notus-xml column=1401?>ironic that we have talked so much of certainty in

long as benefits have been uprated by inflation, it has been possible
to budget taking them into account. But this cap on uprating is a major
and apparently long-term change to the whole principle of our benefit
system. Recipients and those who work with them are owed an
explanation. I am not looking for commitments from either Front Bench
beyond 2015, but I would be very grateful for comment from both of them
on whether this is to be seen as a temporary reduction with the aim of
restoring benefit values after 2016 so that we ensure a decent living
standard for those on benefit—the requirement that has been so
ably put by the noble Baroness, Lady Lister. Or is this actually a
permanent reduction to a lower level, which will then be stabilised in
real terms after 2016, or a continuation of a gradual reduction
expected to continue after 2016? None of those options is desirable,
but they are very different in the effect that they will have, and a
sense of purpose and direction from the Government and Opposition is
important in all this. It is important to know just where benefits are
anticipated to be going in future, both from the opposition and the
government Front Bench. I hope that they can supply that in the debate

intervention on this amendment so ably moved by the noble Baroness,
Lady Lister. I entirely concur with her view and analysis. I want to
add, however, the fact that I am now very frightened about what is
happening in the short term. There is a complacent view held among
policymakers generally that the work programme and universal credit are
all that need be done. I support both, and will not cast any aspersions
on any Governments or make any party political points, but both these
important reforms will take at least 10 years to go into steady state
and be of assistance to our most hard-pressed, low-income households in
the United

am right about that, and about the prognosis for the United
Kingdom’s level of economy over that period, we face a really
difficult period of activity where we cannot rely safely on the work
programme and universal credit to provide the social protection that
this country needs and expects. We need to do something in the short
term that seeks to understand what is going on. More than anything
else, this is a plea for really rigorous and urgent monitoring of
everything going on: every bit of evidence from every constituent part
of the United Kingdom. We need to watch carefully what is happening.
The noble Baroness is quite right: malnutrition of children will result
over the next five to 10 years if we are not extremely
careful.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030549000184" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0001.htm#13030549000184">Now,
this is no one’s fault. I understand perfectly well the need to

nobody could have foreseen the difficulties or longevity of the

with 
<?notus-xml column=1402?>in the short term of five to 10 years. That does not seem like a long

them for the best part of 25 years. The noble Baroness is one of
them— she nodded at that point. This is a serious point:
we have internationally recognised experts on this yet we are deaf to
what they say to us. A growing body of opinion says that something

want to make a couple of quick suggestions about how we might deal with
that in conjunction with looking at the principles in the long and
short term and how we perform the monitoring and evaluation. What is
happening in the devolved legislatures of the United Kingdom is very
important. There are positive responses in Wales, and in Scotland,
which I know best, where the need is recognised. We must first promote
the need to do things differently. That may mean financing food
banks—that is not something that I want, but if the alternative
is malnutrition in children, we cannot ignore that. It is easier in
smaller countries which have shorter lines of communication and a
smaller scale. They can move more flexibly and faster. Working with the
legislatures in Cardiff and Edinburgh, I think that there are some
quick wins that central Government could help to promote. I
hope that we will do that and keep the channels of communication

the second part of that, working with local authorities will be so
important. The evidence coming back from housing authorities,

There is a spatial dimension to some of these issues

always safely relied on a centralised, unified United Kingdom social
security process as the right thing to do. I have less confidence about

debate, introduced by my noble friend Lady Lister with her now
characteristic blend of expertise and passion. I am sure that we are
all grateful to her for opening up the question so well. The quotes
that she shared with the Committee about children arriving hungry at
school and mothers missing meals and going without themselves to
protect their children from the effects of poverty were, on one level,
not a surprise to any of us, but they are still shocking. They should
be profoundly
shocking.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030549000193" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0001.htm#13030549000193">I
found the point made by the right reverend Prelate very interesting and
I understand why he would like those assurances from both sides of the
Committee. My noble friend Lord McKenzie of Luton made Labour’s
position clear at the beginning of our first day in Committee. It is
this: if we were in government right now, we would be uprating benefits
in line with inflation. However, we
cannot<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-05T16:39:32"></hs_TimeCode> make a
commitment at this stage for the next Parliament. My view is that that
is not a good idea anyway. We are fundamentally opposed to the whole
principle in the Bill of fixing the levels of uprating for a period. We
have perfectly good mechanisms for uprating benefits annually in line
with inflation in the light of prevailing economic circumstances. To be
honest, I would not want to be tempted into anything other than
maintaining that position, but I fully understand why the right
reverend Prelate is pressing the concerns that he is
pressing.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13030549000194" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0001.htm#13030549000194">I
also found the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood of
Kirkhope, very interesting. He drew in the spatial dimensions of
poverty and the wide-ranging regional issues. That is something that we
may come back to. I particularly agreed with his point about the need
to monitor what is going on. The next amendment that I shall move
encourages the Government to look specifically at the impact on child
poverty. I also support the noble Lord’s point about 
<?notus-xml column=1404?>the need for a cumulative assessment of all the changes between 2010 and

three years covered by the first uprating and the two years of this
Bill? It would be very helpful to the Committee to understand what
assessment the Government have made. At a time when three new food
banks are opening every week and even families in work are finding it a
struggle to make ends meet, the state needs to take particular care to
demonstrate that resources are gathered and distributed in a way that
is fair to everyone. In the light of that, I shall be very interested

Stowell of Beeston:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble
Baroness, Lady Lister, for moving this amendment and explaining her
thinking. Of course, I recognise the serious issues that she and other
noble Lords have raised during the course of this debate. I would not
claim first-hand experience of living on benefits, so I do not bring to
this debate any presumption about those on benefits finding what we are
doing anything other than difficult, but is an inescapable fact that
when setting benefit levels successive Governments have sought to
strike a balance between the needs of claimants, maintaining work
incentives and affordability.</hs_para>

uprating legislation recognises this explicitly. The Social Security
Administration Act 1992 requires the Secretary of State to make
his annual review of benefit levels based on the increase in prices. He
is then given discretion as to how to uprate certain benefits, having
regard to the national economic situation and any other matters that he
considers relevant. Parliament therefore requires the Secretary of
State to take certain issues into account when considering the level at
which the benefits in question are set. In bringing forward this Bill,
we have considered these issues carefully and struck a balance between
providing a cash increase, protecting certain key benefits and making
necessary
savings.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030549000198" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0001.htm#13030549000198">Benefit
levels also have a significant bearing on work incentives. The
complexity of the current system largely arises from successive
Governments’ attempts to balance benefit income against work
incentives. That is why universal credit is such an important measure
as it applies a single set of rules focused on maintaining the
incentive to take up work or more work. In response to some of the
points made in this debate, I shall say something that I know is shared
around the Committee. This Government believe that work is the best
route out of poverty, and that is why we are focused on making sure
that work pays.</hs_para>

was the noble Baroness, Lady Lister, who talked about how benefits
could impact on people living in poverty. We believe it is misguided to
try to 
<?notus-xml column=1405?>lift people over the 60% median income line through benefit increases
alone. This does not change their lives or those of their children
because it does not tackle the reason they find themselves in poverty
in the first place. We accept that most benefit rates are below the 60%
median income line that measures relative poverty but it has never been
the intention to alleviate poverty through benefit payment.</hs_para>

move into work. We expect some 3.1 million households to gain from the
move to universal credit, on average by about £168 a month.
Around 75% of those gainers will be in the bottom 40% of the income

Government recognise that very soon—from April this

the passage of the Welfare Reform Act will be implemented. I want to
reassure the Committee that the Government take very seriously their
responsibility for monitoring the effects of the changes that will be
implemented through the Welfare Reform Act. We have put in place a

Hollis of Heigham:</Member></B> My Lords, to add to my noble
friend’s point, my obviously localised and limited experience of
food banks has been that before about 2010, in so far as they were in
play, food banks were mostly drawn upon by young people. These were
very often young men aged under 25 who were getting the shared rate for
housing benefit in the private rented sector and found, as Shelter and
others have told us over the years, that it did not match the rent they
were required to pay; it was a very discrete group. They, in my
localised experience, often had to turn to food banks to cope. Now the
Government have extended that limitation on housing benefit from 25 to
35, while producing additional pressures right across the benefits
spectrum, as my noble friend Lady Farrington has said. It is a
disgraceful aspect of the fifth-richest nation in the world that so
many of our people have to make recourse to food banks because our
benefit system does not sustain them in the way it
should.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-05?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_05_PT_1/A7988963ADE2B8CE4F00A1289F1DE0518E90061B" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 5 March 2013">Tuesday,

Sherlock:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 12 is in my name and that of
my noble friend Lord McKenzie of Luton. This amendment would require
the Secretary of State to publish and lay before Parliament a report
assessing the impact of the order on the number of children living in
the four measures of child poverty set out in the Child Poverty Act;
namely, relative low income, combined low income and material
deprivation, absolute low income, and persistent poverty. The aim is
very simple. It is to force the Government to face up to the
consequences of their actions and to come clean about the impact of
these measures on child
poverty<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-05T17:15:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

probably is important to look at the backdrop to this. Since the goal
of ending child poverty by 2020 was first announced in 1999, the UK has
made real progress. Some 1.1 million children were taken out of
relative child poverty between 1998-99 and 2010-11, and 2.1 million
children were taken out of absolute child poverty between 1998-99 and
2010-11. But now we are going into reverse. The rise in child poverty
likely to be caused by these measures is on top of a net rise in child
poverty of 400,000 by 2015 and 800,000 by 2020, resulting from the
Government’s current fiscal policies, as seen in the IFS
analysis of
2011<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-05T17:17:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

right—the Institute for Fiscal Studies has a pretty good record
on these things—that means a rise in child poverty of at least 1
million children under the relative low-income measure is now likely by
2020. However, the relative low-income measure is just one of the four
poverty measures in the Child Poverty Act. I should like to ask the
Government why Ministers have not given any figures on the number of
children who will be pushed into absolute poverty by the Bill, despite
the fact that the Government have the same capacity to produce an
estimate on that measure as on the relative low-income measure. I look
forward to hearing the answer because, as the Minister will realise,
the Government have a statutory duty to reduce absolute child poverty
under the Child Poverty Act. Therefore, they presumably must be able to
measure it to know if they have fulfilled that statutory
duty<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-05T17:18:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030549000247" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0001.htm#13030549000247">Similarly,
the Government have given no assessment of the likely impact of the
Bill on material deprivation, despite again having a statutory duty to
reduce material deprivation under the Child Poverty Act. Even if
Ministers did not feel able to produce a numerical estimate, I cannot
see any reason why they could not produce a narrative assessment, a
point made repeatedly by the Child Poverty Action
Group<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-05T17:18:29"></hs_TimeCode>. Finally,
and at the risk of being repetitive, we have seen no assessment, not
even a narrative one, of the impact of the Bill on persistent poverty,
despite the fact that yet again the Government have a statutory duty to
reduce persistent child poverty under the Child Poverty
Act<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-05T17:18:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

disgrace after all the careful progress that has been made. The reason
the previous Government took child poverty so seriously was that it had
risen so dramatically under the previous Conservative
Government. The researcher, Jonathan Bradshaw, who has already been
mentioned today, found that child poverty increased nearly threefold in
the 1980s alone 
<?notus-xml column=1414?>and that the well-being of British children compared unfavourably with
that of children in most developed nations. That was the reason the
Labour Government acted. It was also the reason why, by the time of the
last election, there was apparently cross-party support for that goal
of tackling child poverty in Britain. We are now in the
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-05T17:19:23"></hs_TimeCode>position of

pianist, but if I do not take lessons to learn to play the piano and I
never practise, no matter how many times I say it, the odds of my
becoming a concert pianist must be seen to be slim. In that case, on
what basis can Ministers say they are committed to eradicating child
poverty in the UK if they keep bringing forward Bills that drive it
ever higher<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-05T17:20:04"></hs_TimeCode>? It

amendment really is for the Government’s own good. If they are

they cannot possibly achieve that. If they are not committed to that
goal, the nation has a right to know that and still to understand what
the impact of these measures would be. That is all the amendment does.
It requires the Secretary of State to tell Parliament and the nation
what the effect would be of these measures before he implements them.

Kirkwood of Kirkhope:</Member></B> My Lords, I hope to make an even
shorter contribution to this important debate. I agree that the
amendment relating to child poverty is apposite and important. I want
to confine myself to seeking further clarification from the Minister,
if she has the information to hand. It would be to the
Committee’s advantage if we knew more about what we can expect
from the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission, because it
relates directly to the substance of this amendment.</hs_para>

was pleased that there was a recent change to the membership of the
commission and that our very own noble Baroness, Lady Shephard of
Northwold, has joined it. I am pleased about that because she is an

fruits of her work within that commission. It is important to us
all<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-05T17:21:52"></hs_TimeCode>. However, I
was disappointed to learn recently that the first annual report of the
Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission is not now to be with us
before 26 September this year. We were expecting it in May. I make that
observation because it is a sign of drift, potentially. If I am wrong
about that, I hope that I will be put right.</hs_para>

was very uneasy about adding social mobility to child poverty. The
original terms of reference of the 2010 Bill as put forward by the
noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, were the correct ones. The Deputy Prime
Minister, of whom I am a great fan, as I am sure people understand, was
wrong. Social mobility is a 
<?notus-xml column=1415?>different subject altogether. It is much longer term
and in the short term, we are dealing with a situation that is more of
an emergency than the aspiration of social mobility, which of course we
all accept<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-05T17:22:56"></hs_TimeCode>. We
really need to understand what contribution to child poverty this

second point is that of course we know that there is a consultation on
child poverty measurement. I am taxing my memory here, but I think we
were expecting the end of the consultation to be earlier this
year—some time in February. If that is the case and my memory is
correct, I hope we can be told that the Government’s
contribution to the further development of child poverty measurement
will be vouchsafed to us sometime soon. It will certainly be important
to get hold of this around the time of the Budget, if we can. Some of
the Office for Budget Responsibility’s assessments of future
policy in terms of the Budget should be seen against the background of
the Government’s view about how they will treat child poverty
measurement in the future.</hs_para>

It may be that I am misreading signals but I hope that we do not lose
focus on the fact that, at the end of the day, child poverty can be
addressed only with
money<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-05T17:24:29"></hs_TimeCode>. Regarding
any attempt to dress that up and expand the measurements too widely,

Lister of Burtersett:</Member></B> My Lords, I am pleased to support my
noble friends on this important amendment, which has been moved so
ably. The Government have still not explained why they did not include
the impact on child poverty in the impact assessment for the Bill, as
they promised. A Written Answer in the Commons as late as 30 January
wrongly stated that the impact assessment sets out the estimated child
and adult poverty effects, but it does not. As it is, the shameful
figures had to be dragged out of the Government by a Written Question,
as my noble friend
said<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-05T17:25:55"></hs_TimeCode>. Nor have
the Government explained to the Committee how the anticipated increase
in the number of children living in poverty thereby revealed is
compatible with their obligations under the Child Poverty Act 2010, to
which my noble friend referred. I asked this question during Second
Reading, but answer came there

deflected the question with the Government’s usual line that the
child poverty measurement indicators are somehow not fit for purpose
—picking up on the point made by the noble Lord, 
<?notus-xml column=1416?>Lord
Kirkwood<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-05T17:26:26"></hs_TimeCode>. That
was followed by a brief discussion about the importance of education,
debt and paid work in tackling poverty, but nothing was said about how
by enacting this legislation and knowingly adding 200,000 children to
the poverty rolls, the Government are fulfilling their obligations
under the Act. Those obligations are in addition to the increase in
child poverty estimated by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, to which
my noble friend referred. I would be grateful if today the Minister
could answer the question I asked at Second Reading. What does this
mean for the Government’s statutory obligations under the Act?
Whatever the Government think about the measures of poverty enshrined
in the Act, unless they plan to amend it—perhaps the Minister
could tell us if they do—they must face up to their legal
obligations as set out in it. What countervailing measures will they
take against the increase of 200,000 children living in
poverty<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-05T17:27:28"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

Minister that education, debt and work are important factors in any
anti-poverty strategy, but it is unclear how reducing real incomes will
help with any of them. How, for instance, will making life harder for
low-income families enhance the educational chances of their children?
Hungry children do not make good learners. Anxious and stressed parents
are less able to support their children’s education. Adequate
incomes are important to educational chances. Paul Gregg has estimated
that around 50% of educational inequalities or attainment gaps between
the rich and the poor in the UK stem from differences in income.
Similarly, as the Minister said, debt is a major problem for poor
families, but I fail to see how reducing their weekly income will
reduce that problem. All the children’s charities are predicting
an increase in debt as a consequence of this Bill, and a Bill that
depresses the incomes of low-income workers is hardly conducive to
promoting work as the best route out of poverty. I made the point
earlier about what Alan Marsh said: people who are demoralised do not
make very effective
jobseekers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-05T17:28:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Bates:</Member></B> My Lords, I rise with trepidation following the
noble Baroness, who has immense expertise in this area. Even if I had
not intended to speak on the technical aspects of this amendment, the
claim by the noble Baroness, Lady Sherlock, whose approach is always
sharp and pointed in proposing such matters, that this Government is
not serious about tackling child poverty would demand a response. Not
only is it there for us to read repeatedly in government statements
that this Government, as with their predecessor, are committed to the
eradication of child poverty, but when we are tempted to get a little
too high and mighty about that, one might look at the targets which the
previous Government set in respect of halving child poverty by 2010 and
how they performed against that measure—they did not tackle it.
The commitment is real and is what is driving the whole argument
towards universal credit, the raising of tax thresholds, the freeing up
of the economy to create 1 million new jobs—which is a pathway
out of poverty—the troubled families programme and the pupil
premium. This is an immense drive across all departments within
government to tackle what we accept is a shame on a country which is
still the seventh-richest nation on earth—that 2.3 million
children should be in poverty. I just make that point

Bates:</Member></B> I will come to that point in a minute because it is
an interesting one about the effectiveness of the cash measure alone in
eradicating child poverty. The previous Government failed to meet their
target of reducing child poverty by the level they set themselves,
despite spending £171 billion between 2003 and 2010. Here, in a
sense, is something that almost makes the case for the Opposition, were
they to take it. Those of us on the government Benches could stand here
and point to the fact that, in 2010-11, 300,000 children were taken out
of relative poverty. We could say that, but of course we realise that
that is not actually happening on the ground. We recognise that those
immense pressures are there. I do not dispute the quotes that the noble
Baroness has used in introducing this but the Institute for Fiscal
Studies, in its helpful analysis, points to the fact that all that
happened with that 300,000 was that you had private sector
incomes—predominantly—being repressed or
flat-lining<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-05T17:37:57"></hs_TimeCode>. I
am trying to follow the gestures of the noble Baroness but being a man
I can do only one thing at a time. Private sector incomes increased by
10% over the years 2007 
<?notus-xml column=1419?>to 2012 while benefit levels increased by 20%. That
is one of the arguments that is put. Because it is pitched at median
income, you then find that, as the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows
in its graph, the measure comes down, the benefits go up and
effectively you say, almost like a card trick, “We have reduced
child poverty by 300,000”. In fact, you have done nothing of the
sort. All that has happened is that, during a recession, private sector
incomes have fallen and therefore, as the IFS
says:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13030549000340" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0002.htm#13030549000340">“If

Committee. I was unable to be present for the beginning and I have
obviously missed the explanation of a phrase that I cannot understand.
The noble Lord has just repeated that the answer to child poverty is
not money. I do not know the explanation for the Government’s

the noble Lord comes from a different northern region from mine. The
biggest problem that people face is poverty when they are struggling to
go to work. They are struggling to get extra hours, which the
Government are insisting that people have to try to do, when their
employers will not give them extra hours; when the only extra hours
they can get may be two hours further away from their home and the cost
of travel there is impossible. I think that noble Lords opposite are

Hollis of Heigham:</Member></B> My Lords, perhaps I may add to my noble
friend’s comments. The noble Lord perfectly accurately described
what was happening to the 300,000 children who were lifted out of
poverty because the median income line fell by virtue of the recession
and the downward pressure on incomes. Of course, he is completely
right, but the other way of stating that was that as a result of what
the previous Government did, the incomes of those children—the
poorest of the poor—were protected against the effects of the
recession, for which most of us are grateful and
appreciative<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-05T17:41:39"></hs_TimeCode>,

Bates:</Member></B> I accept that point. On the first point made by the
noble Baroness, Lady Farrington, of course I am not saying that child
poverty has got nothing to do with money. It is vastly to do with
money, but is that the only thing that impacts on child poverty? If we
want to impact on child poverty, do not the quality of housing, the
quality of education and the opportunity to work have some bearing on
the fact? Does the fact that the parents are in debt or are
drug-dependent or alcohol-dependent have any bearing on it? Does living
in a one-parent family or with two parents make any difference to the
life chances of the child in poverty? One would probably have to say:
yes, to a degree. I am simply saying that there is more to
this.</hs_para>

by international comparisons. I found a report card of child
well-being, which was produced while the previous Government were in
power. It was undertaken by UNICEF and it is an international
comparison. Yes, it looks at cash, although interestingly it looks at
50% of the median, not 60%; it also looks at health and safety,
educational opportunities, work opportunities, family and peer
relationships, behaviours and risks, and subjective well-being—a
broad range of indicators in a basket of trying to assess international
child well-being. By the way, if the party opposite is interested, it
actually came last: 18.2 was that Government’s average ranking
position out of the most advanced countries in the world, but that is
not my point.</hs_para>

must come back to the median income. The median income is worth looking
at in itself because that is the test that we are using to measure all
benefits. It relates to a level of income—not an average income
but a median income, the most frequent across the distribution. The
latest figures I could find on the ONS website showed that median
incomes vary quite substantially across the United
Kingdom—nothing unusual there; you would expect that to happen.
For example, in London the median gross wage is £651.80 per
week, but in the north-east the figure is £451.80 per week.
These are the latest figures; I accept that there might be a shift
slightly in one direction—well, upwards only.</hs_para>

of 44% across the range. Therefore, when we are applying a national
target of 60% of the median, we need to examine whether that is giving
us an accurate reflection of child poverty levels in all parts of the
country. It might be that we are understating it in parts of the north,
Wales and the south-west; it may be that we are overstating it
in London—I do not know. None the less, using that as the sole
measure to test median income across a national rating by which we
actually assess those in child poverty is worth taking a more careful
look

is that there is an absolute crying need, of which we are all
absolutely aware. There is child poverty out there and we need to
strain every sinew to ensure that we tackle it. Also, we have no doubt
that on the current measure there is no question that it is going to
increase. The Office for Budget Responsibility’s figures
forecast that as the recovery gets under way, private sector earnings
will increase by 4.6% per annum. It does not take a great mathematical
mind—which is fortunate for me—to figure out that with
what we are dealing with today, as well as the likely increase in
private sector incomes, we are going to see the gap rising and almost
an inversion of what has happened over the past few years happening in
the future. But there are more indicators that need to be examined to
give us a holistic picture and to ensure that we target scarce

noble Baroness, Lady Sherlock, asked whether we would publish other
impacts of the measure. We do not think that it is possible to derive
estimates of all the measures in the Bill. For example, impacts cannot
be modelled for the persistent low income poverty measure because
impact assessments are based on cross-sectional data rather than
longitudinal data. In addition, measures based on an estimate of
material deprivation are technically complex to model because material
deprivation relies on more factors than just income, so impacts have
not been modelled for these
measures<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-05T17:52:16"></hs_TimeCode>. The

we have said previously, we believe that we need to be cautious about
setting too much store by such individual assessments of impact. These

future, as they do not take into account all the other variables which
exist. For example, our estimates will change as forecasts of economic
growth and average earnings change, and they do not take account of
policies which cause child poverty figures to move in the other
direction such as universal credit. Universal credit, which has not
played much of a part in our debate today, is of course expected to
lift up to 250,000 children out of poverty depending on the effect of
the minimum income

poverty; and, thirdly, we strongly believe that income matters and will
remain a central part of any new measures of child poverty. Our

have cited figures from the IFS and the Child Poverty Action Group
which suggested that child poverty levels would rise by between 800,000
and 1 million by 2020. I really would caution against setting too much
store by those figures. First, child poverty forecasts are an inexact
science. For example, the numbers that the IFS produces do not account
for future changes to government policy. It is measuring change at a
time of immense fiscal challenge for the Government but cannot know
what government policy will look like in four or five years. The IFS
core numbers also do not take fully into account the dynamic and
behavioural changes that will result from the Government’s
reforms. Moreover, even in the short term, child poverty forecasting
has proven difficult to get right. The IFS, which I accept is a leader
in this area, made predictions in October 2011 of a fall of 100,000 in
the figure for relative child poverty for the year 2010-11. In reality,
the figure fell by 300,000. It is therefore an inexact science and it
is very easy for numbers produced by it to be spectacularly wrong. This
does not of course detract from the importance of taking action to
reduce the level of child poverty, but it serves as a reminder that we
should proceed with caution in making forecasts of child poverty,
whether based on measures in isolation or changes over the longer
term<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-05T17:57:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030549000291" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0002.htm#13030549000291">It
is important to remember that many figures on poverty are based
entirely on tax and benefit changes feeding entirely into the relative
income measure of poverty. This measure does not capture the full range
of issues that poverty involves. It captures a lot, but it does not
capture them all. It will not tell us how many children’s lives
will have been changed by 2020 but only how many children have
circulated around the poverty
line<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-05T17:57:50"></hs_TimeCode>. One way of
tackling child poverty is to focus on this line, pushing up benefit
incomes to lift people from just below it to just above it. We already
know that focusing on the relative income line alone yields perverse
results, and people have referred in this debate and earlier debates to
the fact that, in 2010, 300,000 fewer children were set to be in
poverty because the recession had caused median incomes to drop.
Children were set to be pulled out of poverty not because anything had
changed in their lives but because the rest of society got

pay through the universal credit, sending out a clear signal that we
believe that work is the best route out of poverty for parents and
their children. As part of the universal credit, we are spending an
extra £200 million to support families with childcare
costs and, for the first time, this support will be made available to
families who work fewer than 16 hours a week. This will mean that

I have said, the Government are currently analysing responses to their

attempt to capture the wider reality of poverty in the UK today. The
Government already produce a number of detailed reports on poverty. I

spoken in this debate, which may be an interesting precursor to the
kind of debate we may have when the commission finally reports. I am
particularly and genuinely pleased to hear the Minister say two
things—first, that the Government remain committed to
eradicating child poverty and, secondly, that income matters. They are
both important statements, and I welcome them and am very pleased to

noble Lord, Lord Bates, with whom it is always a pleasure to do battle,
took me to task for saying that I did not somehow accept that the
Government made clear their commitment to eradicating child poverty.
What I was challenging was not that commitment but whether or not the
actions were being taken that would make it a reality. That was the
point that I was trying to make, and I apologise if that was not clear.

lot has been said about the nature of the measure. I have never thought
that the well-being of children was about only money. However, the
reason why this amendment is about money is because the Bill is about
money; the amendment is about the impact of the Bill, and the Bill is
solely about what happens to the tax credits and benefits that go out
to people—in this case, children. So it makes no sense for it to

second thing that is worth saying is that I made it clear that the
relative income measure was, deliberately, only one of four income
measures in the Child Poverty Act, and that was for a reason. The
Government of the day recognised that we had to take a 3D approach to
understanding what poverty was, and no single measure alone would be
able to give us all we needed. However, those four points of
perspective between them give a pretty good idea of what is happening
to incomes across the UK. That is something that we need to
understand<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-05T18:01:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Bates, commented on the regional variation of median income. That is
true, but the cost of living also varies. As he and I both know, the

Bates:</Member></B> That is quite an interesting point, if the
noble Baroness is prepared to expand on it on the record. I think that
she accepts that it is true in Durham, a city that we both love
greatly, that median incomes—or, rather, average
incomes—are significantly lower, by 44% according to my figures,
and that the cost of living is different and lower. So in
those circumstances —putting the two together by using a
national measure and putting 60% of median income—you would
perhaps overstate the level of child poverty in Durham. Does she accept

Sherlock:</Member></B> It might be worth the noble Lord and me sitting
down together with the Child Poverty Act. He might find that many
answers to his questions are in there. As well as giving the Secretary
of State a specific duty to address income measures, because tax and
benefits are in the gift of central not local government, with the
exception—reprehensible in my view—of the recent move to
localising council tax support, the strategy places a duty on local
authorities and other players to engage in issues around child poverty,
specifically because they have competence in those areas. So if the
noble Lord goes back to read it, he will find that there is an awful
lot more in it than he perhaps remembers. We may have to come
back to

is also worth coming back to the idea that it is not just about
money—but it is also not not about money, a point made very
clearly by my noble friend Lady Farrington. The noble Lord, Lord Bates,
said that the fact that the Labour Government did not meet their target
for child poverty reduction means that the measure does not work. I do
not think that it means that at all. I pick up again a point that the
Minister made. I fully accept that no forecast is a precise measure and
no measure is precise, but one reason for keeping a long-term
target of 2020 is that what really matters is direction of travel. Over
time, how does the income of the poorest relate to the income of the
country as a whole? On that, I am proud that our Government lifted 1.1
million children out of poverty. If I had to stand up and say that we
had pushed 1 million children into poverty, I would be
ashamed of that, and I am very glad that I am not in that

the Government come forward with other measures, we will happily debate
them. I am always open to any conversation that focuses the attention
of this House and the nation on the well-being of the poorest families,

reports about what that means and what the best means is to assess the
impact of policies on that. However, at the moment, the Child Poverty 
<?notus-xml column=1426?>Act is law, and it puts an obligation on the Government—a
statutory duty—to address child poverty in all these areas.
Unless they measure that, I simply do not see how it is possible to
satisfy themselves that they have done

Government’s defence has also partly been that the measure is
meaningless. I may be worth reminding ourselves even of the relative
income measure. The Child Poverty Action Group reminds us that a
relative low-income poverty line is, typically, around £12 per
family member per day for all spending needs after housing costs. It
notes that many families in poverty will be far below
that—because that is where the line is, and many families are
way below the line. The point of having four measures is to try to
understand the impact of policies such as this on all those measures. I
accept that other measures are going on. I accept the point that the
noble Lord, Lord Bates, made—and he has engaged with the
arguments from this side of the Committee most
comprehensibly—that other measures are happening and that there
are time lags. However, it is impossible to ignore the fact that a Bill
that sets out deliberately to cut in real terms the incomes of poor and
middle-income families will do anything other than increase child
poverty in real terms. That is a real increase—it is not a

do not want to delay the Committee much more, but I remind noble Lords
that the amendment simply invites the Government to report before they
enact this Bill on what the impact will be on child poverty, using
measures already in statute to reflect a duty that the Government
already have in statute. That is all that it does; it could hardly be
less radical. However, as I am interested in returning to this at a

14 concerns child benefit. Time and again in these debates on welfare
reform, we face the challenge that our reforms have a disproportionate
effect on children. Overall, some 30% of households are affected by
this Bill. Of those with dependent children, 87% are affected; of
lone-parent households, 95% are affected. For example, a single nurse
on average earnings for her profession of £530 a week would lose
nothing at all as a result of the Bill. If she had two children, she
would lose £424 a year in 2015-16. Families with lower incomes
are those who end up being the worst affected, whether by reductions in
housing benefit or the freeze on child benefit, and so
on.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030567000017" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0002.htm#13030567000017">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-05T18:09:06"></hs_TimeCode>

in welfare reform, and that is a matter of choice. The most powerful

struggling to make ends meet but quite clear that child benefit is to
be used not for the general household expenses but by the mother to
help her children. The points made persistently in debates on this Bill
and on the Welfare Reform Act by the noble Baroness, Lady Howe of
Idlicote, speak of the way in which it is women—often
mothers—who are most disadvantaged by the measures we are taking
because they are concerned particularly with the specific help of their
children. Child benefit reduction fails to take account of the cultural

to its financial

in child benefit specifically is also a disincentive to seeking work,
so it is a direct challenge to the Government’s own desire, put
forward powerfully by the Minister, to encourage people to return to

and in calculating the applicable amount before housing and council tax
benefit are reduced. The result is that a low-income working family
living in rented accommodation loses both the £4.80 a week in
child benefit and a further estimated £4.10 a week because of
the disregard rules. A loss of some £9 a week is a serious blow

specifically, on Amendment 17 and its effect in removing the lower

Prelate explained, Amendments 14 and 19 would together remove child

particularly necessary by the fact that child benefit has already been
frozen for three years before the measures contained in the Bill take
effect. That means that child benefit will increase by only 2% over the
course of half a decade. Over the same period, prices as measured by
CPI will have risen by more than 16%. I say that that justifies the
removal of child benefit from the scope of the Bill but, in truth, it
would be unjustifiable not to remove
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030567000030" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0002.htm#13030567000030">These

obviously have much greater costs than those without dependent
children. For this period of their life, the income they need to meet
the basic living costs of their household is clearly greater. That

summarise Amendments 14 and 19, households with children are much more

These families, even if working full time, gain very little from the
raising of the tax threshold. Many of these households, whether working
full time or unable to work, are already in poverty. This Bill is going
to pull many households with children even deeper into poverty.
Universal credit will help the family in work, but that will be too
late for many of these children. Taking child benefit and child tax
credit out of the scope of this Bill would go some way to mitigate the

shall briefly turn to Amendment 17. Many parents of disabled children
face losses under universal credit. Support for the most disabled
children is being halved. In my inquiry into the impact of universal
credit on disabled people, the large body of evidence we received from
parents of disabled children was that they face substantial additional
costs as a result of having a disabled child. They include paying for
specialist aids, adaptations to their homes, additional clothing costs
and travel costs. Roughly two-thirds of lone parents who had a disabled
child receiving the middle rate of the care component of DLA reported
that they were unable to work because of their caring responsibilities.
Their entitlement under universal credit will be about £28 less
than current levels of benefit, as has already been mentioned by the
right reverend Prelate. Roughly two-thirds of these parents said they
were unlikely to be able to return to work for at least five years. The
evidence we received was that these levels of benefit would create
great hardship.</hs_para>

element will mean an even greater loss. Current parents will receive
transitional protection, but their award will be frozen until their
entitlement under universal credit reaches that level. These families
are facing a very difficult next few years because of the freezing of
child benefit and child tax credit. If the disability element does not
increase with inflation, these families will face an even bigger drop
in real-terms value when they transfer to universal credit. They will
face several years with lower-than-inflation rises. Their benefit will
then be frozen on universal credit for an even longer period while
food, housing costs and fuel prices continue to

Touhig:</Member></B> My Lords, these amendments, to which I have added
my name, are essential to protect the basic well-being of the very
poorest children. Those seeking to justify restrictions to our social
security system have continually argued two things: first, that we must
fairly distribute the burden of national economic hardship, and
secondly, that we must take tough decisions in order to ensure a
sustainable future. Yet driving down the value of child-related
benefits achieves neither of those objectives. Instead, it unjustly
shifts the burden onto the most vulnerable section of our society and
damages the future prospects of hundreds of thousands of young
people.</hs_para>

Government’s own impact assessment highlights that the Bill as
it stands will disproportionately affect families, with lone parents
experiencing the most significant real-term cut to their income of
£5 per week. Noble Lords might think that £5 is not much,
so let us put that figure into context: it is the equivalent of half an
average weekly heating bill or two lunches for a child. The loss of it
is a significant challenge to the increasing number of parents
currently struggling to cover utility costs or turning to local food
banks for their children’s meals. In practice, the actual
shortfall is likely to be larger still owing to above-inflation rises
in the cost of necessities such as groceries, fuel and gas and
electricity. The net result will inevitably be more child poverty and
greater family suffering, making a mockery of any notion that this is a
fair or just mechanism for securing cost
savings.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030567000050" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0002.htm#13030567000050">As

increased levels of child poverty are not only devastating for

our society. One of the most significant risks is to children’s
education, an issue previously recognised in the DWP’s impact
assessment on restrictions to housing benefits. It stated that
overcrowding resulting from the cuts could hamper children’s
ability to do homework and affect educational attainment. Last year,
more than half of teachers surveyed reported that financial hardship
among families had resulted in children arriving at their classes
hungry, with significant consequences for concentration and behaviour.
A report from the Children’s Food Trust last week reinforces the
picture of children going to school hungry. Of 250 staff surveyed, 84%
said they had seen children without enough to eat and 68% said they had
seen an increase in this over the past two years. If child-related
income is driven down further this is only likely to worsen,

parents struggle to afford basic necessities for children, there is
also the very real risk of running into long-term personal debt. The
shocking findings by the magazine <I>Which?</I> 1ast year showed that
payday loan companies now spend over half a million pounds targeting
cash-strapped mothers and fathers by putting their adverts on
television during children’s programmes. This is indicative of
the increasingly desperate situation that so many families now face. A
growing number of parents are turning to these lenders, while some 25%
now use credit cards to meet everyday living costs. The abolition of
community care grants and crisis loans in April only stands to deepen
this problem by closing the door to interest-free emergency

warm houses, winter clothes and new shoes. When parents are faced with

it is good to hear that they are committed to reducing it. The action
areas that the Government must consider when they provide their

skills of parents; financial support for children and parents;
information, advice and assistance to parents and the promotion of
parenting skills; physical and mental health, education, childcare and

are the Government listening to those who work with children and,
importantly, have the Government considered the long-term effects of

consequences, potential drop out from education and lack of social
mobility? Measures in the Bill are potentially hugely costly, much more

provoking such a good debate on so important an issue. As we have
heard, this amendment would remove child benefit, child tax credit, and

heard from the right reverend Prelate, the noble Baroness, Lady
Grey-Thompson, and others, the Bill has a disproportionate impact on

because families with children receive more in state support—of
course they do. As the noble Baroness, Lady Grey-Thompson, pointed out,
a household without children is rather cheaper to run than one with
children; not to mention a great deal quieter. However, while most
parents rightly bear the lion’s share of the cost of raising
their children, the state has always contributed—not just in
extreme cases to try to protect children from the misfortunes that
befall their parents but also because, in general, it is always
recognised that children are a public as well as a private good. We all

they will. As we have heard from a number of noble Lords, the Bill
comes on top of a series of cuts in the value of other tax credits and
benefits. As well as the headline cuts, there have been a series of
hidden cuts affecting, for example, tax credits for families with
children by changes to taper rates, the treatment of income and the
freezing of allowances, all of which sound technical but have in fact
saved billions. However, it is not of course money that has been saved,

seem to recall that the Government suggested at earlier stages that one
of the reasons that so many families are affected is that tax credits
go too high up the income scale. The implication, I suppose, is that
people would not miss the money. However, the noble Baroness, Lady
Grey-Thompson, described some figures from Citizens Advice. It has
given us case studies showing that a couple with two children, where
one parent is working full-time on just over minimum
wage—getting £13,000 a year—will gain just 76
pence from the personal allowance. As a result, however, they will lose
£3.46 a week net. By April 2015, that family on £13,000 a
year with two kids will be £12.79 a week worse off. Even if we
go nearer to average earnings, Citizens Advice suggests that a family
earning £26,000 in similar circumstances will be over £12
a week worse off by April 2015. The sums may not sound like a lot, but
they are significant to families on those kinds of incomes.</hs_para>

tax credits and allowances which are not included within the scope of

they would be up-rated with prices, as was the case previously. If that
were the case, I need to remind the House that the savings delivered by
the Bill would be reduced by nearly £1 billion. In our view,
those savings simply have to be found. If we did not do it through the
Bill, they would have to be found from somewhere.</hs_para>

grateful to the right reverend Prelate for the fact that, unlike the

made by the noble Lord, Lord Touhig, we are taking action to deal with
exorbitant practices by payday loan companies and loan sharks. One
thing that we are grappling with, with which any Government would
grapple, is that many families on low incomes have got very high levels
of personal debt. This is not new. When I was Treasury spokesman for
the Liberal Democrats about seven or eight years ago I appeared,
somewhat implausibly, on the steps of the Treasury with my right
honourable friend Vince Cable, bearing an outsized cheque at the point
when personal debt in the country reached £1 trillion. Most of
this, I accept, was mortgage debt; it is not the debt that we are
talking about today. However, some of the biggest increases in personal
debt over the past decade have been among people on low incomes. This
growth in personal debt was not effectively recognised or tackled in
the past. Indeed, our appearance bearing this cheque just guaranteed a
huge amount of ridicule for Vince Cable and myself, rather than
anybody, including the previous Government, taking the slightest notice
of it, which was deeply distressing—or, more importantly, taking
the slightest action to deal with the culture with which we are now
grappling.</hs_para>

of loan sharks and payday lenders, I hope that we are taking more
effective measures, not least through the amendments during the passage

will treat them half-decently. The other area which we protected, which

growing concern about this and other cuts affecting new mothers
prompted this amendment, which seeks simply to remove statutory
maternity pay from the scope of the Bill. It is worth rehearsing very
briefly how SMP works. SMP is payable only to women who have just had
or adopted a baby, or who will do so shortly. They must be in paid
work. Indeed, they must have been continuously employed by an employer
liable to pay national insurance contributions for them for six months
before the 15th week before their expected date of confinement. They
must have had average gross weekly earnings at least at the level of 
<?notus-xml column=1443?>the lower earnings limit for national insurance and they must have
stopped work in order to have or care for the baby. In other words,
this is a contributory benefit paid to working women who have stopped
work only to give birth or to care for a new baby. SMP gives them 90%
of their average weekly earnings for the first six weeks and then, at
the current rate, £135.45 a week for the next 33
weeks.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030567000099" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0002.htm#13030567000099">According
to a Written Answer from the right honourable Maria Miller in another
place on 30 April 2012, at col. WA 1322, the Government estimate that
some 232,000 families will claim SMP in 2012-13. Those families could
find themselves being seriously short-changed. Using the
Government’s own inflation forecasts, the Children’s
Society calculates that in 2015-16, SMP will be £145.15, if
inflated by CPI. However, the impact assessment indicates that the
likely rate is just £139.58—a difference of £5.57
per week. To put that in context, if a woman were on maternity leave
now with her first child and had her second child in 2015, she would
find that she got about £884 less in real terms during her next
maternity leave than she would during this maternity leave. If her
earnings were below the flat rate level for SMP, that figure rises to
£217.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030567000100" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0002.htm#13030567000100">The
period after a birth is a particularly tough time for parents. The
Money Advice Service estimates the average cost of essentials for a new
baby as some £3,700 over their first year. Of course, just as
costs rise, income falls because of maternity leave, and parents are
time-poor as well. The £200 may not be much to some people but
it is enough to buy a cot and bedding and 17 value packs of newborn
nappies.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030567000101" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0002.htm#13030567000101">This
amendment focuses on SMP for two reasons. First, I simply do not think
we can allow this Bill to go through the House without noting all the
impacts on mums of new babies that have happened since 2010. Just since
2010, the Government have done the following: abolished the health in
pregnancy grant; abolished the Sure Start maternity grant for all but
the first child; abolished the baby element of child tax credit;
cancelled the planned toddler element of child tax credit; abolished
the Government’s contribution to child trust funds; frozen child
benefit for three years and removed it from higher rate taxpayers; cut
the percentage of childcare costs parents can get back through working
tax credit; and legislated to introduce hefty charges for using the
CSA. Some of those cuts are very severe. House of Commons Library
research shows that low-paid new mums are losing £1,300 during
pregnancy and the baby’s first year just from cuts to maternity
pay, pregnancy support and tax credits, and are losing more from child
benefit.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030567000102" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0002.htm#13030567000102">The
second reason for tabling this amendment is that during the Second
Reading debate, I raised the issue of SMP. I did it specifically to try
to find out how that fitted with the Chancellor’s claim that the
reason this Bill is needed is to ensure the welfare state is fair to
working people, not, you may recall, to those who lie in bed with their
blinds down, sleeping off a life on benefit, while others go out to
work. However, on the face of it, it is hard to see how targeting a
payment made to someone who has just had a baby after being in
continuous employment for the requisite period at a level which
triggers national insurance contributions 
<?notus-xml column=1444?>fits with that narrative. Indeed, I am sure that the Government have a
good reason, and I hope it is better than simply saying,
“It’s a choice”. However, given that we are in
Committee and this amendment is about SMP only, I look forward to
hearing the Minister share that reason with us. I beg to
move.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-05?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_05_PT_1/F8AA973A03EB8CA13D3434C3880AEA1BA6C83B1E" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 5 March 2013">Tuesday,

absolutely clear that, contrary to what the noble Baroness, Lady

maternity and parental regime. The UK is significantly more generous
than the requirements of the EU pregnant workers directive. The
directive says that a woman should benefit from 14 weeks’ paid
maternity leave; we provide 39 weeks. It also says that a woman should
receive at least the amount that would be paid for sickness; our

addition, the latest available data from the OECD from the previous

past decade, the standard rates of statutory maternity pay and

are not in work who have children, or who were not in work prior to the
birth of their child, have increased by more than 35%, from £100
a week in 2003 to £135.45 currently. So while I accept that the

Mumsnet, the Government are committed to make this architecture for
women stronger. The provisions in the Children and Families Bill, which
had its Second Reading in another place last week, will allow working
parents to choose which parent takes parental leave and pay to care for
their child in the early years. This will give mothers real choice over
when and whether they return to work. This is helpful in two big
ways—where the woman is the higher earner and in starting to
chip away at the inequality that some women face at work just because
it is assumed that they and only they will take a break in their
careers to have children. Our proposals will start to make a big
difference.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030567000109" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0002.htm#13030567000109">It
is also important to remember that the Government have introduced other
reforms that will help to off-set the impacts of these changes. For
example, a woman working full time at national minimum wage for six
months of the tax year, who then receives statutory maternity pay for
the next six months, will still be better off overall as a result of
changes to the income tax personal allowance. The introduction of
universal credit will also provide a big boost for many
mothers and lone parents, with 2.6 million women and 700,000
lone parents expected to gain through increased take-up and improved
financial incentives to work. In addition, as part of the introduction
of universal credit, £200 million extra is being
spent to support families with childcare costs. For the first time,
this support will be made available for families who work less than 16
hours a week. This will mean that 100,000 more working families will be
helped with their childcare costs. That is important, because it means
that even if someone is able to take on only a small amount of work,
they will get that support for childcare costs to which they previously
would not have had access. In another move that will be helpful to
mothers and parents, as my noble friend Lord Newby mentioned, we have
committed to introduce 15 hours a week of early education for 40% of
two year-olds, starting with the most disadvantaged.</hs_para>

continue to make extra support available for mothers on low incomes to
buy the basic goods that they need. We have a programme called Healthy
Start, and the Sure Start maternity grant—a lump sum payment of
£500—is available to help parents with the costs of
having a new child. I know that the noble Baroness, Lady Sherlock, said
that this is now available only to parents who have a child and no
other child under the age of 16. However, this support is additional to
the money that parents receive through their statutory maternity pay.
Bear in mind that if there is another child in the home, some of the
initial substantial expenses of having a family often are not repeated
if they have a second
child.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030567000111" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0002.htm#13030567000111">The
amendment would reduce savings from the Bill by around £50
million in 2015-16. None of the decisions contained in the Bill are
easy. I recognise that the noble Baroness, Lady Sherlock, would prefer
that we did not include statutory maternity pay in the Bill. I would
like that, too. I would love it if we could say, “Let’s
exclude this or that”. However, as my noble friend said in our
previous debates, every time we say that we will not include something
in the Bill, we have to look somewhere else for the money. That
£50 million is not a small sum and is equivalent to more than
20,000 part-time nursery places for three to four year-olds. This is
money that will cover substantial support that rightly we provide to
mothers and families in other ways.</hs_para>

this side believe that the Government are making a political policy
choice. It does not have to fall on children, disabled children or
statutory maternity pay. As some of us argued at Second
Reading—there were different shopping lists—we are
spending £32 billion on tax relief for private pensions, of
which £8 billion goes to subsidise the tax relief that
higher-rate taxpayers currently enjoy. To continue that is a political
policy choice. The money would pay for most of these cuts twice

charges. She began to answer the first charge, where I had listed a
whole series of benefits and payments—specifically for mothers

families find current levels of support particularly difficult,

income support and other mainstream benefit levels. Until 1999, asylum
support was set at 90% of income support, after which levels of support
were reduced to 70%, with the justification that asylum

currently no statutory provision to make an annual uprating of levels

that asylum support for families also provided with accommodation
should be aligned with mainstream benefit rates paid for living
expenses. Where accommodation includes utilities, which would normally
be expected to be paid from living expenses, it is appropriate to make
a deduction. However, such a deduction must be reasonable. The
inquiry argued 
<?notus-xml column=1450?>that the rates of support should never fall below 70% of
income support. As it is, asylum support now bears no relation to

particularly concerned about the situation of families on Section 4
support, which may be provided if a child is born after an asylum claim
had been refused but where the family are, for some reason, unable to
leave the UK. Almost 800 children are being supported under Section 4,
some for many years. Under Section 4, the amount provided is even lower
and the use of a cashless system—the azure card, as it is
called—can be degrading and wasteful because it can be used only
in certain designated shops. The inquiry recommended that this
particularly inhumane form of asylum support be abolished entirely and
replaced with a single cash-based support system for all children and
their families who need asylum support while they are in the
UK.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030574000015" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0002.htm#13030574000015">Given that

raised as a matter of urgency for the 2013-14 financial year and
thereafter increased annually, at the very least in line with income

if the Minister could explain the rationale for treating asylum support
differently from mainstream social security benefits when it comes to
annual upratings. Ministers frequently refer to the Government’s
ongoing review of asylum support when questioned on these issues,
including recently in response to a Written Question from the noble
Lord, Lord Hylton, which referred to our all-party inquiry.
In his Written Answer, the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Holbeach, said
that the Government would consider our findings as part of this ongoing

respond to the all-party inquiry’s report? How long will this

the payments made to people who have applied for asylum should be
treated in the same way as any other benefits and should be subject to
review by your Lordships. Instead, as the noble Baroness explained,
there is no obligation to uprate the benefits or even to make a
statement, nor, in particular, for the Government to explain
whether they believe that the payments made to asylum seekers should
bear any relationship to those on income support, or whether the two
calculations are to be performed on an entirely different basis. If so,

support?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030574000018" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0002.htm#13030574000018">As
the noble Baroness has already said, with her I was a member of the
cross-party parliamentary inquiry organised by the Children’s
Society into asylum support for children and young people, under the
very able chairmanship of my honourable friend Sarah Teather, the
former Minister for Children. I join the noble Baroness, Lady Lister,
in expressing the concern and 
<?notus-xml column=1451?>dismay that we all felt when listening to the stories of suffering and
destitution of asylum seekers. The worst-off were those supported under
Section 4 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, many of whom were
failed asylum seekers who could not be returned to their country of
origin because it would not accept them. Under that provision, people
have to live in housing and accommodation provided by private agencies,
the standard of which often is grossly deficient and lacking in
ordinary facilities.</hs_para>

noticing the contrast with the Statement made earlier today about the

support in the form of vouchers which can be redeemed only at certain
shops. The value of the Azure card, which is intended to provide for
all essential living needs, is £70.78 a week, compared with
income support for a couple with children of £123.35. Because
they have no cash, as the noble Baroness has explained, the recipients
cannot do many ordinary things, such as buying stamps, taking a bus or
making a telephone call. She gave a particularly lurid example of
evidence that we heard about a mother who had to undertake all sorts of
physical arrangements with her small child as regards apparatus that
was needed. My noble friend Lord Taylor of Holbeach said, in his brief
answer a question on asylum support on 24 January, that he was
surprised to find that there were two levels of benefit within the
asylum system. Indeed, one cannot imagine the motive for building this
level of complexity into
it.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13030574000144" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0002.htm#13030574000144">7.45

iniquitous feature of the system is that asylum support was not uprated
like other benefits in 2012-13, as the noble Baroness has said, and
there are no plans to uprate in 2013-14. It is utterly repugnant that
we should impose extra hardship on people who are already desperately
poor, including the estimated 10,000 children in asylum-seeking
families. Surely, the policy of keeping this group of children at a
level of resources that was already well below what was considered
necessary for our own citizens, and to allow that level to be eroded by
inflation two years in a row, must be contrary to their best interests,
and thus a breach of our obligations under the UN Convention on
the Rights of the Child. Perhaps my noble friend the
Minister would like to comment on that when she winds
up.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030574000022" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0002.htm#13030574000022">Would she
also comment on the most astonishing of all the panel’s

Government possibly justify depriving these families, who are by
definition even more disadvantaged than settled families with disabled
children, of the support that is given to every other such family in
the country? Surely, that cannot be anything to do with making every
penny count towards reducing the deficit when there are any number of

overhaul, dictated by considerations of humanity and fairness, may have
to wait until we have got the national overdraft under control.

that officials had met the two NGOs to discuss the report and assured
them that the care provided by NHS midwives was appropriate and within
NHS guidance. But that was not the whole story. The report showed that
the UKBA system of dispersal and relocation impacts adversely on the
health and well-being of pregnant women and new mothers, as I told my

zones such as rape, torture, female genital mutilation or trafficking
for sexual exploitation. These experiences will adversely affect their
health during pregnancy and as new mothers, and the evidence obtained
for this report suggests that they have a maternal mortality rate much
higher than the rest of the UK population. Will my noble friend provide

suggested to my noble friend Lord Howe that the UKBA’s current
policies were resulting in additional costs to the NHS. A woman who is
dispersed will need a duplicate booking appointment following
dispersal, at a cost of £297. They often need a duplicate scan
and follow-up appointment at £281, and there may need to
be interpreters at these appointments. The effects on the
women’s health of the move itself may also require additional
expense, such as days in hospital at £467 per
day.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030574000028" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0002.htm#13030574000028">Unfortunately,
the total cost to the NHS of dispersing and relocating pregnant women
is not ascertainable because no statistics are collected on them.
However, according to a freedom of information response, more than 600
women in the asylum system applied for the maternity grant in the first
six months of 2011, and the vast majority of these women will have been
moved during pregnancy. I have suggested to my noble friend Lord Howe
that the Department of Health should hold discussions with the Home
Office to ensure that dispersal policies for pregnant women and new
mothers are developed that are compatible with NICE guidelines on the
maternity care of women with complex social factors. I would like my
noble friend, in conclusion, to provide an estimate of the rate

harrowing as it is for those who have been on asylum support for two,
four or six years and who cannot return to the countries from which
they have come. The Government accept that they cannot return

children and extra costs that are imposed on public services such as

ongoing review of our approach to asylum support. In response to a

noble Lords have acknowledged, there are two types of support. First,
there is support provided to those people who have made an application
for asylum that has not yet been decided. That is provided under
Section 95 of the Immigration and Asylum Act. People in that context
are usually described as people under Section 95. Secondly, there are
people who have been found by the UK Border Agency and by the courts
not to need protection in the UK, but who cannot return home due to a
temporary problem. They are provided for under Section 4 of the
Immigration and Asylum Act. That is the Section 4 to which several

noble Lords are aware, the support provided is expressly intended to
meet people’s essential needs. By that we mean their food,
toiletries and clothing. As an example, a family of four receiving
Section 95 support 
<?notus-xml column=1455?>while the decision on their application is pending is given £178
per week to cover these essential costs. The same family receiving
Section 4 support is given £151 per week. The levels of support
provide for the fact that asylum seekers have, as has been acknowledged
by noble Lords, fully-furnished, rent-free accommodation with household
equipment, utilities and council tax included. This support is
temporary in its nature. It is true to say that the allowance is less
than income support equivalents but that is because the recipients do
not have to pay for other things such as utility bills or other costs

new mothers receiving asylum support do not have to buy a cot or things
of that kind because sterilising equipment and such things are

Healthcare and schooling are also provided. In addition to the weekly
subsistence rates, families receive the following benefits. A single
one-off payment of £300 may be provided to asylum seekers to
help with the costs arising from the birth of a new baby. This is
different from the maternity grant provided by DWP as recipients will
not need to cover the costs of a new cot, stair gates and sterilising
equipment. Pregnant women and young children aged between one and three

higher value support. Again, that is a matter for individual local
authorities, which will have considered the needs of the child and

these arrangements are compatible with the UN Convention on the Rights

bound by its Section 55 duty to consider the best 
<?notus-xml column=1456?>interests of children. As I have said, fully furnished free
accommodation, education and healthcare are provided, plus an allowance

the strength of feeling that has been expressed by noble Lords about
the difficulties that inevitably are faced by people who come to this
country seeking asylum, when comparing asylum support rates across
Europe, our research shows that the UK is comparatively generous in
family cases, providing more to an asylum-seeking family of four than
countries like Sweden or Denmark. Further, as I have mentioned,
there is an ongoing review of our approach to asylum seeker support and
we expect to finish conducting our inquiries shortly. We are taking
account of the views of partners, including the recommendations of the
Children’s Society. We will want to ensure coherence with the
mainstream benefit system and the financial constraints being faced.

there is no statutory obligation to carry out an annual review of
asylum support rates. Instead, Parliament has set a clear benchmark
that the support provided must meet the “essential living
needs” of recipients of Section 95 support and that it must
provide “accommodation” to recipients of Section 4
support. It would be wrong to raise expectations in this area given the
current constraints on the funding available, but we are committed to
an approach to asylum support that is fair, reasonable and balanced. No
one who has sought our protection need be destitute while waiting for
an application to be decided, but if the application is refused and the
decision is upheld by the courts, we expect people to return home.
Perhaps I may add that if someone is granted asylum, if they are in
need of benefits they will transfer on to the domestic regime, which
ensures that they receive the same benefits as anyone else in this
country under the normal rules that apply.</hs_para>

Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee secretariat in carrying out the
research which enabled my committee to produce the report that we are
about to debate. I thank in particular Kate Lawrence, our clerk until
the end of last year who is now on a two-year sabbatical, and Peter
Milledge, our invaluable counsel. I hope that the House will be as
impressed as I am by the magnificent Table 1 on page 8 which sets out
clearly the variations in strengthened scrutiny procedures that are at
the heart of our report. I shall come back to those variations in a
moment.</hs_para>

been increasingly concerned in the past few years at the proliferation
of procedures in legislation designed to give Parliament more control
over delegated powers. This may sound counterintuitive: surely it is
nothing but a good thing for Parliament to have an increased role in
scrutinising all powers proposed by the Executive, particularly in the
field of secondary legislation, which has always been the Cinderella in
the legislative landscape, if I may mix my metaphors a bit. We agreed
that enhanced and rigorous scrutiny is a good thing but needed to say
to the Government, “Please don’t invent yet another
variation on a strengthened statutory procedure without examining
existing procedures first, otherwise the complexity you are in danger
of creating may lead to confusion and muddle rather than enhanced
scrutiny”. We even suggested that the House might consider the
case for rationalisation of all these variations by
legislation.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=1458?><hs_para UID="13030574000051" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0002.htm#13030574000051">Then there is
consistency of language. In seven of the scrutiny procedures, the
Government have a legal duty to “take account of”,
“have regard to” and “consider” a relevant
committee’s recommendations. We wondered whether there are
subtle differences in these
expressions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030574000052" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0002.htm#13030574000052">Before
going any further, perhaps I should put our report in context by
quickly sketching out how our committee came into existence, what has
led to these new procedures and what they are. The Delegated Powers
Committee was set up only in 1992—very recently by House of
Lords standards—because of real disquiet over the way successive
Governments were increasingly using order-making powers in Bills, some
of which were little more than skeletal. This practice enabled
Ministers to be vague about the all-important detail and future
secondary legislation as the Bill made its way through Parliament. In
justifying this lack of detail, Ministers could always cite flexibility
for changing circumstances and, of course, precedent, but the House
made it clear that leaving so much important detail to unamendable
instruments was no longer acceptable. In many cases the detailed policy
had simply not been worked out. The upshot was the Jellicoe report,
which recommended the setting up of the Delegated Powers Committee to
examine whether the delegation of legislative power in new Bills was
appropriate. Eleven years later, the Merits of Statutory Instruments
Committee was also set up to look at existing statutory instruments.
Both committees have different names now to reflect their additional
duties. They have certainly given a higher profile to delegated
legislation and have, I believe, over the course of their existence,
proved their worth. Governments have always taken the DPRR
Committee’s reports seriously, very often acquiescing in its
recommendations as Bills go through the
House.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030574000053" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0002.htm#13030574000053">It may
be worth noting that the other place does not have committees carrying
out the same function; indeed, my committee is often asked to comment
on draft Bills before a Joint Committee of both Houses. However, the
other place does set up a scrutiny committee, under the
super-affirmative procedure, if necessary, which issues a report, as
does my committee. This might therefore be the right place to question
whether having this duplication really makes sense. I gather it is
fiendishly difficult to set up Joint Committees for both Houses but
should this process not be made easier, and certainly speedier for this
purpose, if not for any
other?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030574000054" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0002.htm#13030574000054">Our
report starts by setting out the different types of statutory
instrument before concentrating on those orders which attract some kind
of enhanced scrutiny procedure. These orders are all Henry VIII powers,
which enable Ministers to amend Acts of Parliament by secondary
legislation. Who would have thought that Henry VIII’s name would
still be immortalised in quite this way? My late colleague Lord Russell
said that the very first time King Henry used this power was
to vary the price of wine. Although many Henry VIII powers are limited,
there are many others which are much more significant. Nearly all Henry
VIII powers are exercised by ordinary, familiar affirmative
instruments, which have to come before the House before they can be
made. However, there are now order-making powers 
<?notus-xml column=1459?>in certain Bills which are subject to the super-affirmative or enhanced
affirmative procedure, by which these orders receive much more detailed
scrutiny, with many variations, than an ordinary affirmative order. Our
report details all the order-making powers in Acts which attract a
strengthened scrutiny procedure, and exactly what that procedure is in
each case. Perhaps the best example is the Legislative and Regulatory
Reform Act 2006, once dubbed the “Abolition of Parliament
Bill”, because of the scope and significance of its delegated
powers. This Act ticks all the requirement boxes in Table 1. All this
may seem quite an undertaking but these safeguards were the price that
the then Government had to pay for enabling a Minister to reduce or
remove a burden imposed by primary
legislation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030574000055" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0002.htm#13030574000055">At
the beginning of my remarks, I said that our report asked the
Government not to invent a new variation on a strengthened statutory
procedure without examining existing procedures first. The second major
point we needed to make to the Government was, “Please make it
clear whether legislative reform orders are to be used even if the
proposed changes are highly controversial and if proceeding with them
is not recommended by the relevant scrutiny committee in one or both
Houses”. Just to be clear, the previous Government said that
they would not proceed with proposed changes under these
circumstances.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030574000056" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0002.htm#13030574000056">Since
our report was published, the Government have responded to several of
our questions but only to one of those two main points. We now know
which committees are to scrutinise which orders. We also know that the
Government will use the existing model, if possible, when proposing a
strengthened scrutiny procedure in future; if not, they will explain
the reasons for inventing a new procedure. They have also undertaken to
lay supporting documents setting out the detail of and rationale for
any proposed order under Section 19 of the Localism Act 2011.</hs_para>

have been addressed but we still do not know whether LROs will be used
for highly controversial changes and whether the Government will
respect the relevant scrutiny committee’s power of veto. Before
further legislation is drawn up, it is vital that the House knows the
answer to those two crucial matters. For example, we know that the
Government are contemplating a deregulatory Bill in which it is quite
possible that new rules will be introduced to change the super- or
enhanced affirmative procedure by cutting down or cutting out
consultation.</hs_para>

am probably not the only person to worry about that word
“proportionality”. Governments skip a proper consultative
process at their peril. A good example is the lack of consultation on a
crucial part of the recent Social Security (Personal Independence

To say that the change put the cat among the pigeons is putting it
mildly, and at least the Minister apologised for inadequate
consultation on that occasion.</hs_parafo>

is a paragraph headed “New opportunities”, which I shall
now turn to. The question arises that if a strengthened procedure is
considered proper for some Henry VIII powers in certain Acts, why do we
put up with such a comparatively crude way of considering some very
important affirmative instruments that are not Henry VIII orders? What
I mean by this is the “take it or leave it” procedure
that the House has for considering affirmative instruments. They can
either be agreed to or disagreed to, full stop. Non-fatal amendments or
regret Motions to the approval Motion, whether agreed to or not, are in
effect neither here nor

report is concerned with delegated legislation that is subject to
enhanced procedure by statute, but it is high time that the Procedure
Committee turned its mind to considering a non-statutory procedure for
consideration of certain important instruments. This might attract,
say, two bites of the cherry, by which I mean that noble Lords could be
given a chance to have a preliminary debate before the instrument is
taken through the House. The Government could be encouraged to table a
proposal for an instrument which might then attract one or more
suggested amendments on which votes could take place. Even if the
Government decided to take no notice of any successful suggested
amendments when the instrument was going through the House, at least
there would have been the possibility of change, because any amendments
would have been suggested before it was too
late.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030574000062" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0002.htm#13030574000062">A recent
candidate for such a procedure would have been the draft PIP
regulations that I just mentioned. We know that the Government were
running seriously out of time for them, and I well understand that DWP
orders may have that problem, but it might have been a better if the
House had been able to have two bites of that particular cherry. In the
event, the Government have published amending regulations to take
account of the many representations
made.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030574000063" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0002.htm#13030574000063">This
begs the question of whether the House really has the scrutiny of
ordinary affirmative SIs right. All my committee and the Secondary
Legislation Committee can do is to recommend and warn. It is up to the
House what then happens. Should the House be more robust in voting down
instruments? In spite of the recommendation of the committee of the
noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, on the House’s working practices, I am
not particularly attracted to that course of action because I think it
is a bit unrealistic and confrontational. The noble Lord, Lord Filkin,
may disagree with me when we hear what he has to say later on; I am
very pleased he is to speak. I would prefer the House to allow a
genuine draft of the instrument to be debated and voted on, with
suggested amendments before the instrument was agreed
to.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030574000064" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0002.htm#13030574000064">I am very
aware that many Peers believe that there should be a way of amending
statutory instruments, but the whole point of delegated legislation is
that it is just that: it delegates a power to a Minister to bring in
some policy the House has agreed to in principle, and the whole point
of my committee is to see that that delegation is not inappropriate.
However, there is no reason why the House should not devise some way of
improving the scrutiny of important statutory instruments

suspect that all Ministers would in their heart of hearts prefer to

We can only make recommendations, whether as to the appropriateness of

ministerial legislation, an increase causing—to quote a 1992
report—“considerable disquiet”. A remedy was then
proposed. That report stated that a delegated powers scrutiny committee

report also demonstrates that the originating problem is ongoing.
Rather like a virus, it mutates. Unlike a virus, however, there are
already antidotes, which in this report your Lordships’
committee endeavours to prescribe. I must be selective, given the list
of speakers whom your Lordships will wish to hear. Let me
select the important statement that the report makes that it is the
practice of the committee to try to take a consistent approach in its
judgments as to whether a strengthened power proposed in a Bill is
appropriate to be delegated by Parliament to Ministers at all and
whether, if it is, it will be subject to an appropriate level of
parliamentary scrutiny, not merely by means of the familiar negative
procedure or the affirmative procedure but by the super-affirmative
procedure or whatever variant may be proposed. Consistency on the
committee’s part is obviously desirable and
necessary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030574000073" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0002.htm#13030574000073">The
trouble is that Bills come forward with “marked
differences” in their provision for strengthened parliamentary
scrutiny, as my noble friend has already said. As the report states, it
is that variation that has led our committee to undertake the analysis
at its heart. Here I agree with what my noble friend says about table
1—and I would add appendix 2—of our report. The contents
fully justify that reaction. The detail certainly illustrates the
outstanding service that we receive from our clerks. They have led the
committee to recommend that—here I paraphrase—when
proposing a strengthened scrutiny procedure, the Government should
normally use an existing model. I shall explain the basis for that
decision. I am personally very glad that the Government have
effectively accepted this. It would be helpful to the House if it is
brought into practice. That would be highly desirable and helpful to
the
public.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030574000074" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0002.htm#13030574000074">The
Government have so far been less accommodating —my noble friend
referred to this, too, so I can be brief about it—about adopting
undertakings given by the previous Government, made during the passage
of Clauses 12 to 19 of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill in
2006. These are discussed at paragraphs 21 and 22 of our
report, and they are of such a character that they would, if generally
adopted, have an effective impact on future attempts to legislate in
this way. That is a very important matter to consider. I hope
that the Government can be induced to agree to adopt the
undertakings given in 2006 legislation. It was a little disappointing
to find from their report that they are considering this and will
report in due course. Our report was published in July and the response
is, I would respectfully suggest, rather overdue. I hope that it will
be
favourable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030574000075" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0002.htm#13030574000075">I
want to end without striking a churlish note. This report and the

scrutiny of delegated power, although it needs nurturing, is now
strongly embedded in our governance. Accordingly, those inclined to

Andrews:</Member></B> My Lords, it gives me great pleasure to
participate in this debate and I congratulate the noble Baroness on

report and thank her for the comprehensive way in which she set out the
background to the report. It is a pleasure to serve under her wise,
inclusive and very firm leadership. I must ask the forgiveness of the
House if I cannot say for part of the debate, but I shall be here for
the end. The business of the House has gone slightly awry this

the noble Baroness, I shall say a few words about the context of
statutory instruments and their role in policy. In terms of
parliamentary architecture, it is obvious that the DPRRC was a hugely
important innovation in the bastion of parliamentary
scrutiny. It is a model of scrupulous attention and is unique.
It concentrates the minds of Ministers and departments very well. I
remember, as a departmental Minister, the collective grown that would
go up in the department if the DPRRC recommended that we change a
negative to an affirmative instrument. We were always very conscious of
the tightrope we trod. We listened, and for good reason, because
essentially what impacts upon people’s lives in terms of
legislation is not primary legislation but the statutory instruments. I
once saw a statistic—I cannot stand it up but others may be able
to—that 80% of the laws as they impact on individuals are
transported through statutory instruments, whether that is welfare
benefits, food safety, planning requirements or competition across the
NHS. The trouble is that few people outside Parliament are au fait with
the way that statutory instruments work or are debated. We should try
to address that
obscurity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030574000078" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0002.htm#13030574000078">Secondary
legislation serves government well. It served Henry VIII well and
consolidated his powers of dictatorship. It serves his successors well,
too. Sometimes, there is no mistaking the Government’s
intention. There are those of us who still clearly remember the Public
Bodies Bill, where the Henry VIII powers were used so blatantly and
deliberately that they shocked the entire cast of the DPRRC to its
core. The committee and this House brought the Government to book on
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030574000079" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0003.htm#13030574000079">More
often, Ministers argue rightly that secondary legislation is simply a
practical solution to implementing change in an uncertain world. It
enables flexibility and reflects a willingness to respond to changing
circumstances. There is the impossibility of loading all the detail,
implementation and enforcement into primary legislation. Yet that is a
secondary weakness. In the interval as we waited for this debate to
start, I added up the number of SIs that have been and will be before
the House between 27 February and 19 March. There are 38 sets of
regulations in that short period, with six yesterday in the Moses
Room.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13030574000080" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0003.htm#13030574000080">The
irony is that while much of the effort goes into writing and rewriting
Bills, not least in response to egregious errors, secondary
legislation, which requires enormous care and attention to detail,
tends to suffer from the lack of both. It is also a victim of time. We
have lost count of the number of times we have desperately needed
regulations before this House before 
<?notus-xml column=1464?>the Report stage of a Bill, only to be told that we
could not have them because they were in draft and officials were
working hard but could not produce
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030574000081" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0003.htm#13030574000081">It is
for this reason that I am a firm supporter of the recommendations made
by the Goodlad committee, on which I had the honour to serve, to
improve the way we make legislation, train Bill teams and discuss the
issues with draftsmen. Our task in the committee is to determine
whether the level of delegation is right. As the noble and learned
Lord, Lord Mayhew, said, tempting though it is to trespass into policy,
we are always brought firmly back to the point that that is not our
business. But we should ask the following questions. Have Ministers
taken too many powers unto themselves? Is that deliberate or
accidental? Is the level of delegation appropriate? Have the officials
really thought about the
alternatives?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030574000082" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0003.htm#13030574000082">Most
of the time, as we find, delegation is appropriate. However, given the
various scrutiny procedures and the variations they impose, as
documented in the report, it is not surprising that this House, let
alone Bill officials and draftsmen, gets confused. Sometimes, the
Explanatory Memoranda that come before us are disingenuous in terms of
the arguments about the level of delegation proposed. Sometimes, for
example, departments misunderstand, wilfully or not, the role of
precedence. Sometimes it seems that the subtle difference between
negative and affirmative regulations, or the justification for the most
severe of regulatory structures—the
super-affirmative—have not been sufficiently on the departmental
radar. No wonder that our report calls this
a,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13030574000140" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0003.htm#13030574000140">“complex

reflecting on that, we have been provoked by more recent and specific
changes that have introduced yet more variations and at the highest
levels of the Henry VIII procedures. The noble and learned Lord, Lord
Mayhew, said that we must not be churlish. I do not want to be churlish
because we welcome any enhanced role for Parliament. However, the new
variations are simply, and as we describe them, frankly, unhelpful.
They confuse an already confused picture. The report lists the
variations in terms of primary legislation, the multiplication of
different models, the variation of procedures and the delegated weight,
and the inconsistency in requiring whether supporting documents should
be laid before Parliament. Equally frustratingly, an uncertain
vocabulary adds another layer to that bank of rolling fog. We have
super-affirmative versus enhanced and varying terms for the responses
that are required to committee
recommendations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030574000084" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0003.htm#13030574000084">At
least the Government agree with us that the muddle must stop. Like the
noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, I am grateful that the Government see the
need to stop improvising, to resist the temptation of making any more
new variations to an existing and strengthened procedure, and to
introduce consistency by undertaking to lay supporting documents
setting out the detail of and rationale for any proposed orders under
Section 19 of the Localism Act
2011.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030574000085" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0003.htm#13030574000085">However,
that sensible response is, for me, overshadowed by the fact that, as
noble Lords have said, there is genuine uncertainty about the future
use of LROs—the most draconian of all forms of delegated 
<?notus-xml column=1465?>legislation. The previous Government established the
convention that LRO procedures would not be used to force through
controversial legislation or when a scrutiny committee of either House
had opposed the proposition. Why have the Government apparently refused
to honour this? Why are they so silent on that point? What is so
difficult about that aspect of accountability and good government? That
is bound to raise suspicion, perhaps for the wrong
reason.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030574000086" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0003.htm#13030574000086">I am
bound to say that my fears have been compounded by the evidence that
the Government are trying to reduce consultation procedures. Where does
this sit with Mr Francis Maude’s commitment to greater
transparency and open government? When will the Government learn that,
in the long run, it is infinitely better to take people with you than
to press on regardless of how those who are affected by the legislation
see it and will have to implement it? I hope that the Minister can give
us some reassurances
today.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030574000087" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0003.htm#13030574000087">Finally,
under “any other business”, I want to support what the
noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, said about the way in which Parliament
deals as a whole with affirmative resolutions. There is no doubt that
the present situation is deeply unsatisfactory for everybody. The
choice between a debate on unsatisfactory regulations where not even
the most perverse consequences can be ironed out, challenged, or
removed, and the cliff edge of a fatal Motion which wrecks the entire
process, the good bits and all, serves no one. It does not serve the
Government, who may have to retrieve their mistakes months later; it
does not serve the credibility of Parliament, whose job it is to help
get legislation right; it does not serve the purposes of this House;
nor does it allow us to undertake our specific responsibility to make
government think again and think carefully. That is what we do. It
certainly does not serve people in the community who have to live with
the consequences. We need a third way: an opportunity to nudge
government without humiliating Ministers; an interim stage to consider
regulations on the understanding that the Minister can take them away
to rethink them. It might be a counsel of perfection in some
cases—some regulations one would not want to see ever
again—but, nevertheless, it would make for better law and,
often, more humane solutions.</hs_para>

paying tribute to the chairmanship of the Delegated Powers and
Regulatory Reform Committee of my noble friend Lady Thomas of
Winchester. She consistently chairs meetings of our committee with a
combination of efficiency, understanding and charm that enables even

has been said, the committee performs a valuable function and performs
it well, but there is considerable force in the central thrust of our
special report. That is 
<?notus-xml column=1466?>that the burgeoning range of arrangements for
parliamentary scrutiny tends to deprive Members of this House of the
ability quickly and simply to assess whether Ministers’ exercise
of delegated powers will be adequately or appropriately supervised and
controlled.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030574000091" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0003.htm#13030574000091">It
is, of course, gratifying that, in general, the recommendations of the
committee are accepted by Ministers, so that the work of the committee
is, to that extent, effective. However, there are occasions when the
committee rightly feels that the level of scrutiny should be a matter
to be considered by the whole House. This is particularly true when
strengthened scrutiny procedures are being considered. On such
occasions, it would be helpful for Members of this House if the
possibilities were generally limited to a few well understood
procedures. That recommendation is at the heart of our report. The
Government have promised to move in that direction, and this House
should be astute to monitor how serious and disciplined the approach of
the Government is in
future.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030574000092" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0003.htm#13030574000092">I
shall follow up the suggestion that my noble friend Lady Thomas made
towards the end of her speech, which was supported by the noble
Baroness, Lady Andrews, that there should be a better, more effective
and more detailed specific way of scrutinising delegated legislation
that is subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. The regret
Motion, which is a familiar procedure in this House, is a blunt
instrument indeed. Fatal Motions are even blunter and the House is
understandably reluctant to entertain or to resort to them. If passed,
a regret Motion gives the Government an opportunity to think again, but
it does not compel them to do so. As a procedure, the regret Motion has
two important flaws: first, it is entirely non-specific and while it is
common that the Motion sets out in general terms the basis for
criticism, it does not enable the House to consider and express a view
on particular flaws in the instrument proposed nor does it give the
House the opportunity to suggest alternatives or amendments that might
make for better or more effective secondary legislation. Secondly, the
regret Motion is generally ineffective in practice, even if it is
successful. Generally, it is an instrument not of constructive
scrutiny, which is the proper role of this House, but of
outright opposition, which may be out of place, particularly given
that, ex hypothesi, the enabling legislation has already passed through
both
Houses.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030574000093" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0003.htm#13030574000093">The
two-stage process suggested by my noble friend would answer those
criticisms. I fully appreciate and agree with her that delegated
legislation is of its nature a matter for Ministers, subject to the
appropriate level of parliamentary scrutiny. It is therefore not
appropriate for us to introduce a fully fledged procedure for amending
delegated legislation. That would be contrary to principle and the
whole point of such legislation. However, I suggest that there might be
many ways of achieving the objective of enabling the House to have a
more directed and specific way of looking at draft instruments. My
noble friend’s suggestion is certainly one which offers that
prospect. On the first occasion that a draft instrument came before the
House, the House would be in a position to suggest amendments that
might improve it and to invite the Government to consider them. The
Government would then have the opportunity to do so, knowing that if
the will of the House were 
<?notus-xml column=1467?>ignored, they would run the risk of being defeated when the draft was
brought back to the House unamended. If, on the other hand, the
Government wished to amend the draft, they could do so and bring the
amended draft back to the House for approval.</hs_para>

not suggesting that this procedure would or should be invoked in every
case, but it would be sensible for it to be considered and tested. I
suspect that its introduction would probably not require any formal
change of procedure. The House, the usual channels and the Government
could then determine when such a procedure should be used and monitor
whether such a new procedure added to the effectiveness of the House in
scrutinising secondary legislation. I suggest that it almost certainly
would.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13030574000150" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0003.htm#13030574000150">8.49

are discussing specific issues tonight but they arise in the context of
the volume and complexity of legislation passing through these Houses,
which has grown so much over the years. We have only to look at the
most recent public legislation figures for the last Session. In 2010-12
some 80 Bills came before the House; 10,000 amendments were tabled in
the two Houses and, of these, 25% were accepted. In the same period,
9,432 measures of delegated legislative instruments were passed. That
is a huge volume of new law cascading forth to be understood and
applied. It is vitally important in cases that require scrutiny that it
is properly carried out so that Parliament may achieve and carry out
its functions. There is significant interest in the delegated
legislative scrutiny processes, and studies are presently being carried
out.</hs_para>

the measures which issue as delegated legislation quite simply do not
come for approval before any committee. About 2,500 of the 10,000
actually came to the Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee. Many of
them are simply passed into law and the Delegated Powers and Regulatory
Reform Committee has no power of scrutiny over delegated legislation
introduced after the passing of an Act. Such scrutiny as does occur is
the responsibility of others. However, questions may rightly be asked
about whether there is sufficient scrutiny of the huge volume of
delegated legislation, currently running at about 10 measures
every day.</hs_para>

committee examines each occasion on which power is delegated. For
example, most recently, the committee was satisfied that it was
appropriate for the orders prescribing rates of welfare benefits to be
subject to no parliamentary control. The Bill leaves the Secretary of
State and the Treasury with very little discretion so there is very
little control that the House could usefully exercise. The role of the
committee in that context is necessarily limited but it will consider
whether any Bill 
<?notus-xml column=1468?>contains delegated legislative power that is inappropriate and examine
each occasion on which there is a delegation in any Bill.</hs_para>

measures, in order to apply the law. Such is the volume of legislation

legislation can be scrutinised. The language in which we describe these
procedures may be historic and can probably be improved. As a House I
think we are very reluctant to refuse to affirm legislation or to
challenge it. It could be otherwise. The committee has developed an
almost invariable practice of recommending the affirmative procedure
where there is no upper limit to maximum civil or criminal penalties in
a delegated power to make orders or regulations. We have developed a
series of standards which we apply.</hs_para>

of a number of super-affirmative or enhanced affirmative procedures, 11
in all under particular Acts such as the Northern Ireland Act 1998 and
the Localism Act 2011, are examples of that. However, as the committee
has made clear in the past, the insertion of a super-affirmative
procedure cannot by itself bring a misconceived delegated power within
the bounds of acceptability. While accepting, indeed admiring, the
ability of my noble colleagues to find their way around the myriad
conventions and procedure governing the passing of legislation, I am
fairly sure that there are not many Members who could state the powers
attaching to the exercise of 
<?notus-xml column=1469?>each of the different enhanced scrutiny procedures.

However, this recommendation affects potential draft orders to be made
under legislation passed in 2004, 2006 and 2011. It is clearly
desirable that the Government respond rapidly and positively to the
statement made by the committee in paragraph 21 of the report.

exercise of the democratic mandate which Governments have by virtue of
election. Where the Government seek to legislate to confer a power to
delegate matters which are properly the prerogative of Parliament, then
the committee must exercise its powers by applying standards to
determine that this has happened, as occurred during the highly
controversial passage of the Public Bodies Act 2011. The committee
stated that if the House could find no overriding reason or exceptional
circumstances which justified the inclusion of Clause 11 and
Schedule 7—those powers which allowed the Minister to add any of
150 bodies or offices listed in Schedule 7 to any of Schedules 1 to 6,

further parliamentary intervention—the committee would recommend
that they should be removed from the Bill. The clause and the schedule

Haskel:</Member></B> My Lords, to most people outside Parliament, and
to many inside Parliament, “delegated powers” is an
arcane topic best left to specialists— something rather
technical and dull. They are wrong. They are wrong because, as the
noble Baroness, Lady O’Loan, reminded us just now, delegated
powers are central to our democracy. I am grateful to the noble
Baroness, Lady Thomas, for leading this debate, and for the skill with
which she has led our
committee.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030574000111" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0003.htm#13030574000111">The
noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, reminded us that Ministers cannot
do everything, so they delegate some of their powers. In a democracy it
is essential to see whether legislative power is delegated
inappropriately, and to ensure that this scrutiny is carried out to an
appropriate degree. The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, reminded us that
because of this the House became concerned about the unlimited
discretion which some legislation gave Ministers in delegating powers
by order or by secondary legislation, and so it formed a committee to
scrutinise this aspect—and quite right too. That is entirely in
keeping with the revising function of this
House.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030574000112" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0003.htm#13030574000112">When
legislation is proposed, the method of scrutinising delegated powers
should be contained in that legislation. Some legislation makes no
reference at all to scrutiny by Parliament. Some can be laid before
Parliament and will be subject to no further debate but generally there
is an affirmative or negative procedure, or a super-affirmative
procedure, for scrutiny. However, in recent years many variations have
been introduced; many Bills introduce their own form of scrutiny, which
are listed by our report. As the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas,
explained, the real purpose of the special report is to draw the
attention of your Lordships to these variations of procedure and to
make the point that they are helpful neither to Parliament nor to the
public’s understanding of our work. I join the noble Lord, Lord
Marks, in hoping that the outcome of this debate will be to arrive at
some form of consistency and to rationalise the range of
variations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030574000113" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0003.htm#13030574000113">Not

consultation or lay supporting documents so that scrutiny can be
thorough. Again, there has been a variation in the timing and

the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006, they will not use those

the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, said, these procedures may seem technical,

which the House has a deservedly high reputation. So much of the detail
of the Executive’s lawmaking is done these days through
delegated legislation that it is important that the House scrutinises
that delegated legislation as effectively as we do primary legislation.
In that context, I support the proposal of the noble Baroness, Lady
Thomas of Winchester, that the House should consider rationalising the
committee structure for the consideration of statutory instruments and
should seek to work more closely with the other place through Joint
Committees. Unlike primary legislation, which the two Houses consider
sequentially, we frequently consider many statutory instruments
simultaneously. In those circumstances, it would make more sense for
the Houses to work together more closely through Joint

happens is that when the Government are defeated in this House on
legislation, they consider the matter further and either accept this
House’s view or reverse it in another place. Similarly, if the
Government were defeated in this House on secondary legislation, it is

consideration to the Goodlad committee’s proposal for an

that, when it does so, its purpose is to give the Government the chance
to think again and that if the Government relaid a
substantially similar instrument, and the Commons passed it, the Lords
would not vote against it for a second time. That would be an
alternative way of achieving the objective that the noble Baroness,
Lady Thomas, has described—namely, giving the Government an

Reform Select Committee”, you would think that a soporific way
of starting the day. In fact, it is not just dry, it is arid at times,
but—and this is a most important “but”—it
is extremely important because it is about the way in which Parliament

an affirmative resolution of this House. Indeed, a quick look at
tomorrow morning’s business in the Delegated Powers Committee

difficult for anyone to know that now, including a qualified lawyer.

answer that question fairly soon. By fairly soon, I do not mean
“in due course”; I mean, I hope, in the next month or so.
It is unreasonable not to do so.</hs_parafo>

suggested that strengthened scrutiny should take place in respect of

about such powers, as a committee we clearly have to be

need to do that. I appreciate that that would need legislation and that
it could not be quick. However, it would enable us to think much more
strategically about how we approach this and to deal with the point
rightly raised by the noble Lord, Lord Butler, with which I agree, that
a number of these issues should be dealt with by a committee of both
Houses. Put simply, at times both Houses are looking at the same things
without knowing that the other House is considering them. I am tempted
by that paragraph to say that we should go much further on
this.</hs_parafo> <hs_para UID="1303061000010" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0003.htm#1303061000010">It has
been pointed out already, and I do not wish to labour it, that the
House does not always nominate a committee to undertake scrutiny of
draft orders. At the moment, there are about six draft orders before
the House which are not nominated to any committee. That again makes
the suggestion of having a more strategic look at this problem quite
attractive. The variety of these orders, the way in which they are
being changed, the fact that some are not looked at at all and the fact
that both Houses often look at some of these things simultaneously
makes me think that a more strategic view would be better. It also
could focus on how the two Houses emphasise the fact that Parliament
must be able to control the Executive. That underlying principle is
always there. If we could take a more strategic view, it might make a
lot of
sense.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303061000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0003.htm#1303061000011">It would
also enable us to look again at some of the language we use. Saying to
a person outside this House that something is a draft affirmative order
or a super-affirmative order is more confusing than it needs to be. I
sometimes think that the Henry VIII phrase is quite useful, because it
implies authoritarian government, but it is not really meaningful to
many people outside. Although I recognise the importance of having
legal terms that at times have to be defined in legal or parliamentary
drafting language, we should always bear in mind that unless we want
everyone to have legal aid and to be able to see a solicitor, it would
be a good aim for Bills to be able to be read and understood by an
average member of the public. I know that that is a bit far-fetched but
we should never lose sight of this: we are legislating for the public.
It is the public who have to obey the laws, rules and regulations that
are passed by delegated powers. We really have a duty to make
legislation understood by them.</hs_para>

received today, I understand that the Hansard Society is conducting a
fairly detailed review of this whole area, which I very much welcome. I
simply say to the Minister that perhaps he could take away the

therefore a case for the House to find a way of reviewing it and seeing
if we should not approach it by a form of legislation, as suggested in
the opening lines of paragraph 25 of the 
<?notus-xml column=1476?>report. Once again, I thank the staff and members of

Gardner of Parkes:</Member></B> I have been on the Delegated Powers and
Regulatory Reform Committee for quite a number of years and I have
served under a number of different chairman. We are very fortunate now
in having the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, and I congratulate her on
securing this debate today. Tribute was paid to the various supporters
and advisers we have had. In particular, Peter Milledge, who is now in
charge of providing our legal advice, was mentioned. I should
like also to acknowledge Allan Roberts and all that he did. During the
early years when I was on the committee, he was the number 1. They
worked very well together and clearly the committee continues to work
well. The other point that has been raised many times about two bites
of the cherry in selective cases is very valuable. However, I think
that selective cases is right. You certainly would not want to turn it
into something more general.</hs_para>

the committee is limited because all I can do is look at things and try
to exercise a bit of common sense. The only thing I can really claim to
have had an input into was the very first ever regulatory reform order
that we worked on. It was about pub licensing hours and referred to
what I think were “minor variations” in pub licences. The
order said that a variation need not be advertised in the local press
or anywhere else. It could go through because the pubs would look after
everyone and make sure that everything was fine, so there would be no
problem. I went to a hearing in the borough where my daughter lives and
discovered that it is quite a different thing if you live next door to
a pub with a beer garden that wants to stay open until two in the
morning because the noise spreads around all the nearby houses. I
thought that it would be wrong for us to agree to it, even though the
policy on regulatory reform was to simplify life and do away with a lot
of bureaucracy and red tape. I agree with all that, but suddenly you
found that you had fought your corner well at a licensing hearing, but
the pub had gone back with what it described as a minor variation and,
without you having any idea that it was even under consideration, it
would suddenly be in place. I said that I thought it was not right and
that we should have a consultation on it. The proposal then went out to
all the local authorities and licensing authorities, and the response
was really quite extraordinary. People felt very strongly about it.
When it came for a decision by the committee, it was agreed that pubs
would at least have to post a notice in the window of the premises so
that local people, those who would be most affected, could see what was
going to happen and would be given a certain period in which to
exercise their right to object. I believe that that was the first ever
regulatory reform change we made. It also set quite a good precedent
for the committee in terms of assessing what really is and is not
relevant and what is worth looking at.</hs_para>

of which is extremely healthy. I think that it is a marvellous
committee which is greatly respected. It also works in with other
committees such as the Constitution Committee. A lot of the Select
Committee reports go with one another in order to make a complete

Baroness, Lady Thomas, on the one hand, for initiating this debate, but
on the other regret that she invited me to take part in it, although
that is 
<?notus-xml column=1479?>perhaps churlish. I speak with respect for, but not
much knowledge of, the Delegated Powers Committee and with too many
years serving before the mast as chairman of what was then called the
Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee. Having been there, I have an
abiding interest in and commitment to the importance of this
place’s scrutiny of secondary legislation, which is of course
what we are debating tonight. I essentially want to ask the House
whether those two committees, although they have undoubtedly improved
the House’s procedures, have improved legislation. I do not
think it obvious that the merits committee, at least, has,
although I cannot speak for the Delegated Powers Committee.</hs_para>

argument as to why. I start by reflecting on how government works. Many
of us know how government works, either from the outside or the inside.
Governments, quite rightly, are in power to do things. They have a
manifesto—or even a modern version of it in the coalition
agreement—and are massively busy and challenged, and are
committed to delivering on what they think is either their manifesto or
coalition programme and, they hope, getting another innings after the
next election. Legislation is a necessary evil. It is a distraction
from what Ministers really want to do but is necessary because that is
how our constitution works. By and large, they want to get their
legislation through the House as quickly, and with as little damage to
it, as
possible.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303061000025" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0003.htm#1303061000025">Ministers
also believe they are right. Civil servants believe they are right, by
and large, because they are usually more expert on a subject than most
parliamentarians. Ministers believe they are right because they have
to, otherwise they would not have the confidence to sustain doing a
difficult job. That sense of confidence as a Minister or as an official
does not make you sufficiently persuadable to change your mind,
particularly when you have got to the position where you have committed
your Government to legislation, in either primary or secondary form. It
is not obvious that the processes of the House themselves will
naturally lead Ministers to change their minds. Why should we expect
that they will do
so?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303061000026" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0003.htm#1303061000026">We know how
we change their minds on primary legislation but let us consider, as my
good friend the noble Lord, Lord Butler, has spelled out, what happens
on secondary legislation. We cannot amend it, and it is quite right
that we cannot amend it, for good technical reasons which I will not go
into. We decide, although we are able to reject it, that we will not do
so. By our own self-denying ordinances, we can neither amend nor reject
an instrument: so why do we assume that that is going to change
anything? The only thing that shifts Ministers and shifts policy is
either the fear or reality of adverse publicity, or a defeat. That is a
statement, for most of us, of the blindingly obvious. We get zero
publicity on primary legislation, except when there is a defeat, and we
get even less publicity—if you can have a negative—on any
publicity about secondary instruments, for pretty obvious reasons. It
is hardly the stuff of the Dog and Duck. On that argument, we have a
situation where it is not the media that will change Ministers’
minds but only defeats. However, we have said that we will never defeat
the Government, for reasons that I struggle to understand.</hs_para>

consequence of this—this is my central argument—is that
the legislation that comes in through one door, in all its hundreds of
pieces, exits the other door in all those hundreds totally unchanged.
So what have we done in this processing factory to affect that
legislation? I am open to persuasion that in some way the feel or
quality of the aura of the legislation is better but the words are
exactly the same. So what are we doing? Where is the evidence we are
improving secondary legislation by our processes? I struggle to
understand it. If noble Lords accept my argument—from too many
years, probably, serving on the merits committee—that the
processes are superb but that what the Chamber itself does is
fundamentally flawed because it will not do anything about it when it
thinks it is wrong, what should we do about
it?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303061000028" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0003.htm#1303061000028">I will not

legislation. So the only way that this House can legitimately reject a
secondary instrument is because it is fundamentally flawed in some way,
either in its execution or its policy design, or it does not actually
reflect the instrument. In such cases, if the House thinks it is

is clear that your Lordships’ House fulfils its role as a

scrutiny of delegated legislation is limited. The noble Baroness, Lady
Thomas of Winchester, made it clear that it is appropriate to have
delegated powers if they are used appropriately. I think that we all
recognise that we can only accept or reject delegated legislation. For
reasons of constitutional sensitivity, the latter happens rarely in the
House of Lords, as the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, observed in his
powerful comments. Acceptance or rejection is not a substitute for good
line-by-line scrutiny, debate and possible amendment, but it is none
the less beholden on us to do the best job that we can with such
legislation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303061000044" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0003.htm#1303061000044">Having
sat in both Houses, I have no doubt that the scrutiny undertaken by
your Lordships’ House is superior in this regard, and that role
of scrutiny is taken very seriously and is fulfilled. As I have said,
there is no equivalent committee in the Commons. The Procedure
Committee in the other place has considered the idea, but it has never
really got off the ground. It could be argued that its failure to have
a similar delegated powers committee reinforces our role as a scrutiny
Chamber, with the Commons perhaps accepting that as being our role and
saying, “We'll leave it to the Lords to do this worthy, very
technical work for all of us”. That is quite an imbalance and
recognising the different roles of both Houses could be seen as a
division of labour, but it also makes the scrutiny of delegated
legislation here an even more important responsibility and one that we
have to take very
seriously.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303061000045" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0003.htm#1303061000045">The
true value of scrutiny is in the capacity to revise and reject when
required. Legislation of this kind cannot be amended and only withdrawn
by government and retabled in another form, which is
rare—although, coincidentally, it happened today on the health
regulations. All this makes scrutiny of delegated legislation a bit of
a blunt instrument and, as the noble Lord, Lord Marks of
Henley-on-Thames, said, sometimes an inadequate instrument as well.
That is why we should be concerned about the overreliance of
Governments on this type of legislation. The report is very helpful in

Government must consider carefully in any piece of legislation that
they bring forward whether it is appropriate to delegate order-making
powers to Ministers. We have heard from many noble Lords—my

there has been an increase in legislation generally. The noble
Baroness, Lady O’Loan, gave some examples of how big that
increase has been. There is also an issue of Bills coming to Parliament
before they are truly ready—or “oven ready” as I
have described them. I can think of two such Bills that I specifically
worked on from the Front Bench. One was the Energy Bill in 
<?notus-xml column=1484?>the last Session of Parliament. More than 50 pieces of secondary
legislation will come from that Bill. That seems a huge amount and we
have to question whether, if the Bill had come to us a bit later, some
of those pieces of secondary legislation would not have been more
appropriate in primary
legislation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303061000051" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0003.htm#1303061000051">One
of the crucial parts of the Crime and Courts Bill—another Bill
yet to come back to this House—is setting up a national crime
agency, to be established through a framework document. That framework
document was not available to your Lordships’ House even at
Report stage, though it had been promised to us earlier. Given that
that framework document will describe everything that the NCA is
supposed to do and how it will do it, and so will be crucial to the
establishment of the new agency, it would have been appropriate to have
that before your Lordships’ House as part of the primary
legislation. Instead it will be brought forward by order that will be
unamendable and will not have same the degree of discussion and
scrutiny. To my mind, it is an integral and essential part of that
Bill. Again, it would have been better if that Bill had taken a little
longer to come to your Lordships’ House and not been one of the

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, I approached this debate
with considerable trepidation. When I first came into this House, I was
told by several people that, after the Clerk of the Parliaments, the
greatest expert on all matters of procedure was the then head of the
Liberal Democrat Whips’ Office, Celia Thomas, who is now my
noble friend Lady Thomas of Winchester. When I started to read into
this subject, I discovered how little I understood about the processes
of scrutinising secondary legislation and, indeed, about the difference
between a remedial order and a legislative reform order. I now
understand, and I hope I still will in a week’s time, but it has
been a journey of
exploration.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303061000061" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0003.htm#1303061000061">This
has been a very useful debate, and I start by agreeing with the noble
and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, that this is a success story. What we
have seen in this Chamber over the past 20 or 30 years is a gradual
rise in its effective ability to give scrutiny. As a young academic, I
was an adviser to Lords and Commons committees and I discovered that
Lords committees were much more serious in many ways than Commons
committees and much less partisan. Members had read their papers, they
came and they asked about paragraph (15) and what precisely the
Government thought they meant by it. That is, as the noble Baroness,
Lady Smith of Basildon, said, a different function from that of the
Commons, but it is a very useful function. We should be very proud of
it and cling to
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303061000062" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0003.htm#1303061000062">Much of the
best work this House does is done in its committees, and I hope that
will continue to be the case. There is a necessary tension between the
Executive and the legislature and listening to this debate I was
thinking that much of the press comment on British government is a
matter of seeing a conflict between the Government and the Opposition,
but there is also a very positive, necessary tension between the
Executive and the Legislature, whatever that may be. We play our
role—the Cross-Benchers and others in this House—by
providing the detailed scrutiny that does not get on to the front page
of the <I>Daily Mail</I> but does improve the quality of legislation.
For that reason, I have more sympathy for the suggestion from my noble
friend Lady Thomas of Winchester that we should move towards looking at
draft SIs than for the Goodlad proposal that the House should assert
its right to vote down. As the noble Baroness, Lady Smith, said, that
should be regarded as the reserve option, the exceptional circumstance.
Greater dialogue with the Government about progress on SIs is a much
more effective way to
influence.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303061000063" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0003.htm#1303061000063">When
I first came into the House of Lords, I was asked what I thought the
power of the Lords was. After a bit, I said, “I think
it’s the power to embarrass”. That is quite an effective
power in the dialogue we have with Ministers. The power to publish and
to whisper to a visiting journalist that this Minister has 
<?notus-xml column=1487?>not really got it right yet are quietly effective in the corridors of
Whitehall, and that is the way this Chamber should
operate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303061000064" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0003.htm#1303061000064">A
number of noble Lords suggested that the number of SIs and the area of
subordinate legislation are growing. I am pleased to say that, from
looking at the statistics, that is no longer the case. In the
legislative year 2007, nearly 12,000 SIs went through. In 2011, there
were some 750. Cynics might suggest that the longer Governments are in
power, the more they are likely to resort to SIs. If that should be the
case and this Government stays in power for long, I trust that Members
of this House will point that out and keep Ministers up to the
mark.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303061000065" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0003.htm#1303061000065">I have
some sympathy with those who say that slower government is better
government and that less legislation is better legislation. The
problem, which we all recognise, is that in an era of 24/7 media and of
lobbies insisting that Ministers should take on everything they are
lobbying for, it is very difficult for Ministers to resist those
outside pressures. It is thus up to Parliament to keep pushing back and
saying, “Think about proportionality. Think about whether this
is necessary. Think about whether this is
desirable”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303061000066" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0003.htm#1303061000066">I
am fascinated—I now at last understand this aspect of Henry VIII
powers. I thought when I first heard about Henry VIII powers that they
were a way of keeping numbers in the House of Lords under control. I
have sometimes wished that they might be reintroduced as a means of
keeping the numbers down and allowing new blood to come in, so to
speak. Henry VIII powers are clearly something we always wish to
question. The question of how clear Governments should be about the
implications when they put new legislation through is something we can
accept as desirable in terms of good legislation. The Government accept
all those criticisms and the House of Lords will, I hope, maintain its
effort to keep the Government, of whatever variety, up to the
mark.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1303061000067" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0003.htm#1303061000067">The
noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, incidentally, suggested that 80% of
legislation consisted of SIs. I am not sure where that statistic comes
from. If the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, was here he would
say, of course, that 80% of legislation was forced on us by the
European Union. I suspect these statistics are both a
little—</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303061000068" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0003.htm#1303061000068"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Andrews" PimsId="3758" UID="1303061000129" xid="1053" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0003.htm#1303061000129">Baroness
Andrews:</Member></B> My Lords, I was saying that it has been
calculated that 80% of the impact on people comes via SIs, not that 80%
of legislation is made through SIs. That is why I find it difficult to
source. I will try to find a source for the
Minister.</hs_para>

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> I understand. This was an extremely
valuable report, in particular for pointing out that we have wandered
into a situation where there is considerable diversity—indeed,
almost a confusion—of different sorts of arrangements under
secondary legislation. I can imagine how these will have grown up with
Ministers from different departments making specific concessions on
different Bills. The committee is quite right to say that we should
exert pressure to bring things back to as common a model as
possible.</hs_para>

House, my noble friend Lord Strathclyde, wrote to my noble friend Lady
Thomas last November, accepting the committee’s conclusion that,
wherever possible, existing procedures for enhanced scrutiny should be
used. In his response, which I have deposited in the Library, my noble
friend noted that there may be exceptions where existing procedures are
not suitable, but where the Government sought to create a new procedure
they would clearly set out the case for doing
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303061000071" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0003.htm#1303061000071">The
committee’s report also invited the Government either to set out
the case for not requiring supporting documents to be laid with draft
orders under Section 19 of the Localism Act 2011—to
which a number of noble Lords have referred—or to give an
undertaking to lay supporting documents when laying any draft order
under that section. I can confirm that the Government have given an
undertaking to produce material setting out the detail of, and the
rationale for, any proposed order under Section 19 of the Localism Act
2011, and to provide relevant background to support the parliamentary
process.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1303061000072" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0003.htm#1303061000072">The
committee’s report also looked at orders made under Section 14
of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006. We welcome the
recognition that the existing scrutiny procedures for 2006 Act are
robust. The committees scrutinising such orders can choose which
scrutiny process should be used. They also have the power effectively
to oppose any highly controversial measures. Ministers are obliged to
consider the committees’ recommendations and cannot easily set
them aside. They would need to persuade the whole House to overturn any
recommendation by a committee to reject an
order.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-05?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_05_PT_1/BE0259CB7596622690AB62E436EFBD514387C12C" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 5 March 2013">Tuesday,

legislative reform order that has been identified as highly
controversial during the consultation stage has been withdrawn. Some
measures have returned with increased scrutiny in a Bill. Neither
committee has ever felt the need to exercise its veto when considering
draft orders. This is why the Government have not felt the need to
renew the undertakings given by the previous Administration. This is
not a change of policy. The undertaking was given by the previous
Government in 2006, at a time when it was not clear how the powers in
the Act would be used. It is now clear that the process of bringing
forward draft orders and the scrutiny process has worked well. However,
I recognise that some noble Lords have strong views on this issue, so
we are willing to take it away and consider it further.</hs_para>

that legislative reform orders are important tools to reduce burdens on
business, taking forward deregulatory measures that do not fit into
other legislative vehicles. The report also touched upon orders made
under Section 85 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, Section 102 of the
Local Transport Act 2008 and various orders made under sections of the
Local Government Acts 1999, 2000 and 2003. Some of these have been
rarely, or never, used. Section 85 of the Northern Ireland
Act has been infrequently used and, following the devolution of
policing and justice in 2010, its use is likely to decline further. No
orders have been made under the powers in the three

noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, touched on the mechanism by which we
debate and approve secondary legislation, particularly the system of
consultation and the time allowed for it. Any changes would of course
be a matter for the Procedure Committee. I would not wish to
pre-empt its discussions, but I acknowledge the importance of the
process of consultation and of having a process which commands public
confidence. Again, I will take that back to the Cabinet
Office.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1303061000076" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0003.htm#1303061000076">There
is of course a great variety in the significance of secondary
legislation laid before the House. It is worth remembering that
Parliament itself delegates powers to Ministers and, advised by the
DPRRC, decides which form of scrutiny—negative, affirmative or
super-affirmative—is appropriate for any particular delegation.
In addition, a significant proportion of secondary legislation is
already published in draft, with the consultation process beginning
long before instruments are
laid.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303061000077" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130305-0003.htm#1303061000077">The noble
Lord, Lord Butler, suggested rationalisation of the committee structure
and greater use of Joint Committees. I think a number of us would want
to take that away and think about it further. I am more persuaded by
the arguments of the noble Baroness, Lady Smith, about the different
functions of the two Houses. My limited experience of serving on one
Joint Committee suggested that the two Houses do not always blend
terribly well. A great deal depends on the subject. To the credit of
this House, we tend to approach things in a less partisan and more
detailed manner. Perhaps there is an argument that maintaining a degree
of duality may therefore be functional.</hs_para>

idea of making it totally Joint Committees; they are difficult.
However, that does not rule out looking at the way in which the two

about harmonisation.</hs_para>

July 2013, will include powers to seize and if necessary sell a
