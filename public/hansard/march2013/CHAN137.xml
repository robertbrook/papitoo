down for VAT fraud—that year on year the amount being
confiscated is rising from what was a very low and rather unsuccessful
level after the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 first came into force. In

the heart of this problem is the fact that current definitions of

are inspected is fundamentally flawed, with the same generalist
inspectors looking at slimming clinics, care homes and major teaching
hospitals—sometimes in the same month. We will therefore set up
a new regulatory model under a strong, independent chief inspector of
hospitals, working for the Care Quality Commission. Inspections will
move to a new specialist model based on rigorous and challenging peer
review. Assessments will include judgments about hospitals’
overall performance, including whether patients are listened to and

<?notus-xml column=1472?>of care. In order therefore to expose failure,
recognise excellence and incentivise improvement, the chief inspector
will produce a single aggregated rating for every NHS trust. Because
the patient experience will be central to the inspection, it

Nuffield Trust rightly says, however, that in organisations as large

misleading. The chief inspector will therefore also assess hospital
performance at speciality or department level. This will mean that
cancer patients will be told of the quality of cancer services, and
prospective mothers the quality of maternity services. We will also
introduce a chief inspector of social care and look into the merits of
a chief inspector of primary care to ensure that the same rigour is

it does mean an attitude to harm that treats it as totally unacceptable
and takes enormous trouble to learn from mistakes. We await the report

we must have a clearer picture of what is happening within the NHS and
social care system so that, where problems exist, they are detected
more quickly. As Francis recognised, the disjointed system of
regulation and inspection smothered the NHS, collecting too much
information but producing too little intelligence. We will therefore
introduce a new statutory duty of candour for providers to ensure that
honesty and transparency are the norm in every organisation, and the

a timeline of around 50 warning signs between 2001 
<?notus-xml column=1473?>and 2009, yet Ministers and managers in the wider system
failed to act on those warnings. Some were not aware of them; others
dodged responsibility. That must
change<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T12:39:52"></hs_TimeCode>. No
hospital will be rated as good or outstanding if fundamental standards
are breached, and trusts will be given a strictly limited period of

fourth part of our response concerns accountability for wrongdoers. It
is important to say that what went wrong at Mid Staffs was not typical

excellent care day in, day out. We must ensure that the system does not
crush the innate sense of decency and compassion that drives people to

Francis delivered 290 careful recommendations after a three-year public
inquiry and, like the Secretary of State, I pay tribute to him today.
In response, the Prime Minister promised a detailed response to each
recommendation by the end of this month. Although the Opposition
welcome much of what the Secretary of State has said today, his
statement falls short of that promised full response and contains
serious omissions on which I would like to press him, in particular, on
four of Robert Francis’s flagship recommendations, which I shall
take in turn.</hs_Para>

welcome the move to place a duty of candour on health-care providers
and believe it could help bring about the culture change the NHS needs.
The Francis report, however, goes further and recommends a duty of
candour on individual members of staff. Will the Secretary of State say
more about why he has only accepted this recommendation in part and not
applied it to staff? Has he ruled that out or is he prepared to give it
further
consideration<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T12:45:15"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032655000242" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0001.htm#13032655000242">Will
the Secretary of State assure the House that the duty will apply
equally to all providers of NHS services, including private providers?
His statement was a little vague on that point. More generally, with
more private providers coming into the NHS, is it not the case that we
will not get the transparency we need unless the provisions of freedom
of information apply fully to all holders of NHS contracts and
information cannot be withheld under commercial

on patient voice, the Government have announced new chief inspectors of
hospitals and social care. Those were not Francis recommendations and,
while we give them a cautious welcome, I am sure that the Secretary of
State will agree that regulation alone will not be enough to prevent
another Mid Staffs. Instead, we need a powerful patient voice in every
community that is able to sound the alarm if things are going wrong.
Rather than pulling down the shutters, as the NHS has a tendency to do,
complaints should be embraced as opportunities to learn and
improve.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032655000244" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0001.htm#13032655000244">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T12:46:29"></hs_TimeCode>
is just a matter of days until the new NHS comes into being and the
concern is that patient voice has not been embedded at the heart of the
new system. A third of councils say that their local healthwatch will
not be up and running by the 1 April deadline, and there are 
<?notus-xml column=1475?>wide variations in both structure and membership. Will the Government
accept Robert Francis’s recommendation of a consistent basic

on regulation and training, Robert Francis has made a very clear case
for a new system of regulation of health care assistants to improve
basic standards—a case that we made during the passage of the
Health and Social Care Act 2012—yet it did not feature in the

support moves to rebalance nurse training and to include more hands-on
experience, but student nurses already spend 50% of their time in
clinical practice and face significant financial barriers when
completing their training. Will the Secretary of State assure the House
that requiring a year on the ward will not increase the financial
barriers to young people entering nursing and, if more trainees are to
be on the wards, will he ensure that there are enough staff with the

takes me to my fourth point and the most glaring omission
from the Secretary of State’s statement, namely safe staffing
levels. We will never get the right culture on our wards if they are

that some parts of the NHS are already in danger of forgetting the
lessons of its recent past by cutting the front line too far? Do not
communities need a clear, objective benchmark so that they can
challenge staffing levels on wards, and would it not be a great help to
them for the Francis recommendation on staff-patient ratios to be

staff, because another part of the Francis report is on the importance
of a culture of openness and transparency, and we do not want a culture
of fear. We have therefore not ruled out criminal sanctions for
hospital employees who breach a duty of candour—they already
have a contractual duty of candour —but, as I said in my

ward. If he wants to talk about numbers, he must accept that, because

The hon. Lady is right that one of the problems is the
overlapping roles and the confusion of roles. What we are

involved in putting right problems in hospitals: its job will simply be
to identify problems, so it is not compromised in its ability to be the
nation’s whistleblower-in-chief. The responsibility for putting
right problems will lie with Monitor, the NHS Trust Development
Authority, the NHS Commissioning Board and the wider NHS system. We
want to make sure that the chief inspector is unconstrained and
unconflicted, when his or her team goes into hospitals, from shouting
loudly if there is a problem and continuing to shout loudly until it

that it can never happen again. The accountability that we are
introducing, including criminal sanctions for boards that fail in their
statutory duties, will be a significant change. The body that was
responsible for what went wrong at Mid Staffs, according to Francis,
was the board of the hospital, so that is where our focus must be.

closely with outside bodies, such as the royal colleges, to ensure that
we establish the best way to judge, for example, cancer survival rates.

issues as part of its inspection of whether basic standards of care are
being met. Yes, of course such issues matter, but there are challenges
beyond what an inspection regime can deliver which we will need to
address to deal with these issues. In particular, a problem we are
wrestling with at the moment is who will take responsibility for the
frail elderly when they are discharged from hospital. One reason why
they stay in hospital for a long time is because geriatricians are
nervous about sending them back into the community. They do not think
anyone will take responsibility for them and that is something we have

me turn in detail to what I am announcing today —a programme
that will give great improvements to the passenger, certainty to

that we can invest more, and flexibility, so that different routes with
different demands can be managed in different ways. The programme will
also give fair weight to passenger satisfaction, which has not always
been respected as it should have been, with long-term franchises that
can run for up to 15 years if operators meet the standards
they promise at the 
<?notus-xml column=1488?>start. To ensure a competitive market, we will hold no more than three
to four competitions a year, starting with a smaller number as the
programme gets up to full speed and extending up to 12 current

are those who would like our railways to go back to the days of state
ownership, decline and under-investment. They are wrong. I share the
view of the last Labour Government, who said that franchising worked.
In 2009, Ministers brought in Directly Operated Railways on the east
coast as a short-term stand-in. They did what was needed in difficult
circumstances, but the east coast main line, upgraded in the 1980s, now
needs revitalising. New trains, to be built in the north-east, are now
on order. Now is the right time to invite bidders to put forward
proposals for investing and improving those services. This will be the
first of the new inter-city franchises to be awarded in 2014 in a
programme that meets my three essential principles of better service,
better competition and better value.</hs_Para>

Some competitions are to be delayed by as much as 50 months—not
five months, but 50—yet instead of focusing on the chaos in

permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement on the future
of the UK Border Agency. Since 2010, the Government have
been getting to grips with the chaotic immigration system we inherited.
We have introduced a limit on economic migration from outside the EU,
cut out abuse of student visas and reformed
family visas—as a result, net migration is down by a
third. We have also started to get to grips with the performance of the
organisations that enforce our immigration laws: through the Crime and
Courts Bill, we are setting up a National Crime Agency with a border
policing command; the UK Passport Service continues to operate to a
high standard; and since we split the Border Force from UKBA last year,
98% of passengers go through passport control within target times and
Border Force meets all its passenger service
targets.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032655000435" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0002.htm#13032655000435">However,
the performance of what remains of UKBA is still not good enough. The
agency struggles with the volume of its casework, which has led to
historical backlogs running into the hundreds of thousands; the number
of illegal immigrants removed does not keep up with the number of
people who are here illegally; and while the visa operation is
internationally competitive, it could and should get better still. The
Select Committee on Home Affairs has published many critical reports
about UKBA’s performance. As I have said to the House before,
the agency has been a troubled organisation since it was formed in
2008, and its performance is not good
enough.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032655000436" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0002.htm#13032655000436">In
truth, the agency was not set up to absorb the level of mass
immigration that we saw under the last Government. That meant that it
has never had the space to modernise its structures and systems, and
get on top of its work load. I believe that the agency’s
problems boil down to four main issues: the first is the sheer size of
the agency, which means that it has conflicting cultures and all too
often focuses on the crisis in hand at the expense of other important
work; the second is its lack of transparency and accountability; the
third is its inadequate IT systems; and the fourth is the policy and
legal framework within which it has to operate. I want to update the
House on the ways in which I propose to address each of those
difficulties.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032655000437" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0002.htm#13032655000437">In
keeping with the changes we made last year to the UK Border Force, the
Government are splitting up the UK Border Agency. In its place will be
an immigration and visa service, and an immigration law enforcement
organisation. By creating two entities instead of one, we will be able
to create distinct cultures. The first will be a high-volume service
that makes high-quality decisions about who comes here, with a culture
of customer satisfaction for business men and visitors who want to come
here legally. The second will be an organisation that has law
enforcement at its heart and gets tough on those who break our
immigration
laws.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032655000438" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0002.htm#13032655000438">Two
smaller entities will also mean greater transparency and
accountability, and that brings me to the second change I intend to
make. UKBA was given agency status in order to keep its work at an
arm’s length from 
<?notus-xml column=1501?>Ministers—that was wrong. It created a closed, secretive and
defensive culture. So I can tell the House that the new entities will
not have agency status and will sit in the Home Office, reporting to
Ministers. In making these changes it is important that we do not
create new silos. That is why we are creating a strategic oversight
board for all the constituent parts of the immigration
system—immigration policy, the UK Passport Service, the UK
Border Force and the two new entities we are creating. That oversight
board will be chaired by the Home Office permanent secretary.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13032655000439" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0002.htm#13032655000439">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T14:07:43"></hs_TimeCode>
will also work to make sure that each of the organisations in the
immigration system shares services, including IT, because the third of
the agency’s problems is its IT. UKBA’s IT systems are
often incompatible and are not reliable enough. They require manual
data entry instead of automated data collection, and they often involve
paper files instead of modem electronic case management. So I have
asked the permanent secretary and Home Office board to produce a new
plan, building on the work done by Rob Whiteman, UKBA’s chief
executive, to modernise IT across the whole immigration
system.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032655000440" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0002.htm#13032655000440">The
final problem I raised is the policy and legal framework within which
UKBA has operated. The agency is often caught up in a vicious cycle of
complex law and poor enforcement of its own policies, which makes it
harder to remove people who are here illegally. That is why I intend to
bring forward an immigration Bill in the next Session of Parliament
that will address some of these problems. The changes I have announced
today are in keeping with the successes of this Government’s
reforms so far. We are reducing net migration and we are improving the
performance of the organisations that enforce our laws, but UKBA has
been a troubled organisation for so many years. It has poor IT systems,
and it operates within a complicated legal framework that often works
against it. All those things mean that it will take many years to clear
the backlogs and fix the system, but I believe the changes I have
announced today will put us in a much stronger position to do so. I
commend this statement to the
House.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13032655001269" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0002.htm#13032655001269">2.9

visa delays have got worse and 50% fewer people are being refused entry
at ports and borders. She says that the number of illegal immigrants
removed does not keep up with the number who are here legally, but that
is because she is letting

split UKBA once: just 12 months ago she split it into the Border Agency
and the Border Force and made a lot of promises. The Minister for
Immigration would like us to believe that it has all gone hunky dory
and that things are much better since then, but what has happened since
last year’s split? Queues at the borders went up and the Border

not had an apology for Labour’s mass uncontrolled immigration,
and we have had no apology today for the state in which the previous
Labour Government created and then left the Border Agency.</hs_Para>

am sure that everyone in the House would agree, but how does the shadow
Home Secretary propose to get there? We need, she said, a
“taskforce”. So, that is it. That is how the Opposition
think that we will get control of our immigration system:
the classic new Labour solution of a taskforce.</hs_Para>

all the comments the right hon. Lady made, let us remember who we have
to thank for the structure that is being dealt with today. The plans to
create UKBA were set out in a paper published by the Cabinet Office in
November 2007. Who was the Minister for the Cabinet Office at the time?
None other than her boss, the Leader of the Opposition.</hs_Para>

right hon. Lady cited a number of figures and raised a range
of issues. She referred to the fact that, to use her terms, two thirds
of visas were not processed on time. I have news for her: more than 90%
of visas are processed within the performance target time. She referred
to clearing up the backlogs, which originated with the
Government of whom she was a member. I will respond to the point,
nevertheless. The structural changes that we are making today will make
for better-run organisations with greater clarity and greater focus,
with more transparency, more accountability and stronger management.
That, as we have seen with the Border Force, will deliver better
performance; but it is not the only answer, which is why I have also
referred to the need for us to change the law, deal with the IT systems
and improve the processes in the organisation. It will take
time, but today’s announcements are an important
start.</hs_Para>

right hon. Lady made a number of references to the Border Force and its
performance. Until I took the Border Force out of UKBA last year, it
was not possible to tell what its performance was. The Vine report,
published last year, showed that checks were being suspended routinely
and without permission for many years. That is no longer the case,
thanks to the changes that I made.</hs_Para>

Border Agency, but I suggest that she should have listened to my
statement. I know that the performance of the Border Agency
is not good enough. It never has been. That is why we are making the
changes that I have announced today. The question for the right hon.

right hon. Lady asked when the changes will be made. The agency status
will be removed at the beginning of April, and I shall return to the
House with a further statement on the detail of the structural changes
in due course. She said that there had been no reference until today to
the possibility of changes to UKBA, but that is not right. If she had
paid attention during Home Office questions yesterday, she would have
heard my hon.

right hon. Lady suggested that I have made this statement only in
response to the report from the Home Affairs Committee that was
published yesterday, but the decision has been taken after many hours
of serious work over many months. If I restructured UKBA every time the
Select Committee criticised it, I would have restructured it on more
than one occasion. [<SmallCaps>Hon. Members:</SmallCaps>

must remember why the Border Agency got into this situation. After the
mess that the previous Government made of the immigration system, John
Reid turned up at the Home Office, called the immigration system not
fit for purpose and, instead of fixing it, turned it into an agency at
arm’s length to keep all the trouble away from Ministers. That
was a soundbite with no substance; but under the right hon. Lady, the
Labour party is regressing, as she does not even have a soundbite. The
Government have a very clear plan to get net migration down to the tens
of thousands and to sort out the enforcement of our immigration laws.
The Opposition have nothing. She is not serious; they are not serious;
and the British people know that they cannot trust Labour with
immigration.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032655000460" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0002.htm#13032655000460"><B><Member PimsId="-1" UID="13032655001619" xid="-1" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0002.htm#13032655001619">Several

I said, the Home Affairs Committee has been assiduous in its
consideration of matters relating to UKBA over the years and has had a
consistent message about the need to deal with some of the problems. It
is obviously important that we deal with backlogs. It is also important
that we ensure that the agency makes the right decisions on an ongoing,
day-to-day basis, that those decisions are made not just appropriately
but fairly and that people are dealt with properly when they interact
with the agency. That will take some time. I think that we share an aim

Certainly, in some of the examples that he and other members

operations, real change has been brought about. The work of the vast
majority of staff in the areas of enforcement or the immigration and

We have focused on housing, health and the benefits system. We do not
propose not having the provision of education for individual children,

changes were about publicity stunts, is far from the truth. We have
been sorting out a chaotic immigration system and immigration policy
introduced by the previous Government that led to net migration in this
country reaching hundreds of thousands a year. We aim to bring it down
to tens of thousands. We have already seen net migration cut by a

excited by the number of statements and was wondering where the missing
one was. Ash dieback is the biggest tree disease to hit this country
since Dutch elm, and it has spread to 427 sites around the UK. We

it is available only on the Department for Environment, Food and Rural

publication of the plan but have not informed the House about it,
despite undertaking to present it to the House. I ask for your advice
once again, Mr Speaker, on how the House can hold the Executive to
account when they fail to deliver on what they have promised, which on
this occasion was to bring the Chalara management plan that deals with
ash dieback to the House for its consideration? Instead, it is only out

not an optimist in these matters so far as the hon. Gentleman is
concerned—he may wish to return to the matter. Whether it was a
Standing Committee of which one needed to be a member to contribute, I
do not know. If he was not a member of the Committee, I am saddened for
him. I cannot offer any compensation for him today, but knowing the
hon. Gentleman, he will return to this matter just as predictably as a

interest in this issue was rekindled last year during the
police and crime commissioner elections, particularly in my area of
north Wales. A number of candidates stood for the post, including
Labour, Conservative, UK Independence party and independent candidates.
One of the independent candidates for the post was Winston Roddick QC.
He was the successful candidate and is now operating as the police
commissioner for north Wales. May I say at this point that I wish him
well in that post and hope that he does a good job? My concerns are
solely about transparency in the

knew of Mr Roddick before he became an independent candidate. He was a
well respected senior civil servant in the Welsh Assembly and had twice
been a Liberal parliamentary candidate. He was and still is a member of
the Liberal Democrats, and yet he put himself forward under the banner
of an independent before 500,000 voters in north Wales. That point was
raised during the election, but it did not receive a high
profile—nor, dare I say it, did the election itself. He received
25,175 votes on the first ballot on a turnout of less than 15% and
36,688 votes on the second and final ballot, and was elected.</hs_Para>

by comparison, the Liberal Democrats have never received more than
18,000 votes for the north Wales region in the
four Assembly elections, which have had much bigger turnouts. Indeed,
in 2011, they got just 11,000 votes on a 40% turnout, compared with
Mr Roddick’s 25,000 votes when he stood as an
independent. I contend, therefore that not having a party label helped
his cause. The feedback afterwards included a tweet from a constituent
of mine, which
said:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13032655001234" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0002.htm#13032655001234">“I

that case, the winner has said that he will not take the whip. However,
my contention is that it is very strange and a little unnerving that a
fully paid-up party member can stand as an independent without
resigning their membership and not be open about the values that they
hold. Mr Roddick says that he was open about his candidature. In that
case, I hope that he will support the aims of the

happened in north Wales is not unique. In the police and crime
commissioner election in Devon and Cornwall, a former chairman of the
Devon and Cornwall police authority and head of the Liberal Democrat
group on the Association of Police Authorities stood as an independent.
Again, there might be good reasons for that—dare I say it, but
the public might not want to vote for a Liberal Democrat—but the
point is that the individual was a member of the Liberal Democrats.
Indeed, I checked the website today, and he is still the leader of the
Liberal Democrats on his local council, having not stood as an
independent in that

situation in the City of London corporation is the same, with most
current councillors sitting as independents, despite being members of

although some candidates stood with party labels, many stood as

could be worse. I do not think any of us would be comfortable with the

them as independents in good faith. In my own constituency in 2004, an
individual was elected as an independent, but two years later, when the

let me be clear about what the Bill does not do. It does not prevent
anyone from standing for election or from calling themselves an
independent. It does not even prevent people from standing as
independent despite being party members. It will, however, inject
transparency into the system, so that no one can ever stand again as an
independent, be in a party and not declare it. There is nothing wrong
with being an independent councillor or MP. It is not my choice, but
there is nothing wrong with it. It is deeply worrying, however, that
people can stand as independent, despite having a party membership card
in their back pocket. It presents 
<?notus-xml column=1515?>a real problem for our democracy, because the values that influence
parties might well influence the electorate, and if those values are
hidden, the electorate might vote blind on those issues.</hs_Para>

proposal would add transparency to our democracy and help ensure the
public have the information they need to make an informed choice. It
will not add undue stress or expense to the election procedure and
could be done simply, without the need for a particularly big shake-up
of electoral procedures. This small bit of information could go someway
to ensuring that voters get what they think they are voting for, rather
than for what they are actually voting for without realising it. My
proposal would add one small, but important, dimension to the system.
It would require that if someone stands as an independent, or under any
label, without declaring a party membership, action would need to be
taken. I propose that the election be declared void, the member
disqualified and a by-election called. I ask for no further penalty
than that. I simply ask that those individuals have the opportunity to
face the electorate under their true colours.</hs_Para>

believe that people should be public and proud about being members of
the Labour party, and should not hide behind the banner of
independence, if they hold a party membership. The Bill will provide
some transparency. I am sure, as I have said, that there are examples
across all parties, so I hope that this is not a party political point.
I want transparency for all members. We should be proud of our
democracy and how our elections operate. The suppression of such
information is not good for our democratic system. I hope and believe
that the House will share that view. I am pleased to have secured
cross-party support from Liberal Democrat, Conservative and Labour
Members, and I hope that nobody has anything to fear by it. I commend
the motion to the House.</hs_Para>

I seek not to divide the House, but to put down a marker that the Bill
would not have unanimous support. It would be a regulatory Bill cutting
across the tradition of independence, particularly in parish and town
councils, where people should not have to declare their party
allegiance. It is perfectly legitimate that somebody stands for
election 
<?notus-xml column=1516?>to a parish or town council on the basis that they are independent, even
if they are a member of a political

Bill implies that people who belong to political parties belong only to
one political party. I agree with the right hon. Gentleman’s
argument, which he put forward strongly, about the Liberal Democrats
being duplicitous—I have no quarrel with him on that—but
let us think of students. You, Mr Speaker, were once a student. Many of
them join three or more political parties at the freshers fare in order
to see which has the most attractive membership. That is a perfectly
legitimate objective for many people who join political parties. It
would be very confusing to the electorate if one of those students was
to declare that they were a member of four political parties. Where
would that leave the

“Flood Re” insurance scheme would create a non-profit
fund to ensure that cover is available for the 2% of homes that are at
significant risk of flooding. Like the current system, the model would
be based on cross-subsidisation. High-risk home owners would pay higher
premiums, subject to a cap, and benefit from a subsidy
levied on lower risk properties. Today that subsidy costs the average
property owner about £8 a year—that is the proportion of
the insurance premium that they pay. Under “Flood Re”
that would rise by an estimated
£1<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T15:16:25"></hs_TimeCode>. Those
owning a band A property at significant risk of flooding would see a
15% increase in their premium, rising to 43% for more expensive homes.
The point of the scheme, therefore, is to cushion the most
vulnerable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T15:16:37"></hs_TimeCode>. In
return, the insurance industry wants the Government to strengthen flood
defences, provide access to flood risk assessments and enforce planning

parameters of a balanced deal are emerging. Ministers have,

I strongly support the motion and congratulate him on securing the

companies do not have a completely free hand in this, because they are
required by state regulators to secure reinsurance on the risk that
they take on? Unless there is some Government participation to cap that

would be useful if Ministers could today explain their position on the
gist of the “Flood Re” proposal, and any concerns they
have now that the taxpayer is not 
<?notus-xml column=1522?>being asked to underwrite the overdraft facility. One key issue is the
balance of contributions by those owning properties at higher risk and
ordinary insurance holders. Have Ministers considered the composition
of the board of governors of the fund, and in particular the number and
character of members who are independent of both the Government and the
industry? How will the Government retain control and accountability
over future increases in either the levy or ordinary premiums? Both
aspects are important; it is question of
balance.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032655000925" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0002.htm#13032655000925">The
“Flood Re” scheme inevitably invites comparison with
models used elsewhere. In the United States, the national flood
insurance programme is not funded on the basis of cross-subsidisation,
but as a result was left $17 billion in the red after Hurricane
Katrina. “Flood Re” as a model would avoid a situation in
which the British taxpayer covers all losses the market will not
insure—the Dutch Government have such a commitment. The
“Flood Re” model is somewhere between the US and Dutch
models.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032655000926" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0002.htm#13032655000926">Alternative
models have been proposed but are not in the negotiating mix between
the ABI and the Government at this stage. One alternative presented by
Marsh, the insurance broker, would involve mutualisation of 50% of
flood claims among all home owners. That would pass back to home owners
or the Government the risk of paying the remaining 50% of flood claims.

alternative?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032655000927" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0002.htm#13032655000927">More
broadly, the negotiations on flood insurance shed broader light on the
UK’s wider environmental policy. The risks of flooding, which is
effectively what we are debating, prompt a simple question: have we got
our environmental priorities right? Met Office data show that four of
the five wettest years on record have occurred since 2000. The
Government’s chief scientist has warned
that</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13032655001241" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0002.htm#13032655001241">“in

flood defences should therefore be a top priority—both in its
own right as a matter of sound policy, but also to contain the rising
insurance premiums that have prompted today’s debate—and
yet environmental resilience has been relatively low down the
pecking order of UK environmental policy for more than a
decade. By way of illustration, the cost to businesses and consumers of
the inefficient green subsidies to solar and onshore wind through the
renewables obligation will be £2.6 billion this
financial year. That is almost as much as the DEFRA will
spend on flooding and coastal defences over the entire five-year period
of this Parliament. Those are skewed priorities. The
Government ought to place greater emphasis on adapting to the reality
of climate change—the environmental here and now—and
spend less time speculating on technological winners that hike energy
bills, particularly for the squeezed middle, without substantially
decarbonising the UK
economy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032655000929" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0002.htm#13032655000929">That
points to a more systemic, bureaucratic problem, namely the lack of
policy coherence between the Department of Energy and Climate Change
and DEFRA since they were separated in 2008 by the previous Government.
Too often, DEFRA feels like DECC’s more realistic but poorer
cousin, and yet DEFRA is left to pick up the pieces when an
environmental crisis strikes. Have Ministers considered re-merging the
two Departments? That would integrate policy and realise 
<?notus-xml column=1523?>at least £1 billion from cutting bureaucracy,

the deficit more

an increasing incidence of extreme weather conditions, a greater

There is no single agency responsible for actually tackling flooding

meetings when it is asked to attend, abdicating all responsibility for
what is going on. When West Lancashire was hit by flooding on several
occasions at the end of last year, I met people who had been forced out
of their homes. They were angry and upset. Who do they call when the
watercourse is overflowing on to the land, and the water is running off
the land through their back garden and down on to the highway where the
drains cannot cope with the volume? Many were passed from pillar to
post, with the message from different agencies as they asked for help
as the flood water headed towards their homes, “We can’t
do anything until your home is flooded.” That is the very point
at which it was too late to save their homes or give them meaningful
help. Local farmers were forced to stand by and watch as the flood
waters destroyed millions of pounds of food crops. They were ready,
willing and able to take the necessary action to clear the ditches and
watercourses to protect their land and to protect the crops, but
inadequate land management because of budget cuts, a lack of
communication and the need to undertake an environmental impact

my hon. Friend the Member for Esher and Walton (Mr Raab) on securing
this timely and important debate. I have 1,627 homes and businesses in
my constituency that are at significant risk of flooding. I have
visited streets in Abingdon, Kidlington and Oxford where ripped-out
carpets, kitchen units and discarded furniture were all piled up and
abandoned on pavements in 2007, and that sight is branded on my memory.
I guarantee that not a single one of those home owners has forgotten
that summer, and since then we have had any number of flood warnings
that serve, like tremors after an earthquake, to reawaken the anxiety
of that week of flooding and the reconstruction that followed. It cost
the county £3 million and the country £3
billion.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032655000944" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0002.htm#13032655000944">For
those who live at flood risk, there is no respite. Instead, they live
in a constant state of uncertainty, never knowing what our delightful
British climate will bring. Uncertainty driven by weather is one thing,
but uncertainty that is driven by our response to flood risk is
another. Other than by inventing a weather machine we are not going to
eliminate flood risk, but we have 
<?notus-xml column=1525?>three, interdependent levers to mitigate flood risk and limit the stress
that it brings. Those are flood insurance, flood defences and
individual property and community resilience.</hs_Para>

people are rampant climate sceptics or paid-up members of the Green

overloaded infrastructure, such as drainage capacity, is leaving
increasing numbers of constituents at the mercy of not only notoriously
hard-to- respond-to surface water, but revolting episodes of effluent
flooding. I am aghast that in this day and age I have constituents who
have to cope with sewage coming into their homes simply because it is

continues to be widely available and affordable, a point I will come to
in a moment. Although there is frustration about the responsibility of
different agencies working together to respond to constituents, the

dramatically, and there have been positive developments on flood

none of that addresses the long-term strategic challenges we face, and
insurance has to be at the top of that list. That is why, with all the
other urgent flooding priorities that we have heard about, we have to
focus on the 30 June deadline. That date dominates the lives of far too
many of my constituents. They fear that they will suddenly become
uninsurable, breach their mortgage conditions and have unsellable
properties. While I appreciate that negotiations with the Association

negotiations by giving a running commentary on them. That is not

all would have been forgiven, but people need to know now how to
protect themselves. Ministers have been clear about their priorities,
which are to ensure that flood insurance remains widely available,
affordable and fiscally sustainable. Nobody is going to argue with any

therefore ask the Minister the following questions. On the stroke of
midnight on 30 June, will we have a free market or will we have some
kind of interim extension of the statement of principles? If it is the
latter, have there been any discussions about what form it will take?
If the Government are going to let the free market emerge in the

what kind of regulation, and how and when?

Re”, the current cross-subsidy is £8. Yesterday the ABI

would have to be formalised as a tax. However, the National Flood Forum

Government made of the levy and what mechanism would they need to
regulate it? Finally, what measures are being considered to incentivise
flood defence investment on a personal, local and national level? That

of State for Environment, 
<?notus-xml column=1527?>Food and Rural Affairs what was happening, I was told on the Floor of
the House that an agreement was close, that it would be a much better
deal, that premiums would be affordable and that there would be no
unaffordable excesses either, so I was quite optimistic. That was last
summer. Since then I have written to the new Secretary of State and

understanding is that the Treasury is now stopping any agreement being
reached. I understand that the Treasury has to look carefully at
whatever public money has to be set aside or underwritten for any
scheme, but time is running out. This is about people’s lives.
People in Hull who were flooded in 2007 feel upset that they

difficult to get flood insurance over the last few years. Premiums have
gone up considerably and excesses are now very high. I say to the

able to get mortgages or sell their homes. I feel strongly that the

cannot think of many things worse than coming home and finding

As hon. Members know who have experienced this issue from their

sewage. It is devastating to have that in the house. However, one thing
that is worse is for that to happen three years after the last time, as
was the case in Stonehaven in my constituency. The safety net of
insurance is one of the long-term securities to which people look to
recover from the situation. Obviously we thank the emergency services
for all they did and could do on the night to rescue people and
mitigate the situation. Indeed, I want to place on record the
resilience of the local community in Stonehaven, which rallied round.
It was the weekend before Christmas and people were
turning up with 
<?notus-xml column=1528?>replacement food for Christmas lunches and
replacement gifts for those that the children had lost in the floods.
In that sense, it was great to see the community spirit, but the

hon. Members have mentioned, the issue is going to be of wider

the warming of the atmosphere and its ability to hold more moisture,
making more rain-intensive events. It is thus in our collective
interest to come up with a solution that deals with flooding, as it is
going to be a wider risk, which needs to be
shared<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T15:40:13"></hs_TimeCode>. Planning

insurance companies have become more sophisticated with their computers

where it will strike next seems to provide an important way forward.

problem has been described as immense, but the pooling system—an
important component of insurance—will be an integral part of any

system has been proposed under the “Flood Re” model and
the Morpeth model. That system formalises the existing cross-subsidy.
It redistributes the risk to keep affordability in place for high-risk
properties. It represents the only fair way forward in a changing
situation where climate change is giving rise to an increasing number
of extreme weather events. The ABI model, the “Flood Re”
system and the Morpeth system combine availability with affordability.
The “Flood Mu”, or Noah model, does not guarantee that
because it does not put a cap on flood

Gilbert:</Member></B> My hon. Friend pre-empts the point I was about to
make, and which I have made before. We need to review the Bellwin
scheme in order to take account of different types of local authority
structure, whether single-tier, such as Cornwall’s unitary
council, which I believe gives Cornwall a stronger voice overall, or
two-tier, such as Devon, with its district council and county council,
which has a lower threshold for activating Government support. In
Cornwall’s case, the threshold is £1.4 million of
expenditure, which needs to be defrayed before the Bellwin scheme
provides any central Government support. If that threshold is not met,
the whole bill must be picked up by the local authority. Even if it is
met, the local authority will still have to pick up 15% of the
additional
total.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032655001010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0003.htm#13032655001010">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:07:25"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T14:49:59"></hs_TimeCode>
are very strange rules relating to different types of expenditure.
Although the immediate response to incidents—the £181,000
for the fire and rescue service and the cost of advice to residents and
of housing support, for example—might fall within the Bellwin
scheme if the threshold is crossed, the repairs to highways and other
capital expenditure to put right what the flood damage put wrong are
not covered. I say to the Minister that as well as ensuring that flood
insurance for homes and businesses remains affordable and available,
and recognising that we are all in it together, local authorities need
to know that the Government stand behind them,
too<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:08:03"></hs_TimeCode>. With
climate change happening, it is clear that flooding will continue, but

Evans</B> (Cardiff North) (Con):</Member> I begin by drawing attention
to my entry in the Register of Members’ Financial Interests and
to my chairmanship of the all-party group on insurance and financial
services. It is in that context that I think it is helpful to share
with the House some of the observations that have been made by the

to nowhere”.</hs_Para>

is astounding that it was in 2008 that the insurance industry made it
clear that it would be withdrawing from the statement of principles.
May I make it absolutely clear that it is important that it should do
so, because many of the individual cases that Members have drawn
attention to here are not covered by the statement of principles? They
are not in this jeopardy because of the expiry of the statement of
principles; the statement of principles does not have an “all
circumstances” provision. That is why it is necessary to address
the matter.</hs_Para>

It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:14:38"></hs_TimeCode> is not as

resort is, in fact, the Government. They took on that role
in relation to “Pool Re”, when we needed to create
terrorism insurance, and it was done in a matter of weeks. The
Lloyds-Equitas debacle, which I had ministerial responsibility for
resolving, was resolved within 12 months. Following 9/11, no insurance
was available to the aviation industry in this country, and 
<?notus-xml column=1536?>that matter was resolved by Government within a matter of days. Yet here
we are, years and years later, with no progress to announce.</hs_Para>

these issues. People have attended from the Association of British
Insurers, on every occasion, from the British Insurance Brokers
Association, on every occasion, and from the National Flood Forum.
People from Aon, from Guy Carpenter and from Marsh have outlined the
range of proposals that they have been making to Government. In an
all-party group meeting on 12 October, Aon raised for the first time a
variation on the “Flood Re” proposal, but we do not know
what the Government’s response has been. In November, there was
a bit of a spat when the ABI thought that the Government were not going
to make any contribution. In response, it was claimed that it was
nonsense to say that there was an impasse. Yet here we are, approaching

do not blame the Minister. He attended a flood summit back in 2010, and
he absolutely understands all the issues. However, I wonder to what
extent his hands are tied elsewhere, perhaps not so much by the change
in Secretary of State but by the involvement of the Cabinet Office in
some aspects of these discussions. It is said that the
Government may have been spooked by the original discussions, which had
been going constructively, when they looked at the overall cost of
flooding. However, that is not good enough. We have heard it suggested
that there could be an extension of the statement of principles, but
that is a voluntary agreement with the industry, and it is not going to
happen; we can rule it out. The reality is that we will either see a
return to the free market or the Government will have to get their act

agree with many of the points that have been made, and I will not go
over them again. I wish to touch on two additional issues that add
insult to injury. The first of these is planning. Planning applications
are approved even when the new build is on a serious flood plain. 
<?notus-xml column=1537?>An applicant for a dementia care home in my constituency
attempted to placate the planning committee by saying—I kid you
not—that because the building was high-rise, if there were a
flood the residents would be able to get to high ground. The
application was approved. The advice of local planning committees and
the Environment Agency is often ignored, or their decisions
overturned.</hs_Para>

hope that there could be an incentive for a slightly more responsible
stance on these issues. There is a gap in the market for an
“Environment Agency Says No” website, so that whether it
is a house or a care home place being purchased, the consumer would be

so that people can access insurance irrespective of whether they have
been flooded several times. It is not their fault that they live in a

the village of Feniton, there have been appeal decisions allowing more
houses to be built where the appeal inspector has actually recognised
in his brief that the village will flood and might flood further as a
result of the development, but has allowed the houses anyway because
the district council has not got its five-year housing plan up to
speed. That means that the poor people down the bottom of Feniton will
get flooded even more. What is the logic of that? This must be not only
about flood insurance but about a planning policy that says we do not
build on flood plains or on hills above villages so that the water runs
off and floods the people at the bottom end of the village even more.

want to see in the proposal what the word “affordable”

if an agreement could be reached, it would require primary legislation.
The Minister should admit what we now know to be true—that this
will not be in place for 30 June. The 570,000 properties to which this
motion applies and the 570,000 families that could find their homes
uninsurable, unmortgageable and unsellable are calling for certainty,
but there is

is the plan? To deny the risk and the social responsibility that any
Government bear would deny one of the most basic laws of political
gravity, which is that catastrophic risk resides with us all. When
catastrophic floods devastate streets, towns and communities,
we rightly expect the Government to be there to help us pick
up the pieces. That is what is so short-sighted about the
Government’s response to getting a deal done on flood
insurance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:31:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032655001066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0003.htm#13032655001066">As
the Minister has previously made clear, there is only one deal on the
table. The alternative is a free market that will allow insurers to
leave the market for high-risk properties and that will unwind a
long-standing settlement that flood insurance should be available as
part of every
policy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:32:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032655001067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0003.htm#13032655001067">Climate
change is making flooding more prevalent and less predictable, and the
UK climate change risk assessment cites it as the No. 1 threat that we
need to adapt to. I have made it clear that the Opposition seek to be
helpful and constructive in securing a deal that protects home owners,
businesses and communities vulnerable to the risk of flooding. Despite
our constructive approach, Ministers have refused to brief this House
or involve the Opposition in the discussions. As each week passes, it
is becoming harder to defend a situation in which Ministers appear to
be drifting without giving any indication of when a deal will be
concluded<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:32:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032655001068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0003.htm#13032655001068">This

Ministers have repeatedly made clear, the main aim of our work has

flood risk will always be the best and most sustainable solution.
Despite difficult times, we are on track to spend more than £2.3
billion to deliver better protection from flooding and coastal erosion
to more than 165,000 homes over the four years to 2015. Our new system

on top of that from external partners. Many hon. Members, including

year being the second wettest on record, more than 200,000 homes were
protected from flooding because of defences already in place. The
Environment Agency’s flood warning service provided additional
support; evidence is emerging that many houses avoid flooding because
of the better flood warning system. We have estimated that, for every
property that suffered flooding last year and in January, more than 25
homes were protected because of flood defences and maintenance work and
because of the work of the Environment Agency, local authorities and
other front-line responders. More than 200,000 householders are
therefore benefitting from the Government’s continued investment

hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff North (Jonathan Evans) talked about
flood insurance in the context of terrorism, but those are entirely
different types of insurance. The pool model does work for some of
them, but the “Flood Re” model would not work in this
case, because it does not provide support for the cost of that cover.
He made the point that “Flood Re” is a not-for-profit
solution. Well, yes and no, in that the Government would pay through a
levy—so householders are paying for it with an element of
underwriting—but taking away risk from the most at risk is an
advantage to the industry. So we must be very careful. The
Minister’s job is to look after the taxpayer and householder.
Yes, we need a solution, but not at any price. Whoever was standing at
the Dispatch Box, they would not want to bring before the House a deal
that was unworkable or that would cause the wrong sort of increases for
some of the most at risk and hard up of our constituents. We need to
get this
right.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032655001096" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0003.htm#13032655001096">My

Pound:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes a telling point. In doing so
she has rather stolen my thunder, but I forgive her in that as I do in
all things. The Government may well have a policy, but it is
retrogressive. The idea that the solution to the housing problem in
London is to sell off the last few remaining properties at vast,
eye-watering discounts and somehow assume that, in extremis, property
can be sold as cheaply as £10,000, and that that money will then
go forth, multiply and create a new property, is absolutely absurd.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:49:27"></hs_TimeCode>The other strand

that with hard work—exhaustive work—and a great deal of
extremely fine officer time, we can create 5,044 units from a total of
3,653. I pay tribute to my colleague Councillor Hitesh Tailor in the
London borough of Ealing, who has somehow managed to square the circle
in the case of Copley close, an absolutely typical old Greater London
council estate. Allegedly—I have never heard anyone disprove
this, but I am told it is true—the architect who designed the
estate never set 
<?notus-xml column=1549?>foot in the borough of Ealing, let alone on Copley

everyone somehow to manage to do 15 jobs and buy their own property.
One of the solutions is to do as my children, aged 24 and 22, have done
and start sending away for loft extension catalogues anonymously. They
pour through the door at an extraordinary rate—and I have
finally accepted the hint. However, one thing we really can do—I
want the Minister to give particular attention to this—is to
consider raising the housing revenue account cap, which was discussed

Infrastructure Bill. Three amendments were tabled by three

idea at present is that there are streams against which local
authorities can borrow, and not just the traditional ones, such as the
Public Works Loan Board or the general fund. Some people have rather
imaginatively —and in a way that is almost suggestive of Robert
Maxwell in his prime—talked about borrowing against pension
funds. That slightly worries me, but the housing revenue account, which
has traditionally been massively in surplus, despite what some would
have us believe, is a good thing to borrow against. The recent
relaxations in this area are to the Government’s credit. Let us
be honest: the Government have done the right thing on that. However,
the present cap limits local authorities massively. They include not
just boroughs such as Kensington and Chelsea, Westminster, and
Hammersmith and Fulham, which have a property portfolio worth well over
£2 billion, but even small, modest boroughs such as Ealing,
which could borrow more and build more.</hs_Para>

someone loses their home, they lose everything. A person can lose their
job and get another job; they can lose their health and get healthy
again. Without a home, a person has nothing. Every single one of us in
this House has a bounden duty to try to provide that simple, most basic
of needs: accommodation. Raising the HRA cap to a more realistic level

Bingham</B> (High Peak) (Con):</Member> Carbon monoxide poisoning can
be fatal or lead to permanent health damage. Carbon monoxide is
tasteless, odourless and colourless. It is very much a silent killer.
It makes no distinction among its victims—however, the young and
the elderly are more vulnerable, as in many other cases—and it
creates risks for pregnant women and their unborn children. The
symptoms include headaches, tiredness, dizziness and nausea. These are
common symptoms, often associated with other things; therefore, carbon

<?notus-xml column=1550?>However, the report deals only with the gas industry and gas-related
incidents. Carbon monoxide poisoning is not solely a gas appliance
issue. Carbon monoxide can emanate from many sources. It is caused when
carbon fuels do not burn properly, so although there is a perception
that the problem is restricted to gas fires in the home, it can go much
wider than that. Any fuel-burning appliance that is not properly
maintained has the potential to be a source of carbon monoxide.
Cookers, AGAs and hot water heaters can all emit carbon
monoxide.</hs_Para>

goes, I hope people will turn their thoughts to the summertime pursuits
I have listed. As we sit outside a tent, caravan or motor home watching
the sun go down in the summer, there is naturally a feeling of
contentment, and possibly a barbecue shimmering in front of us, but we
should be aware that this smouldering barbecue could be putting out
carbon monoxide. Portable barbecues and portable heaters can and have

claimed victims in the summer months, too. As summer approaches, I want
to highlight the dangers of this gas—not just in the home, not
just in the winter, but all year round and seemingly in some innocuous
conditions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032655001124" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0003.htm#13032655001124">Returning
to the issue of carbon monoxide in the home, the Minister may well ask

short, the Government believe that if all empty office space in the UK
were converted into residential property, it would create 250,000 new
homes, saving nearly £140 million in planning system costs. The
Government tell us that, following the recession, between 7% and 9% of
commercial space in the UK is empty, but that many developers have been
put off converting buildings into homes because of the costs and time
required to secure planning approval. That may be true in some parts of
the world, but in my Hackney South constituency and particularly in
Shoreditch, many developers have landbanked old offices and warehouses
to cash in on rising housing prices as housing demand increases. They
have been sitting on this for investment reasons rather than because
they have been put off by the conversion costs. The conversion costs
could soon be recouped, but every day that the developers sit and wait,
the price of housing goes

Hackney, the legislation will have a major impact on our business and
creative communities and on the local economy. We sit right on the edge
or fringe of the City. In fact, Broadgate used to be in Hackney until a
boundary change some years ago, and many of our business locations will
be adversely affected by this policy. The area is coveted as a
residential location, but not for local people. It has fancy loft
apartments for those with very deep pockets. This will put business at
risk, potentially leading to forced relocation and loss of jobs for
local people in an area where unemployment is already high. Of course,
all of us speaking in this debate are keen to see more homes built, but
this policy will encourage landlords and freeholders to dash for the
short-term gain of changing offices to residential homes, at a big
long-term cost to our area and to one of the engine rooms of our
current economy.</hs_Para>

from the proposal. Without an exemption, existing businesses will be
under threat, too, so I strongly support full exemption for Hackney,

will be counted as under-occupying and be forced either to find the
extra money to pay for the bedroom, until their children reach the age
at which they qualify for the extra bedroom, or to give up their home

Hillier:</Member></B> Of course, and as I mentioned earlier, this is a
big issue, but that is to do mostly with the supply of housing and
there are other ways to incentivise people to move out of their homes,
rather than taxing them. Over the years, there have been schemes to
provide money to help, for example, pensioner households with their
removal costs and the costs of new furnishings for their new
home to encourage them to move at a small price to free up the larger
properties that are desperately needed. In my constituency, where about
a quarter of residents are under 16, we need affordable family homes to
be supplied. We also need reform of the private rented sector, which in
this short speech I do not have time to go into, but the Government
abolished the register of private landlords and are doing nothing to
tackle the issue. “Generation rent” in my constituency is
among the biggest in the

tax is an invidious policy. It will not free up rooms in the way the
hon. Member for Central Devon (Mel Stride) expects. Up and down the
country, people are being forced to move from their larger homes,
although smaller homes are not available in their area, and they are
being penalised if they cannot move. It is illogical. The policy
provides a good cheap headline for the Government, but it will not
deliver and it is having a negative impact on families’ lives.
There are better ways to tackle the housing issue. Cross-party, we
should look at supporting an increase in supply and ensuring
that there are no loopholes in any schemes. In the Budget, the
Chancellor talked about the mortgage guarantee, which will enable
people to buy second homes. The Government have still not come up with
a comprehensive rejection of that approach, so we can only take that as
an assurance that people can buy a second home with a mortgage
guarantee from the Government, while many of my constituents will
continue to struggle to get on the housing ladder, or into a form of
tenure that provides them and their families with security and the
strong base in the community that we all want to
see.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13032655001291" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0003.htm#13032655001291">5.5

am raising an issue brought to me by a constituent who has serious
concerns about the way in which gas safety certificates are dispensed.
She recently bought a bungalow, and was supplied by the previous owner
with building regulation compliance certificates, including gas and
electricity safety check certificates. Having got those certificates,
she trusted, as anyone would, that all the work and inspections had
been carried out to the required standard, as did her conveyancing
solicitor and
surveyor.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032655001141" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0003.htm#13032655001141">It
later emerged that all the traders and engineers who had issued those
certificates were personal friends of the previous owner, and it
appears that the certificates were issued without them either checking
that the work had been carried out or that it was up to the correct
standard. Electrical and gas appliance installations such as the
under-floor heating, boiler and heating system had been blindly
certified by Gas Safe and ELECSA-registered engineers as a favour to a
mate. There have been some consequences, such as de-registering the
ELECSA trader, but the main concerns remain. The Electrical
Contractors’ Association has accepted that its engineer was very
wrong to issue a certificate for work he had neither carried out nor
inspected for safety. However, it appears Gas Safe has been reluctant
to take the same
approach.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032655001142" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0003.htm#13032655001142">I
by no means pretend to be an expert in the field of building
regulations and appliance safety, but I do find it incredibly odd that
although gas and electrical engineers can be struck off the register if
they negligently leave an appliance unsafe, the same does not apply to
those who issue certificates without doing or inspecting the work.
There really does appear to be not simply a loophole but a gap in the
legislation that endangers lives. My constituent sustained an injury as
a result of the faulty appliances, and informed me that it was pure
luck that the later inspecting engineer, who condemned the appliance,
was not electrocuted.</hs_Para>

London county council in the inter-war years that did a great deal to
build decent homes for people who were living in appalling slums.
Indeed, in my constituency and others one can see the products of the

the Mayor of London does not fully grasp, but one of them is the
essential need for the building of new council houses. The number of
social rented properties—that is, council or housing association
properties—built under his watch and by his means has reduced

how much lower than that the numbers will go in future years. We must
kindly ask central Government to get a grip of the situation and do
their best to intervene with the Mayor and with borough councils to
ensure that there is a rapid increase in the supply of council housing

country parks and open spaces. Decades on, we have succeeded, with new
country parks to the south, west and east and the regeneration of our
traditional parks and green-belt open spaces. That has been a
tremendous community achievement. I have set up friends groups for each
park and worked with organisations such as the London wildlife trust, A

of our greatest achievements is the creation of the award-winning Lake

this month, Natural England declared Ministry of Defence land at Lodge
Hill in my constituency to be a site of special scientific interest. In
numerous plans over 18 years, the site has been clearly designated for
5,000 homes and for employment opportunities for 5,000 people. A total
of £35.5 million has been spent to get to the point of planning
consent being granted. After all this time and money, the council is
concerned, to put it mildly, to be thwarted at the last hurdle by
Natural England, which does not consider the economic impacts. The

nightingales and homes for 12,000 people and jobs for a further 5,000

will be reviewed by the full board of Natural England, but we do not
know if that will be anything more than a rubber-stamping exercise. I
would appreciate the Minister’s views on whether it will be a
genuine exercise and whether the board will really consider the wider
representations or the Government’s policy. If it is not able to
consider Government policy, how can democratic Ministers have their way
when competing in what they call the global race? When councils such as

flexibility that the Government have provided to authorities to
undertake prudential borrowing. I reassure him that within the cap for
the 29 stock-holding authorities in London, there is £1.4

housing. Many councils of all stripes are seeking to do so. I disagree
with his idea that rent control would be nirvana for his constituents
and for those who have to manage the housing benefit bill. The last
time that we had rent control, there was a collapse in the private
rented sector because investors were unwilling to invest in it. Our
approach is very different. We are investing in the private rented
sector through a generous scheme of guarantees that has been
over-subscribed and to which the Chancellor committed more money in his

He will

framework is clear about the protections for the green belt: there can
only be development on the green belt in very special circumstances, so
planning authorities would have to meet quite a tough test in law, if
they wished to approve such a proposal. That has to be balanced,
however, against the equally explicit commitment that great weight be
given to the need to create and expand schools. I cannot prejudge how
that will be arrived at in that case, but he has made an eloquent and

such a major scheme should be put at risk by a declaration that the
site is to be viewed as a site of special scientific interest. I cannot
comment on the merits of the decision or the scheme, but I can reassure
him of two things. First, notification of a site as an SSSI does not
necessarily mean that it cannot be developed, but it does mean that the
developer must make advanced efforts to mitigate, or, if they cannot do
that entirely, to compensate for any impact on the site.

want to raise two issues, one local and the other national. The first
relates to a constituent of mine, Mrs Brenda Pressdee, a

is unclear how Mrs Pressdee came into contact with Dream Money Ltd. It
brokered an agreement and she had to pay £3,000 in fees because
she signed a loan agreement for a second charge on her property of
£36,000. Once the brokerage fee and all the fees for lawyers,
solicitors and title insurance had been paid, the total charges and
interest came to £32,995, which is 99.9% of the £33,000
Mrs Pressdee had initially requested. By December 2012, with interest
and charges and charges associated with arrears, Mrs Pressdee’s
total debt was £51,713.74. She is unable to keep up her payments

many years fighting for free elections, in 2008 Anni Nasheed was
elected as President of that small country. Last year, a few weeks
after I went out there to help his party prepare for the upcoming
elections, he was ousted in an appalling coup. The country is now in a
critical state. The free and fair elections that should happen later

That followed a completely ludicrous allegation. It was alleged that
the 15-year-old had given birth and that her step-father had murdered
the baby and buried her. The step-father was accused of molesting the
15-year-old, and the victim’s mother has been accused of
concealing a crime and failing to report the molestation. We will only
get changes in the Maldives if there is public awareness of what is
going on. Similar things are happening in many countries across the

consistently that Cornwall should not go down the route of incinerating
its municipal waste. I have said consistently that St Dennis
is the wrong place for an incinerator and that incineration is the
wrong solution and technology. I have argued for several years that
cheaper, cleaner and greener alternatives are available to local
authorities, yet in Cornwall and in other local authorities across the
country we see a determination to continue to pursue this
one-size-fits-all solution and off-the-shelf easy win to deal with
municipal waste when alternatives are available. Yes, they might
require a little extra effort, but in the long run they can deliver
huge savings in carbon emissions and money. Road movements would be
reduced as less waste is ferried around, and that would be better for
our country and our

consultancy, Eunomia, which has previously advised Cornwall council,
looked recently at the council’s plans and decided that savings

potentially £320 million of savings can be delivered to
taxpayers in Cornwall if the council revisits its waste strategy. It
makes the point that the contract is outdated and not fit for purpose,
that it no longer fits the overall policy context of either the UK
Government or our European counterparts, that the PFI credits are poor
value for money, and that with some simple changes Cornwall can find a
different solution that better meets its

currently recycles just 37% of its waste and has no real plans to
improve that rate. Recycling rates cannot be improved while trying to
feed an incinerator that is ever-hungry for material to burn. The best
local authorities now recycle more than 60%, and recycling alone could
deliver £12 million-worth of savings a year to the council.
Indeed, if we went as far as Surrey county council, which is hitting a
70% target, there is potential for still more significant savings.
Eunomia reports that the PFI contract that Cornwall council agreed with
the previous Government is outdated and not fit for purpose, and that
savings can be made there

Marlborough and Vaughan schools—both excellent schools in my
constituency—are in urgent need of rebuilding. They were built
in the 1960s as temporary schools. They have problems with asbestos and
other serious defects. Given Harrow’s growing population of
young families, both schools also need to expand to become three-form
entry schools. The council wrote to the chief executive of the
Education Funding Agency last July to propose a financial agreement
involving funding provided through the priority school building
programme and Harrow’s share of the basic needs allocation. I
hope that the Deputy Leader of the House will use his influence, at the
very least to speed up a response to Harrow council’s letter to
the EFA—one containing, I trust, positive news.</hs_Para>

I hope that the Competition Commission will investigate the funding of
premiership rugby teams. Together with the Rugby Football Union,
Premiership Rugby is the body that distributes funding to
England’s top rugby clubs. It does so on an uneven and unfair
basis. I understand that London Welsh rugby club received some
£1.4 million from Premiership Rugby to help to fund
players’ salaries, while other premiership clubs—notably
the so-called founder clubs, such as Sale, Bath, Leicester and
Gloucester—receive some £3.5 million a season.
Indeed, figures I have seen for January suggest that Worcester, London
Irish and Sale all received about three times the funding that London
Welsh received. Given that they are London Welsh’s rivals for
the relegation place, this hardly suggests that a fair contest is being
played out. Indeed,
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T18:07:24"></hs_TimeCode>bizarrely,
recently relegated Newcastle also appears to have received three times
more funding in January than London Welsh, while Bristol and Leeds,
which were relegated some time ago, received almost double the funding
that London Welsh received in January.</hs_Para>

short, there is a clear bias in how funding is distributed against
teams promoted to the premiership. The funding arrangements have all
the appearance of a cartel. They make it extremely difficult for newly
promoted teams to survive or thrive. To their credit, Exeter and
Worcester have done so, but the vast majority of promoted clubs
struggle to survive beyond a season or two. I have therefore written to
the Office of Fair Trading today asking it to request an investigation
by the Competition Commission into the funding of rugby clubs. I hope 
<?notus-xml column=1571?>that the Deputy Leader of the House will speak to the Department for
Culture, Media and Sport and the Department for Business, Innovation
and Skills and encourage them to use their influence to support such an
investigation.</hs_Para>

is, too, the fiasco of the five points deducted for messing up the
registration paperwork of the London Welsh scrum half, Tyson Keats,
even though no one disputes his entitlement to seek employment in the
UK, his eligibility to seek work as a professional rugby player or
indeed—should the call come—his eligibility to play for
England. I very much regret today’s decision to turn down London
Welsh’s appeal against this grim five-point deduction. Quite why
the crime is so severe that it should merit such a huge penalty, when
other clubs making similar mistakes have not been hit so hard, is
frankly difficult to fathom. Exeter fielded an extra overseas player in
one of its matches last season and was hit with only a two-point fine.
Leicester fielded Manu Tuilagi some seasons ago, despite his
effectively being an illegal immigrant. The club was not penalised any
points at all. One would think there would be some expectation by the
RFU that Leicester would have checked his status; instead, the RFU
rallied round to help him to get his status resolved.</hs_Para>

premiership should surely be a genuine competition in which clubs
battle it out on a level playing field. At the moment, sadly, a newly
promoted team first has to climb a mountain to get to the playing field
and is then expected to play with one hand tied behind its back. It is
time that the funding of premiership rugby clubs became much more
transparent and that newly promoted teams received appropriate
funding<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T18:10:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-26?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_26_PT_1/BB03C2BA165BB0C3CEB2F64826F5C343D26381D1" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="26 March 2013">Tuesday

House will be well aware that Essex is a county of entrepreneurs, as
there are many successful small businesses. That is why the first item
on my list is Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, which continues
to act as a barrier to businesses and many small firms in my
constituency. To put this into some kind of context, HMRC has spent
over 10 years relentlessly pursuing and seeking to punish my
constituent, Mr Philip Wright. His case relates to a complex issue
surrounding tax paid in the construction industry. Despite Mr Wright
losing his business, being unwell and being of very limited means and
having previously won an initial court hearing, HMRC continues to drag
this case on, persecuting my constituent.
HMRC<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T18:11:08"></hs_TimeCode> has made
many errors, yet it seems to be determined to secure a

easy targets, while letting larger firms off the hook. It also shows

HMRC did the right thing. I urge the Government, and particularly the
Treasury Minister responsible for HMRC, to leave Mr Wright in peace.

another example of bureaucracy not understanding how businesses operate

week’s Budget has been positively welcomed by business, which is
why I urge Ministers and the Government to press local councils to
unleash local businesses from business rates and to tell local

Clark, is an outstanding local entrepreneur who converted a redundant
out-house building into a cookery school, creating two full-time jobs.
He has taken a risk to set up that business and has a great “can
do” attitude—the type of attitude that this country needs
to grow into a more prosperous future. He should be congratulated on
what he is doing; instead, of course, he faces a £6,000 bill for
his rates. I hope that the Government will urge local councils to use
their powers over business rates to foster a competitive spirit of
business enterprise in this environment. That would help start-ups and

of the problems that I have highlighted demonstrate that the public
sector needs to have a greater understanding and appreciation of the
private sector. If those public bodies engaged more constructively with
the private sector, they would enhance their own understanding. A great
example of that happened in Witham town, when Essex county council
listened to a body called Witham Industrial Watch, whose business
members monitor criminal activity on our industrial sites. The county
council was on the verge of taking away the street lighting on the
industrial estate, but Witham Industrial Watch made a persuasive case
to the council. I pay tribute to the council and to the cabinet member

Witham Industrial Watch to get the right

Enough Food For Everyone If, which will have lobbied most hon. Members

school. For those children, there is no Easter, Christmas or holiday.
There are none of the basic comforts that we wish for our own children.

British corporations and companies, some of them well known, are not

Yesterday, I had a brief moment with you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to allude
to some of the child poverty in my constituency, which has the second
highest child poverty and the second highest child mortality in the
entire country. I know that I will not melt the hearts of the
Government on that point, so I want to raise a practical point with
them that, even in their own terms, is an anomaly. More than 10,000
children in Bradford are not receiving free school meals but are
officially under the poverty line. The reason is that their parents are
working and receiving working families tax credit. They are officially
poor, officially below the poverty line, but cannot get free school

House will know that in October 2011, I led a debate in Westminster
Hall on Tourette’s syndrome, an inherited neurological condition
that affects children from the age of six or seven. Many of those
children are not well educated because they struggle to keep their tics
under control and end up being excluded and in the criminal justice

foodstuffs with folic acid, particularly for women of child-bearing

have not eliminated the dreadful, tragic conditions of hydrocephalus
and spina bifida, they have reduced their incidence. It is
my great good fortune to represent the city of Peterborough, in which
the Shine charity, formerly the Association for Spina Bifida and
Hydrocephalus, is based. It gives help, support and guidance to
children affected by spina bifida and their parents. I remain hopeful
that the Government will work with the Food Standards Agency—the
Department of Health will work with others—to do the right thing
and fortify foodstuffs such as bread and flour with folic acid to
prevent these terrible conditions.</hs_Para>

a centre of excellence for English choral music to celebrate 900 years
of a Christian settlement on the banks of the River Nene—an

very

generation. In some cases, three generations of families have been
involved in the plant. It was a sad and emotional day when we saw those
grown men in their hard hats having soft hearts about the closure of
such an important part of East Lothian’s history, which has made
such a great contribution to its economy. For many, including me, as I

have been no compulsory redundancies. Many employees are moving to
other stations, while others have opted for retirement or severance
voluntarily. Having said that, this was still a tough day for East

planning permission for the plant’s conversion to gas.
Fortunately, that decision was overturned by Scottish Ministers, who
are also from the SNP—indecision is not limited to those on the
Government Benches. Thankfully, we have a new administration in East
Lothian council, a Labour-Conservative coalition—that is how
democracy can be at times. It results from the single transferable

executive officer, Mr Galan, said that ScottishPower would increase its
planned UK spend of £10 billion by £3 billion to build
new gas-fired power stations, but uncertainty caused by market
conditions and a lack of clarity from the UK Government was holding
back that further investment. Some of that money could be used to
refurbish the station at Cockenzie, creating 1,000 construction jobs in
my constituency in the process and with further knock-on benefits to
the local economy. When completed, it would be a welcome source of
skilled jobs and apprenticeships for young people in my constituency. I
urge the Deputy Leader of the House to take that message back to the

investment in the UK and in my constituency to create jobs and to keep

Graham</B> (Gloucester) (Con):</Member> Not long ago, a Slovak
national, Mr Peter Pavlisin, badly beat up his pregnant Gloucester
girlfriend, Natasha Motala, threatened her with death and had to be
subdued by several policemen. He was sentenced to four years in prison
in the Gloucester Crown court and the judge revealed during sentencing
that during Mr Pavlisin’s four years in the UK he had been
convicted of 14 offences from 21 charges. When I read that in our local
paper, <I>The Citizen</I>, my immediate reaction was relief for my
constituent Natasha, who had given birth safely, and for my other
constituents, as the criminal would be off the streets of Gloucester.
There was something missing, however. Where was the instruction to the
courts to deport the prisoner at the end of his sentence?</hs_Para>

rang the judge and he explained that judges have the authority to
deport non-EU nationals but not EU nationals. That can only be decided
by the Home Secretary. I did more research, and I discovered that if an
EU national is sentenced to more than two years, or 12
months for certain crimes, the National Offender Management Service is
supposed to make recommendations to the Home Secretary on deportation
some months before that sentence is over. That system is unsatisfactory
in several ways. First, the victims, the court, the media and the
community are unaware of it. No one in Gloucester knows
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T18:31:24"></hs_TimeCode> Mr Pavlisin
should be deported in due course. As the judge is silent on the
issue—indeed, judges have to be—the implication is that
he will not be deported and will emerge with a strong likelihood of
extending his frequent appearances in our
courts<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T18:31:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032673000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0004.htm#13032673000063">Secondly,
there is no clear responsibility for action, no audit trail and no
measurement of the Ministry of Justice’s ability to ensure that
dangerous EU nationals 
<?notus-xml column=1577?>are deported at the end of their sentences. Thirdly, as the law allows
for deportation but the process does not highlight it, my constituents
and everyone else’s are unlikely to have confidence in the
system.</hs_Para>

gap in the process could, I believe, be fixed relatively simply through
an amendment to the UK Borders Act 2007 and a memorandum of conviction
that would require judges to say when the sentence for any EU national
is of a length or severity that obliges NOMS to consider recommending
deportation to the Home Secretary well ahead of the completion of the
sentence. That would spell out to everyone, including EU nationals, an
important likely consequence of serious crime in our country. It would
remind everyone that we decide who is deported and
who<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T18:32:46"></hs_TimeCode> is not,

on foreign criminals. This is about the safety of my constituents and
justice for all our constituents and it is a plea for more certainty
and rigour in the process of justice. I am sure that Ministers in both
the Ministry of Justice and the Home Department share my concerns and I

cross-party agreement to support the development of a new all-party
group on women’s sport and fitness. We launched it, it is
supported by the Women’s Sport and Fitness Foundation and we
have had some great meetings. Our first meeting was with the presenter
and sports commentator Clare Balding and the Olympic rowing gold
medallist Kath Grainger, and most recently we have had a meeting with
the Paralympian Martine Wright, who survived the

to listen to those inspirational women from those different sports. It
is needed, because women’s sport faces a crisis in media
coverage and lack of sponsorship. Outside Olympic years, women’s
sport receives less than 5% of the total sport print coverage, and even
then, unsurprisingly, women’s sport receives only 0.5% 
<?notus-xml column=1578?>of the total sponsorship income. There was the recent case of the
England women’s football team being offered a salary increase
from £16,000 to £18,000 a year. They eventually settled
on a contract of £20,000 a year. In the same week, the Arsenal
football player Theo Walcott signed for £100,000 a week. I know
that we have some talented girls and young women playing football now,

women with positive role models in sport, and that would encourage
participation and future achievement, but media coverage is elusive and
without it we do not get the sponsorship and salaries remain
low.</hs_Para>

me turn quickly to school sport, because we currently have a crisis of
activity levels among children, especially girls, with just 16% of
girls and young women reaching the recommended levels of activity by
the time they leave primary school, compared with 29% of boys, and only
12% of 14-year-olds are active enough to benefit their health. In fact,
girls leave school only half as likely to meet the recommended activity
levels of boys, and nearly a third of 16-year-olds do no physical
activity at all.</hs_Para>

that context, the Government’s announcement of £150
million for primary school sport is welcome, but I have some questions
about the funding. How will Ministers ensure that the investment helps
to close the gender gap in activity levels in primary schools? Do they
have any plans to provide similar, much needed support in secondary
schools, where sport among girls really drops away? How do Ministers
plan to measure the success of the investment, given that there is no
comprehensive annual measurement of children’s activity levels
in sport? The status quo is that 51% of girls say that school sport and
physical education actually puts them off being active, and they are
only half as likely as boys to meet the recommended activity
levels.</hs_Para>

draw the House’s attention to proposals for a Congleton link

the north of the town centre and on to Macclesfield road to the east.
The potential benefits have been excellently summed up in an
appropriately titled document, “The key to unlocking Cheshire
East: Securing jobs and a future for the local economy”, which
has been compiled by a forward thinking partnership of Congleton
business people and the East Cheshire chamber of commerce, collectively

road would improve connectivity right across east Cheshire by improving
links to Manchester airport, the M60 and the M6, the latter being just
10 minutes away at Sandbach, junction 17, in my constituency. It would
also improve connectivity to the rail network, particularly the
inter-city connection at Crewe, and would help alleviate heavy traffic

years.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032673000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0004.htm#13032673000079"><Member ContinuationText="David Rutley" PimsId="5634" UID="13032673000372" xid="1121" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0004.htm#13032673000372"><B>David

Congleton link road would reduce the daily traffic congestion in the
centre of Congleton that impedes businesses, residents and school
pupils and has been described by Siemens, the town’s biggest
employer, as “chronic”. It would also reduce the
consequential high levels of nitrous oxide at pollution hot spots in

benefits of this road involve far more than traffic improvements alone.
Its route north of the town would open up much-improved access to
industrial and business park sites that are small, land-locked, in poor
condition and under-occupied, which means that existing businesses
looking to expand are being forced to relocate. Moreover, the sites
offer minimal opportunities for inward investment by new businesses.
All this could radically change with the investment in these sites that
improved connectivity both locally and regionally would justify. The
benefits of opening them up are cited not only in the L2P document but
in Cheshire East council’s draft development strategy, which

me give a case study. The L2P document talks about Senior Aerospace
Bird Bellows, which is based at Radnor Park estate, one of the business
sites to the north of Congleton. SABB manufactures key aircraft
components, and it is Congleton’s second largest employer. Key
visitors to SABB include Boeing, Airbus and Rolls-Royce. Sadly, as the
L2P document states, the condition of Radnor Park estate does not
reflect its status as the home of a high-tech, world-class
manufacturer. SABB is set to grow; indeed, 100 jobs are about to be
attracted to the company very soon. However, if it is to remain in
Congleton, it is crucial that Radnor Park estate is improved.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T18:42:49"></hs_TimeCode>Improvements to
the Radnor Park site, and indeed to other business sites in the area,
could provide knock-on benefits in terms of attracting additional new
businesses and much-needed employment opportunities, particularly for
young people, that cannot be overestimated. That is why over 60 local
companies listed in the L2P document support the link road proposal,

Congleton town council, Congleton Partnership and the retail arm of
Congleton Business Association, which say that there is a need to focus
on contemporaneous support for the town centre’s public realm
and retail sector to ensure that that part of the town flourishes, in
conjunction with this redevelopment, just as much as the business
parks. I believe that with appropriate creative thinking and
investment, the town centre will indeed benefit, not only as a result
of the improved traffic flow and access to the town centre, but because
it will provide a more pleasant shopping and leisure experience, and,
one hopes, increased footfall as a

pilots of the FSA’s review into interest rate swaps revealed

banks, but the question is: why is the review not looking at TBLs? Many

can best illustrate that point by referring to two businesses in

Barclays bank referred to as a “simple swap”. The

their business is included in the FSA

Secondly, the Beechey family who run the Black Lion pub in Aberystwyth
took out a £750,000 fixed-rate loan—a TBL with embedded
swap—over 15 years with Clydesdale and Yorkshire bank. Their
breakage fees are £200,000, but the business is not included in

12 years the FSA has worked on the assumption of a principle-based
system of regulation. The results of January’s pilots found that
poor disclosure of break costs was one of the most significant issues

knife crime in Harrow has increased by 16% in the past two years. The

offence came into operation only on 3 December 2012, so we are unable
fully to judge its effectiveness yet. However, we can say that this is
not the end of the fight against knife crime, but only the beginning.
We need to look at the recently released figures to know the trend,
particularly the figures on knife possession—if people do not
carry knives in the first place, they will not commit knife crime. In
2012, nearly a quarter of the offensive weapon possession offences were
committed by repeat offenders—I would add that they repeated the
same offence. Of 4,000 individuals, 43% escaped a custodial sentence.
Forty-four per cent. of those offenders had three or more previous
convictions, but also escaped a custodial sentence. Even more
gallingly, 5% of repeat offenders escaped with nothing more than a
caution. Both the rates of reoffending and the sentences show that
something is going
wrong.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032673000143" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0004.htm#13032673000143">Across
London, 62% of knife crime is accounted for by personal robberies
involving a knife. Knives are used primarily as a weapon of threat, and
in only a small number of cases is someone injured, but 40% of
homicides in England and Wales involve a knife. That leads to the
utterly wrong view that possession is the least dangerous aspect of
knife crime, and therefore unimportant. We must address that. An
attitude needs to be introduced in this country by which knife
possession is completely and utterly unacceptable. If we allow repeat
offenders to escape with nothing but a caution, that attitude will not
come about. If we had such an attitude, we would not allow nearly half
of all repeat offenders to escape
prison.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032673000144" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0004.htm#13032673000144">I

taken much more seriously, which is why I call on Ministers to assess
whether it would be appropriate to introduce a two-strikes policy, by
which anyone found in possession of a knife who has a previous

custodial sentence. That would make it clear, in the strongest terms,
that the Government stand against knife crime and are prepared to

causes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032673000145" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0004.htm#13032673000145">This

reported delays to its vehicles of more than 30 minutes on more than
1,000 occasions at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire. That
is not a criticism of that hospital, just a reflection of demand. The
proposal, however, is to remove a substantial amount of that capacity,
which is already stretched: 300 acute beds at Stafford, in addition to
the 250 that have already been lost at UHNS as a result of the new,
smaller PFI hospital. In fact, at least 60 have had to be reopened at
the old site, as demand is so great.</hs_Para>

reason given for this is, as always, that if we move care out of
hospitals and into the community, the demand for emergency and acute
admissions will fall. That is only half the truth. It will fall, but
only from the much higher levels it would have reached. Moving care
into the community will stop the need to provide much more extra
emergency and acute capacity, but it will not allow for substantial
reductions in that capacity. This is the flawed assumption under which
NHS leaders seem to be working.</hs_Para>

firmly believe, as do most of my constituents, that acute district
general hospitals have an important role to play. Indeed, if they did

is not, as is proposed for Stafford, to cram all serious emergency and

closely with those neighbouring trusts—even become part of
them—and thus enable clinicians to work across neighbouring

substitute. E-cigarettes consist of an electronic inhaler that
vaporises a liquid into an aerosol mist, simulating the act of tobacco
smoking. E-cigarettes are the same size and shape as cigarettes. They
are held in the same way and treated as cigarettes. The difference is
that while cigarette smokers smoke for the nicotine but die from the
tars and gases released by the burning of tobacco, e-cigarettes deliver
nicotine in an aerosol form but, crucially, without the hazards that
accompany tobacco smoking. There are, of course, other ways of getting
nicotine, such as patches, gum and lozenges, and nicotine is not
harmless. However, Action on Smoking and Health states that there is
little real-world evidence of harm from e-cigarettes. There are some
trace toxicants present, but at a much lower level than in
cigarettes.</hs_Para>

basically in secret courts is constitutionally difficult to fix,
because it needs scrutiny to fix it. There is an additional challenge
in that the people affected who are UK citizens are generally poorer
people and less articulate. Hence, although stories about people who
are foreign citizens maltreated in the UK get substantial coverage in
the foreign media, there are only a few journalists such as Sue Reid,
Christopher Booker and Ted Jeory who are willing to report on these

that issue, I, one of the chief fundraisers at Prospect hospice, Amy
Falconer, and Andrew Paterson, a lecturer at one of my local colleges,
Swindon college, allocated £10 to seven teams and set them the
task of trading at Blunsdon market. It is a challenging trading
environment; an indoor market that is not at capacity and has limited
footfall. I secured mentors from Smiths News, Nouble Furniture, Asda
and Barclays to come along to support those teams to formulate ideas
and to choose the products and services that they would
offer.</hs_Para>

that the teams understood that their stall would be simply a wooden
trestle table that would need dressing up, but that, if they spent too
much money dressing it up, they would not make any money. They needed
to promote themselves. They competed against existing traders and the
other teams. They also looked at promotion to ensure that they did not
rely just on the footfall, on what turned out to be an exceptionally
cold and wet Wednesday in the market, and got friends and family along.
They also were told that they would have to stand on their feet all
day, that being in retail is a real challenge, that customers would
haggle and that they would have to do mental arithmetic and ensure that
they had sufficient change.</hs_Para>

to the market, the seven teams set up. All seven managed to trade
extremely well and to make a profit. In fact, the teams managed to
raise £838.70 for the hospice. On a very quiet and cold day,
that was an incredibly impressive performance. At last Friday’s
presentation event, I saw how much they had changed from when they
first decided to take up the
challenge.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032673000192" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0004.htm#13032673000192">I
want to highlight two of the teams. Art Creations focused on providing
henna tattoos. My mother, who is a 72-year-old councillor, and my wife
were covered with henna tattoos after visiting that stand. Art
Creations managed to make over £100. The Double Trouble team was
run by Jessica and Kay, who set up a 1950s cake stall. They were
dressed in 1950s clothing. They sold hand-made bags and all the cakes
were home-made. There was 1950s music playing. They gave incredible
customer service. That team got over £100 as well.</hs_Para>

for those two teams is that they have been invited to return to
Blunsdon market in the summer holidays. Those students are all sixth
formers considering their career options. They can come back for six
weeks to see whether their ideas can work beyond a day and whether they
can work for themselves. They will be working with Forward Swindon and
In Swindon, two of the organisations charged with re-energising our
town centre using Government money to boost the high street. Those
teams have both been offered opportunities to take advantage of the
provision for pop-up shops; 
<?notus-xml column=1596?>they will probably be the first teams to benefit from that. All things
being equal and working in the real commercial world, they will have
the opportunity to consider that as a career. That career path has been
laid out for them.</hs_Para>

these students, if they step up, volunteer and succeed, I will do all I
can to get the mentors in place to support them. We all have the
opportunity to support keen, young and enthusiastic people. They will
be the next generation of wealth creators providing employment. We MPs

Stewart</B> (Milton Keynes South) (Con):</Member> I am grateful for the
opportunity to raise the issue of accident and emergency provision at
Milton Keynes hospital, which serves my constituents and indeed some of
your constituents, Mr Speaker. The Lord Commissioner of Her
Majesty’s Treasury, my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes
North (Mark Lancaster), and I have joined forces with one of our
excellent local newspapers, the <I>Milton Keynes Citizen, </I>to
campaign for a new A and E centre.</hs_Para>

simply one of space. Our hospital was built in the early 1980s and the
A and E department was designed for approximately 20,000 patients a
year. With population growth and other increases in A and E usage, it
is now dealing with well over three times that number each year, and
very soon it will reach four times that
number.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032673000197" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0004.htm#13032673000197">At
this point, I would like to put on the record my deep appreciation of
and admiration for the many dedicated staff at the hospital. Although
there are certainly long-standing problems in parts of the NHS that
have rightly been highlighted and addressed, not least by my hon.
Friend the Member for Stafford (Jeremy Lefroy), it is too easy to
overlook the fact that the vast majority of NHS staff do an excellent
job and deeply care for their patients. That is certainly what I have
found on visiting Milton Keynes hospital.</hs_Para>

given an existing population of some 250,000, the accident and
emergency centre is already too small. With more than 20,000 housing
permissions in place locally over the next 10 years or so and in the
light of demographic changes, we will have a larger elderly population
and there will be a constant upward demand on A and E
services.</hs_Para>

pertinent to mention that the hospital site includes an urgent care
centre, opened as part of the Darzi plans a few years ago. Although it
was set up with the very best of intentions, far from reducing demand
on the A and E department, it has led to an increase because,
understandably, people can become confused about where best to go for
treatment.</hs_Para>

care intensive support team recently reviewed the A and E centre and
recommended that the NHS trust should seek capital support for what it
calls a “common front door” provision. I am happy to
report that all the relevant local stakeholders have developed plans
for a single-point-of-access system in which those who need the full A
and E treatment get it and those with less serious ailments get proper
and timely treatment without being pushed from pillar to

I want to say thank you to all the people who, for all the time that we
have all been here, have looked after us so well in this place: not
only the staff employed by the Palace, but the staff who work for us,
without whom we could not do our job. If that is not enough and if
Members have nothing better to do when the debate finishes, we are
celebrating my having been here 30 years, and everyone is very welcome
to come to the Attlee Suite for a drink. We are there until 9
o’clock. I want to couple with that a thanks to my head of

I was prompted to say something on a subject that has nothing to do
with the main one: the Revenue and Customs consultation on whether tax
offices should be closed or a face-to-face service should continue. I
just want to make a very simple point. Many of us can use the internet
and e-mail, but many constituents—not just the
elderly—sometimes need to talk to somebody. I make a plea that
the Government understand that, whether with careers, benefits or tax
advice, doing it on the phone or via the internet is not always the
answer. We must make sure that we keep face-to-face
provision.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032673000206" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0004.htm#13032673000206">The
substantive issue I want to address is the Thames tunnel proposed by
Thames Water to deal with London’s sewage. I have been
campaigning to clean up the Thames all my political life. Our sewers
are overflowing. The wonderful Victorian sewer system cannot cope with
the vast size of London and the now increasingly intermittent and heavy
rain. As colleagues will know, every time it rains, water pours through
the drains and gutters and floods the sewers, which overflow into the
Thames. Some 83 million cubic metres of storm water, mixed with raw
sewage—a horrible figure—went into the Thames last year.
That hardly bears thinking about. The European Community has taken
action. It is prosecuting the UK for failing to meet the terms of our
waste water
directive<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T18:45:00"></hs_TimeCode>. I,
like all other colleagues with riverside constituencies or in the
Thames Water catchment area, have therefore questioned what the
solution is.</hs_Para>

current solution is to pour millions of tonnes of concrete into
building a super-sewer through the Thames to intercept the outflows
from the sewerage system. That will be very expensive, costing an
average of £80 a year for all of Thames Water’s household
customers, and it will be hugely disruptive. In my constituency, for
example, one site might be worked on for up to seven years. In
addition, this solution deals with only one problem. It will
efficiently keep sewage out of the Thames, but it will do nothing
else<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032673000208" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0004.htm#13032673000208">Other
countries across the world are doing things differently now. Places
such as Detroit and Philadelphia and places in Europe started to think
about building tunnels but have realised that greener alternatives may
be better. Instead of building a big tunnel, Philadelphia now has small
interventions: much more porous surfaces on roads, drives and car
parks; and smaller sewage collection tanks across the city, rather than
in a central place. People in those places believe that what they call
a blue-green solution is a better solution and it allows parks to
flourish, with the transformation of the city into a wholly greener
environment. Such a solution also produces many more jobs at the lower
skill levels more quickly than one big tunnel project does.
Philadelphia and London may not be the same, but Greater Philadelphia
has a huge population, just as London does.</hs_Para>

Government Policy. My plea to the Government is that we look at the
blue-green experiences elsewhere. We should look at what has happened
in Philadelphia and other cities. It is not too late to have an
alternative to a super-sewer down the middle of the Thames. I hope that
we can pursue an alternative. I hope that the Deputy Leader of the
House will relay back to Ministers that that is very much supported by
the community and that the Thames tunnel can be replaced by a greener,
more sustainable and more cost-effective solution. Happy Easter to you,

eggs, fluffy chicks and chocolate bunnies for tinsel and crackers at

2016, hen welfare is not a done deal, and we on the green Benches

one time, consumers would not deign to notice what, if anything, was
said about welfare on food packaging. Now, thanks in no small part to
the efforts of well-known TV chefs, we want to know from where our food
has come. Indeed, the term “higher welfare” has even
found its way into the ingredients list of the king of school dinners,
Jamie Oliver, and there is undoubtedly a culture in which it is
considered poor form to offer for sale food that is lower welfare. In a
January 2010 survey, twice as many people as in 2006 said that animal
welfare informed their shopping choices—that made 19%, and I am

previous Prime Minister’s GOAT—his Government of all the
talents—might have been a tur laid to rest by the British
people, but that was either the exception that proves the rule on our
love of animals or an act of mercy that confirms it. It should be the
proud boast of British farmers that no land does more to ensure the
welfare of its animals, and the success of the ban on inhumane cages in
this country is a case in point. There was concern that increased
prices would lead to a drop in demand for eggs, but the reverse was
true and the British consumer bought 5% more eggs in 2012 than
in 2011.</hs_Para>

for welfare does not stop at the good treatment of hens during their

hens is somewhat in vogue at the moment, despite the prospect of
heartache. Many a hen keeper will be prepared for the early morning
discovery of scattered feathers and an empty coup, but how many are

the positive step of banning battery cages, many British consumers
might be surprised that 17 million hens are still housed in
cages, albeit of an enriched variety. These birds provide the eggs that
are sold as a constituent part of another product and then, despite the

Government should consider the value of labels that would show the
origins of eggs when used as an ingredient and when a chicken is an
end-of-lay bird as a means of promoting high welfare standards. I also
entreat the Government to stick to their plan to hold a thorough
investigation into beak trimming in 2015. When we eventually head into

marine conservation zones. She expressed concerns about the cost of a

referred to the controversy surrounding an incinerator or energy
recovery facility. I can confirm that I am aware of the controversies
surrounding such plants, because there is a proposal for one in
Beddington in my constituency. He stressed the importance of ensuring

work proceed on rebuilding Marlborough and Vaughan primary schools. He
will be pleased to hear that there is no delay. He asked me to ensure
that Ministers chase up the Education Funding Agency, and I am happy to
pass that on so that he gets a prompt response. He also referred to
problems relating to London Welsh, and I am sure that the Department
for Culture, Media and Sport will have listened carefully to what he
said. He highlighted some inconsistencies in the penalties issued by
the Rugby Football Union, but I do not think that is something I can
pursue as Deputy Leader of the House. I am sure that is something he

other counties—and made a couple of specific points about Her
Majesty’s Revenue and Customers and a constituent, Mr Wright. I
am sure that HMRC has public relations people who follow these debates
closely and that they will want to pick up on that point and, I hope,
respond positively to her concerns. She also referred to some
unhappiness about the way in which the Valuation Office Agency works
and the need for more flexibility on business rates, particularly how
high levels of business rates affect strong and emerging businesses in
her

want to support. That gives me an opportunity to underline the fact
that the Government are delivering on the commitment to devoting 0.7%
of gross national income on aid, which I think we should all be proud
of. It was started by the previous Government and finished by this one.
He also expressed concern about the difference in the way children from
families with parents who are in work and those from families with
parents who are not in work are dealt with in respect of free school
meals. I am sure that is something the Department for Education, which
has responsibility for free school meals, might want to respond
to.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032673000228" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0004.htm#13032673000228"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T19:52:49"></hs_TimeCode>My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T19:52:49"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Peterborough (Mr Jackson) raised
a variety of issues—another Member referred to it as a
“kaleidoscope of issues”—and it would be difficult
to respond to them all. He referred to the plight of Christians,
particularly in countries such as Pakistan; the importance of
recognising the need to support Tourette’s sufferers, through
the Department for Education, and in schools and in health care; and
the importance of fortifying foods with folic acid, and the charity in
his constituency, Shine, which works on that issue. I have noted his
concerns about equal marriage, but I am pleased that the Government are
pursuing it. He talked about the important role the voluntary sector is
playing in relation to the Peterborough cathedral appeal. He also
mentioned the Sue Ryder hospice and the generosity of his city. I am
sure that his city and its people are very generous and that we all
want to recognise
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032673000229" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0004.htm#13032673000229"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T19:53:49"></hs_TimeCode>We

for East Lothian (Fiona O'Donnell) on the Cockenzie power station. She
said that today might feel like groundhog dog. She will no doubt know
that the groundhog is being sued at the moment. In fact, they are
seeking the 
<?notus-xml column=1602?>death penalty for the groundhog in America because he has failed to
predict the beginning of spring accurately. She focused on the need for
investment. Clearly, the decision on whether to invest in a new
combined cycle gas turbine at Cockenzie is very much a commercial
matter for ScottishPower, but I am sure that the Government would
welcome that investment and the jobs and energy that would be created
if and when the development goes
ahead.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032673000230" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0004.htm#13032673000230">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T19:54:30"></hs_TimeCode>

Aldous</B> (Waveney) (Con):</Member> I am pleased to have secured this
debate. Its purpose is to highlight the job-creating opportunities
associated with renewing the UK’s energy infrastructure, the
considerable potential that that offers to generate economic growth,
the concern that we may not be making the most of the opportunity, and
what can be done to ensure that we
do.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032673000250" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0004.htm#13032673000250">At<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T20:02:56"></hs_TimeCode>
the outset, I should draw attention to the Register of Members’
Financial Interests because I have an interest in family farms where
renewable energy projects are being pursued. However, this evening I
shall largely concentrate not on land but on the offshore oil and gas
and wind sectors, with some references to
nuclear<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T20:03:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032673000251" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0004.htm#13032673000251">At
times during this debate, I might be accused of being parochial and
focusing on the opportunities in East Anglia and my Waveney
constituency. However, I should emphasise that there are opportunities
not only for areas that adjoin the North sea but for areas across the
UK. That is because the energy supply chain stretches right across the
country and is not confined to Lowestoft and Yarmouth, Humberside or
Tyneside. If we get the supply chain working to its full potential, the
whole of Britain will benefit. That will have a significant positive
impact on GDP, help to rebalance the economy, and provide significant
exporting
opportunities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032673000252" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0004.htm#13032673000252">Not<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T20:03:58"></hs_TimeCode>
only has Lady Luck looked favourably on me in securing this debate, but
the timing is particularly opportune, coming just before the Energy
Bill returns to this House on Report after the Easter recess and just
before the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills publishes its
industrial strategy for oil and gas and offshore wind.
At<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T20:04:19"></hs_TimeCode> present,
there is much focus on the energy sector.</hs_Para>

country faces a significant challenge: to replace its ageing capacity,
provide power to the nation’s homes and businesses and ensure
that the nation’s lights do not go
out<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T20:04:36"></hs_TimeCode>. In rising
to that challenge, three criteria need to be addressed: energy must be
affordable, secure in supply and low carbon in content. There is a
fourth goal, however, that we should strive to achieve. I refer to the
opportunity to create economic growth, to rebalance the economy towards
the regions and in favour of engineering and manufacturing and to
attract inward investment. Nowhere is there a greater opportunity to do
that than in East Anglia, which is already a significant player in the
energy sector, with 35% to 45% of the nation’s gas supply coming
through the Bacton terminal, where the Sizewell C nuclear power station
will be built and with Lowestoft, in my constituency, lying closest to
the East Anglia Array, potentially the world’s largest wind
farm.</hs_Para>

Aldous:</Member></B> Although I am concentrating on the North sea, the
supply chain for the offshore work extends right the way around the
country, both in the oil and gas sector and the offshore wind sector. I
am also extremely conscious of the work that DONG Energy and
ScottishPower have done and the investment they have made in
Belfast.</hs_Para>

short, we need to strive to maximise the British content of UK energy
infrastructure projects. At present, there are concerns that we are not
meeting this challenge. Some two years ago, the Thanet wind farm was
completed, with less than 20% of the £900 million of investment
going to UK firms. Although companies such as ScottishPower and DONG
Energy are aware of the need to maximise the UK content of contracts,
we are some distance from achieving the Offshore Wind Developers
Forum’s target of 50% UK content for UK offshore wind
farms<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T20:07:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032673000258" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0004.htm#13032673000258">The
problem is more serious in the oil and gas sector. In last
year’s Budget, the Chancellor announced significant incentives
for opening up marginal North sea fields and decommissioning. These
initiatives are to be applauded, and North sea investment this year is
now at its highest and most extensive for 30 years, but the problem is
that contracts worth more than £10 billion are being placed
overseas, while in the past two years only 7% of North sea platforms
have been made in the UK. In other words, British taxpayers’
money is being used to create jobs in other
countries<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T20:08:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032673000259" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0004.htm#13032673000259">The
Nexen Golden Eagle project was awarded to Lamprell of Dubai, the BP
Clair Ridge project to Hyundai Heavy Industries of Korea, and
Statoil’s Mariner project to Daewoo of Korea and Dragados of
Spain. I name just three contracts, but there are more. If some of
these contracts had been awarded to British yards, they would have
helped secure thousands of jobs and strengthened the UK’s supply
chain, which as I have said extends across much of the UK. In the past
two years, contracts for a total of 200,000 tonnes of fabrication
structures have been awarded outside the UK, representing a loss to the
country of 18,600 direct man years of
jobs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T20:09:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032673000260" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0004.htm#13032673000260">Some
people may say, “Tough luck. Why should we pursue protectionist
policies propping up uncompetitive UK firms?”. But that is not
the case: these businesses are competitive and innovative and have
highly skilled and dedicated work forces. If we do not allow them to
compete on a level playing field with companies from other countries,
there is a danger that the yards will simply disappear. That will not
only hit hard those areas of the country with above average levels of
unemployment, but it will have a serious knock-on effect on the
offshore wind sector, as those businesses are well placed to help build
offshore wind
farms<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T20:10:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032673000261" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0004.htm#13032673000261">There
is, therefore, a need for the UK to have a local content policy when
granting such contracts. The reason given for not having such a policy
is that it would contravene EU competition regulations, but if that is 
<?notus-xml column=1607?>the case, why is the UK the only oil and gas province in the world that
does not have a local content policy? Why should licences granted on
the UK continental shelf not contain a clause requiring free and fair
provision for British companies in the procurement
process<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T20:10:40"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032673000262" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0004.htm#13032673000262">The
UK Government should apply pressure at national and EU level to ensure
that UK companies are not disadvantaged when competing for overseas
contracts. Sembmarine SLP, based in Lowestoft in my constituency,
advises that in its experience, when it competes for projects in
Norwegian, Dutch, German and French waters it has practically no chance
of winning owing to blatant protectionism. In the offshore wind sector,
Seajacks, based in the constituency

the French Government have explicitly stated that they intend to award
licences for offshore wind sites to bidders favouring the
French supply chain.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T20:11:26"></hs_TimeCode>British
companies are not looking for favouritism or trade barriers; they are
seeking a level playing field. I urge the Minister, together with his
colleagues in the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and
the Treasury, to do all he can to help achieve
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T20:11:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032673000263" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0004.htm#13032673000263">The
Government could take other long-term measures to strengthen the UK
supply chain. Indeed, they have put in place a number of initiatives,
for which I thank and commend them. In the time left I shall briefly
run through what else needs to be done to ensure that UK-based
businesses are in the best possible place to secure
contracts<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T20:12:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032673000264" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0004.htm#13032673000264">First
is electricity market reform. At present, the Energy Bill is the most
important game in town, and if we get it right it will provide the
stable long-term policy environment that is required to attract supply
chain investment. I believe that we are moving in the right direction.
A £7.6 billion package has been provided for investment in
renewable energy, and although the Bill’s provisions are
complicated, it should provide the certainty, confidence and
credibility that investors are looking for in UK energy
policy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T20:12:41"></hs_TimeCode>.
Timeliness is vital. It is important to investors that draft strike
prices are published in the second quarter of this year and that the
Bill receives Royal Assent by the end of the
year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T20:12:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032673000265" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0004.htm#13032673000265">I
commend the Minister on being receptive to amendments to improve the
Bill, and I am grateful to him for considering my proposals, which are
designed to strengthen the supply chain. The elephant in the room is,
of course, the 2030 decarbonisation target. I shall not dwell on that
as I know it will be debated in the Chamber in much detail and with
much passion in the coming weeks; indeed, it could be the subject of an
Adjournment debate. I will say, however, that it is unfortunate that
the issue has become a bit of a political football, and when the matter
is considered I ask the Government to look behind any political
positioning and decide what is best for Britain, and particularly the
development of the UK energy supply chain. My views on the matter are
determined by what industry and investors tell me, and it is
important that we listen to
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T20:13:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032673000266" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0004.htm#13032673000266">Secondly,
the Government have put in place a number of measures to strengthen the
supply chain. In Lowestoft and Great Yarmouth there is an enterprise
zone, and the two ports have centre of renewable
engineering—CORE—status. Those measures are proving
helpful in 
<?notus-xml column=1608?>promoting the area, but as the Minister heard from the Norfolk and
Suffolk delegation he met last month, more could be done to ensure that
we fully realise the potential of the great opportunity in front of
us<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T20:14:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032673000267" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0004.htm#13032673000267">The
problem that Yarmouth and Lowestoft face as a CORE is that of six COREs
in England, only it and Sheerness do not have assisted area status. I
believe that if all six COREs enjoyed the benefit of assisted area
status, it would be particularly advantageous, both nationally and
internationally, in seeking to promote the UK. It would help Lowestoft
and Yarmouth to compete against our fiercest competitors from the low
countries on the other side of the North
sea<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T20:14:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032673000268" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0004.htm#13032673000268">I
am also mindful that the UK ports fund, which is designed to help the
establishment of offshore wind manufacturing, is only available in
assisted areas. I am advised that at present this fund is largely
unspent. If Lowestoft and Yarmouth were given assisted area status, the
two ports could access the fund to carry out work that would stimulate
jobs and investment in renewable offshore
engineering<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T20:15:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032673000269" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0004.htm#13032673000269">The
advanced manufacturing supply chain initiative is proving beneficial in
stimulating investment in manufacturing-related jobs and growth.
However, the current minimum threshold of £1 million for
investment from the fund appears to be holding businesses back from
making applications. It would thus be helpful if the Department of
Energy and Climate Change could liaise with the Department for
Business, Innovation and Skills to see whether the threshold could be
lowered either for individual businesses or for smaller scale projects.
This would be helpful to businesses from across the manufacturing
sector and to those looking to support energy
projects<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T20:15:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032673000270" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0004.htm#13032673000270">I
apologise if it appears that I have a shopping list, as I am mindful
that the Minister may tell me that the shelves are bare. I would
emphasise, however, that a thriving supply chain can be a key driver in
reducing costs in the offshore wind sector, which is vital to
establishing the industry on a sustainable, long-term

investing in skills and people is of paramount importance. The UK needs
to improve its skills base to serve the large demand that will come
from the North sea in the next few years with regard to the oil and gas
and wind sectors. If we do not do that, businesses will source that
expertise from other

commend the Government for promoting apprenticeships. Indeed, the
Minister himself played an important role in that work in a previous
life. I also pay special tribute to Lowestoft college which, although
not a large further education college, has realised the huge potential
in the energy sector and invested a considerable amount of resources in
providing facilities and putting on courses with the energy

are a number of different ways and proposals as to how best to invest
in skills for the offshore industry. I do not propose to go through
these or, indeed, to pick a winner. Suffice to say that it is important
that the necessary skills centres should be located near offshore
engineering ports. This way we can create the world’s leading

I know that organisations in Lowestoft such as OrbisEnergy and the

Perhaps I should say more about it. I have asked my officials to look
at pre-application consultation, benchmarking good practice, and
ensuring that communities have the resources to evaluate and consider
wind applications. Many representations have been made on cumulative
impact and topography. It is vital—to use not my words, but
those of the Secretary of State—that no community feels bullied
into having wind turbines in the wrong places, and that the Department
of Energy and Climate Change and indeed Government policy should not be
used as an excuse for putting them in the wrong places. I cannot be
clearer than that, but my hon. Friend will look forward to that

return to the main thrust of my argument, the scale of the investment
that I described a moment or two ago is big even compared with some of
the other major infrastructure investment that the economy is likely to
enjoy. It makes up nearly half the total investment in the
pipeline—it is up to six times the investment expected in water
or communications, and more than 30% greater than expected investment
in transport. Perhaps sometimes in energy, we punch below our weight in
making the case on infrastructure investment and the effect it can have
on the wider economy, and on skills and jobs, as

I have said, it is critical in that process that we work with

September last year, the Government launched an industrial strategy
that will drive forward our approach to creating a new partnership with
the business sectors that will give us the greatest potential for
development and exports. My Department and my former Department, the
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, which my hon. Friend
also mentioned, are working closely together and in partnership with UK
industry to produce three energy sector strategies as part of the
industrial strategy, identifying ways that we can build up the UK
supply chain in order to maximise the economic benefits of the
investment we have attracted to communities and constituencies across
the country.</hs_Para>

strategies cover oil and gas, nuclear and offshore wind, all of which
my hon. Friend mentioned in his speech, and are among the first to be
launched as part of the Government’s industrial strategy.
Indeed, the nuclear strategy was launched today. It sets out how we can
achieve our ambitions in nuclear power, bringing a new generation of
nuclear power to deliver light and heat to lives across the nation. It
also sets out how we can achieve a massive increase in opportunities
for those who work in that industry. It is fair to say that some of
those skills have been eroded over time as the last nuclear power
station we built was in 1985. There will be jobs in building those
stations, in running them and in the regulatory system—the
context in which they sit, because of course all we do will be safe and
secure.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032673000289" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0004.htm#13032673000289">The
oil and gas strategy will be launched in Aberdeen on Thursday. The
offshore wind strategy will be published later this spring. An
abundance of virtues is emanating from the partnership between my
Department and BIS. The strategies set out where we are now, where we
want to get to, and how we will get there. This work will bring forward
important analysis of supply chains, focusing on barriers, skills and
technology.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032673000290" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/debtext/130326-0004.htm#13032673000290">There
is good news. For example, Hitachi, which is a partner organisation
that wants to develop a new generation of nuclear power in this
country, has suggested that 60% of the jobs created will be local. The
Hinkley Point development, which has been debated in the House several
times and is of critical importance, estimates that potentially 57% of
the jobs will be from the UK. These are real and tangible benefits to
our nation as the result of a policy that is not
protectionist—although Joseph Chamberlain is one of my
heroes—but planned, on the basis that if we get the economic
effect for which my hon. Friend calls, we will build unparalleled
resilience, flexibility and responsiveness. It is right that all should
benefit from the plans that I have outlined today.</hs_Para>

apologies for being a patriot—no one in this House
should—so of course the measure has to be quality. I know that,
by and large, British is best. As we move forward with our nuclear
supply chain action plan, which was delivered in December 2012, and
work on the community benefits for sites that host new nuclear power
stations and new technology in other areas—mentioned by my hon.
Friend the Member for Daventry (Chris Heaton-Harris)—we must put
the people’s interests first. That is also true in the oil and
gas sector.</hs_Para>

the oil and gas sector strategy will be published on Thursday in
Aberdeen. It will focus on how we can develop further opportunities in
the North sea to the benefit of communities and of the supply chain. My
hon. Friend the Member for Waveney will know that our gas generation
strategy, published last December and of course on everyone’s
bedside table, is designed to provide certainty for investors about the
Government’s view of gas generation to ensure that sufficient
investment comes forward within the context of the Government’s
wider energy policies. Gas currently forms an integral part of the
UK’s energy generation mix because it is reliable and flexible.
It provides around 40% of our electricity. Shale gas is another
exciting opportunity and our new office of unconventional gas and oil
will be the pivot of our thinking and developments in that
area.</hs_Para>

I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T09:32:00"></hs_TimeCode> am delighted

1914 and 1915, it became clear that the country was under-prepared to
provide munitions for a major war, so the Government increased their
control of munitions manufacture and made sweeping changes. Perhaps the
most significant of those, with millions of the male work force on
military duty, was to force the employment of more women. By the end of
that war, nearly a million “munitionettes” were employed
in the factories and were estimated to have been responsible for 80% of

estimated that anywhere between 1.5 million and 2 million
people—mainly women—were employed in that highly

the location of the factories and the identity of the people working in

as factories had to be moved away from the heavily bombed south to
northern England, Scotland and Wales. We can still see the social
impact of that in some of those places, where populations increased
hugely by the influx of workers to munitions factories. I have
mentioned ROF Swynnerton a number of times this morning, and huge

railway station near Swynnerton that did not exist—it did not

obviously in huge danger, because if any light had shown, enemy planes
would have spotted the train, which could have led not only to the
death and injury of the people on it, but  to the factory being
traced. I talked to the women  who were on the train, who said
such situations were commonplace—they just got on with it. They
sat for hours in comradeship, having hushed conversations among
themselves. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T09:41:21"></hs_TimeCode>I

worked in munitions and defining munitions have always been problems.
Does that include somebody who worked with small arms and shells, or
with airframes, tanks and similar? In the all-party group, we are clear
about what we mean by munitions workers: those who worked on royal
ordnance. A problem is that over many years, the records of who worked
at some of the factories that were turned over to produce munitions
during the war have been
lost<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T09:46:17"></hs_TimeCode>. If a
person in their 80s came forward and said that they had worked at a
munitions factory, but it turned out that they had not—it is
questionable whether anybody in their 80s or 90s would misrepresent
themselves, but it might perhaps happen—giving away a badge or
two to them would probably be a small price to pay for recognising
those hundreds of thousands of workers. I do not think it would be
hundreds of thousands now; sadly, only tens of thousands are still

which families—children, grandchildren and more distant

munitions workers, in a comradely way, with the Government. We just ask
that, rather than seeking justification for why living munitions
workers should be excluded from the recognition that other groups have
had, the Government consider again how such recognition can be given.
We also ask the Minister to agree that the danger and cost of giving a
badge to someone who perhaps was not there is far outweighed by the
need to recognise the ever-decreasing group of people who risked their
lives day in, day out. That risk is a price worth
paying.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032643000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/halltext/130326h0001.htm#13032643000032">All<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T09:59:42"></hs_TimeCode>
I really ask of the Minister is that he consider the matter with
colleagues. My Front-Bench colleagues will probably hate me for trying
to push for a spending commitment, but we are talking about a few
thousand pounds. The fundraising push for the permanent memorial seeks
to raise £100,000, and the cost of providing a medal or a badge
to the surviving munitions workers is 
<?notus-xml column=422?>probably half that amount. The Chancellor will probably not lose too

colleagues to review their position. It is only just and proper that
the Government give the Roses of Swynnerton, and everyone who was
employed in the manufacture of munitions, the formal recognition they
deserve. They went about ensuring, in a quiet and determined
way—almost without raising an eyebrow—that this country
could fight the first and second world wars. They ensured that there
were bullets in the guns that our brave soldiers were firing, shells in
the artillery pieces, and munitions in the aeroplanes that went up to

Arctic convoys was important, and I have just had a constituency case
involving a gentleman in Cliffe Woods village who served at Suez but
did not get the medal of recognition he should have received. When my
office pressed the issue, it appeared that there had been some
confusion and his service had fallen through the cracks, so to speak,
within the Ministry of Defence. We were able to provide the firm
evidence that he had served in Suez, and the medal was then awarded. To
the gentleman, the recognition was a source of great pride. That was
one of the most rewarding pieces of constituency casework with which I
have been
involved<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T09:58:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032643000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/halltext/130326h0001.htm#13032643000040">I

factories. Pembrey has a long history of manufacturing explosives: a
powder works was established on the Pembrey Burrows as far back as the
1800s, and was known as the New Explosive Company of Stowmarket.
Detonators, fuses and other explosives were produced on the site, which
covered an area of some 150 acres, stretching along the Pembrey
coastline. The factory employed almost 80 people, including young boys
and girls. As the work was highly dangerous, employees were paid by
piece work that enabled them to earn between 2 shillings and sixpence
and 3 shillings a day. At the time, that was comparatively good pay, so
there was a local shortage of people wanting to be domestic
servants<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T10:03:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032643000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/halltext/130326h0001.htm#13032643000046">The
industry was not without its dangers. A minor explosion occurred at the
Pembrey Burrows site on 11 November 1882, but fortunately no
one was injured. It prompted Sir John Jenkins, my predecessor as MP for
the area, to ask a parliamentary question on Thursday 16 November,
because the sheds apparently held well over the legal limit of 150 tons
of material authorised under the terms and conditions of the

Nobel—the same man who, when he died, left most of his wealth in

1914, with war looming in Europe, the then Secretary of State ordered
and approved the construction of a new plant at Pembrey, with the
Government bearing the full cost. It was agreed that the Nobel
Explosives Company would be retained as administrative agents of the
plant and that the 750-acre site would remain Government property after
the war. The Pembrey plant was one of the first of more than 200

the second world war approached, work started in July 1938 to build a
new factory on the Pembrey site, with the Ministry of Works acting as
agents. It opened in December 1939 under the control of the Ministry of
Supply, as one of several explosives Royal Ordnance Factories making
TNT. Unlike other factories, ROF Pembrey also made tetryl and ammonium
nitrate. Production of explosives began in December 1939 and reached
its peak in 1942, producing 700 tons of TNT, 1,000 tons of ammonium
nitrate and 40 tons of tetryl each week. There was a complex
arrangement of buildings, spread out over the 750-acre site and set
among the sand hills. The magazines were carefully housed around the
plant and were well camouflaged to avoid detection in case of possible
air raid or sabotage. The site was self-contained, having its own water
plant and a power station for electricity. In addition, the
administrative buildings, canteen, doctors’ surgery, laundry,
police barracks, library and other offices were grouped together at the
main site. We can see how big it
was.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032643000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/halltext/130326h0001.htm#13032643000050">As
my hon. Friend pointed out, these factories were under constant threat
of attack. Indeed, shortly after midday on Tuesday 10 July 1940, a
single German bomber plane made a sneak attack on the factory and
dropped about nine bombs just inside the main entrance gates.
Tragically, 10 workers were killed outright or died later of their
injuries, and others were injured, some severely. Serious though the
bombing was, had it been a little later the casualties would have been
much greater, as many men and women would have been on their way to the

continued at a much reduced scale after the war, except for a sharp
upturn in the early 1950s, during the Korean war. One of the main
functions of the site after the war was to break down large quantities
of superfluous or obsolete ammunition. The TNT was melted out of the
shells by jets of hot water, and taken to solidify on isolated
stretches of sand, where it burned off. The bright glowing flames of
burning cordite lit up the night sky, and could be seen for miles

That was more noticeable at low tide—it was known locally as the

want to talk about the munitions factory at Aycliffe, now Newton
Aycliffe. In 1941, when Royal Ordnance factory No. 59 opened in
Aycliffe, the town of Newton Aycliffe did not exist; it became a new
town in 1947. The former site of the ordnance factory is now the
second-largest industrial estate in the north-east. If people go to the
industrial estate, they can still see the blast walls and some of the
buildings where munitions workers worked during that period. At its
peak, in 1943, the factory employed 17,000 people, 90% of whom were
women. Around the country, there were some 64,500 munitions workers who
filled the shells and the bullets. The importance of their work was
recognised, as they received visits from Winston Churchill, King George
VI and even Gracie Fields, who gave a beautiful rendition of the
Lord’s Prayer, which is well remembered by many of the
workers.</hs_Para>

shells and bullets is obviously dangerous work. I understand from a
study by Her Majesty’s Stationery Office in 1940 that the
Aycliffe Royal Ordnance factory produced more than 700 million bullets
during its period of operation. The work was extremely repetitive,
fragmented and boring, but there were high levels of companionship
among the women as they daily risked their lives filling bombs and
bullets. Many of the women started work at 18, but the average age was
34. Workers were supposed to be under the age of 50 to work at the
factory, but apparently a Mrs Dillon, who claimed she was 49, was
actually 69. She was the best worker in the factory, losing only two
days of work in two-and-a-half years. She received the British Empire

choice: go into the forces; be sent away to  do X,Y or Z; or
work in their local munitions factory. Many of them uprooted, went to
work in the factories, lived in barracks and contributed for the whole

as young men and women. In the Bridgend factory, with 40,000 people
working there, essentially a huge town was established, with a rail
network, new road infrastructure and so on. On the site, they had dance
halls, canteens and a massive social life. They had darts leagues,
football leagues, opera societies, a factory band and a rugby club. As

also think back to the presentation of awards and badges to the Land

made the comment, “Well, we were very lucky, we escaped the
munitions factories”, because they were given a choice: did they
want to go to work on the land, or did they want to go to the munitions
factories? Quite clearly, they wanted to be out in the open air rather
than working in a munitions factory, which they recognised was very
dangerous work. Unfortunately, that offer was not made to some people,
who were told, “You are going to munitions
factories<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T10:27:15"></hs_TimeCode>.”
We must also keep in mind that the women at that time were paid only
half what the men were being paid, so there was not just a workforce
dominated by women; there were men in the factories, who were actually
paid twice as much as the women were.</hs_Para>

have mentioned today the companionship and comradeship found in
munitions factories, and I have to say that I have found it absolutely
fascinating, during the period that the all-party group has been
established, to meet some of the women workers. They related their own
stories and I must say that some of them could not be printed in
<I>Hansard</I>, because of some of the antics that these people got up
to. They were safe in a workplace, but their antics outwith included
social events, social evenings, even cycling 10 or 15 miles to a dance.
That was not uncommon and when we consider that many of today’s
young people will ask, “Can I get a lift?”, if they are
asked to pop down to the shops, we realise that these women in the
factories were real hardy souls who saw nothing whatever as a
challenge.</hs_Para>

also experienced a lot in the workplace. We have already heard about
the “canary girls”, but all of the people in munitions

Sadly, many individuals were left disfigured because of severe acid

their teeth falling out. So it was not pretty, but it was the war

challenge that became apparent when I first raised this issue was that
we have no records of these individuals. In my home town of Annan, a
lady at the Historic Resources Centre, Renée Anderson, has a
card index system of some 2,600 members of staff who were employed. It
is fascinating. I do not know how old this lady thinks I am, but she
produced a significant number of photographs, some of which were black
and white and from way back and asked if I recognised any of the
people. Of course, I did not, but I am sure that people in the
community will come forward to try to identify them. Renée wants
to put on a display about what that site
did<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T10:33:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032643000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/halltext/130326h0001.htm#13032643000089">As
we have heard this morning, these places were secret. I met a chap a
good number of years ago who used to fly for the RAF. He said,
“We were always told to keep away from this area, because we had
no idea what was there. We were told, ‘Do not fly within this
specific zone.’” People were moving around that site
something that could, with the slightest spark, have decimated the
area. To give an example, I am sure that colleagues will remember
incidents in recent years, in Peru and Holland, where fireworks have
gone off in an enclosed area and totally destroyed it, and have taken
the paintwork off vehicles in the vicinity. That is the 
<?notus-xml column=432?>ferocity with which this material—small arms
propellant—burns. It is ferocious and, when it goes, people
stand no chance at
all<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T10:34:20"></hs_TimeCode>. That is the

latter days at the Powfoot site were spent as a production supervisor.
People in a work force do complain and my answer to complaints from
some of the guys that that was dirty, heavy work, was, “This was
women’s work during the war”—not demeaning anyone,
but just showing the fortitude of those women in ensuring that our guys
on the front line were properly

hope that the Minister will speak to his colleagues. It is little to
ask that these women get individual recognition. I know that the
records are not as we would like to  be able to identify each
and every one of them, but the information channelled to my office and
in the Historic Resources Centre in my home town is a good starting
point. I am sure that other colleagues will work tirelessly to ensure
that we get official recognition for these people who made the
difference to our troops on the front line, especially during the

the Member for Stoke-on-Trent South (Robert Flello) on his excellent
speech and on the work he is doing to promote this issue. He started by
reflecting that the debate was recognising some of the forgotten
heroes. In as much as they have been forgotten by history, the work
that the all-party group is doing and the speeches by hon. Members
today are ensuring that they are forgotten no longer. We need to
recognise the
contribution<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T10:36:32"></hs_TimeCode>
they made. My hon. Friend reflected on the huge personal risks and
sacrifices made by munitions workers, known as “canaries”
because of the effects of their work with chemicals. I endorse the work
of the all-party group. The Opposition should look to work with the
Government and the all-party group on some of the more difficult issues
to do with individual

hon. Member for Rochester and Strood (Mark Reckless) broadened the
description of people who also served. When discussing this issue, we
need to reflect on the many people who contributed in different ways to
the war effort. Steps forward have been taken in recent years to
recognise various groups, and the hon. Gentleman gave us a glimpse of
other groups that we might choose to bring under this
umbrella<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T10:37:37"></hs_TimeCode> in the
future. Perhaps inadvertently, he posed a challenge to my hon. Friend,
as the description could continue to grow. At what point do we narrow
it down? If we are asking for individual recognition, recognising that
collective recognition that is long overdue—although there are
real signs that it will be given—what work can the all-party
group, with Government and the Opposition, do to try to narrow the
description so that we can find out how many people are we talking
about, how are we going to find them, who will do the work to see who
will receive the recognition, and how we ensure that there is public
confidence that a self-certification model will not demean the
achievement in receiving it? Questions arise from the hon.

written out women’s contribution to the second world

hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies) reflected on the
importance of local munitions factories as employers in the pre-war
years. He also reflected on the fact that the big immigration concern
in the mid-1930s was whether people would come from Maesteg to steal
all the jobs. As the world has shrunk, the issue has broadened out
slightly, but it was none the less interesting to hear that concerns we
still recognise today were alive and well in Bridgend in the 1930s.

discussing this issue and the fact that I would be contributing to the

BBC’s “People’s War” website included a
contribution from the Derby action team about the war effort of
munitions factory workers in Chesterfield. It mentioned that
Chesterfield people kept a relentless black-out to ensure the factories
were never bombed, although errant German bombers accidentally bombed
the Chesterfield football ground and the Walton golf course. What the
Germans had against Chesterfield’s sporting prowess, we will
never know, but they did not manage to get to the factories.</hs_Para>

the endless lines of munitions that were produced. We have heard again
of the huge impact of this work on the social fabric, with women going
to work in factories often for the first time. That was the case in my
family: my grandmother took up work for the first time in that period
and never gave up the habit afterwards. The same thing happened across
the country, and it resulted in a permanent change in the social

older terminology. As the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent South said,
answers need to be worked out to complicated questions about the
potential formal recognition of munitions workers. There is the
question of numbers: there could be tens of thousands of people still
living who worked in munitions factories in the second world war. That
does not include those who worked in factories involved in closely
linked activities that were vital to the war effort, such as producing
airframes, ships and boats, vehicles—tanks have been

it harder still to identify all those who were involved. Manufacturing
of equipment for our armed forces was spread throughout the UK’s
extant manufacturing base, and many businesses that would not obviously
fall within the definition of munitions factories were integral to the
work. For example, small carpentry firms and furniture workshops

of a range of people.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T10:51:35"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Llanelli (Nia Griffith) talked about Les George and Pembrey
munitions factory and reminded us not only of the dangerous work done
during the war, but of the entirely necessary work that continued after
1945 to make unused munitions safe.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T10:52:01"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Sedgefield (Phil Wilson) reminded us that the work was often
repetitive and, in his word, “boring”, but that it was
none the less a proud part of the history of the town and that the work
was a source of companionship. That was not least the case in places
where it had a huge and obvious impact, such as Bridgend.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T10:52:41"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies) spoke of the massive, 40,000-person
Bridgend site and the debate about who should work there—a
debate that I entirely recognise in what has been happening this very
week. We can imagine the camaraderie in the canteen, among the foremen
of Bridgend and in the enjoyment of dance halls, opera, football and
rugby, but also in the workers’ fortitude in the face of the
danger of the task. Finally,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T10:53:20"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Dumfries and Galloway (Mr Brown) talked about his personal
experience. He provided a powerful testament to the strength and
fortitude of the women who worked in the factories during the war,
which he related to his account of the men who work in the same
factories now.</hs_Para>

drugs are affected. The level of risk is determined by known factors,
such as the particular anti-convulsant medication used and the dose
taken, as well as other susceptibility factors. Children suffering from
fetal anti-convulsant syndrome suffer from a constellation of physical

drug sodium valproate, which is manufactured under the name of Epilim

has demonstrated that it carries a higher risk to the exposed

other drugs. The first case reporting the effects of sodium valproate
during pregnancy appeared in 1981, and it grew to be a hot topic within
the medical profession in the 1980s, with numerous reports appearing in
the medical journals. The report, however, was never investigated in
the review of medicines from 1971 to 1990. The then Medicines Control
Agency, which became the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory
Agency in 2004, did not pursue the claims made by the medical research
community. The MHRA “Current Problems in
Pharmacovigilance” reports addressed the effects of sodium
valproate in January 1983 and continued to do so intermittently. No
action was taken, however, to convince Sanofi to recall the drug,
improve it, or provide comprehensive warnings to patients and their

1998, he was diagnosed with pneumonia and stayed in hospital for 10
days, at which point he was diagnosed with dextrocardia, which is a
congenital defect affecting the heart. In 2001, he started nursery and
showed signs of regression. He lacked co-ordination and was unable to
handle his emotions, as a result of which he was given a 
<?notus-xml column=441?>preliminary diagnosis of fetal valproate syndrome, another name for
fetal anti-convulsant syndrome. He was then given a firm diagnosis by a

2002, my constituent started primary school and was given a special
educational needs teacher. The same year, he was admitted to hospital
for surgery on his tonsils and adenoids and had grommets inserted. In
2003, he was admitted to hospital with problems going to the bathroom
that required surgery. He was diagnosed with pneumonia again, and with
primary ciliary dyskinesia, a genetic disorder affecting the

constituent was seen by occupational, educational and speech therapists
due to his communication problems and inability to mix with peers. In
2006, he was sent back to occupational therapy and sent for a CT scan
on his chest that showed fibrosis on the lower left lobe of his left
lung, which was found to be smaller than his right. Between 2007 and
2009, he was diagnosed several times with pneumonia and severe chest
infections requiring intense physiotherapy and antibiotics. In 2010, he
was diagnosed with pneumonia again and, after admission to hospital,
with hypoplasia of the left pulmonary artery, which had failed to

to keep up to date with known medical knowledge, conduct further
research and pass on that information to patients via the patient
information leaflet. It was the MHRA’s duty to ensure that
Sanofi investigated the medical research claims of birth defects caused
by their products. Delays by both have resulted in thousands of women

that her answer will be, “Of course not.” Is she also
aware that this year, sodium valproate will have been licensed for 40
years, and that it is now being prescribed for other conditions, such

know that the Minister cannot reinstate the legal aid funding, but
there are other things that she can do. As an aside, we should never
allow thousands of families to be affected by the malpractice of a
medical company and a failure of the state, and then not give them the
support that they need to find justice for their families. We should
never allow a situation in which people, through no fault of their own,
cannot pursue justice due to the barriers put in their way by the
system. No one who believes in the principle of fairness would think
that that was just. We all have a responsibility to ensure that we
support those families in bringing their action, so they can get some
justice. It will not be the justice that they want, which is to have
fit, healthy children, but it will be some kind of justice.</hs_Para>

pregnant women taking sodium valproate who are unaware of the dangers,
because they did not receive pre-conception counselling. Can she
confirm that she will ensure that that is corrected in future? Will she
commit to working with the Independent Fetal Anti-Convulsant Trust to

in about one third of women, and it can alter their metabolism of AEDs.
Prolonged fits can be dangerous for the baby as well as the mother, so

Majesty’s Revenue and Customs recently changed its services: it
is trying to become “leaner and more efficient”. Two
weeks ago, we learned that HMRC has hatched a plan to close all 281
inquiry centres throughout the country. Last year, those offices gave
advice to  more than 2.5 million people, but HMRC is closing
them because the number of visits has halved since 2006 and, it claims,
closing them will save £13 million a

them completely

us look first at the number of people visiting the office. The old HMRC
office was open from 9 o’clock to 5 o’clock, five days a
week; now it is open only from 10 o’clock to 3.30 pm, three days
a week. HMRC shares a building on the island, Broadlands house, with
Jobcentre Plus, so people with tax problems can often see HMRC staff
through the glass but are unable to speak to them, which is ludicrous.
Furthermore, staff are discouraged from dealing with clients
personally, face to face; instead, they must floor walk them to a free
phone in the next office and get them to speak to someone in the
contact centre on the mainland. People are not supposed simply to walk
in and get advice: if a taxpayer turns up and insists on talking to a
real live person, staff are supposed to make an appointment for another
time, a rule which applies even if the office is open and staff are
available<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T14:32:51"></hs_TimeCode>. I am
pleased that the staff on the Isle of Wight do their best to be helpful
and tend to ignore that particular edict from on high.
None<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> the less,
it is little wonder that figures show fewer personal calls being made
to inquiry
centres<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>, because
HMRC has done everything it can to make visiting in person difficult
and inconvenient. I have estimates for the island for the past two
years. In 2011-12, there were 4,925 visits to HMRC’s Newport
office and the two outreach offices; in 2012-13, that figure dropped,
but by fewer than 300, so that the total was 4,630. That is more than
4% of the island’s adult population visiting HMRC, which is
hardly

us look at the claimed savings on the Isle of Wight. The
original HMRC office in Upper St James street was closed and 36 staff
moved into the newly built Apex 
<?notus-xml column=448?>centre, although taxpayers needed to walk for 10 minutes from the bus
stop or had to drive to reach it. The move was always planned to be
temporary, and in May 2011 the HMRC office moved again, to Broadlands
house. It was anticipated that some staff would relocate to other HMRC
offices within what was described as reasonable daily travel distances,
but that turned out to be a journey of an hour and a half each way. The
majority of staff lost their jobs, and only nine people now work in the
HMRC office on the island. Broadlands house is also home to the main
Jobcentre Plus office, as I said, and to the valuation office.
HMRC’s nine remaining staff moved into empty offices in the
building, which seems an eminently sensible solution. The Government
already pay for the upkeep of the entire building, so the costs are
minimal, and it is hard to see what savings could be made on rent,
rates or utility charges from closing the office. The only other
opportunity for substantial savings, therefore, would be on
staff<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T14:36:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032651000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/halltext/130326h0001.htm#13032651000011">In
addition to being open to the public three days a week, the staff carry
out what are called personal taxes operations, which is computerised
work generated centrally. The work can be obtained by HMRC officers
anywhere in the country and includes activities such as changes to tax
codes, addresses and so on. The staff on the Isle of Wight are
justifiably proud to be achieving 100% of their target. They should be
proud: they are an efficient and experienced team—in fact, the
nine staff have a combined total of 186 years’ experience, which
may well be a record, but certainly represents a large investment by
HMRC in training and development over the
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T14:37:13"></hs_TimeCode>.
HMRC<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T14:37:43"></hs_TimeCode> claims that
it intends to deploy the staff affected by the proposed changes
elsewhere, and such experienced officers must be a valuable asset, but
there are no opportunities within reasonable daily travelling distance
from the Isle of Wight. HMRC would therefore be willing to pay the
costs for staff to relocate, not only paying the costs of removals,
legal fees, stamp duty and so on for a new house, but perhaps even
extending to cover the difference in house prices if staff move to a
more expensive part of the country. HMRC could therefore incur
significant costs for Isle of Wight staff to move elsewhere to
undertake exactly the same work that they are doing now. The alleged
£13 million savings appear take into account neither that nor
the costs of redundancy packages for staff who cannot be redeployed to
another job or do not wish to
move<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T14:38:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032651000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/halltext/130326h0001.htm#13032651000012">As
part of the plans, HMRC is going to invest in a shiny new telephone
system costing £34 million—to save £13 million a
year. Looking at HMRC’s record, I would not put my trust in that
working out too well. HMRC spends money, but that does not necessarily
bring success. Despite HMRC spending £900 million on customer
service, the Public Accounts Committee found it had “an abysmal
record”. Last year, HMRC allowed 20 million telephone calls to
go unanswered—a quarter of all the people who tried to call it.
Even its new targets for call answering are described by our colleagues
on the PAC as “woefully inadequate and unambitious”. For
callers who do get through, there can be other
problems<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T14:39:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032651000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/halltext/130326h0001.htm#13032651000013">I
want to raise an issue brought to my attention by Jonathan Isaby, of
that excellent organisation the Taxpayers Alliance. He received an
e-mail from a customer adviser working in an HMRC call service.
Apparently, advisers do not have targets based on how long a telephone
call 
<?notus-xml column=449?>takes; instead, the focus is on what they call “wrap-up
time”, which is the time after a call in which necessary
administration is carried out, such as tax coding, sending e-mails,
making referrals and updating customer
records<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.
Customer advisers are targeted to keep their wrap-up time to an
absolute minimum. They do that by putting people on hold and keeping
them on the phone unnecessarily, which increases the cost to the
taxpayer and generates income from the telephone call for HMRC. That
cannot be right and I urge the Minister to look carefully into that
allegation. I know that Mr Isaby will do all he can to assist in
getting to the bottom of
it<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032651000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/halltext/130326h0001.htm#13032651000014">For

a most important point. I feel certain that only a very few people who
currently use the face-to-face system will be offered a home visit. It
is hard to see the financial sense of somebody coming across from the
mainland to visit a small business man or an elderly pensioner on the
island, but island staff have been told categorically that the mobile

is the poor taxpayer to do if he cannot work out the answer to his

exactly what happens now on the Isle of Wight. Local staff have
introduced an outreach service in Ryde and Freshwater on the days that

islanders will not be able to visit a tax office to talk to local

HMRC staff from the mainland will travel over at huge expense to
provide a service that is already being provided by qualified,
experienced people, and those people will have been paid to move away
or made redundant. I understand the mobile teams may even hold sessions
in tax offices. They could use the empty office in Broadlands house,
which would no longer be open to the pesky public. You could not make

must be aware that a face-to-face session can achieve things that

relevant paperwork to somebody who understands it. That simply does not
happen online or over the phone, and vulnerable groups may find it
particularly difficult to engage by those means. Most people deal with
HMRC not because they want to, but because they have to. Those 2.5
million people did not go to their tax office because they wanted a

make sure that those who need advice can get it. We must make sure that
the claimed savings are not based on flawed research or shoddy decision
making. Only yesterday, the Home Affairs Select Committee highlighted
the “catastrophic leadership failure” of Lin Homer,
the current chief executive of HMRC, when she ran the UK
Border Agency. Previously, as chief executive of Birmingham city

hon. Member for Isle of Wight 
<?notus-xml column=451?>(Mr Turner) on securing this afternoon’s extremely timely and
important debate. His record of assiduously standing up for his
constituents and their interests is well known to the House. The issue
of HMRC closures is clearly of particular importance to the people
living on the Isle of Wight, given its geographical isolation from the
mainland. He set out clearly and carefully the potential impact of
HMRC’s proposals on his constituents. I look forward to hearing
the Minister’s reply and how he intends to ensure that such

timely; we heard only two weeks ago about HMRC’s proposals to
change the way in which it supports customers who need extra help.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T14:50:32"></hs_TimeCode> use the word
“customers”, because that is the language deployed by
HMRC and, no doubt, the Minister will use it in his reply, but as the
Public Accounts Committee has frequently articulated, those who come
into contact with HMRC have little choice about whether they do so.
Many of those people—an estimated 1.5 million—find
dealing with HMRC difficult because they have a disability or a mental
health condition; they have low literacy or numeracy skills; they do
not speak or read English; they do not have the confidence or capacity
to deal with what can be a very complex situation; or because of a
combination of any or all of the above. Ensuring that such people have
access to the best possible support and advice in their dealings with
HMRC is, of course, something that we all wish for, and we on the
Opposition side of the House have regularly advocated
that.</hs_Para>

without access to good broadband that allowed online dealings with HMRC
not to end in utter frustration —even when people have
broadband, it may not be sufficiently fast—but for constituents
who do not even have computers or have access to them. I will mention
later a concern in my constituency, which is that many public services,

a computer. Although we would love to live in a digital age, we are not

hon. Member for Isle of Wight, in his excellent contribution, about the
10-week consultation that was launched on 14 March, and the proposal to
close every one of the 281 inquiry centres that provide face-to-face
advice for customers. The centres are apparently to be replaced by
“more accessible”, “targeted” and
“tailored” services for people who need extra help in
engaging with HMRC, either all the time, or in response to a particular
life event, such as a bereavement. It is proposed that the new service
will include specialist 
<?notus-xml column=452?>expert help over the telephone by a new team, and
face-to-face support delivered by a mobile team of advisers, who can
meet customers at suitably convenient locations in the community, or in
their
home<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T14:52:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032651000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/halltext/130326h0001.htm#13032651000029">That
issue is particularly pertinent to me, not only in my capacity as
shadow Exchequer Secretary, responding to the debate, but because I
represent the esteemed people of Newcastle upon Tyne North, and HMRC
proposes to trial or pilot the new idea on them. From
3 June to
31<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T14:52:54"></hs_TimeCode> October, the
pilot will run throughout my region of the north-east, and
13 inquiry centres will be closed in the process. For the
record, those centres comprise Alnwick, Bishop Auckland, Hexham,
Darlington, Durham, Middlesbrough, Morpeth, Newcastle,
Stockton, Sunderland and—although I, and many proud Yorkshiremen
and women, might quibble over the Minister’s geographical
knowledge of the north-east—Bridlington, Scarborough and
York<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T14:53:41"></hs_TimeCode>.
Apparently, depending on the outcome of the consultation and the pilot,
HMRC states that it will look to introduce the new service across the
UK in February 2014, resulting in the closure of the remaining inquiry
centres between March and May next year—including the one in the
Jobcentre Plus in Newport, on the Isle of
Wight<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T14:53:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

proposal will clearly also have a direct impact on the 1,300 HMRC staff
employed in inquiry centres across the country, although I understand
the intention is that many of them will be redeployed either within
HMRC or to other parts of the civil service, and that is to be
welcomed. As I stated earlier, I fully support the notion of providing
a better service to the most vulnerable people with whom HMRC comes
into contact. I welcome the fact that HMRC has said that it is working
with TaxAid, Tax Help for Older People, the Low Incomes Tax Reform
Group, Citizens Advice, Gingerbread, the Child Poverty Action Group and
Age UK as part of the consultation on what additional support may be
required and how it might be
delivered<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T14:54:35"></hs_TimeCode>.
However, I want to probe the Minister on exactly how he thinks that
HMRC will be able to improve its performance in that area, given the
context in which the Department is operating.</hs_Para>

have previously told the Minister—indeed, only last month in
this Chamber—that serious concerns remain about the customer
service provided by HMRC. The National Audit Office report on
HMRC’s customer service performance, published in December,
revealed genuinely troubling findings about the way in which HMRC
treats some of its customers. To remind hon. Members, 20 million
telephone calls went unanswered by HMRC last year, costing customers
£33 million in call charges; that is in addition to the
estimated £103 million cost of customers’
wasted time. As I have stated previously, that is particularly worrying
for people on low incomes who cannot afford to sit waiting on the
telephone, and for small businesses that could be making much better
and more profitable use of their time, which is particularly important
in the current economic climate.</hs_Para>

Public Accounts Committee report on HMRC customer service published
earlier this month was equally scathing, describing the Department as
having an “abysmal record” in this area. Those concerns
have been echoed by eminent professional bodies, such as the Chartered
Institute of Taxation and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in
England and Wales, whose members’ surveys have found significant
concerns regarding the customer service performance of HMRC, which
often fails to meet its basic responsibilities.</hs_Para>

that there appears to have been some recent improvement in
HMRC’s handling of post, but I would be grateful if the Minister
could clarify the current position on its call-handling performance.
According to the answer to a parliamentary question I received from the
Minister only last month, the percentage of calls not handled—in
other words, unanswered—by HMRC had gone up from 25.6% last year
to 28.6% in this financial year to date. Given that we are now only
days away from the end of the financial year, will the Minister confirm
whether that fall in performance has continued, and if it has, what
specific measures has he put in place to ensure that it does not fall
further?</hs_Para>

how the department is going to improve standards of customer service,
given the prospect of its having fewer staff and receiving a higher
volume of calls, is open to question. HMRC plans to cut the number of
customer-facing staff by a third by 2015. At the same time, the
stresses associated with introducing the Real Time Information System,
Universal Credit and changes to child benefit are likely to drive up
the number of phone calls to the department…Since our hearing it
has also been announced that HMRC is to close all of its 281 enquiry
centres which give face-to-face advice to customers. This will
undoubtedly put even more pressure on phone

I question the extremely tight time scales and the nature of the

a genuinely impressive improvement in HMRC’s response times if
it were able to process and adequately respond to all the 
<?notus-xml column=454?>consultation submissions it receives in such a short period. What will
happen to the inquiry centres in the north-east if the pilot does not
turn out to be a success? Will they re-open? Indeed, what measures will
HMRC use to determine whether the north-east trial delivers what is
intended? We often hear that Government pilots are “doomed to
succeed” and I very much suspect that that is the case in the
present instance. Does the Minister share my concern that HMRC staff
have apparently already been told that it is “highly

are on the decline in the number of people using inquiry centres over

I would like to mention an important concern in addition to those that
I have raised already, and those raised by the hon. Member for Isle of
Wight. It was briefly addressed when the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr
Williams) raised it. HMRC states that it will be able to provide its
new tailored service to those customers who need most support in a
number of venues, including local libraries and community centres.
However, as I have said, hundreds of libraries, community centres and
other local facilities are either closed or facing closure as a result
of the cuts that the Government have dished out to local government
funding.</hs_Para>

cuts are being targeted at areas such as northern cities, and many of
the London boroughs with the highest needs. In such places there are
likely to be more of the type of people for whom HMRC states it wants
to provide a better service. What discussions is the Minister having
with his colleagues in the Department for Communities and Local
Government about the impact of their funding decisions on the venues
from  
<?notus-xml column=455?>which HMRC hopes to be able to provide its new

impact of these proposals on HMRC staff, as Members will be aware, HMRC
has recently written to all Members of Parliament about the proposal.
That included a confirmation of something that I want to stress again
today: that the proposals are no reflection on the dedication and
commitment of the 1,300 HMRC staff working in the inquiry centres,
including the nine staff based in Newport on the Isle of Wight. HMRC
will be looking to redeploy staff affected by the proposals, including
those in the north-east pilot area—I hesitate to call it that,
since, as the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T15:18:30"></hs_TimeCode>

the majority of affected staff—about 1,000 of them in
fact—we expect redeployment to be relatively straightforward.
Many inquiry centres are based in buildings alongside other HMRC staff,
or near other HMRC offices, where inquiry centre staff can be moved
into new roles, either in HMRC or in other Departments. There will also
be a need for staff in the new mobile face-to-face advisory service
that will be introduced, and that could include staff based on the Isle
of Wight.</hs_Para>

the skills and needs necessary for the mobile service. HMRC will work
closely with all stakeholders to ensure that customers get the service
they need. No decisions have been taken on where the people serving the
Isle of Wight will be based. I shall take on board my hon.

question. I am sure that my hon. Friend is closely informed of the job
opportunities available on the Isle of Wight. I made a general point
that HMRC will show considerable willingness to deal with staff in the
best way possible. If one looks at the scale of the reduction in the
number of people working for HMRC over a long period—since its
formation in 2005—compulsory redundancy has been necessary on a
very limited number of occasions. HMRC has a good record of ensuring
that its staff are well looked after.</hs_Para>

were raised that the closure of the inquiry centres marks the end of
HMRC’s dedicated face-to-face advisory service. I can reassure
hon. Members that that is simply not the case. A face-to-face service
is about people, not bricks and mortar. What is important is that HMRC
provides an accessible and flexible, face-to-face service that meets
the needs of customers and can be tailored to the specific needs of
particular locations, including the Isle of Wight. That is what HMRC
proposes to do, only it will do it where it is most convenient for
customers, whether that is in their local community, place of work or
even, if they so wish, in their own homes. A modern face-to-face
service is not about maintaining a patchwork network of buildings set
up in the 1950s, when the needs and expectations of customers have
changed. Inquiry centres are not universal; large parts of the UK are
not even served by them.</hs_Para>

million in 2011-12, and some inquiry centres are now open just one day
a week, because local demand is so low. I shall address the Isle of
Wight specifically. My hon. Friend quoted some numbers on the usage on
the Isle of Wight. HMRC’s management information system shows
that the Isle of Wight inquiry centre had 7,032 visitors in 2005-06,

the number of people using inquiry centres is that people prefer to use
other means of communication.

that context, it is worth turning to the research, which the hon. Lady
touched on, that helped guide HMRC in its decision. It was undertaken
by an independent agency, adhering to strict industry guidelines, and
its findings confirm that face-to-face support works best for some HMRC
customers who need extra help. It also says that any service for
customers who need extra help must be as flexible and as accessible as
possible, which is why HMRC is introducing specialist, expert
over-the-phone help and working closely with the voluntary and
community sector. A face-to-face service is an important part of the
proposal, but it is worth underlining that the inquiries of the 2.5
million or so who visit HMRC centres are satisfied over the telephone.
They use the inquiry centres to phone contact centres, which leads us
to the important issue of ensuring that contact centres provide an
adequate
service.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032651000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/halltext/130326h0001.htm#13032651000063">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T15:27:13"></hs_TimeCode>
shall take this opportunity to respond to the hon. Lady’s
questions. The number of call attempts handled for February this year
was 91.8%, which is considerably higher than it has been at any time
since HMRC’s formation. I remember that the number was 45% for
2010-11, and I think it was about 75% for the previous years, as it has
been subsequently. HMRC’s ability to handle calls has therefore
increased, which is welcome progress, and that, to be honest, is what
we should expect from HMRC—progress on the standards.</hs_Para>

elaborate on the point I made a moment or so ago, HMRC’s
analysis of inquiry centre use shows that 84% of the centres’
customers did not need a face-to-face meeting and were able to get the
help they needed over the phone or online. The 400,000 customers who
did need face-to-face advice had to travel to their nearest inquiry
centre to make an appointment, and if there was no appointment free at
that time, go back on another day to take up their appointment. The
service is not particularly convenient even for those who do have a
centre
nearby.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032651000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/halltext/130326h0001.htm#13032651000065">HMRC’s<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T15:29:22"></hs_TimeCode>
research, which I referred to a moment ago, shows that up to 1.5
million customers need extra help with their tax and benefits affairs.
Many just need help for a specific event in their lives—for
example, when they approach retirement, deal with the death of a family
member or declare new income for the first time—and others may
have low literacy or numeracy skills, or difficulties coping with their
affairs as a result of a mental health condition. Most of the 1.5
million people who need extra help do not currently use an inquiry
centre. HMRC has researched the needs of those customers and that
research has helped in the design of the new service.</hs_Para>

new service will provide specialist expert help over the phone for
those who need it, and its advisers will take the time to sort out
issues if they can. Customers will be able to phone from home and
arrange a call-back if they cannot afford the call themselves, or they
may use a free phone at a local Jobcentre Plus. Customers needing extra
help will be quickly identified and put straight through to a trained
adviser who has more time, as well as the skills, knowledge and empathy
needed to handle the inquiry at a pace that suits the
customer.</hs_Para>

time convenient to the customer. It might be at a library or a local
authority location close to the customer’s home, but I must
reassure my hon. Friend that it will not involve the Isle of Wight
ferry service. If someone needs a home visit, HMRC will arrange for a
local home visitor to contact them and arrange a convenient appointment
time between 8 am and 8 pm every working day. That is much
more convenient than being constrained to a fixed location that is
potentially difficult to access and often open for only one day a week.

14 March, HMRC launched a public consultation on how the new

following: how a new service would be delivered in practice and whether
refinements are needed for particular customer groups; the impact that
closing inquiry centres would have on local communities, customers and
diversity groups; the impact of the new service on the voluntary and
community sector; and the support needed for customers to make the
transition to other channels. The public consultation will enable staff

conclusion, HMRC is making the changes in order better to meet the
needs of the 1.5 million customers who need more help with their tax
and benefits. HMRC is modernising its approach to break free from the
outdated network of bricks and mortar and to provide a more flexible
and accessible face-to-face service for people who really need it,
including on the Isle of Wight. The proposals will target help at those
who need it most, in a way that is better for them and more

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:00:14"></hs_TimeCode>This
year’s Budget quite rightly supports those people who are
working hard and contributing to our economy. Life is tough for many
hard-working people, and we are doing all we can to support them.
Particular focus has been directed at people investing in British
businesses and employing more people. The national growth strategy has
identified sectors of our economy that are strong, that are growing and
that have the opportunity to generate increased wealth for our nation
by making more things and exporting them
overseas<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:00:54"></hs_TimeCode>. In the
next 10 minutes or so, I would like the Minister to think
about another army of workers that needs our support right
now—Britain’s

farmers, and food and drinks manufacturers are quite rightly identified
as significant contributors to our economy and to our future
prosperity. In my constituency, this sector is helping to lead the way
towards sustainable, export-driven growth. Food, drink and farming
businesses employ nearly a third of working people across Cornwall.
Local products include the iconic pasty, the native oyster, wine,
cider, beer, soft fruit and vegetables, and even tea, which is grown at
Tregothnan and exported to
China<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:01:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032651000078" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/halltext/130326h0002.htm#13032651000078">Nationally,
the agri-food and drink sector contributes £85 billion a year to
the UK economy and provides employment for 3.5 million people. Without
a strong work force of bees, we will not be able to realise the
potential of this sector in the coming years. Nearly all the drinks and
food that I have mentioned need bees as pollinators. Bees deliver that
service better than anything else in our ecosystem. It is estimated
that manual pollination, which is the only option if a catastrophic
decline in bee numbers takes place, would cost British farmers up to
£1.8 billion every year. Don’t get
me<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:02:19"></hs_TimeCode>
wrong—like all wildlife, the bee population is important in its
own right, and as part of a balanced ecosystem, which is vital for our
health and well-being. However, as we are so rightly focused at the
moment in Parliament on the economy, the focus of my speech is on the
economic benefits of bee
health<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:02:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032651000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/halltext/130326h0002.htm#13032651000079">The
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has done much to try
to understand why the bee population in Britain, the EU and the USA is
declining. In the UK alone, the number of managed honey bee colonies
fell by 53% between 1985 and 2005. I know that my right hon. Friend the
Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:03:05"></hs_TimeCode>understands
that pollinators, including bees, are essential to the health of our
natural environment and to the prosperity of our farming industry.
DEFRA has estimated that pollination is worth several hundred million
pounds every year. Also, bees are among our greatest allies in
delivering DEFRA’s twin priorities of animal health and plant
health<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:03:23"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Department is implementing the healthy bees plan, working with
beekeepers to provide training and respond to pest and disease threats.
Within that plan, DEFRA’s national bee unit provides inspection,
diagnostic and training services to beekeepers. Before  I

as a whole, these measures represent a lot of different activities that
are focused on trying to understand why bees are declining, and on
taking action to reverse that trend. Most recently, DEFRA has been
involved at the EU level in considering the restriction of some
chemicals that are used mostly by our cereal crop farmers as
pesticides. Just last week, the chief scientific adviser told the
Select Committee on Science and Technology, of which I am a member,
that he did not feel that there was sufficient evidence to ban the
chemicals that are under consideration, but that we should keep the
decision under review while awaiting more scientific evidence. He also
said that we need to bear in mind the impact of withdrawing the
chemicals in the pesticides, including the impact that would have on
food prices, especially the prices of winter wheat and
rape.</hs_Para>

Hugh Sykes, who is the chairman of the Winchester and District
Beekeepers Association, and whom I have met many times, has been in

constituents—on this subject, and he contacted me specifically
about the recent vote on the issue in Europe. Does my hon. Friend know
why our right hon. Friend
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:05:37"></hs_TimeCode> Secretary of

Also, although I appreciate what she is saying, does she not agree that
until the science is proven on this particular pesticide—the

hundreds of constituents on this issue—I am sure that all MPs

in our environment and care for it, which is to be welcomed as it is a

far as I understand from my correspondence with the Secretary of State,
the reason for the abstention, which was backed up by the chief
scientific adviser, is that the evidence is not clear as to how harmful
some of these chemicals are. DEFRA operates on the precautionary
principle when making decisions. It has agreed to ensure that the
research in this area is kept open and continues, and it has also
agreed that if any harmful impact is detected, it will, of course, act.
I hope that my hon. Friend, when he has listened to more of what I have
to say, will understand that I think we need a more holistic approach
to how we are handling this problem. Much as I would love to think that
there is one silver bullet, there probably is not, and we need to
consider all the different contributing factors that have been leading,
undeniably, to bee decline.</hs_Para>

return to the impact of reducing the use of these pesticides. Reducing
their use would also reduce the quantity of crops, and that could have
a detrimental effect on the bee population because it would reduce some
of the bees’ foraging habitat, as well as reducing
biodiversity.</hs_Para>

Shannon</B> (Strangford) (DUP):</Member> I congratulate the hon. Lady
on bringing this matter to the House. I can well remember those halcyon
days of the late 1960s and early 1970s when I was a young boy down in
Clady outside Strabane. In those days, the sun shone regularly; it does
not seem to shine as much now. Does she feel that the change in weather
conditions is one of the factors contributing to the decline of bee
numbers across the whole of the United Kingdom, including Northern
Ireland? The reason I well recall that time in Clady as a young boy is
that bees’ honeycombs were something that we prized zealously
and refused to share with anyone. I am hoping that those days will
return and that the bees can come back, because they are important for
the countryside. There were bog meadows and open land, and there was
not the same agricultural intensification that there is now. Does she
feel that those things are also important factors, and that perhaps we
need to see more land set aside?</hs_Para>

Newton:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman makes a very good point. I
know, for example, that last year beekeepers in Cornwall, like
beekeepers all over the country, had to feed their bees in the hives
because of the appalling weather. Where we have bees in managed
colonies, that is fine, but the wild bees and solitary bees are not
receiving that sort of care and attention, and they will be even worse
affected by the weather. Without those beekeepers feeding the bees in
their hives, we would have seen an even greater loss of bee numbers.
Look at the weather outside today. Lots of flowers are blossoming,
which the bees would naturally be pollinating, but what with the
freezing temperatures and the winds, the bees will, rightly, be huddled
up in their
hives<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:09:51"></hs_TimeCode>, relying
on beekeepers to feed them until the wind drops and temperatures rise,
so that they can venture
outside<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:10:00"></hs_TimeCode>.
Undoubtedly, climate change will be having an impact on bees. When I
talk about research, I shall mention that as one factor contributing to
what is happening to all the bee
colonies.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032651000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/halltext/130326h0002.htm#13032651000089">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:10:33"></hs_TimeCode>

additional investment of £1.3 billion in research budgets over

a pesticide is released on to the market only after an average of nine
years’ extensive research. However, as recent news about
antibiotics has shown, sometimes Government intervention is needed. The
chief medical officer has recently warned that, because antibiotics are
relatively cheap and not very profitable to pharmaceutical companies,
they have made little investment in innovation. As a result, we face
humans becoming immune to current antibiotics within the next 20
years—a risk to our well-being greater than climate change. The
chief medical officer has called on the Government to use some of the
money earmarked for investment in science to discover the next
generation of antibiotics. She has also highlighted the need for

evidence that bee populations are declining is clear. We have talked
about that in respect of honey bees, but it also applies to wild bees
and solitary bees. If we stand by and allow this decline to carry on,
it would hit key sectors of our economy hard. The Government’s
investment in a range of activities and research aimed at slowing this
decline, and better understanding it, is to be welcomed. Now is the
time to move to the next stage: to put together a holistic
cross-departmental strategy aimed at developing new
biodiversity-friendly approaches to crop protection that the rest of
the world will welcome. Now is the time to show British bees, British
farmers and the British food and drink producers that we are on their
side, and will work with them to tackle this significant problem for
our health, our well-being and our

healthy bee population is crucial not only to agriculture, but to the
environment and the economy, so we have to get this right. I have a
record of raising these issues when in opposition: some five or six
years ago, I was one of those who was pressing strongly for a proper
approach to bee health and for the then Government to invest in it. It
is therefore a particular pleasure for me to respond to this debate on
behalf of my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:19:23"></hs_TimeCode>
noble friend Lord De Mauley, whose responsibility it is, and to
highlight what we have been doing to improve bee health and our future

the past five years there has been a welcome resurgence in interest in
keeping bees. Many new beekeepers have turned to local and national
beekeeping associations for information and support on how best to look
after the pollinator species. The British Beekeepers Association, for
example, reports that its membership has increased from some 16,500 in
2009 to 25,000 in 2013.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:20:06"></hs_TimeCode> Government
are playing their part in supporting and maintaining that growth in
interest. The main focus of our efforts to protect bee health is
through the work of the national bee unit, which is acknowledged as
having one of the best bee health surveillance programmes in
Europe<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:20:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032651000102" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/halltext/130326h0002.htm#13032651000102">It
might be helpful if I quickly set out what the national bee unit does.
First, it has an inspection and enforcement role: the unit
has a team of some 60 professional bee inspectors out in the
field controlling notifiable diseases and surveying for exotic pests.
Thanks to their work and the results of the random apiary survey, which
is internationally probably one of the biggest bee health surveys of
its kind ever undertaken, we now have a detailed understanding of the
health status of the nation’s bees and can use that information
to target our inspection programmes to best effect. I am pleased to
report that the incidence of the two notifiable
diseases—European and American foul brood—remains
nationally low, with infection rates around half those observed during
the 1990s. Also, most importantly, no evidence has been found of exotic
pests, such as the small hive beetle, and the pests remain
absent from the UK.</hs_Para>

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:09:59"></hs_TimeCode> national bee
unit and its inspectors provide advice and support to beekeepers on
pests and diseases, with emphasis on varroa management, during their
inspection visits, or through training and education programmes jointly
run with beekeeping associations. Last year, the unit took part in
nearly 500 training events attended by more than 22,000
beekeepers<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.
Guidance is also provided online: the unit’s website, BeeBase,
provides a wide range of information for beekeepers to help keep their
honey bees healthy and productive. I am pleased to report that the
number of beekeepers registered on BeeBase has increased from some
12,000 in 2006 to more than 29,000 today. All those services are
provided by the inspectors without
charge<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:22:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032651000104" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/halltext/130326h0002.htm#13032651000104">Protecting
bee health is not something the Government can achieve by themselves,
nor should it be. The various challenges and threats can be properly
addressed only through effective partnership working. The Government
are co-funding a range of beekeeping association-led initiatives that
are already beginning to deliver improvements with, for example, 400
new beekeeper trainers being trained and a suite of new training
materials and courses 
<?notus-xml column=466?>already
available<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:22:39"></hs_TimeCode>. One
of those programmes is the development of an apprenticeship scheme to

the Bee Farmers’ Association to develop the programme
further.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032651000105" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/halltext/130326h0002.htm#13032651000105">That
is the context of what we are doing, but I know my hon. Friend and many
of our constituents are worried about the perceived threat from the
neonicotinoids. I take that threat extremely seriously. We must take
any threat to bees and pollinators seriously, and we have kept the
evidence on neonicotinoids under open-minded scrutiny. We have
consistently made it clear that we will restrict the use of such
products if the evidence shows the need. That is the crucial point for
us at the moment as a Department that works on the basis of
evidence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:23:43"></hs_TimeCode>.
Although the potential for toxic effects has been shown, Government
scientists and the independent Advisory Committee on Pesticides last
year advised that the evidence then available did not indicate harmful
exposure in the field. The field evidence is limited, however, and
focused on honey bees, so we commissioned research on the field effects
of neonicotinoids on bumble
bees<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:24:12"></hs_TimeCode>. That work
has just been completed and the results are positive, although not
conclusive. In particular, the researchers found no relationship
between colony growth and neonicotinoid residues in pollen or nectar in
the
colonies.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032651000106" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/halltext/130326h0002.htm#13032651000106">Following
completion of the study, DEFRA has drawn up a short
assessment of all the key current evidence, which I have arranged to be
placed in the Library— hon. Members might like to look
at it. The assessment  cannot exclude rare effects of
neonicotinoids on bees in the field, but suggests that those effects do
not occur  in normal circumstances. We are also analysing the
implications for the environment and for agriculture of possible
restrictions on neonicotinoids. If neonicotinoids were not available,
farmers would switch to alternative insecticides that remain legally
available, and it is important to understand the implications of
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:25:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032651000107" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/halltext/130326h0002.htm#13032651000107">The
European Commission proposed significant restrictions on
neonicotinoids, which, as my hon. Friend mentioned, was put to a vote
on 15 March. The United Kingdom abstained. I underline that we did not
take that step because we have closed our mind to taking action; we
abstained because the Commission’s proposal was not well thought
through. We have urged the Commission to complete the scientific
assessment, taking account of our new research. We have also emphasised
the need to assess the impacts of action, so that the measures taken
are proportionate to the risks. We will continue to make that case in
Europe<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:26:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032651000108" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/halltext/130326h0002.htm#13032651000108">The
difference between the laboratory tests on which much of the
information is based and the field trials that we have now undertaken
is that the dosage levels are not comparable. The dosage in the field
is much lower than that used in the laboratory experiments, so the
toxicity might not be demonstrable or replicable in field conditions.
We need to investigate that important aspect

he, as a secondary step, or perhaps as a compromise, consider doing
what 
<?notus-xml column=467?>many have recommended, which is introducing a moratorium on the use of
neonicotinoids for non-farm applications, such as golf courses, private

have been in the House for more than three decades, and I have
witnessed many so-called welfare reform measures, but I have never
witnessed a measure as grossly unfair as this one. As the Minister well

Government have a fig leaf to parade around to cover their nakedness,
and no doubt we will hear about it. They will say that there is a huge
number of people in social housing properties who have too many

strongly about what the Government are doing to my constituents and
similarly placed constituents around the country that I call on both
social housing and housing association landlords to defy the measures,
not by not operating them, but by doing what landlords did after the
nine years’ war, when a Government similarly stretched for money
imposed a window tax. In many instances—we see it in older
properties in our constituencies—landlords bricked up windows. I
hope that landlords will brick up the doors to spare bedrooms and,
where appropriate, knock down the walls, so that the properties can
safely fit the tenants. I have never before asked for direct action. I
do so now because I feel that the measures are grossly unfair. In more
than three decades, I have never debated such a vicious cut. Even if
most people wished to do what the Government want them to do, they
would be unable to do it.</hs_Para>

background to the case is that the Government claim that there are 1
million spare bedrooms throughout the country, and that the subsidy for
those spare bedrooms costs £500 million. If only they could get
people to move around to fit into the accommodation that the Government
would like them to have, £500 million in public expenditure
would be saved. The means of doing so are as follows. From April this
year, those who have one so-called spare bedroom will lose 14% of their
housing benefit, and those who have two spare rooms will lose 25% of
their housing benefit.</hs_Para>

it comes into effect in our constituencies. We know that about one
third of social tenants will be affected, and that their average loss
of benefit will be £14 a week. We know that 40,000 will lose
their entitlement entirely, and, as I said, a higher percentage of
tenants in the north-west will be affected than in London and the
south-east.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032651000120" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/halltext/130326h0002.htm#13032651000120">In
this debate, I will rely on figures supplied by Riverside, one of the
larger housing associations offering accommodation to my constituents.
Some 25% of its 
<?notus-xml column=469?>tenants will be affected by this vicious little measure, and 20% of
tenants of Wirral Partnership Homes will be affected. Let us look at
the facts that Riverside dug out. In the three years between 2008 and
2011, in one part of my constituency, Tranmere and Rock Ferry, 
500 new tenancy allocations were made. Of those households, 302 needed
one bedroom, yet only 126 one- bedroom flats were available.
Even if those tenants wanted accommodation that fitted their needs as
defined by the Government, they would not be able to meet the policy.
Riverside sensibly asked those who would be affected by this vicious
little measure what they intended to do to try to balance the books.
Some 32% said that they would try to move to smaller properties, 11%
said that they would ask people in their household to help them pay the
rent, 16% said that they would ask people outside their household, 17%
said that they would try to earn extra money, 9% said that they would
take a lodger, and 42% said that they would probably fail to pay the
rent.</hs_Para>

dwell on two aspects. One is the 17% who said that they would try to
earn more money. One of the Merseyside police’s worries about
the measure is that there has been a significant increase in the number
of people being encouraged to use spare bedrooms to grow pot. One
consequence of this Government action will be to enable those gangs who
try to enrol vulnerable constituents to make extra money in that way.
That will be a real first for the Government. They should be proud,
shouldn’t they?</hs_Para>

look at the 42% who will fail to pay their rent. They will face
eviction due to significant reductions in their income. Of course, they
will try for a time to cut down on other necessities, such as fuel. I
can switch on the heating, but unlike me, many of my constituents do
not switch it on during the day. They will now spend even less time
with their heating on. Others will eat a far less healthy
diet.</hs_Para>

comes to shove, what will those with children do? They might let their
rent fall into arrears, which the Government do not seem to realise is
a far better option than not paying other bills, because other bills
attract penal rates of interest if they are not paid, and as
yet—although no doubt there will be a measure to help
them—local authorities and housing associations cannot enforce

right hon. Gentleman’s speech was made in a vacuum, without
mention of the fiscal context or how we treat other tenants. He used
various lurid adjectives to describe the policy, as though it was some
uniquely unfair concept that where benefits are paying someone’s
rent, the level of benefits should have regard to the size of the
household. He suggested that this is some unprecedented, evil thing,
the like of which he has never 
<?notus-xml column=471?>come across in 30 years in Parliament—except that he was a
Minister in my Department and, intermittently, a supporter of the
previous Government, who introduced the local housing alliance. As I am
sure he knows, with that allowance we say to private sector tenants on
housing benefit that, broadly speaking, the rents we pay will reflect
household size: generally, if not universally, someone can have private
rent up to, now, the 30th percentile of rents for a
household of the size it is. For some years, therefore, we have said to
1 million LHA private sector tenants, “We won’t pay
benefit for an extra bedroom. If you want one, that’s fine, but
you pay for
it.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032651000135" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/halltext/130326h0002.htm#13032651000135">If<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:44:42"></hs_TimeCode>

it squalid, evil and unprecedented for social tenants? Surely
consistency and fairness—a word the right hon. Gentleman
used—mean that we should treat people the same way, whether they
are private sector or social tenants. One might argue, indeed, that
social tenants generally have the advantage of a subsidised rent, which
private sector tenants do not have, and we treat private sector tenants

decide that, notwithstanding the financial pressures on them, £2
a day for the advantage of that extra bedroom is a price that they will
pay. There will also be many other responses. The right hon. Gentleman
mentioned taking in lodgers, and some housing associations and local
authorities have given their tenants advice on how to do that. It is
good use of a spare room, because it provides accommodation to someone,

but I can save the landlords he is seeking to send down that track the
trouble. If, for example, they want to designate a property with one
bedroom occupied and a spare bedroom as a one-bedroom property, they
can do so. They do not need to brick anything up or knock any walls
down; they can simply designate it as a one-bedroom property. They will
take the lower rent, but the tenant is not under-occupying. The
reduction in the spare-room subsidy would not apply because there is
not a spare room; it is the landlord who takes the financial hit in
that situation.

authority has, on occasion, followed such a policy. If landlords decide
that that is the best solution, we have no problem with that.
Obviously, we get the saving, because we are only paying the rent for a
one-bedroom property and not a two-bedroom property, so if local
authorities and other landlords can bear the financial impact, that
might be a part of the mix. I do not think that many will be able to do

£1 million in that local authority and about £150 million

payment contribution of £464,000 for the current year, but has a
carryover that takes it up to £522,000. I am happy to write to
him with figures for the country. That is not a one-off example. It is
surprisingly common. I have spoken to local authority leaders in the
past few weeks who have said, “We are not spending the money we
have got.” We and they need to make sure that the money that is
specifically there for hardship is actually

Webb:</Member></B> We expect local authorities to budget, but of course
this measure comes into effect on a single day, and good landlords and
good local authorities have already been looking at the existing stock
of people. 
<?notus-xml column=474?>It is by definition a stock of people that does not turn over very much,
so it is pretty predictable. My plea to local authorities is to use the
money that we have given
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032651000155" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/halltext/130326h0002.htm#13032651000155"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:53:26"></hs_TimeCode>We
have given local authorities discretionary money, initially with two
groups in mind. The first is people whose houses have been
substantially adapted for disability. We accept that if there is a
spare bedroom in a house that has been completely redone to reflect
wheelchair access or whatever, it is not cost-effective, sensible or
humane to say, “You’ve got to move,” and then
either the public purse has to pay for another property to be done up
or the people have to live somewhere
inappropriate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:53:54"></hs_TimeCode>.
We estimate that, nationwide, roughly £25 million of the
potential saving from the measure would be related to properties of
that sort. Our initial plan was to try to define that centrally in
regulations: what is a substantially adapted property? We then took the
view that it is better left to local discretion, so we made the money
available
locally<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:54:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032651000156" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/halltext/130326h0002.htm#13032651000156">We
did the same for foster families who have a spare room because they are
between foster children. Most people would accept that foster parents
need to have a spare room. Initially, we thought that we would support
that through £5 million of discretionary payments, but the
message we got back was that foster families wanted to have a right to
a room and not to be reliant on a discretionary payment from the
council. We have now passed regulations, which will come into force
next month, that give foster families the right to a spare bedroom,
subject to certain constraints.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:54:47"></hs_TimeCode>We have also
recently made it clear that where, for example, a child with a
disability or health condition cannot sleep in  the same

having satisfied itself that it is a valid claim, can allocate an extra
bedroom.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032651000157" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/halltext/130326h0002.htm#13032651000157">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:43:53"></hs_TimeCode>
stress that the measure is not a crude one-size-fits-all cut. We have
to save money. The right hon. Gentleman knows that we have to save
money and that housing benefit is one of the biggest working age
benefits that we have. He knows that two thirds of the housing benefit
bill is for social tenants and that we have already cut back on the
housing benefit bill for private tenants. In the context of needing to
save money on social tenants’ housing benefit bill, not paying
for spare bedrooms seems to be a place where we can find savings,
subject to the crucial proviso that we protect the most
vulnerable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032651000158" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/halltext/130326h0002.htm#13032651000158"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:55:43"></hs_TimeCode>We
have protected the most vulnerable through discretionary housing
payments. Of course, although local authorities can use such payments
for substantially adapted properties, the clue is in the title: they
are “discretionary” payments. Local authorities have the
payments for this purpose and for other changes. They have core
discretionary housing payments that they had anyway, before any of the
measures came in. Local authorities have that pot of money, which is of
course not limitless and does not cover everybody, but at least it
gives them the flexibility to respond to people as they come to them.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:56:15"></hs_TimeCode> crucial
thing for anybody listening to our proceedings who is concerned about
the impact of the measure is that if people genuinely need the
additional room, and if the options that some would take up, such as
swapping, taking in a lodger or working extra hours, are not options
for them, they should approach the local
authority<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:56:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Gentleman said that if people move into the private sector, it will
cost money, but that is a very static way of looking at things. When
somebody moves out of the social sector and into the private sector, a
social sector property will be freed up that someone perhaps paying a
high rent in the private sector will move into. It is not self-evident
that in cases where someone moves from the social sector to the private
sector, it costs money overall. Yes, we are trying to save money, and
half a billion pounds will be saved by the measure, but let me set that
in context: in the final year of the previous Labour Government, we
were trying to fill a hole not of half a billion pounds, but of
£150 billion a year. The right hon. Gentleman objects to the
measure, but it illustrates the scale of the task we have been faced
with. Even a measure such as this, which has been controversial and
difficult, saves only half a billion pounds, and we have had to take
many more such decisions to deal with the fiscal
deficit.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032651000160" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/halltext/130326h0002.htm#13032651000160"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:57:36"></hs_TimeCode>Good
things are going on in local authority areas, such as that of the right
hon. Gentleman. I welcome the fact that housing associations and
councils are pooling their stock to enable people to exchange. My local
housing association and others have had what they call
“speed-dating” events—I am not being flippant;
that is what they call them. They try to bring together people from
among their tenants, some of whom have a spare room and some of whom
are desperate for a family home. I think of a constituent of mine who
contacted me after receiving a letter about this. She said, “I
am living on my own in a three-bedroom house. What are my options?
Actually, could my brother and sister-in-law move in?” I said,
“Absolutely. Talk to the landlord.” 
<?notus-xml column=476?>That was an ideal outcome: it meant that the housing stock was better
used and someone else had suitable
housing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032651000161" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/halltext/130326h0002.htm#13032651000161"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:58:28"></hs_TimeCode>To
summarise, the way in which people respond to the measure will be
individual and varied. Some will be able to exchange with someone else.
Some will stay where they are, regarding £2 a day, on average,
as worth paying for that spare bedroom. Some will fill the spare
bedroom with a lodger. As the right hon. Gentleman colourfully
suggests, some landlords will redesignate properties, so that in effect
there is not a spare bedroom, and the landlord will take the cost. Some
people will go to the local authority, and we have put money into the
pockets of local authorities such as his—nearly
£1 million in the Wirral—so that the most
vulnerable people can go to their local authority and make their case
and be
heard.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032651000162" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/halltext/130326h0002.htm#13032651000162">Again<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:59:14"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-26T16:59:32"></hs_TimeCode>,
I urge the local authorities to spend the money that they have been
given to help people, because we have sought to protect the most
vulnerable. We have sought to protect families with disabled children,
fosterers, and people with service personnel living at home. We have
given local authorities the ability to respond on a case-by-case basis.
None of these decisions is easy, but they are necessary decisions that
we have sought to mitigate where possible. We are trying to bring about
a beneficial effect: to make better use of scarce social housing stock
and to create fairness between private and social tenants, which, I
have to say, in the past, we have not
had.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032651000163" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/halltext/130326h0002.htm#13032651000163"><I>Question

borrower’s income is below the threshold, which is 85% of the

believe that there is a great opportunity for UK industry to become
more efficient, save carbon and prosper in a low-carbon future,
provided it looks ahead and prepares now. Different industry sectors
face very different challenges. The key to greater efficiency and lower
emissions lies in the nature of the particular industrial processes
employed in each

with the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, my Department
will work with industry over the next two years to develop a low-carbon
“road map” for each industrial sector for the long term,
focusing on the sectors that use the greatest amount of heat and
represent the greatest carbon emissions. Through closer working with
the companies themselves, we aim to understand more about how energy is
used in each of these sectors and how it can be
decarbonised.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13032652000272" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/wmstext/130326m0001.htm#13032652000272"><I>Heat

networks will be an important part of our low-carbon future—with
the potential to provide heat to dense urban areas at a lower cost and
with lower emissions. I am today announcing support to promote their
deployment. To overcome the initial hurdle of heat network development,
DECC will provide £6 million over the next two years. This will
help authorities to carry out heat network planning and development,
bringing forward projects to the stage where they are suitable for

Government continue to make progress towards finalising all the details

RHI—the first scheme of its kind in the world. We intend to
announce the final details of the domestic and expansions to the
non-domestic RHI in summer 2013 and open the schemes for payment from
spring 2014. To provide continued support to the domestic renewable
heat market in the interim period we will extend the renewable heat
premium payment scheme for a further year to March 2014 with the same
level of support as in 2012-13. This will not affect current

non-domestic RHI has been available for just over one year. In response
to uptake of the policy and stakeholder feedback, my Department has
looked at the evidence on the cost data and heat usage assumptions used
to set the level of tariffs when the scheme was launched, alongside the
level of uptake so far under the scheme. I concluded that some new
input assumptions should now be adopted and my Department is working to
identify what impacts this will have on tariffs. Later this spring, I
propose to launch a short consultation on some tariff changes and to
confirm our decisions in the autumn. We are progressing this work as
quickly as possible. Subject to the necessary approvals and acceptable
modelling outputs, I expect the outcome of this review to come into
force by spring 2014. Where tariffs increase as a result of this
review, it is DECC’s intention that installations accredited
from 21 January 2013—when the early tariff review was first
announced—would also benefit from that
increase.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13032652000278" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/wmstext/130326m0001.htm#13032652000278">Where
there is compelling evidence, I expect to consult on increased tariffs
for some technologies and to leave other tariffs unchanged via this
review process. The degression mechanism the Government announced in
February will be used to reduce tariffs if required, according to our
policy for budget management. Where we consulted on introducing new
technologies into the scheme in September, we will provide an update on
modelled tariffs as part of the consultation. However, decisions on
their inclusion in the scheme and the final tariff level will be
announced in the summer in the Government’s response to the

historically based to area-based payments for those regions which have
not already achieved that transition—and the designation of
areas of natural constraint; and in particular, a change which was
designed to clarify that implementation decisions on all aspects of the

“greening” of the CAP, which will involve part of the
subsidy envelope being paid on the basis of compliance with
environmental measures, should be delivered through a simple system, to
achieve environmental benefits without imposing unnecessary costs on
farmers, and to secure value for taxpayers. Council agreed to include
an option for member states to design their own certification scheme to

compromise and fought off calls for the end to be in 2020. The result
is that sugar beet quotas will finally be scrapped benefiting consumers
and our food processing industries. It is also important that we ensure

payments, will be allowed to pay up to 7% of their direct payment
budget as coupled payments. The remaining member states will be allowed
up to 12%. I was disappointed that the Council proposed that coupled

horsemeat.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13032652000296" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/wmstext/130326m0001.htm#13032652000296">In
addition to the results of 5,430 industry tests reported to the House
on 4 March 2013, <I>Official Report</I>, column 54WS, the Food
Standards Agency has received further results from the UK-wide
authenticity survey of beef products. The survey is of beef products on
sale at a range of retail and catering outlets, with samples 
<?notus-xml column=91?>being collected by local authority enforcement officers across the UK.
Public analysts are testing these products for both horse and pig DNA.
While the majority of testing has been completed, results of some
analysis are still
awaited.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13032652000297" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/wmstext/130326m0001.htm#13032652000297">A
total of 364 samples have been taken in the first two phases of this
survey, including beef burgers, beef meatballs, minced beef, beef ready
meals and tinned beef products. Two products have been identified which
did not meet the sampling and analytical criteria, giving 362 samples
on which the Food Standards Agency will be reporting. Results for five
samples are in dispute. Where results are disputed, a retained portion
of the food sample may be sent for further, independent
analysis.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13032652000298" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/wmstext/130326m0001.htm#13032652000298">Of
the 357 samples for which analysis has been completed, all but five
were clear of both horse and pig DNA at the 1% reporting limit. Two
samples contained over 1% horse DNA and three samples contained over 1%

the Food Standards Agency

Food Standards Agency met representatives of the food industry on 14
March to discuss future collaboration and reporting of test results.
There was general agreement on four areas of future collaboration, for
each of which the Food Standards Agency will now draw-up implementation
plans. These areas are describing good practice for food businesses in
assuring their food chains, with a particular focus on supporting small
and medium-sized food businesses; an improved framework for securing
and sharing intelligence; developing shared priorities for future food
authenticity work; and creating a repository for sharing data and
information.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13032652000301" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/wmstext/130326m0001.htm#13032652000301">Food
industry representatives also agreed to continue to provide data on
their ongoing tests for horse DNA in processed beef products, with
identification of individual products testing positive above the 1%
reporting limit. The Food Standards Agency will next publish a summary
of this information in early June, and will continue to report
individual products testing positive above the 1% reporting limit as
soon as they are confirmed by the food
industry.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13032652000302" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/wmstext/130326m0001.htm#13032652000302">Although
in the short-term our priority has been to focus on the deliberate
substitution of beef with horse, this does not mean that we have

recognise that even trace levels of pork contamination, below the 1%
threshold, are unacceptable to some faith communities. Where a product
is labelled as Halal and is found to contain traces of horse or pig
DNA, the relevant local authority will investigate each case and take
steps to ensure that consumers are
informed.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13032652000304" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/wmstext/130326m0001.htm#13032652000304">It
remains the responsibility of all food businesses (including
processors, catering suppliers and retailers) to ensure that the food
they sell is what it says it is on the label, and Kosher and Halal
certification bodies have a part to play in this. Any claims on a
product certified by a certification body must be accurate. It is for
the certification body to set out the standards which 
<?notus-xml column=92?>a certified product must meet, and for that body to work with food
businesses to ensure those standards are adhered
to.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13032652000305" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/wmstext/130326m0001.htm#13032652000305">On
14 March senior officials from DEFRA, Food Standards Agency, DCLG and

courts and judiciary command great respect around the world and we

Secretary of State for Transport (Mr Patrick McLoughlin):</Member></B>
This morning I have announced to the stock market our long-term plans
for rail franchising.  
<?notus-xml column=96?>This plan is designed to drive improvements to rail services, deliver on
major infrastructure projects, and put passengers at the heart of a
revitalised rail franchising
system.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13032652000334" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/wmstext/130326m0001.htm#13032652000334">In
addition to publishing a detailed timetable for all rail franchises
over the next eight years, I am announcing the immediate start of the
competition for the east coast franchise, currently directly operated,
with the expectation the new franchisee will carry its first passengers
by February
2015.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13032652000335" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/wmstext/130326m0001.htm#13032652000335">The
new programme will provide long-term certainty to the market and
support the delivery of the Government’s £9.4 billion
rail investment strategy for 2014-19. The future competitions will also
place passengers in the driving seat by ensuring that their views and
satisfaction levels are taken into account when deciding which
companies run our railway
services.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13032652000336" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/wmstext/130326m0001.htm#13032652000336">In
rolling out the programme the Department for Transport will work
closely with the industry to negotiate further new services and more
capacity in all franchising contracts while delivering the best deal
for both passengers and
taxpayers.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13032652000337" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/wmstext/130326m0001.htm#13032652000337">Delivering
on Brown review recommendations, the new programme will provide a more
sustainable schedule for rail franchising by delivering no more than
three to four competitions per year, and staggering the two principal
inter-city franchises, west coast and east coast, so they will not be
let at the same point in the economic
cycle.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13032652000338" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/wmstext/130326m0001.htm#13032652000338">In
order to roll out the programme and stagger future competitions, it
will be necessary to exercise a number of contractual extensions with
current operators and to negotiate a series of direct awards with
current operators. During these discussions the Department will look to
negotiate further passenger benefits, which will ensure the best deal
for tax payers. As a result, I will later today be serving notice on
First Capital Connect and Southeastern to call seven period extensions
available in their
contracts.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13032652000339" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/wmstext/130326m0001.htm#13032652000339">The

the very high quality and the maturity of the bids provided by the two

protects the safety of individuals in our maritime industries and in
dangerous conditions on land and around our coastline, it is vital that
we had a robust competition with credible and thoroughly developed

capacity and connectivity between major cities of the north, midlands
and London. Journey time improvements will be possible from new
classic-compatible high speed trains serving destinations on the east

and freight services on the east coast main line offering more

Detained Fast Track process deals with applications for asylum that
appear, after screening, to be ones where a quick decision can be made.
The system operates flexibly and in cases where it becomes apparent
that an application is more complicated and cannot be determined within
the Detained Fast Track time-scale, the case is taken out of the
process and the claimant normally released from detention.
The Government believes that the process provides claimants with the
necessary time and opportunity to enable their applications to be
justly decided and heard. The Agency will continue to seek to process
as many cases that fall within the criteria through this process.
Numbers of eligible cases and therefore detention requirements are
difficult to predict given that entry levels rely on
intake.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13032680000032" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/text/130326w0001.htm#13032680000032">Asylum:

requests from disabled people and disability organisations to improve
work opportunities for individuals with learning difficulties by
supporting the development of a national steering group entitled The
Hidden Impairment National Group (HING). The main aim of the HING is to
improve the DWP customer service experience for people with a range of
learning difficulties including: Autistic Spectrum Conditions including
Asperger Syndrome, ADHD, Dyslexia, Dyspraxia, Dyscalculia, Speech and

by DWP, has a strong and productive membership including disabled
people with Hidden Impairment conditions, medical professionals and

HING has had a significant impact on improving the DWP customer journey
for people with learning difficulties; developing a range of learning
and development resources that are supporting DWP staff/managers to
better understand the disability agenda; this includes an on-line
toolkit, available to all staff via the intranet system that offers
information on individual conditions and hints and tips on reasonable
adjustment solutions that will be needed throughout the
process.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032680000547" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/text/130326w0001.htm#13032680000547">The HING has
also recognised the importance of sharing this information with the
wider business community across the country and had engaged with a
large number of employers to help them to better recruit and retain
disabled people and in particular individuals with learning
difficulties. The HING has also embarked upon a national employer
campaign entitled to 'Uncovering Hidden Impairments' to raise awareness
of the skills, talents and abilities of many  
<?notus-xml column=1024?>people with these conditions. For further information the HING has
created a website that enables employers to register for free resources

priorities.</hs_Para>

figure for the value of new business won by licensed companies which is
attributable to the scheme. However, the Supplier Recognition Scheme
provides a very useful and welcome boost to eligible suppliers. The
value of the licence will vary from business to business and will
depend to a large extent on how companies use the new rights. Companies
looking to promote themselves in overseas markets will benefit as the
new scheme includes rights to use the designation in business
activities carried overseas. The British Olympic Association (BOA) will
be carrying out periodic surveys of licensed suppliers to gather
information on the benefits of the scheme, including new business won
as a result of it. The intention is to conduct the first such survey in
May.</hs_Para>

organisations do not have records of the exact proportions covered by
wooded islands over the last 30 years. However, since 2003 the
Environment Agency has based its maintenance work on a technical

for England is taken from the annual Fuel Poverty Statistics, based on
the English Housing Survey (EHS). Data for Scotland is taken from the
Scottish House Condition Survey. This survey changed to a calendar year
basis in 2007, making it consistent with the English Housing Survey.
Data for Wales is taken from the Living in Wales survey. Years marked
with an asterisk (*) indicate those for which fuel poverty in Wales has
been estimated, by taking data from a previous year where
actual data was available, and applying predicted price and income
changes. Data for  Northern Ireland is taken from the
Northern Ireland House Condition Survey.</hs_Para>

in which potential host communities 'decide to participate' (without
commitment) in site identification and assessment for a potential GDF.

Gauke:</Member></B> In developing PAYE Real Time Information (RTI) HMRC
has worked closely with employers, their representatives, payroll
bureaux and agents to understand the impact of RTI. As a consequence of
these consultations they recognise that some small employers who pay
their employees, more frequently, but currently only process their
payroll monthly may need longer to adapt to reporting PAYE information
in real time. HMRC have therefore agreed a transitional relaxation of
reporting arrangements for small businesses. However, all businesses
will still be required to report real time information at 
<?notus-xml column=1072?>the time of their payroll or at the very latest by the end of the tax
month. Working with representatives of small business and the
accountancy profession, HMRC agreed this as an appropriate easement at
the start of this transitional year for RTI in which they are
supporting all businesses through the implementation without the threat
of
penalties.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032680002577" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/text/130326w0003.htm#13032680002577">HMRC
have no plans to extend this reporting relaxation beyond 5 October
2013. They will, however, continue to work with employer
representatives during the summer to assess the impact of RTI on the
smallest businesses and consider whether they can make improvements to
real time reporting which will address their concerns without
compromising the benefits of RTI or the success of the Department for
Work and Pension's universal
credit.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13032680000132" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/text/130326w0003.htm#13032680000132">Public

invaluable tool to progress our objective to see a world free from
chemical weapons. We welcome the progress made to destroy 78% of the
world's declared chemical weapons. While completion of destruction is
essential, we want the third CWC review conference to also focus on
ensuring that chemical weapons cannot return. We want the Director
General of the Organisation for the Prevention of Chemical Weapons to
be given a clear mandate to enable the organisation to focus more on
chemical safety and security issues. We want to see an even greater
effort to bring into the convention the remaining eight non-states
parties, including Syria; to promote effective national implementation
of the convention by all states parties; for the convention and its
verification regime to take into full account developments in Science

Poulter:</Member></B> The 2013-14 tariffs for percutaneous coronary
interventions are in line with the costs reported by the national
health service and so there should be no impact on the access for
patients to these treatments and therefore on mortality rates. Prior to
publication of the tariffs, the financial impact of the 2013-14 prices
was assessed and the prices shared with a wide range of stakeholder
groups including hospital trusts, commissioners and with industry. In
addition, there is a flexibility available to enable commissioners to
provide additional support to 24 hour primary percutaneous coronary
intervention services (primary
angioplasty).</hs_Para><Question><hs_Para UID="13032680002902" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/text/130326w0004.htm#13032680002902"><B><Member PimsId="4785" UID="13032680004107" xid="827" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/text/130326w0004.htm#13032680004107">Andrew

is likely to be seen first in the results from the cervical screening
programme before cancer registries. For this reason the Health

increasing by 50% the number of health visitors and doubling the number

Government has committed to introducing a national minimum eligibility
threshold for adult social care. Provisions to this effect were
included in the draft Care and Support Bill, and subject to the passage
of legislation, this will be introduced from April 2015. The Government
will determine the level of the threshold as part of the Spending
Review, which we will announce later in the year. Local authorities
will be free to set their eligibility threshold at a more generous
level but will not be able to tighten them beyond the national minimum
threshold.</hs_Para>

Government also gave a commitment in the White Paper “Caring for
our future”, that we will develop and test options for a
potential new assessment and eligibility framework. A Steering Group
involving all relevant stakeholders will be established in the summer.
The Steering Group will develop new models and these will be evaluated
over a number of years. The Steering Group will then put proposals to

these.</hs_Para>

the last Spending Review provided local government with a challenging
settlement. This is why we took the decision to prioritise adult social
care, and provide extra funding for local authorities to help in
maintaining access to services. Since then, we have provided local
authorities with additional resources for social care. However, it is
ultimately for local authorities to choose how best to use their
available funding.</hs_Para>

Wright:</Member></B> The guidance documents relating to the
Department's policies on finance, human resources and procurement are
not currently placed in the Libraries of either House. This is because
there are a large number of policies that are internal documents shared
on the Ministry of Justice intranet for staff reference. It would not
be practical to place these in the Libraries because of the volume of
policies and guidance; the fact that many of them have only been
designed for electronic presentation; and also because they are
regularly updated and would therefore become quickly out of date if
they were placed in the House Libraries. In line with the Government's
digital by default approach, the Ministry of Justice does not publish
its internal material, including policies, in hard copy but instead
makes them available via its internal digital channels such as the
Intranet, This reduces costs associated with printing and ensures that
staff always have access to the latest version of any
policy.</hs_Para><Question><hs_Para UID="13032680003479" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/text/130326w0005.htm#13032680003479"><B><Member PimsId="4772" UID="13032680004193" xid="828" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130326/text/130326w0005.htm#13032680004193">Natascha

assessments which were published alongside the Legal Aid, Sentencing

evidence on the behavioural response of the individuals who will be

agreed to identify priority countries where it would be possible to
