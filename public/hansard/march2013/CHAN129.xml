independent, impartial humanitarian organisations and, through the UN,
continue our lobbying work to ensure we have access. Access is a real
challenge in places such as Mali and is also, of course, a particular
challenge in places such as Syria. Without access, we cannot get
humanitarian support to people, and that is why we focus on

point about helping disabled people across the world, and we should
make sure that the framework we look at properly includes those people.
On the wider issue of our aid budget, I know it is contentious and I
know it is difficult, but I believe we should not break a promise that
we made to the poorest people in our world. To those who have their
doubts I say that of course there is a strong moral case for our aid
budget, but there is also a national security case. It is remarkable
that the broken countries—countries affected by
conflict—have not met one single millennium development goal
among them. By helping to mend those countries, often through security

is a straightforward one-clause Bill, allowing women to become bishops
in the Church of England. I am introducing it today because of what
happened in General Synod last November. During the lead-up to that
vote, 42 out of the 44 diocesan synods voted for women bishops, and at
the November meeting of General Synod, the House of Bishops and the
House of Clergy voted in favour and it was only because the House of
Laity did not reach the two-thirds threshold that it narrowly failed to
pass.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031346000208" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0001.htm#13031346000208">In
1992, the Church voted to ordain women into the priesthood. This
happened 150 years after the start of the deaconess movement and after
many decades of debate on women’s ordination in the Church. It
was expected that, in time, we would see women becoming bishops. In
fact, in 2006 Synod started to look at admitting women to the
episcopate. The theological argument had been
won.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031346000209" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0001.htm#13031346000209">In
1992, however, provision was also made for those who could not accept
the ordination of women—and the so-called “flying
bishops” were created. In an excellent booklet “Like the
Wideness of the Sea: Women Bishops and the Church of England”,
the author Maggi Dawn described examples of the treatment she received
from some within the church who were unwilling or unable to accept her
as a woman priest. On her first day at college, for example, she
received a leaflet, saying “A woman’s place is not at the
altar but in the kitchen; put on an apron and get back to where you
belong”. She also hoped in the booklet that when the final piece
of the jigsaw was completed with women becoming bishops, this would
finally confirm the Church’s full acceptance of women’s
ministry once and for
all<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031346000210" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0001.htm#13031346000210">Twenty
years on from those first women being ordained, we have some highly

women’s ministry and to ensure that we have the very best

8 March, international women’s day, I had a meeting with women
clergy in Hull, East Yorkshire, which had been arranged by the Bishop
of Hull. What an amazing group of ordained women that
was—intelligent, compassionate, witty, warm and very, very wise.
They are a huge asset to the Church. They told me of their roles:
working with young people on tough inner-city estates, working in small
rural communities, visiting the terminally ill in their own homes, and
providing support for young families in their parishes.</hs_Para>

women talked of their feelings about the Synod’s decision, which
they believed undermined their work in the Church, in their communities
and in their role as priests. Tellingly, they mentioned the number of
members of the general public who had spoken to them after the
decision, saying how shocked and sorry 
<?notus-xml column=311?>they were, and, most important, saying that people thought the Church

each day are not regular churchgoers, but ordinary members of the
public who look to the Church to be there at important times in their
lives, to baptise babies, to marry people, and to comfort the bereaved.
Ordinary people want to see the Church of England in action through the
women and men who serve their local communities. They certainly do not
understand why it has taken such a backward decision, given that women
constitute a third of the clergy and half the membership of the Church.
Those women have kept the Church going in communities all over the
country, and their voluntary work was the “big society”

Church has caused an enormous amount of hurt to women who have a
calling to be ordained and serve the Church, but who have found that,
as a result of the decision of the General Synod, their calling has
been sidelined. We are asked to believe, explicitly or implicitly, that
women are not quite as good as men. That would be news to Emmeline

people, even those who claim to support the idea of women bishops, say
that this is a matter solely for the Church, and that it must be left
to sort itself out. The Church, however, is our national established
Church, headed by our Head of State, Queen Elizabeth, the Defender of
the Faith and the Supreme Governor: a woman of some note. We have 26
bishops sitting in the other place in recognition of the Church of
England’s important role in lawmaking in this country. We have
prayers every day in this place, led by a Church of England chaplain,

Ecclesiastical Committee in Parliament, whose job is to examine draft
Measures presented to it by the Legislative Committee of the General
Synod. It reports to Parliament on whether it considers the Measures to
be expedient and to be supported, and it will generally ask members of
the Synod to assist it in its deliberations. In some circumstances, a
conference of the Ecclesiastical Committee and the Legislative
Committee may be convened. So Parliament has a big role to play in the
Church of England, and the Church has a big role in Parliament. I
certainly do not seek to enable Parliament to intervene in Church
affairs lightly, but matters of discrimination are very serious, and we
must speak up.</hs_Para>

Parliamentarians, we should be particularly concerned about the fact
that, with any reform of the House of Lords now several years away and
given the vote of the General Synod last November, we are entrenching
sex discrimination in our Parliament by reserving 26 places in the
House of Lords for men only. The Lords is the only part of Parliament
where women are not allowed to take their place. I think that that is
wholly wrong, and that we must make it clear that such discrimination
is no longer acceptable in our Parliament. Many in the Christian faith
see waiting as a good thing—and, my goodness, we waited an
enormous amount of time to get women priests—but waiting is not
good if it just leads to repeated deferrals, and it is not good in
terms of the lost years before a final decision is made.</hs_Para>

allow women bishops in the Church of England is very much about valuing
women priests. It is also about respecting the equality laws and norms
that we have established in this country. I am shocked to learn that
men and women properly ordained by women bishops in other provinces of
the Anglican communion are not recognised here. That has to be wrong as
well. It is often said that women should not ask or demand, but should
just “play nicely”. However, I think it absolutely right
for us to become angry about injustice, and about the incoherent muddle
that we have now. The Church’s document “Women in the
episcopate: a new way forward” lacks a sense of urgency for
change. The two sides in the current “conversations” are
further apart than ever. It appears that opponents of women bishops
will never compromise. The rest of society has moved on, and the Church
now just looks very odd as a result of having taken this decision. A
great deal of attention is often paid to those opposed to women
bishops, but we know that many men and women have already left the
Church because of the treatment of women. Our established Church risks
going down the path to becoming a sect—a movement becoming a

Leigh:</Member></B> I oppose the Bill for the following reasons. I am
completely agnostic on this issue. The Church of England is not my
Church and I think it is for the Church of England to decide on it.
That is important. In previous centuries when there were matters of
controversy within the Church of England, this House of Commons was
very closely involved. Indeed, in the 1920s there were great debates
about the nature of the Prayer Book. The Church of England wanted to
move forward in a liberal direction and to allow alternative versions
of the Bible to be read in their churches. There were debates in this
House, and the House was more reactionary on the issue and opposed the
reform. After those fierce debates, 
<?notus-xml column=313?>it was decided to move forward and in effect to give the Church of
England independence. That is why from the 1920s we created the current
modern governance system in the Church of England whereby although it
is in theory an established Church—something I strongly approve
of, because it is important that we give an impression that we are
still a Christian country— it should also be independent of
Parliament in terms of doctrine and structure.</hs_Para>

believe that is the modern, progressive and right thing to do. I do not
think it is right that Members of Parliament, who are politicians,
should decide how the Church of England runs its own affairs, whether
in terms of the shape of the Prayer Book, who can become priests, or
whether it can have women priests or women bishops. It is not for us,
as politicians, to make that
choice<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T12:48:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031346000225" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0001.htm#13031346000225">There
was a further advance. As you will know, Mr Speaker, until
quite recently Prime Ministers had a very wide degree of latitude in
the appointment of bishops. The last Labour Prime Minister withdrew
from that process all together, however, and there is now a very
careful procedure in the Church of England, with senior people in the
Church deciding who will be bishops and names then going to the Queen.
Effectively, therefore, the Church of England appoints its own bishops.
That is entirely right. The Prime Minister is no shape
involved.</hs_Para>

is another reason that we must bear in mind, which the hon. Lady
mentioned when she said, “Surely when matters of discrimination

dangerous state of affairs. Have we not been assured all through the

absolutely secure and nobody could take it to court 
<?notus-xml column=314?>for discrimination because all sorts of checks and balances were being
put in place to protect it? Many people feel passionately about
same-sex marriage. They believe it is entirely wrong that the Church of
England should refuse to conduct weddings for same-sex couples, and
they are perfectly entitled to that view. They believe that to be
discrimination on the part of the Church of England, but Parliament has
decided that in that matter the Church of England should be entirely
independent. That is an entirely right point of view, so this Bill

Church Estates Commissioner, that progress is being made on this

Careful discussions are being held. The people who oppose this measure
may not be right, but they are honourable people. They have sincere
religious beliefs that should surely be discussed in their own Church
and not in Parliament. They believe—I am not commenting on
whether this is right or wrong—that the Church of England is the
catholic church; although it is an established Church and an Anglican
Church, it is a catholic church. It is based on the traditions of the
Catholic Church that the apostles were all men. I am not going to get
involved in all these arguments, but these people have strong beliefs
about that. I understand that progress is being made and some
compromise will be worked out whereby people who feel sincerely that
their religious principles are threatened will have some sort of
process to ensure that their bishops are of a traditional
kind—men, not women—and so on. That is the discussion
taking place at the moment. Let us be calm, cool and collected about
this. Let us recognise that the Church of England will move at its own

Speaker, for giving me the opportunity to open
today’s proceedings on the Bill. We start
with the programme motion, which doubles the time available for the
Report stage from one day to two. The House may recall that the earlier
programme motion allowed for only one day of deliberations at this
stage. That was agreed by this House unopposed, but today’s
motion doubles the time available for Report and, as such, I hope it
will be welcome to the whole House. Within the two days available we
will need to ensure that the existing provisions in the Bill are
properly scrutinised. The Government have also tabled a number of
amendments seeking to introduce new provisions into the Bill, including
in response to amendments tabled in the other place, so it is right
that those, too, are properly considered by the House. To ensure that
that happens, the motion includes a couple of knives on each of the two
days for Report, which will ensure that there is a fair allocation of
time between discussion of the various issues. It is evident from the
volume of signatures attached to some amendments that there is
significant interest in a number of the issues to be debated, so we
should facilitate such debate as far as is
practicable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T12:55:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031346000238" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0001.htm#13031346000238"><Member ContinuationText="Mr Peter Bone" PimsId="4750" UID="13031346000441" xid="903" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0001.htm#13031346000441"><B>Mr

I did not say that there was unanimity in the House. There
may be Members who want to debate the motions and
business before the House until 5 or 6 o’clock every
morning, and they are perfectly entitled to take that view. All I am
saying is that we have come to a reasonably settled
collective agreement that some sort of timetabling of legislation gives
clarity. The balance we are trying to obtain is
between ensuring that clarity and providing sufficient scope
for all the different points of view to be aired. That is why, as
I say, we are making generous provision in this
programme motion for this stage of the deliberations on this
Bill. I am sure that the wider points that have been made have been
heard by my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House and,
indeed, by the shadow Leader of the House. They no doubt spend a lot of
time deliberating these matters and can now spend more time

relates to the Leader of the Opposition’s amendment. The
Government will also introduce a supplementary programme motion if the
cross-party talks have concluded—either with or without

second day of business on this Bill. On that basis, both coalition
parties will support the programme motion, having had the assurances
that I have just delivered at the Dispatch Box, and will support the

as the Leader of the House is in his seat, let me say that, whenever
time is taken out of the allocated time for Government Bills by
statements or urgent questions—of course, that does not apply
today—I hope that we can have injury time. The one flaw of the
present system seems to be that we agree a timetable and then lose half
of the time. That is nobody’s fault, but it means that we do not
implement the will of the House. I hope that the Leader of the House

it is not a problem for the House to sit late in the night if we are
doing a proper job of scrutiny; and the idea that it is impossible to
stop the House sitting late if there is no programme motion is wrong,
because it is possible to bring in a guillotine. There has been a
programming motion for every single Bill in this Parliament. The
Library has confirmed to me that the present Government have
guillotined more debates than were guillotined during the previous
Parliament. So the idea that it is impossible to stop debate is
unfounded—in fact, I was stopped in mid-flow the other day by a
Whip moving a closure motion.</hs_Para>

the Minister, who is a great democrat—or was, before he became a

<?notus-xml column=322?>try something different with the Bill. Let us abandon the programme
motion, and the other programme motion, and see the self-discipline of
the House. When we are talking about things as important as

be made up of independently minded Back Benchers who would not
necessarily toe the party line. So it will be Parliament deciding, and
I am absolutely sure that there would be members from the minority
parties. That is actually a coalition priority. They seem to have
slipped on the timetable. We were supposed to have it by May this year,

we could dispense with programming if we want to be in the Chamber
until 5 am or 6 am on every Bill. That is patently nonsense,
because in the 1992 Parliament that happened occasionally when the
Maastricht treaty was debated, but not all the time. There are some
Bills that require greater debate and scrutiny, but the flexibility to
provide that is missing from all of this. That is extremely unfortunate
because, with the best will in the world—with the benign
Government we have now and any Government who may follow—the
Executive are riding roughshod over us. This is not what Parliament is

<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>The Government
will bring forward a supplementary programme motion if the cross-party
talks have concluded, whether that is with or without agreement. If
those talks have concluded, we will introduce a supplementary programme
motion. With that assurance, the Opposition amendment is not necessary.
If those talks have not concluded, we can proceed as we are currently
proceeding, and if they have concluded, the Government have given an
undertaking—I have given that undertaking on behalf of the
Government—that we would in those circumstances introduce a
supplementary programme motion. As for the question of when we will
introduce that motion, which was raised by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Delyn, the answer is that we will do so when the cross-party

It could mean “came to a conclusion with which everybody
agreed”, which might not be the view of the whole House, or it
could mean “came to an end” because those talks
collapsed. I should be grateful if the Minister provided clarification.
Secondly, he has not told us which day has been chosen for the second

issue; it is a procedural issue. The Government have not taken a view
as to whether counter-terrorism should be transferred into the NCA. The
NCA is not even up and running yet. It requires the assent of the House

will repeat it briefly in case hon. Members did not latch on to the
point—that is why I made it before giving way: there is a duty
on the Home Secretary to consult persons affected before laying a draft
order, then there is an opportunity for Committees of either House to
scrutinise the draft order, and I said that I envisage that task
falling to the Home Affairs Committee, a cross-party Committee chaired

counter-terrorism policing is a partnership endeavour among all UK

distributed between forces, and how those national functions support
forces in both proactive and reactive operations. However, with the

that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T13:39:18"></hs_TimeCode> the
Government should want to consider afresh how the current

could play a role to enhance our response to the terrorist threat.
Those questions can be sensibly considered only after the NCA is up and
running, and only then after a full
review.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031347000117" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0002.htm#13031347000117">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T13:39:57"></hs_TimeCode>

of the NCA in them.
However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T13:40:52"></hs_TimeCode>, we
continue to believe that it is right to build into the Bill the
flexibility to implement the outcome of such a review in a timely

parliamentary scrutiny in the form of the super-affirmative procedure,

me be clear that the NCA will continue to operate on a UK-wide basis,
including in Northern Ireland, but the Executive’s decision
means that the NCA’s activities in Northern Ireland will be
curtailed. For example, NCA officers in Northern Ireland can no longer
be designated with the powers of a Northern Ireland constable. However,
there is still much the NCA can do to tackle serious, organised and
complex crime in Northern Ireland, both through its own investigations
and by supporting the Police Service of Northern Ireland and other
agencies. Importantly, the strong operational relationship that the
Serious Organised Crime Agency has built up with the PSNI, both through
the SOCA officers based in Northern Ireland and across SOCA as a whole,
will continue with the
NCA.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031347000130" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0002.htm#13031347000130">Furthermore,
NCA officers will still be able to use customs and immigration powers

Bill as introduced included a number of new safeguards, above and

arrangements were limited to England and Wales, the directed assistance
provisions included an additional consultative role for the Northern
Ireland Policing Board, and we extended the remit of the Police
Ombudsman for Northern Ireland to cover complaints in relation to asset
recovery. I maintain, therefore, that the Government were alert from
the outset to the specific sensibilities in Northern Ireland. We have

police forces—in other words, their sovereignty would no longer

to undertake certain actions. That is not the case with the
Metropolitan police. It is conceivable that some in Northern Ireland
will be unwilling to be tasked in that way, but a lot of collaborative
work takes place in any case. Activities that fund terrorism, rather

system that allows the director of the NCA to agree that help and
support can be given on request or by decision, but that ultimately the

for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell), but I will not steal his
thunder and will be as brief as possible. In particular, I agree with
amendments 95 and 102. As we know, clause 12 would prohibit unions from
instigating a strike affecting any officers working for the National

do not think they should be deprived of rights that most workers are
accorded. It is only right and proper for the Government to take a
respectful approach to those workers and allow them the negotiating
rights and further rights that most people have.

goes as far as allowing the Home Secretary to seek an injunction

would allow for the contracting out of all functions of fines officers.
The clause also makes provision for the costs of collecting
compensation, fines and other financial penalties to be recovered from
other offenders. I share the concern of groups such as the Public and
Commercial Services Union that the Bill would allow a crucial element
of enforcing sentences to be privatised. That would mean private
companies being in charge of carrying out quasi-judicial functions,
such

me return to the question of deleting clauses 12 and 13. When read in
conjunction, they look worse than when read by themselves. What they
say is: “You will not have rights that other trade unions have.
We will appoint a form of board to determine your pay. End of
story.” If ever there was an invitation to truss up a turkey and
put it in the oven, this is it. Read together, clauses 12 and 13 will
stitch up these people in the worst possible sense. This kind of
legislation might have been in vogue 10 or 20 years ago, but it has no
place in any modern democracy. By proceeding with it, the Government
are undermining trust in these people and making them look like people
who should not be in the jobs they are in or who will not act
responsibly, which clearly they are not. Amendments 95 and 102 are well
worthy of support, and I fully support

their trade union rights. This is the party that gave commitments to
the Prison Officers Association that we would address its complaint
that a Conservative Government had removed the right to take strike
action from prison officers. I urge Labour MPs and others—anyone
who is in the Chamber and anyone watching this debate outside—to

we have 70-odd members on a cross-party basis—that represents
the workers we are talking about. The PCS represents members in the
Home Office and its agencies. It currently has about 2,700 members in
the Serious Organised Crime Agency and will have between 3,350 and
3,500 members in the NCA when it is established. The whole discussion
up to now has proceeded on the basis that these are civil servants, who
respect the right of Government to govern and will therefore do all
they can when there is a restructuring of Departments or Government
agencies to ensure that they support the 
<?notus-xml column=343?>Government in that restructuring and implement the policies effectively.

closer to SOCA officers than police officers. Even if there were
evidence of such a need, on the evidence currently available to us we

have not come forward with these proposals; they have been brought
forward by the Government. This is a Government whim. Someone in
Government decided it would be worth trying for a no-strike provision
on this group of workers. It is the thin end of the wedge, because
there are some Conservative Back Benchers who have been seeking to
introduce a no-strike provision across whole sectors of industry. I
think this is the start. This group of workers is the experiment, to
see whether people will acquiesce, and I am amazed that those on the
Labour Front Bench have rolled over. That sends a signal to this
Government to come forward with proposals for the transport sector and
many others, as some have been planning to do for many years. I am

us be clear what clauses 12 and 13 will do. They will take away from
civil servants a fundamental right that they have at the moment: the
right to take industrial action. This is the crossing of the Rubicon.
The clauses will bring in a ban on industrial action that extends well
beyond the police and prison officers, where it already exists, to
civil servants, on whom such a ban has never been imposed before. This

the Government to test the water around their future policies on trade

Wilson</B><B>:</B></Member> It is with regret that I see the references
to Northern Ireland and the role of the National Crime Agency in
Northern Ireland being removed from the Bill, and I want to put some
questions to the Minister on this point. If any part of the United
Kingdom needs the effective operation of a national crime agency, it is
Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Affairs Committee in this House
has already identified the fact that hundreds of millions of pounds
every year are lost to the Exchequer and go into the hands of criminal
gangs, on many occasions to finance terrorist activities, as a result
of fuel laundering alone. There are many other areas in which organised
crime plays a big role in Northern Ireland. We need the National Crime
Agency.</hs_Para>

role that the criminals play is not confined to Northern Ireland. Their
tentacles spread well beyond Northern Ireland and dealing with them
involves operational decisions that cannot be taken solely by the
Police Service of Northern Ireland. Indeed, the fact that they are now
laundering their money across Europe and north America demonstrates the
international dimension involved, and the PSNI cannot be expected to
deal with them alone.</hs_Para>

activities of the National Crime Agency did not cross with any PSNI
investigations, about the restrictions on the ability of the Justice
Minister to direct the police service to co-operate with the NCA in
investigations, and about the role of the surveillance commissioner. A

“Well, we haven’t got the agreement of the

Northern Ireland—introduce the necessary changes, but I do not
know whether that will ever be possible. That is why the Government
should keep open the option of considering whether the demarcation
between the devolved authorities and the authority of this House could

agencies. Last year alone—this is in the annual
report—£13 million-worth of drugs were seized, 33
potential victims of human trafficking were rescued, £4.44
million-worth of criminal assets were seized, and the list goes on.
That is the result of working together to combat organised crime. That
is now being put at risk because of the breakdown in negotiations and
the failure to get a legislative consent motion. As reported by the BBC
today, a recent massive operation against the illegal fuel trade
involved law enforcement north and south of the border, with 300

continuing at the highest possible level and to the fullest extent, the

the Member for Belfast East 
<?notus-xml column=350?>(Naomi Long). I think it is a mistake to take the Northern Ireland

longer be consulted on strategic priorities, on the annual plan or
indeed in respect of the appointment of a director-general. We have an
impasse here: taking the Northern Ireland Justice Minister out of the

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T15:04:09"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

that context, the Minister has described himself as a
“collegiate” Minister—and who am I to argue with
that description? I was rather hoping, in that spirit, that he would
have come back with an amendment to schedule 6, paragraph
1(2), which deals with inspection. Provision is made there for
inspections relating to the NCA in Scotland, but no mention is
made—there is still no mention of it anywhere in the
Bill—of Criminal Justice Inspection Northern Ireland. It
inspects the police there. It should be involved in any inspection of
the NCA. In the spirit of trying to move this forward to get a meeting

to meet the parties? How is it being done? Is there any real urgency in
the negotiations that should be happening? Are Ministers just sitting
back and waiting for Northern Ireland politicians to come forward? We

that they are in place to deal with such problems? It is important not
just to have reassurance about the operational responsibilities but to
ensure that the message goes out to people that, if they know of abuse
or if they have been abused, they must come forward to report it.
Goodness me, after all

devolution and who is, even now, looking at and trying to deal with the
risks that may occur if consent is not given to these provisions. It
does not come as a surprise to me at all to know that he is trying to
plug the gaps in these provisions. The Minister, however, is the
Minister responsible for the NCA and for CEOP, so that Minister has to
offer us some reassurances.</hs_Para>

last point is about the relationship between the NCA and the Northern
Ireland Policing Board.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T15:08:40"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for East Antrim made the point that when he was a member of the
Policing Board it was important to establish what the relationship was
between a UK-wide body and the Northern Ireland Policing Board. I
remember going, as the Minister responsible for policing in Northern
Ireland, to the Policing Board—I did that once a year—for
a formal session on organised crime. I would take with me senior SOCA
officers, so that the Policing Board could ask them questions and get
to the bottom of certain issues. We were as open as we possibly could
be, even though there was no formal requirement for accountability.
That was the spirit in which we operated. What will happen now? If the
NCA is to have no formal relationship in Northern Ireland, the danger
is that such discussions, formal and informal, will cease to happen.
Yet the NCA will still have responsibilities for customs and
immigration in Northern Ireland. There will be a loss of communication
and dialogue about those and other important
issues.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031348000208" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0002.htm#13031348000208">There
is a huge agenda here. I hope that the Minister will be able to offer
us some reassurance about the urgency with which he is dealing with
these matters and the negotiations that need to take place, and that he
will respond in detail to the points that I, and others, have raised.
There are continuing and serious differences of opinion in Northern
Ireland, which must be respected and worked through in a democratic
way, but surely there should be absolute unanimity when it comes to the
need to combat organised crime and the awful evil that it brings. That,
at least, should be a matter of absolute consensus between the
politicians of Northern
Ireland.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-13?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_13_PT_1/C2C61E4E95C724402AADEFFE090908EEA9F787BD" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="13 March 2013">Wednesday

others, I find it regrettable that, in new schedule 1, we

such matters is impossible. The discussions have been positive and
practical rather than intractable. It is not a question of people
trying to play politics, which some people unworthily accused us of
doing some time ago. The character of the discussions with the Minister
and his officials, and indeed the constructive role of the
Minister’s special adviser, has been entirely positive. No one
is saying, “Because this is coming from England, we
want nothing to do with it.” There is no “green against

I said in an intervention, some of us raised issues in relation to this
Bill, and similar but different issues in relation to the Justice and

complications when it came to the interface with, and the impact on,
Northern Ireland and the Patten architecture. We cannot throw in new
fixtures and fittings that are UK-wide, or even Northern
Ireland-specific, and say that some of them do not affect the Patten
architecture, if their character does affect it, or possibly affects
it. When it comes to such matters as legislative consent motions,
members of my party—as conscientious legislators both here and
in the Assembly—must ask ourselves whether we have fully
understood the implications, and assured ourselves that the results of
these legislative changes will be positive. Are we persuaded that they
will add to the fighting and the reducing of crime, but will not cause
any difficulties in relation to the policing ethos, the upholding of
the Patten principles and the new start to
policing?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031348000214" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0002.htm#13031348000214">That
is something we have consistently done. The right hon. Member for
Wythenshawe and Sale East and I have had many discussions about the
whole issue of national security—about the re-routing of certain
responsibilities and balances of interest, and about the changes that
were made in the context of the St Andrews agreement, which took some
of the Patten accountability and the Patten complaints process out of
some of the purview of national
security.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031348000215" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0002.htm#13031348000215">We
opposed that. We had worked hard to ensure that the issue of policing
would be addressed in the negotiations for the Good Friday agreement
when no other party would address it, and we had ensured that an
international commission was set up. Having done that, and having
helped to drive the Patten reform programme, we were
not going to say, “That does not matter. We never
really cared about those principles. It was purely
ephemeral.” When we saw measures relating to
national security that we thought might provide a way of
getting around or undermining Patten, we registered 
<?notus-xml column=353?>our concern about them, and we must ensure that that does not happen in
the case of the National Crime

Unionist parties which told us that no change was

be precious and pedantic about the need to ensure that the integrity of
the change that we worked so hard to secure, with very little help from
anyone else, is respected and protected, and that
is what we are trying to do. We should all have been afforded more time
earlier in the process, and a fuller, more open discussion when we had
a draft Bill. That is not a criticism of David Ford as the devolved
Minister of Justice. It is possible that we need to be less precious as
a Parliament about which other parties can be in on discussions about
the drafting and preparation of a Bill when a significant
devolved interest is involved. If more had been done earlier in that

Wilson:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman’s view on policing and
the safeguards that are required obviously differs from mine, but all
the discussion to which he has referred happened a long time ago, when
SOCA was set up. The relationships between the Policing Board and SOCA
and between the ombudsman and SOCA, and the safeguards that were to be
provided, are still in place, and indeed have been added to. I cannot
understand—I am sure it would be useful to the Minister to know
this as well—where the gaps which, according to the hon. Member
for Foyle (Mark Durkan), still exist can be found. The safeguards that
his party agreed were necessary in the past were adequate and have been
added to, but there seems still to be a reluctance to accept that the
National Crime Agency will be able to operate in the context of the
Bill.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031348000218" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0002.htm#13031348000218"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mark Durkan" PimsId="3056" UID="13031348001372" xid="916" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0002.htm#13031348001372">Mark
Durkan:</Member></B> The reluctance is not a reluctance to see the
National Crime Agency operate or make a due contribution to the
fighting and the reducing of crime in Northern Ireland, and crime that
reaches into or out of Northern Ireland and affects other territories.
The hon. Gentleman mentioned SOCA. When SOCA was first proposed, his
party and mine had reservations about it, but many of those
reservations were concerned with whether it would mean the loss of the
valuable work done by the Criminal Assets Bureau. We wondered whether
level 1 crime would be dealt with by the PSNI and level 3 would be
dealt with by SOCA, and whether criminals knew that if they kept their
criminal activity within level 2, there would be no one to deal with
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031348000219" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0002.htm#13031348000219">Many
issues arose in relation to SOCA, not just the issue of whether UK
policing would affect Northern Ireland. We were seriously worried, for
instance, about SOCA’s role in relation to the role of MI5. The
notion of what is classified as national security, and of what a
Government treat as national security, seems to be something of a
movable feast in terms of the level of crime operations that are deemed
to be within MI5’s 
<?notus-xml column=354?>sphere of influence. We were trying to clarify all those matters, and
the same applies here. We need to know about any additional policing
element.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031348000220" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0002.htm#13031348000220">The
Bill with which we were originally presented provided for constabulary
powers to be given to National Crime Agency officers in Northern
Ireland, and we needed to know how they would be aligned with the
constabulary powers of the PSNI. The Bill also provided for NCA special
constables in Northern Ireland. I think that the hon. Gentleman would
have been very surprised if, four and a half decades on from all the
working and striving to get rid of the B-specials, nationalist parties
did not question legislation providing for new special
constables.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T15:19:06"></hs_TimeCode>

that respects the devolved settlement and secures the progress that has
been made in policing are genuine, but he has referred on a number of
occasions to the original draft Bill, and considerable changes have
been made to it to get to where we are today—leaving aside the
fact that we are not going to delete all references to Northern
Ireland. Huge progress has been made on constables and their status,
answering to the ombudsman and other issues. Therefore, will he outline

still hung up on all the stuff about MI5 and so forth. It was said that
we had too much emotional and intellectual capital invested in the
Patten reforms, and that we had a hang-up. Latterly, Sinn Fein seemed
to realise some of the issues as well, but it is not a matter of them

Assembly in Northern Ireland and Westminster so we are not left in the

arrangements we helped to legislate for.” We are then like
Clouseau in one of the “Pink Panther” movies where he
sees a man with a dog and asks, “Does your dog bite?” The
man says, “No.” Clouseau pets the dog and the dog nearly
takes his arm off. Clouseau then says, “I thought you told me
your dog doesn’t bite,” and the man says,
“That’s not my
dog<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T15:28:08"></hs_TimeCode>.” We
cannot say, “We’ve sorted out policing, and we have full
accountability and a full and open complaints process, but meanwhile
anything goes in relation to how this Parliament here at Westminster
legislates for other aspects of policing.” We have to get this
right for now and for the

hon. Member for East Antrim raised an issue that was close to being a
red herring: what is or might be provided for in relation to Northern
Ireland in the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill. As I read it, that
legislation basically says that a same-sex marriage conducted in
England or Wales will have the status only of a civil partnership in
Northern Ireland or in Scotland. In one respect, Ministers could argue
that they are respecting the legal position in Scotland and in Northern
Ireland, and are saying, “We won’t do anything that does
injury to that, interferes with that or introduces any other new
language or different standing.” I do not accept the hon.
Gentleman’s point about a comparison with that Bill’s
provisions, as they stand. The comparison is that there was a danger
that the way in which this Bill was providing for Northern Ireland was
going to damage carefully developed and agreed procedures in place in
Northern
Ireland<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T15:29:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13031348001307" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0002.htm#13031348001307">3.30

wish to deal with one other point. When we raised concerns about
constabulary powers, we were accused of wanting all the paedophiles and
child exploiters to be free to do what they want. That was what was
said about the National Crime Agency not having constabulary 
<?notus-xml column=357?>powers, but of course the Child Exploitation and Online Protection
Centre does not have constabulary powers, and it does not particularly
need or want them. Some of the issues we raised are shared by Jim
Gamble; he has shared in some of our concerns and highlighted others of
his own. Those of us who have issues are not purely playing politics;

I said earlier, we envisage that in those circumstances the cross-party
Select Committee on Home Affairs would consider proposals brought
forward. After the Home Secretary has considered those matters, she may
revise the order before inviting each House to agree the amended order.
The point I am making is that, although there may not be a provision
for the House to amend such an order at the end of the deliberations,
there will be multiple opportunities for different bodies of Parliament
to inform any recommendations that the Home Secretary may wish to bring
to our attention. That detailed scrutiny process may be more
comprehensive and may contain more provision for amendment and scrutiny
than attaching an item of primary legislation into an overarching
so-called Christmas tree Bill at another stage. There is a danger of
the House underestimating the degree of scrutiny that will be available
to Members, and the Government would certainly wish such a serious
measure to be scrutinised effectively.</hs_Para>

had a lot of debate about Northern Ireland, and it is worth stressing
that I agree with the central thrust of the points that have been made
by nearly every Member who has spoken; the United Kingdom Government
wish the NCA’s provisions to reach right across the UK, and in
so much as they do not that is a source of regret to us. I therefore
think that there is no difference between the Government’s
position and that of most Members who have spoken on that point.
Obviously, a number of meetings have taken place between officials,
Ministers here in London and Ministers in Northern Ireland, but David
Ford, the Northern Ireland Justice Minister, has led the main body of
discussions. As legislative consent is a devolved process, it was for
him to take forward the discussions with his Executive colleagues and
the political parties. That is the proper way to

deficient in its operation—he accepted that in

and plough on without that consent or implement the legislation from

is worth making it clear to the House that the NCA will still have a
role in Northern Ireland, as there is a danger that a casual observer
of our deliberations might think otherwise. I can confirm that some
types of cross-border crime will fall within the remit of the NCA in
Northern Ireland, even in its constrained form. For example, the NCA in
Northern Ireland will be able to tackle immigration or customs
offences. The NCA and CEOP will continue to be able to co-operate with
partners in Northern Ireland and we are seeking to mitigate the
operational impact of the situation we find ourselves in.</hs_Para>

NCA and CEOP will continue to operate in Northern Ireland, but it is
worth saying that that operation will be curtailed as a result of the
absence of legislative consent. In a way, that illustrates the wider
point. There will be an NCA function in Northern Ireland and obviously
we hope and believe that it will benefit the people of Northern
Ireland. It will not be as comprehensive as we would have wished, but
there is provision for it to be made more comprehensive in the future,
as and when the political will and consensus in Northern Ireland
provides for that.</hs_Para>

let me clarify the Government’s position. We wish the NCA to
come into effect by the end of 2013. Our target date is October, but

those unions that will be recognised by the NCA. That would, in
practice, impose strike restrictions on the vast majority of NCA
officers and establish an alternative method for resolving disputes
with the organisation. If that is achieved, the Bill gives the Home
Secretary a power to suspend the operation of the provisions
restricting the right to strike. In essence, therefore, the no-strike
provision is designed as a reserve

return to the central point: I think the public will not be able to
understand why, if they are at threat from serious and organised crime,
the agencies of the state, which are paid for from our taxes to protect
the public from that serious and organised crime, should not be
available 24 hours a day to do so. The threat to the public exists 24
hours a day. I would ask
the<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Hayes and Harlington to reflect on that central point, because as I
understand it, unless those on the Labour Front Bench have changed
their position, it has been accepted by the Labour party that we should
be seeking to protect the public around the clock. I invite the hon.
Gentleman to accept that point
too.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031348000260" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0002.htm#13031348000260"><B><Member ContinuationText="John McDonnell" PimsId="1799" UID="13031348001390" xid="379" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0002.htm#13031348001390">John

need to protect the public. Until now, customs and revenue
officers—the immigration officers—have been able to do
that without having the right to strike withdrawn. That is what the
Labour party thought was happening. The Labour Front-Bench team thought
that the provision related to policing powers, but it has gone well
beyond that. A<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
briefing was circulated to all MPs on Friday to explain that. Some
people are saying that they did not receive it. I have a list of the
e-mail addresses that it went to, so I know who got it. That briefing
showed, in the explanation from management to staff, that the provision
has gone well beyond what Ministers originally proposed, which was just
for police officers. It has been extended to immigration
officers—customs officers—who have always had the right
to strike and yet have always protected our country. This is a massive
step beyond anything that was proposed initially in the
Bill.</hs_Para>

the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) has raised
concerns that were circulated late on Friday. I just want clarification
from the Minister as to what he means by “some officers”.
Will he confirm whether customs officers and immigration officers will
be included in the provision under clause 12, as opposed to just police

idea that this is something that has been circulated at the last moment
and which Labour has suddenly discovered, but the Bill is the Bill. If
there are agonies in the Labour party about

have been given a note that confirms what I have said. For the
avoidance of doubt, I said that the measure applies to people with
operational powers, and the Bill has always provided that those NCA
officers designated with operational powers— police, customs or
immigration powers—will be prevented from striking. That is what
the measure said from the outset. I feel bad, because
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T15:47:47"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Hayes and Harlington is being told by Labour Whips that they are
all on his side and so on. He should have served on the Committee,
because Labour Members did not object to the measure there. They have
to resolve that between themselves, but our view—the bottom-line
view, which is the same as when the matter first came up; nothing
changed in Committee or elsewhere—is that the provisions on the
NCA should be there to protect the public around the clock from a
threat that they face around the

Friend the Member for Delyn said. This is what we call legislating;
this is what we call debate. We discover during the passage of
legislation the implications of that legislation. I did not serve on
the Bill Committee, so this is my opportunity to discover and debate.
We have all discovered that the intention of the Bill is to remove the
right to strike, not from police officers but from immigration and
customs officers, who are civil servants—they are not police
officers. That was never the intention behind any of the debates until
now, and on that basis, I urge hon. Members on both sides of the House
to vote for the amendment. If the Government need to return with
clarification at a later stage in another place, that is fair enough,
but we must ensure that we do not introduce legislation in the House

the public of the United Kingdom 24 hours a day from serious

and counter that threat from the people who perpetrate it 24
hours a day, 365 days a year. So we want a consensus to be arrived at

amendments made to the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 in
Committee to remedy the effects of the Perry judgment will operate
UK-wide, but as with the NCA provisions, which we have just
discussed, in the absence of an LCM it is necessary that we amend those
provisions so that they do not extend to Northern Ireland. In new
schedule 2, a similar approach is adopted in respect of the proceeds of
crime provisions to that taken in new schedule 1 in respect of the NCA.
It provides that “relevant civil recovery provisions” and
“relevant investigation provisions” do not extend to
Northern

primary outcome of the new schedule and the associated amendments to
clause 33 and schedule 17 is that the High Court of England and Wales
will be able to make a civil recovery order against property located
outside the UK where there is, or has been, a connection between the
case in question and the relevant part of the UK, and the Court of
Session will have similar powers in Scotland, but the High Court of

Burrowes:</Member></B> Both new clause 18 and amendment 120
concern sentences for driving over the prescribed limits for drugs and
alcohol and both seek to fill a gap in sentencing. There are 220
traffic cases each year in which individuals die on our roads owing to
a driver who has been impaired through drink or drugs.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13031348001190" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0003.htm#13031348001190"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T16:39:13"></hs_TimeCode>On
the subject of filling gaps, I pay tribute to the Government for
filling the gap in drug-driving offences. The new offence will not
require proof of impairment. Owing to the imminent arrival of roadside
drugalysers, it will become an offence that sits alongside
drink-driving. It will be possible to rely on proof that someone is
over the prescribed limit, whether for alcohol or drugs, rather than
relying solely on proof of
impairment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031348001191" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0003.htm#13031348001191">Here
I must declare an interest as a criminal defence solicitor. I must
confess that I recall many prosecutions that did not succeed because of
ambiguities and complexities relating to proof of impairment. The
filling of that gap might not have been welcome to some of my clients
of old, but it will be welcome to victims of offences of this kind, and
it will be welcome to those who believe that it is in the public
interest to ensure that drink and drug-driving offences are prosecuted
properly.</hs_Para>

also concerned about another gap. The purpose of new clause 18 and
amendment 120 is to draw attention to it, and to ensure that, in one
way or another, we fill it. Without the new clause, the maximum
custodial sentence for driving after consuming excess alcohol, or
indeed drugs over the prescribed limit, will still be six
months’ imprisonment. Statute has properly 
<?notus-xml column=381?>provided that, if carelessness or dangerousness is proved, greater
penalties will follow. The last Conservative Government recognised the
need to ensure that drivers who caused death while under the influence
of drugs or drink should be more heavily penalised. We now have on the
statute book the offence of death caused by careless driving while the
driver is under the influence of drugs or alcohol, which attracts a
maximum sentence of 14 years.</hs_Para>

occasions. He was a great advocate in courts in Enfield and Haringey,
and he continues that advocacy in the House. He has made an important
point. There is a parallel between dealing with drink-driving cases and
dealing with, for example, cases of criminal damage. Where there is a
succession of criminal damage cases, later cases can receive a higher
penalty and can be committed to the Crown court; indeed, there are
categories of criminal damage that attract a higher penalty and the
attention of the Crown court. The Government should look at whether
that principle, which is already in statute, should be applied to
drink-drive cases that have the most serious
consequences<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T16:44:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

already crossed the Rubicon in terms of culpability and consequences in
death by careless driving and dangerous driving. We have recognised
that there needs to be a particular way of dealing with penalties that

came to the fore as a result of the campaigning efforts of my

saw a gap involving fatalities in drink and drug cases that are not

gap is in hit-and-run cases where a driver who is over the limit on
drink or drugs crashes into another car or a pedestrian and kills, and
then leaves the scene. In situations where fatalities occur, such cases
are not infrequent, as—it will not surprise Members to
learn—many 
<?notus-xml column=383?>people who know they are over the limit will do their best to evade
prosecution, so they will leave the scene. They get hunted down and
arrested, and when they are found to be over the limit the prosecution
begins and the investigation continues. A prosecution for a failure to
stop carries a limited penalty that does not reflect the gravity of the
situation, and I have previously sought amendments to extend the
penalties in that regard.</hs_Para>

prosecutor is left with the option of prosecuting for death by careless
driving, but the problem is that there is no witness. In these cases,
often the only witness is dead; there is nobody left. The steps are
then traced back and the scene is marked out. The marks on the road
might allow people to come up with a prosecution that shows that
careless driving took place, because there are signs of speed,
swerving, braking and so on. But it may well be that none of that is
available, as perhaps it was a wet day and very little could be shown.
Little corroborative evidence may be available beyond the fact that the
person has died because of that vehicle and that driver, and all we
have left is the fact that the driver was over the limit.</hs_Para>

all the prosecutor can perhaps do is prosecute for driving with excess
alcohol or driving over the prescribed limit for drugs, which carries a

option, new clause 18, would make drink-driving or driving over the

option is amendment 120, whereby those on licence, disqualified drivers

have to put my lawyer’s hat on, because I appreciate that people
may have concerns about new clause 18 opening up all drink-driving
cases to a Crown court trial; I recognise the expense and the vagaries
of jury trials, and that that is not wholly satisfactory in itself. I
am perhaps being generous in how I am presenting new clause 18 and it
perhaps needs to be refined. Perhaps it should be simply specified in
relation to fatalities.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T16:54:05"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Gillingham and Rainham suggests making specific
provision about repeat drink-driving offenders. There is certainly a
role for making only those high-end cases liable for a committal to
Crown court, in a similar way to what happens in the criminal damages
cases I referred to earlier.</hs_Para>

way around that would be to deal with magistrates’ maximum
sentencing powers. Perhaps the Government will respond to the calls
from the Magistrates’ Association to extend their powers to a
maximum of two years. Youth courts have a two-year custodial sentence
power, so perhaps we should have equity for adult courts. That would be
much more cost-effective and would avoid cases all going to the Crown
court and we lawyers being paid more up there—although we must
appreciate the legal aid restrictions in that regard. The issue could
then be dealt with in a magistrates court in a proportionate manner.
That option is also open to the Government.</hs_Para>

recognise that there are reservations about amendment 120. As a lawyer,
I am not keen on extending strict liability cases too readily and the
amendment would certainly effectively extend a strict liability
scenario to drink and drug-driving-related cases. Nevertheless, my
amendment is clean cut. It does not extend the powers of the Crown
court to all drink-driving cases but relates specifically to
fatalities. It deals with the issues that have motivated my amendments
and merely adds to the list of offences. Members of the public
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T16:55:41"></hs_TimeCode>might ask what
the difference is: if someone takes the risk of driving while
uninsured, disqualified or without a licence, they are pretty careless
to do that and should accept the consequences, and the same applies to
those who are over the prescribed limits.

problem that should not be ignored. The fact that there were
220 deaths in a year but only 27 people were charged with
causing death by dangerous driving while impaired in the same period

would make a difference, but my fear is that if it is seen as part of
forensics, it comes under a back-office function of the police, and
could be subject to fairly serious cuts. I cannot see the point of
having lots of police legitimately checking people for drug-driving if
we cannot get the results of the tests and get the guilty people put in
jail to serve the necessary sentence.</hs_Para>

89 and 90 deal with an entirely different matter. As Members are aware,
the Bill is wide ranging. Clause 42 was inserted during the
Bill’s passage through the other place. Its effect is to remove
the word “insulting” from section 5 of the Public Order
Act 1986. We could debate that for many days, and I do not propose to 
<?notus-xml column=386?>rehearse all the arguments, which were well made in the other place, but
it is perhaps worth noting that, notwithstanding the
Government’s indication that they did not support the amendment
in the other place, it was agreed to on a Division by 150 votes to only
54. I think it is fair to say that there was overwhelming support for
the removal of the word.</hs_Para>

that it is much more complex than testing for drink-driving, so the
types of machinery and equipment that the police will need will be much

all, that raises a series of questions about the cost implications for
our police forces. We know that police forces are investing
in some of that technology. For example, Essex police are
investing in the tests for cannabis, but whether they will be able to
buy a machine that tests for all drugs is clearly a question of value
for money. For the Home Office simply to say that that is a matter for

that the expert panel does not think that there is sufficient evidence
at present on the impairment generated for a driver, but were that
evidence test to change, would the police then have to buy a subsequent
set of equipment to be able to deal with that, and what would be the
consequences for their budgets? I think that the Minister needs to give
us much more information about what he has done to ensure that when
this becomes law our police have the equipment they need to deal with
every drug that might impair driving.
As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T17:15:48"></hs_TimeCode> the Institute

right hon. Friend the Member for Delyn revealed that no assessment has
been made of the training required by police forces to be able to
undertake roadside drug testing. This is a critical issue, because the
expert panel itself has pointed out that the most effective evidence on
drug offences is gathered at the roadside. The question of whether
blood and urine samples will be tested at the roadside will also be a
key issue for how the police manage the system. As the expert panel
points out, it is widely acknowledged that blood and, to a lesser
degree, oral fluids are most likely to give the most accurate
measurement of drugs currently active in the system. Potential
prosecutions may rest on whether a substance was in somebody’s
system at the time an offence was committed, so accurate evidence is
vital.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031374000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0003.htm#13031374000046">This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T17:21:10"></hs_TimeCode>
is a problem, therefore, not just for our police, but for our courts.
As a result of my right hon. Friend’s sterling work in asking
parliamentary questions, we have uncovered the fact that the courts do
not have the relevant training to deal with questions about differences
in metabolism and equipment or to interpret the evidence. That is why
we have tabled the amendment to push the Government to be much clearer
on how we can all make sure that this particular offence is dealt with
successfully. We do not know how the equipment will be developed, how
much it will cost or its source. We do not know whether police budgets
will be able to extend to the range of equipment they will need, or
whether the police will be given appropriate training to
collect the necessary samples in the right manner to secure a
successful prosecution. It is not unreasonable for Parliament to
continue to ask those
questions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031374000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0003.htm#13031374000047">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T17:22:03"></hs_TimeCode>

and the intention behind it, but provide much more detail. In
particular, will the Government accept in full the guidelines suggested
by the expert panel? Have the Government made provision to ensure that
police forces throughout the country are able to purchase the necessary
equipment and that they will be able to future-test those purchases
when new evidence becomes available about the impact of different drugs
as our experience and understanding of issues such as legal highs
develops? The amendment seeks to probe the Government to ensure that,
at this late stage, they have done more of the homework that we all
want to see so that the offence is recognised and families of people
such as Lillian Groves can take comfort that Parliament is listening to

I want to speak briefly to amendments 89 and 90. We all enjoyed the
opportunity provided in Committee to discuss our favourite
insults—whether they be the work of Nye Bevan or Winston
Churchill—and, naturally, to repeat them and direct them at each
other. However, I want to put on record that the amendments and our
concerns about section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986 are based on
serious worries about its potential impact, particularly on minority
communities. We agreed with the Government’s decision not to
overturn the other place’s decision to remove the word
“insulting” from section 5 on the basis of evidence
provided by the Director of Public Prosecutions that all the cases
brought so far could have been prosecuted without taking that word into
consideration. Nevertheless, concerns have been raised by a number of
groups, particularly Stonewall, which points out that 88% of incidents
of homophobic abuse that many of the people it represents have
experienced involved insults, abuse and harassment. Many of us are also
concerned about the Government’s management of debates such as
that on the “Innocence of Muslims”

Prosecution Service is clear that these are two very different elements

drug-driving, it is important that we consider carefully any extra
burdens that we place on the police, the Crown prosecutors and the
Courts Service when introducing a new offence. The Government published
an impact assessment in May last year that considered those issues. It
shows that removing the requirement to prove that a driver is impaired
will make it easier to enforce the law against
drug-drivers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031374000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0003.htm#13031374000054">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T17:26:49"></hs_TimeCode>
2010, about 40% of the proceedings in magistrates courts for driving
while impaired through drugs were withdrawn or dismissed. The
comparable figure for exceeding the drink-drive limit is just 3%. In
addition, research for Sir Peter North’s review of drink and 
<?notus-xml column=392?>drug-driving law found that in one police force, only 35% of positive
preliminary impairment tests led to findings of guilt at court in 2008
and 2009. It is clear, therefore, that the existing law on drug-driving
is unsatisfactory, resulting in costs being incurred unnecessarily by
the police, the CPS and the
courts.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031374000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0003.htm#13031374000055">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T17:26:49"></hs_TimeCode>
new offence will reduce the wasted time, expense and effort involved
when prosecutions under the existing impairment offence fail. It is not

on the level at which specified limits are set and on the drugs
specified for the offence, it is possible that introducing the new
offence, which does not require proof of impairment, will increase the
number of proceedings against drug-drivers. However, based
on the Government’s estimates, those costs will be more than
offset by savings from fewer road deaths and serious injuries. Indeed,

new clause 18 and amendment 120,
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T17:31:04"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr Burrowes) has explained that he
is concerned about the penalty regimes for drink and drug-driving. That
is the issue that has exercised people the most, so I think it will be
helpful if I dwell on it for a while. The new drug-driving offence
created in clause 41 will be subject to the same penalty regime as the
existing drink-driving offence of driving or being in charge of a motor
vehicle with an alcohol concentration above the prescribed limit. The
penalties available are mandatory disqualification from driving for at
least a year, and a fine of up to £5,000, and/or imprisonment
for up to six
months<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T17:31:46"></hs_TimeCode>. In
addition, there is the offence in section 3A of the Road Traffic Act
1988 of causing death by careless driving while under the influence of
drink or drugs, which carries a penalty of up to 14 years’
imprisonment. It is necessary for the prosecution to show that a
person’s driving was careless to secure a conviction for that
offence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T17:32:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031374000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0003.htm#13031374000062">Section
3ZB of the 1988 Act makes it a criminal offence to cause death by
driving while unlicensed, disqualified or uninsured. The maximum
penalty is two years’ imprisonment, or a fine, or both.
Amendment 120 would amend that section to include people who were
driving with a specified controlled drug in their body in excess of a
specified limit. Importantly for my hon. Friend, carelessness does not
have to be proved to secure a conviction under that section. I know
that he is concerned that requiring the prosecution to prove
carelessness puts too great a burden on it, but the Government are not
aware of any recent cases in which that has proved problematic.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T17:32:53"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

test for carelessness is broad, and CPS guidance suggests that a wide
variety of circumstances should be considered as carelessness. Indeed,
in the case of Lillian Groves, which has been raised by

for Croydon Central (Gavin Barwell)—although he is in another
debate now, he has been extremely vigilant in pursuing the case on
behalf of his constituents—the driver was convicted of causing
death by careless driving. It therefore seems likely that if the new
offence had been in force when the tragedy took place, the defendant
would have been tried under the section 3A offence, provided that the
prosecution could also show that he had a specified controlled drug in
his body in excess of the specified

hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, Southgate also proposed new clause
18 that would increase the maximum sentence for the prescribed limit
drink-driving offence to two years’ imprisonment. The United
Kingdom already has the toughest drink-driving penalties in Europe. Sir
Peter North’s 2010 review of drink and drug-driving law examined
the penalty regime and did not identify any evidence that would support
that increase in the maximum sentence. The Government are not aware of

Government consider that the existing offence framework is sufficient
and appropriate, and ensures that those who ought not to be on the
roads are removed from them. Where more serious offences are
committed—such as where others are hurt or killed—other
relevant offences could be pursued. I do not want to suggest in any way
that the Government are complacent about or insufficiently vigilant in
the face of such matters. We want to make our roads as safe as
possible, but it is worth noting that Britain has some of the safest
roads anywhere in Europe and the western world. That is due to
responsible social attitudes but also the fact that the legal framework

causing others to fear violence, or causing harassment, alarm or
distress to others. They would do that by removing the word
“insulting” from the offences under sections 4 and 4A of
the Public Order Act
1986<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T17:36:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031374000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0003.htm#13031374000068">My
hon. Friend may see the amendments as a helpful intervention to bring
those sections of the 1986 Act into line with the amendment to section
5 of that Act set out in clause 42, but that would be a mistake as it
would ignore the thorough consideration, consultation and debate
undertaken by the Government, both here and in the other place, before
agreeing to reform section 5. It would also ignore the significant
differences between the section 5 offence and the more serious offences
described in sections 4 and 4A. This is not just a tidying-up exercise;
sections 4 and 4A are materially different from section 5. Offences
under sections 4 and 4A require proof of intent to cause harm to
another person, and proof that harassment, alarm or distress was both
intended and actually caused to another person. The intent and harm
caused are the differentiating features of those offences, rather than
the likely effect of the words used or behaviour involved.</hs_Para>

insulting words that cause someone to fear violence against them, or
that have the deliberate intention of causing harassment, alarm or

which the perpetrator might not intend to cause harassment, alarm or
distress, and indeed none might have been caused. In the
Government’s view, using insulting words or behaviour in the
context of sections 4 or 4A oversteps the line between freedom of
speech and the freedom of someone 
<?notus-xml column=395?>to live in peace and safety. The line must be drawn somewhere, and the
Government believe it right to draw it between sections 4A and
5.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031374000070" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0003.htm#13031374000070"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T17:38:25"></hs_TimeCode>Furthermore,
during the long-running campaign that culminated in clause 42, one key
argument put forward by those seeking to remove
“insulting” from section 5 of the 1986 Act was that
removal would not have a negative impact on minority groups. The
reasoning behind that was that the police have more appropriate powers
available to deal with such unacceptable behaviour under
sections 4 and 4A of the 1986 Act. Having accepted that
argument as part of the reasoning behind the removal of
“insulting” from section 5, it seems perverse to remove
the protections to minorities provided by the “insulting”
limb in sections 4 and 4A.</hs_Para>

I ought to speak briefly to the single Government amendment in this
group, amendment 84, which provides for the enhanced householder
defence provisions in clause 30 to come into force on Royal Assent.
Clause 30 is designed to give householders greater latitude to protect
themselves in those terrifying circumstances when they are confronted
by intruders in their homes. We recognise that it is unusual, although
not unprecedented, to commence provisions of this nature on Royal
Assent. We would usually allow a gap of at least two months between
Royal Assent and commencement, to allow the enforcement agencies time
to prepare. However, in this case we are anxious to avoid any
unnecessary delay in delivering a coalition commitment and, more
important, a tangible enhancement of the protection that
householders have to defend themselves. The Government have
discussed the amendment with the police and the Crown
Prosecution Service, which are content with clause 30 being commenced
on Royal Assent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T17:40:23"></hs_TimeCode>.
We think the public would find it difficult to understand why
commencement had been delayed beyond Royal Assent, particularly if a
householder was attacked by an intruder in the intervening period while
acting to protect themselves or family members, but could not rely on
the heightened householder defence.</hs_Para>

Browne:</Member></B> The Government will publish a revised impact
assessment alongside our consultation on the drugs to be covered by the
new offence and the limit for each, and we will revise it again, if
required, before the draft regulations are laid before Parliament. As
the regulations are subject to the affirmative procedure, they will
need to be debated and approved by each House before they can be made
and come into force. Given the requirement to consult on the draft
regulations and then to have them approved, we are currently working on
the basis that the new offence will come into force in the
latter half of 2014, as I said a few moments ago.</hs_Para>

impact of the new offence just 12 months after Royal Assent
would be premature. However, I can assure the House that the Government
will commission research to evaluate the effectiveness of the new
offence once it is in operation. The research will take account of the
impact of the new offence on the police, prosecutors and the courts.
The results of such research will be published on the Department for
Transport’s website. A lot of the responsibility sits with the
Department for Transport rather than the Home Office, but I am not in a
position to give the hon. Lady a definitive date when these matters can
be considered in detail. All I can give is an assurance that this work
is being undertaken and that opportunities will exist to consider such

the Member for Croydon Central (Gavin Barwell) and I raised the matter
on Second Reading. My hon. Friend has rightly been lauded for his
excellent campaign on the issue. We relied at the time on the
explanatory notes to the Bill, and we received assurances that a person
who killed someone when driving while over the limit in relation to
drugs or alcohol would face the prospect of being charged with the
offence of causing death by careless driving while under the influence
of drink or drugs, which carries a 
<?notus-xml column=397?>heavy penalty. On the basis of those assurances, we proceeded to the
Bill Committee, where my hon. Friend the Minister gave further
clarification and assurances that the gap that I have described had

those figures and find out why that difference exists between those two
numbers. There is also a difference between the number of people tried

hon. Members will be aware, the Government are making a number of
changes to the judicial appointments process, including to the
selection process for the Lord Chief Justice and the heads of division.
As part of the changes, the details of the selection process that are
currently in the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 will move into
secondary legislation. There are many reasons for doing that, and many
improvements are being made. There is an urgency to this, however,
because the Lord Chief Justice is about to retire and we hope that it
will be possible to deal with the new appointment and any consequential
appointment of a head of division under the new system rather than the
old. The amendments aim to achieve that by briefly inserting the new
selection process into the 2005 Act, so that it applies to the
appointment of Lord Judge’s successor. I must stress that it
will be a transitory measure and will cease to have effect after the
appointment of the next Lord Chief Justice and any consequent head of
division. It is then intended that the secondary legislation will
follow<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T17:50:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031374000097" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0003.htm#13031374000097">Amendments
25 to 55 deal with the technical aspects of the change to the Lord
Chancellor’s role in the judicial appointments process,
including the transfer to the Lord Chief Justice or the Senior
President of Tribunals, as appropriate, of the power to decide upon
selections made by the Judicial Appointments Commission for certain
judicial offices below the High Court. The Government intend to retain
the Lord Chancellor’s role in all other aspects of these
appointments, particularly terms and conditions for fixed-term judicial
appointments where a fee is
paid<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T17:50:50"></hs_TimeCode>. However,
the Bill currently transfers the power to renew, or to refuse to renew,
fixed-term judicial appointments to the Lord Chief Justice and Senior
President of Tribunals. Amendments 25 to 55 therefore amend
schedule 13 so that that power is retained with the Lord Chancellor.
They ensure that, in exercising that role, the Lord Chancellor must, as
now, if deciding not to renew a fixed-term appointment, comply with any
requirement to secure the consent of the Lord Chief Justice or Senior
President of
Tribunals<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T17:51:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031374000098" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0003.htm#13031374000098">Amendments
23 and 24 also deal with the selection process for judicial
appointments and the move from primary to secondary legislation. As
part of these changes, the original idea was to move the requirement
for there to be a commissioner with special knowledge of Wales on the
commission into secondary legislation, but on further consideration,
the Government decided that it was important to retain an appropriate
level of input by a lay member of the commission with a special
knowledge of Wales and that that requirement should remain in primary
legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T17:52:13"></hs_TimeCode>. The
amendments therefore reinstate the requirement in the 2005 Act that
those selecting persons for appointment as commissioners should ensure,
as far as practicable, that there is at least one lay commissioner with
special knowledge of
Wales<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T17:52:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031374000099" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0003.htm#13031374000099">Amendment
59 relates to the judicial deployment provisions in schedule 14. The
objective is to give the Lord Chief Justice more flexibility in
deploying judges to different courts and tribunals. That supports an
important objective for the Government because it means that judges can
be used efficiently. Individual judges will also benefit, if they have
a wider breadth of experience and can develop their judicial careers as
a result. The 
<?notus-xml column=400?>policy was brought forward in partnership with the judiciary and the aim
has always been to move forward collectively in the delivery of our
shared aims and
objectives<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T17:53:17"></hs_TimeCode>.
After further consultation with the judiciary and further thought, it
has been decided that the particular skills and experience needed in
the Crown court mean that it should be removed from the flexible
deployment provisions. Those matters should be dealt with by Crown
court judges, as happens now.</hs_Para>

10 to 21 are technical and minor amendments dealing with the single
family court provisions. I can be brief, because there is only one
point of substance. At the moment, magistrates courts can vary
maintenance orders registered with them, but because in future the
family courts will be able to issue those orders, it is necessary to
provide that magistrates will no longer have that variation power,
which will lie with the family courts—a victory for the

Court has been discussed with the president of the Court, and I am
pleased to report that those discussions have been successfully

the Court’s agreement. Thus the president of the UK Supreme

the chief executive. It is no longer necessary for the chief executive
to agree the staffing structure with the Lord Chancellor, and the

not to give credit where it is not due, but to encourage ability
wherever it may be found. We have seen many instances where it has been
argued that merit and diversity are mutually exclusive, but we have
argued that a diverse judiciary is not artificial or missing out on
talent—it is quite the other way round. Diversity matters in
both principle and practice. A judiciary that incorporates a range of

It is modelled directly on a law in Northern Ireland that

understand that it is reasonably uncontroversial. A second strength of
the amendment is that it is in the spirit of the diversity provisions
that are already in the Bill. It does not specify process
or demand the filling of quotas, and it is in keeping
with the aim to bring about a long-term shift in the present
culture. It asks for awareness, intelligent decision making, and
encouragement for the best from every

to recruit. Opening up the possibilities of recruitment and promotion
in the profession is vital if we are to gain the best and the brightest

the Government have made a great deal over the past few weeks of their

implement part 3 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement

extensive reform to challenge bad practice. Part 3 sets out improved

carefully to the speech made by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Darlington (Jenny Chapman), and I entirely share and sympathise
with the thrust of her argument: we do need to make sure that the
regulation of the behaviour of bailiffs is not just about
certification; and the continuing behaviour of individual bailiffs does
need to be monitored, tracked and adequately assessed, so that
regulations are adjusted to keep pace with changing practices in debt
collection.</hs_Para>

all know that debt collection is a sad fact of life that affects a
large number of our constituents. We have all, in our case
loads, doubtless come across worrying stories about abuses of power. It
is right to acknowledge that the Government are moving, with their
transformative agenda, to address large parts of the concerns that
Members rightly have. Using the existing legislation to create new
regulations is a good step forward. Importantly, the strengthening of
the certification process, in the form of training and the like, is a
valuable way forward, as is the creation of the new fixed-fee system.
As I have already said, that deals only with the point of certification
and not with practice. We must be realistic and we must acknowledge
that taking a snapshot of the behaviour of individual bailiffs will not
deal with many of the problems that beset people who are in debt but
still deserve to be treated with
respect<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T18:14:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

new clause takes a slightly different course from the Opposition
amendment. It seeks to build on existing structures in Her
Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service and to use those
mechanisms to create a system whereby individuals who have been wronged
can make complaints and seek redress of grievance. The grounds I have
set out relate to behaviour that is disproportionate to the debt and
circumstances involved and to a situation where the debtor’s
goods are insufficient in value to satisfy the debt. Giving the court
the discretion to stay orders made in prior proceedings is, I submit, a
cost-effective, streamlined and appropriate way of building in the
extra check and balance that is needed in the system of
regulation.</hs_Para>

new clause does not stop there but goes on to deal in subsection (2)
with the discretion of the court. Importantly, subsection (5) would
give power to the Lord Chancellor to review data on complaints and
allow the regulatory framework to be updated when, as a result of that
review, a body of evidence demonstrates that change is needed. There
are some concerns that the creation of such a system could lead to a
flood of applications that would mean that the debt enforcement system
fell into some form of disrepute. I do not accept that. I believe that
the creation of such systems incentivises the behaviour of bailiffs so
that their standard of conduct becomes even better. That is the thrust
of the Government’s reforms and, I think, the combined will of
Parliament. We want to see a change of culture and a constant striving
for improvement.</hs_Para>

proposal would create a more streamlined procedure than the ombudsman
path. It is simple, clear and allows individuals to have proper redress
against bad bailiff behaviour. I agree that challenging the
certification of bailiffs is important, but that path is hardly ever
used. Unless there is a concomitant increase in the number of
challenges to certification, I am worried that the system will not keep
pace, however well intentioned the reforms are, with the change that so
many of our constituents quite rightly demand.</hs_Para>

by the Northern Ireland Judicial Appointments Commission was not
principally that there was an under-representation of Catholics. It was
that there was a gross under-representation of women. So from having
been far behind us, Northern Ireland is now far ahead. According to the
last figures that I have seen for the judiciary in Northern Ireland,
57% were men and 43% were women—streets ahead of our judiciary

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T18:31:58"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Blackburn (Mr Straw) left off? I entirely accept that what
has happened since 2005 has been very disappointing indeed. We had high
hopes. I was involved in the debates at that time and we expected that
we would see far more women at the very top of the judiciary than we
have done. He mentioned one out of 12 in the Supreme Court.
I believe it is four out of 38 in the Court of Appeal. It is
not acceptable and there is no question but that more needs to be
done<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T18:32:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031374000166" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0004.htm#13031374000166">As
the right hon. Gentleman conceded to some extent, we have done much in
the Bill to try to achieve that, starting with flexible working, which
could make a difference, and the tipping-point provisions where two
people are of an equal standard. There has been a long debate in the
legal profession and among judges about exactly what merit means in
this context. Lord Bingham and Lord Phillips previously said that it
was the judicial qualities, plus what the needs of the Court were,
which had to be put together to establish what the commission should be
looking for. One of the needs of the Court is to have the wisdom of
highly intelligent women who have sat as judges for many years and who
come to the role with the experience of women, which is, admittedly,
different in all parts of the House. We are very keen to see the
position
improved<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T18:33:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031374000167" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0004.htm#13031374000167">There
are one or two encouraging signs. For example, those entering the legal
profession are now balanced and there is some progress, as the right
hon. Gentleman said, at the lower levels. There is no question but that
more needs to be done. The Bill makes a start with the flexible working
and the tipping point. There was a great deal of discussion in the
other place about how to try to make matters go forward faster, and it
was accepted there that one way would be a statutory duty underpinning
the leadership role of the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Chief Justice.
That is why, as the right hon. Gentleman said, paragraph 11 of schedule
13 provides that both office holders must take such steps as they
consider appropriate for the purposes of encouraging
diversity.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031374000168" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0004.htm#13031374000168">Of
course, the right hon. Gentleman is correct that that is not the
application of an objective standard. We are putting trust in the Lord
Chief Justice and the Lord Chancellor to take this matter seriously and
come up with a plan for the steps they consider appropriate for the
purposes of encouraging diversity. For my part, given that we have not
done that previously, and given that I trust those office holders to
take it seriously and pursue it vigorously, I am prepared to give them
the 
<?notus-xml column=410?>chance without making it an objective standard. We are putting trust in
them, under paragraph 11 of schedule 13, to do the job. I
believe that the current Lord Chief Justice takes that very
seriously—I have discussed it with him and he certainly gives
that impression—as does the Lord
Chancellor<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T18:35:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031374000169" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0004.htm#13031374000169"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Straw" PimsId="4165" UID="13031374003415" xid="570" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0004.htm#13031374003415">Mr
Straw:</Member></B> I have the highest regard for the Lord Chief
Justice and, as it happens, for the Lord Chancellor, so that is not the
issue. Will the hon. Gentleman explain something for me? Exactly the
same arguments could have been used with regard to the Northern Ireland
judiciary, because we were trusting the same Lord Chancellor—the
same person—until 2009, and the Lord Chief Justice of Northern
Ireland is a man of the highest quality. Therefore, if these measures
have not only been needed in Northern Ireland but have worked, why is
the hon. Gentleman moving on to say—I think he is about to do
so—that they are not needed in England and
Wales<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T18:36:21"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T18:39:36"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031374000170" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0004.htm#13031374000170"><B><Member ContinuationText="The Solicitor-General" PimsId="907" UID="13031374003416" xid="263" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0004.htm#13031374003416">The

for this House simply to say, “Oh well. Let’s nudge it

be a legal duty on those officer holders to take those steps, that

Loughton</B> (East Worthing and Shoreham) (Con):</Member> I am very
grateful, particularly to you personally, Mr Speaker, for
this opportunity to raise a matter in the House that relates to a
criminal investigation that has been conducted against me by Sussex
police over the past six and a half months before being dropped, but
which has implications for all hon. Members and how we communicate with
our
constituents<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T19:13:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031374001246" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0004.htm#13031374001246">I
am sure that I speak for all hon. Members when I say that we all
appreciate our constituents—it is one of the reasons we do our
job—but I doubt that there are many hon. Members without a tiny
minority of constituents who either by design or default try to make
our lives hell. A very few think they have a divine right to be
gratuitously rude to MPs or other figures in the public eye, and some
think they can be offensive because of their own political
allegiances—although I have never had that problem with my own
opposition locally, with whom I have always had a constructive
relationship—and others have personal issues that make them
obsessive.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031374001247" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0004.htm#13031374001247">In
the case of Mr Kieran Francis of Shoreham in my constituency, he has
all three attributes, as a result of which he has worked tirelessly to
try to make my life hell, together with that of my staff at Westminster
and at my constituency office, local councillors, council officials and
countless others. To cut a long story short, going back many years Mr
Francis has sought my help to promote formal complaints against the
police for brutality against him; against the local hospital for not
giving him the treatment he thinks he needs as a result of police
brutality; against the Benefits Agency for having the temerity to
summon him for an assessment; against the Courts Service for not
enabling him to progress legal action; and against the local council
and council officials for all manner of things. I am not aware that any
of his complaints have ever been upheld on any substantive issues. He
is a serial complainer with more chips on his shoulder than
McCain’s, and as someone who does not work and is on benefits,
he has too much time on his hands, as
well.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031374001248" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0004.htm#13031374001248">When
Mr Francis does not get his way, he becomes abusive. He once stormed
out of my surgery accusing me of being “an effing Nazi”.
He has attended my street surgeries to harangue my local councillors
and me. He rings my office repeatedly to abuse my staff, despite having
been told constantly that he should not contact my office, having
reduced a former member of staff to tears when she was heavily
pregnant. But of course Mr Francis knows better. He also
knows better than to commit his abuse to paper, so last year he
increasingly took to social media, including his own blog, where terms
beginning with the F word, the C word and the W word directed at me and
others are commonplace, along with creatively doctored
photographs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031374001249" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0004.htm#13031374001249">I
am referred to as “an arrogant, lying, racist
arsehead”—one of the more moderate terms of endearment
that Mr Francis uses—and am likened to the perpetrators of the
holocaust. The cabinet of Adur council in my constituency is referred
to as “the Führer council”; a 
<?notus-xml column=426?>council official is an “ugly pig-faced fascist”; a
constituent is condemned as “a paedophile”; and another
who is now suffering mental health problems as a result is taunted with
the phrase, “Let’s hope his **** shrivels up and drops
off whilst he is suffering a horrible death at the hands of a nasty
disease.” Elsewhere, he has boasted about his trips to far-left
rallies in the Czech Republic; on social media, he details his dream
dinner guests, including Adolf Hitler and Pol Pot, and is pictured with
his prized collection of over 300 edged weapons. He also describes a
scene in the local council chamber drenched with blood; he is there
with machine gun in hand until he wakes up and realises it is only a
dream—much to his
disappointment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031374001250" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0004.htm#13031374001250">Let
me give a more graphic idea of what I am talking about. Mr Francis has
recently posted a photo-shopped image of me taken when, as a Minister
last year, I was visiting a school in east London in support of the
City Year charity, except that now I have Nazi insignia on my jacket
and I am toting a smoking gun in a playground full of screaming,
fleeing children. I will not read you the caption, Mr Speaker, but it
is just one of many such tasteless and grossly offensive postings.
These appear on a blog run by Mr Francis, previously masquerading under
the pseudonym of “Lord Hardy Ha Ha”, with a photograph of
him wearing a terrorist-style balaclava. Despite complaints to Sussex
police, these remain on the
web.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031374001251" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0004.htm#13031374001251">Last
year, Mr Francis engaged in almost constant complaints against the
local Adur district council, in respect of which he was a tenant of a
council house and had an allotment. The most prolific issue was on
account of his losing his allotment because of complaints about his
abusive behaviour against other allotment holders and his using human
excrement on his compost heap. After a court case, which he lost, the
council placed Mr Francis on their “customer of
concern” list—or “COC” list as Mr Francis
proudly and loudly boasted. On the internal document for the COC list
that he obtained under freedom of information, under the section marked
“description” he is referred to as
“unkempt”—cue another complaint from Mr Francis
that Adur council should deign to refer to him as unkempt.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13031374001252" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0004.htm#13031374001252">After<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T19:18:30"></hs_TimeCode>
failing to get satisfaction from Adur council and after one of his
regular abusive visits to one of my street surgeries, Mr Francis wrote
to me. I investigated and sent an e-mail back to my constituent, saying
that given that the dictionary definition of “unkempt” is
“untrimmed, dishevelled and rough”, the council’s
description—not mine—struck me as “eminently
accurate”. Anyone who has seen a photograph of the pony-tailed,
shaggily bearded Mr Francis could not but concur. For good measure, and
uniquely in almost 16 years of being a constituency MP—but
probably unwisely—I let my true feelings get the better of me
and referred to Mr Francis’s latest whinges as self-
serving nonsense. In place of the word “nonsense”,
however, the word I used, which I took off Mr Francis’s own
blog—one that you have given me special dispensation to use
today, Mr Speaker—was “bollocks”. It
was one of the tamer terms frequently used against me and others by Mr
Francis.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031374001253" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0004.htm#13031374001253">Indeed,
the word is often used figuratively as a noun to mean
“nonsense”, as an expletive following a minor accident or
misfortune, or as an adjective to mean “poor quality” or
“useless”. Conversely, the word also figures in idiomatic
phrases such as “the dog’s bollocks” 
<?notus-xml column=427?>or “the bollocks”, referring to something that is admired,
approved of or well-respected. Thank you to Wikipedia for that!
Moreover, as Members may be aware, the well-respected overseas aid
charity ActionAid has been running a high- profile and successful
campaign called “Bollocks to Poverty”. I therefore
thought that I was on safe ground. Having suffered years of abuse at
the hands of Mr Francis, I thought it was about time to make the point
that enough was enough, and that a proportionately robust reply was in
order. Someone needed to stand up to his self-indulgent time wasting
that has cost the taxpayer thousands over the
years.</hs_Para>

next and the reason for securing the debate today—as well as for
the national media publicity that has accompanied my case—has
caused consternation. Within hours of receiving my e-mail, and before
phone calls to my Westminster office and a foul-mouthed tirade at my
researcher, Mr Francis contacted the police claiming that I was guilty
of an offence under the Malicious Communications Act 1988. A few days
later, I was contacted by a detective inspector from Sussex police
requesting a meeting to discuss a “sensitive issue”. I
responded immediately, saying that I was happy to help in whatever way
I could, and 48 hours later a discussion of a “sensitive
issue” became a 90-minute recorded interview under caution in
Worthing police custody
suite.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031374001255" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0004.htm#13031374001255">I
was presented with a disclosure document that had given rise to the
interview, in which Mr Francis had claimed that the single e-mail that
I had sent him qualified as a malicious communication
because</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13031374003368" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0004.htm#13031374003368">“Mr
Francis states that he is of Romany Gypsy origin and feels that the
references made against him within the email are of a racist nature and
that the email contains insults of a grossly offensive
nature.”</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13031374001256" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0004.htm#13031374001256">So
using the word “unkempt” is deemed racist, purely on the
basis that a constituent with a grudge says that it is, and the police
go along with that. Even though it came as a complete surprise to me,
and indeed to the local council, that Mr Francis is of Romany Gypsy
origin, especially as he has lived in a council property for all the
years I have dealt with him, since when has “unkempt”
been a term associated with Romany Gypsies, let alone a derogatory one?
Surely, if anything, it would be the act of identifying the term with
Romany Gypsies that could be construed as racist, but that was down to
Mr Francis, not me. As for his taking gross offence at one of the more
moderate terms used on his own blog, whatever happened to
proportionality? Some people might take it as offensive—although
I doubt that they would take it as grossly offensive—but the
likes of the constituent I have already described? 1 think
not.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031374001257" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0004.htm#13031374001257">I
was happy to help the police with their inquiries. It is absolutely
right that all MPs should be treated no differently from any of their
constituents, notwithstanding the occupational hazard facing us and
others in public life that we are more high-profile targets for
vexatious complaints. I have no problem with the fact that the rather
embarrassed custody sergeant had to go through the formalities before
the interview, asking whether I could read or write or had mental
health problems; the answers were yes and no in that order. I was happy
to tell the police everything I knew about my constituent, and to offer
to hand over any correspondence that I had had with him over the years.
In particular, I informed them of Mr Francis’s blog and Twitter
account, which had given rise to the tone of my e-mail and both of 
<?notus-xml column=428?>which he had taken down at the same time as making the complaint to the
police, knowing that they were self-incriminating. He is now claiming
that his blog post-dated my e-mail. That is, of course, another of his
lies, and the police should have traced it through the internet service
provider.</hs_Para>

basis to the case that had been advanced by a serial complainer, well
versed in making malicious and vexatious complaints. The case could
have been terminated at that stage. It would have satisfied the
procedures that sprang from the Macpherson report, under which alleged
race incidents should be taken seriously and should be subject to at
least an initial investigation. However, there was no remotely racial
side to this case, and any offence in the language was small beer
compared to what I and other victims of Mr Francis had been subjected
to over many years. I personally resent any suggestion that I am
racist. Racism is an insidious cancer against which I have always
fought. Equally insidious, though, are the forces of political
correctness that seem to have been brought to bear in this instance,
which can do so much damage to good race relations and social harmony
and which too often triumph over common sense.</hs_Para>

however, a full-blown investigation ensued, lasting six and a half
months. I had contact with at least six separate officers who were
involved, and a file was then sent to the Crown Prosecution Service in
December. All my Westminster office staff were interviewed, as well as
a former secretary who lives in Hampshire. We trawled the archives for
all copies of previous correspondence, which were eventually collected
two months later. Throughout that time, Mr Francis continued to post
abusive articles about me on his blog, while I remained silent in order
not to prejudice the case or be seen trying to influence the
outcome.</hs_Para>

formal complaint of my own and that the blog could provide material
evidence, it transpired that the police had failed to take copies of
the blog entries before they disappeared. They had lost their own
police evidence and subsequently had to come to ask me if I had taken a

the Crown Prosecution Service decided there was no case to answer and

was given a prepared list of one-sentence answers, effectively saying
the investigation was dealt with in an exemplary way. The chief

never experience another constituent as nasty as Mr Francis and will
not feel the need to use the level of robust language that I felt
proportionately offensive only in this case, I cannot say that the same
dilemma will not happen again, because I still do not understand
exactly what the offence was that merited the investigation and

find yourself under criminal investigation for some form of inverted

issued with a manual of words and phrases that we can or cannot use?
Perhaps we need a whole new section in “Erskine May”.
Will this House and hon. Members in future be muted in speaking their

it would be helpful if I set out briefly how the protection
of our freedom of speech afforded by parliamentary privilege
extends to Members’ correspondence with constituents. Freedom of
speech for Members of Parliament is guaranteed by article 9 of the Bill
of Rights of 1689, but it provides absolute protection only to
proceedings in Parliament. The meaning of “proceedings”
in that context is to an extent open to interpretation and I am not
aware that the issue raised by my hon. Friend of privilege for a
Member’s correspondence with a constituent has ever been tested
in the courts. The legal position is clear: the House has never sought
to assert that privilege should apply to communications between Members
and their constituents or other members of the

been many cases to test the boundaries of privilege in that regard but
the basic principles are clearly understood. It has been established
that letters from constituents to Members are not proceedings in
Parliament and it therefore follows that Members’ replies to
constituents are not proceedings either. Indeed, the courts have
separately determined that Members’ letters to Ministers are
similarly not considered to be proceedings in Parliament. However, the
courts have regarded some types of communication to a Member of
Parliament by a constituent as enjoying qualified privilege in certain
circumstances. For example, a Member who passes on a
constituent’s concerns in good faith to the proper authority,
such as a Minister, will not be protected by absolute privilege but is
likely to be protected by qualified privilege.</hs_Para>

privilege might also apply to communications with a link to
parliamentary proceedings, such as a speech or parliamentary question,
or those that relate to a matter of public concern. That will depend on
the circumstances, but in their ordinary dealings with constituents,
Members of Parliament, like everyone else, should expect to be subject
to the laws of the land, including that on malicious communication. As
all Members would agree, however, Members and constituents should
expect the law to deal with matters proportionately.</hs_Para>

am sure that my hon. Friend is aware of the Green Paper on
parliamentary privilege that the Government published last April, which
arose in part from concerns that parliamentary privilege might be able
to be used by MPs to avoid prosecution for offences relating to
expenses, but also from a feeling that there might be scope usefully to
clarify the law in certain areas, including on the
definition of parliamentary proceedings and Select Committee powers. On
the issue of Members’ correspondence with constituents, the
Green Paper set out the Government’s view that, on balance, it
is preferable to let the courts determine the boundaries of privilege
on a case-by-case basis than to introduce a statutory qualified
privilege for MPs’ correspondence. To extend an absolute
privilege to correspondence between MPs and constituents could
encourage malicious complaints to be made to MPs that are damaging to
third parties. I am not aware that such an extension has been seriously
advocated.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031374001284" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/debtext/130313-0004.htm#13031374001284">A<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T19:38:46"></hs_TimeCode>

believe that a ten-minute rule Bill made the same point yesterday. It
is absolutely true that Sikhs and other members of the Commonwealth
have served this country not only with distinction, but with great
selflessness, which has been the most remarkable aspect of the service
that they have diligently given to this country.
However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T09:50:38"></hs_TimeCode>, we
should be aware that the Sikh community in the UK still faces
significant challenges.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T09:50:35"></hs_TimeCode> have been
very positive during the debate, as we should be, about the

is important to recognise the challenge of the caste system that still
exists, or the prejudice—I should perhaps be more specific about
it—that is widespread. It is not unfair to say that it can often
go further than simple classism; it is a deep-rooted bias of perhaps
the most unpleasant kind. The sad aspect of the issue is that the
problem is not born outside the Sikh religion, but very often generated
within the Sikh community. I have had Sikhs come to my surgery, for
example, who are so frustrated and who feel that they are being held
back because of prejudices that have been imposed on them. The problem
is perhaps little understood by the wider community, but it needs to be
tackled.</hs_Para>

of the issue is the ignorance of some aspects of the Sikh religion,

with Sikhs wearing a kirpan. The only explanation I can come up with is
that it may be to do with the hundreds of years of Englishmen fearing
Scotsmen wearing the sgian dubh. The fear of Scotsmen wearing that
dagger might be behind what is very often a fearful reaction to Sikhs
wearing the kirpan. Perhaps my race needs to move on. We should see the

conclusion, I do not claim—and have not claimed, throughout this

seen over the years the enormous, positive impact that Sikhs have had,
not only in my constituency, but across the UK. There are still
undoubtedly many issues that need to be resolved, yet I want to pay
tribute to British Sikhs today for all that they have achieved. Their

thanks as well. We held a conference in 1997, where we brought the Sikh

the whole concept of Sikhism is based not only on community, but on
family. One issue that we addressed was the inability of families to be
united, purely because the visa system was not working properly. I want
to thank those Members of Parliament and others—and the Sikh
community overall—who campaigned for the opening of the visa
office in Jalandhar and the work that was done to free that up.
However, the issues on visas remain. We still have constituents coming

been exploited by agents as well.</hs_Para>

there is not simply a problem with visas? A number of Sikh members of
our communities have lived in the UK for many years, but due to the

McDonnell:</Member></B> The hon. Lady is absolutely spot on, and that
is one of the issues that we need to work together on. I know that
members of the all-party group are working on that
now<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T09:57:08"></hs_TimeCode>. I have to

second issue, briefly, is education. I am not a supporter of religious
schools; I believe that people should be educated together, but I
understand that while we have religious schools, no group should be 
<?notus-xml column=78?>discriminated against. That is why I supported the establishment of Guru
Nanak school, the first Sikh school in my constituency. The resources
that have gone into it from successive Governments and from the
community overall have made it, frankly, the best school in the
country. The educational results are phenomenally good. In addition,
the whole ethos of the school, thanks to the head teacher, Rajinder
Sandhu, is that everybody is welcomed into the school. In fact, when my
son did not attend, I got a bit of stick, and he did not attend
because, if he had, I would have been accused of preferential treatment
for trying to get my son into such a school. The school says,
“We open our doors to everyone, not just Sikhs”, but in
addition, “We send our students out into the wider community and
we invite other schools to work with us.” It has secured a
partnership right across the community, and I want to commend the
school, the head teacher and others, for their hard work.</hs_Para>

behalf of the House, I also send our condolences to the family of
Poonam Bhattal. Some Members will know that the young girl lost her
life on a school trip to Switzerland. Her funeral was last week, and
her death has devastated the school and the wider community.  I

third issue is culture. The point that came up was that we need to
maintain the Sikh culture and the Punjabi language. How should we do
that? One of the ideas was to use modern media, and radio in
particular. One of the first community radio stations to be given a
licence was Desi radio in the constituency of
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T09:59:12"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Ealing, Southall (Mr Sharma). It has been a tremendous
success, as a result of the community coming together and, to be frank,
because of some heroes and heroines. Ajit Khera, who has been the chair
of Desi radio all the way through, has demonstrated how a community can
be welded together and how radio can be used, particularly with regard
to the promotion of language and
culture.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T09:55:33"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T09:52:48"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T09:51:27"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

Sikh culture and its history and achievements to a much wider circle of
people than just the Sikh community here. I am very pleased that last

sometimes get anxious about the militaristic impression of the Sikhs.
The Sikhs themselves became warriors at one point, yes. Why? Not
because they were imperialists or invaders, but because they wanted to
protect the Khalsa; they wanted to protect their own community. They
transferred that commitment on, into their commitment to serving
Britain as well, and that was 
<?notus-xml column=79?>done in partnership; it never involved acceptance of
subjugation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T10:01:05"></hs_TimeCode>.

of the fundamental issues that has been raised time and time again with
us is human rights, and we cannot avoid the issue. We had discussion

the injustices that took place, many of which have never been
addressed. I do not believe that any discussion on the Sikh community
should not involve discussion of the need that there still is to bring
to book the people who committed those atrocities during that period,
because we have never found the ultimate truth and many of them have
never been brought to

addition, there have been injustices here. We have mentioned the
wearing of the kirpan and other religious duties. Injustices still go
on. We still get individual constituents who have been turned away at
the London Eye, from concerts at Wembley and so on. Madame Tussauds was
another example. We tried to ensure that at least some standard
guidelines were issued, and to a certain extent, when it comes to
public service, we have achieved that. The problem occurs when the
individual private contractors are not taking note and not reflecting
the culture of diversity in our society. More work needs to be done on
that. I echo the point that has been raised. I know that the all-party
group recently sent a delegation to Europe. We need to ensure that we
are educating our European partners well on how to address that

congratulate my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T10:04:26"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Dartford (Gareth Johnson) on securing the
debate. I was going to open the first paragraph of this speech in
Punjabi, but I was told by <I>Hansard</I> that that would create a few
difficulties. I was inspired in that by Hardeep Singh Kohli, who did a
piece for Channel 4 many years ago called “In Search of the
Tartan Turban”. He was fretting about how he was going to do a
comic gig in a working-class pub in Glasgow. It was going to be a
really tough gig, and he was wondering how he was going to do it. He
did the first 30 seconds in Punjabi, and hon. Members can imagine the
laughter spreading round the pub, but let us be honest: this is not a
working-class pub in Glasgow and I am no Hardeep Singh
Kohli—that was a slight
digression<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T10:05:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031340000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/halltext/130313h0001.htm#13031340000062">If
hon. Members do not mind, I would like to paint a backdrop of the
spiritual background and the canvas of Sikh philosophy, as I think that
many other speakers in the debate will be talking about the
contribution of Sikhs in business and other aspects of life and the
role that they play in the community. I want to highlight a few of
these points, because I believe that it will help hon. Members in all
parts of the Chamber to engage with the debate if they get an idea of
what Sikhi is and Sikh philosophy. I do not mean that as a rebuke to
any Member who is genuine about taking part in the debate today.
However, a big part of being Punjabi and a big part of being Sikh is
always to be big-hearted and to say it as you see it. That is central
to the cultural
background.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031340000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/halltext/130313h0001.htm#13031340000063">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T10:06:31"></hs_TimeCode>

the e-mails that come into my inbox, is that messages come in saying,
“This e-mail represents the message of the Sikh
community”, “This is the view of the Sikh

thinking.” Speaking candidly, I know that sometimes individuals
will say, “I will deliver the Sikh vote in my ward”,
“I will deliver the Sikh vote for this street” or
“I will deliver the Sikh vote in this constituency.” I
have to say to all hon. Members that that is absolute tosh. The Sikh
community are no different from anyone

is the case, particularly among young Sikhs—I am heartened by
what I have learned through my interaction with them—that the
issues that Sikhs talk about are the issues that everyone else cares
about, such as the education of their children and how they want to
advance, but central to them is their passionate belief about what
defines them as Sikh. That drives them through their careers, in the
community, in business and in many other aspects of
life.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031340000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/halltext/130313h0001.htm#13031340000065">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T10:06:54"></hs_TimeCode>
term “Sikh” means someone who dedicates themselves to
become a “disciple and seeker” or, to put it another way,
to learn to be a student towards spiritual enlightenment. There were 10
Sikh gurus, and the idea of each respective guru was to be an
embodiment of scholarly learning, wisdom and discipline. These traits
were passed on from guru to guru, starting from the first guru, Guru
Nanak Dev Ji, who lived from 1469 to 
<?notus-xml column=81?>1539 and who taught that this can be done through a variety of measures.
The first thing is Kirat Karo—the <I>Hansard </I>writers should
not worry; I will provide them with the written version. That means
earning one’s livelihood through honest means, while remembering
God—a way of adopting personal responsibility, if you like. The
second is Vand Chhako—sharing with others. A striking feature of
Sikhism is the idea of Seva. That is the idea of always sharing what we
have. The final thing is Naam Japo—constant remembrance of the
Lord and always being humble and
modest.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031340000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/halltext/130313h0001.htm#13031340000066">My

congratulated me on being a Sikh Member of Parliament. I am the only

this is why we do not see more Sikhs coming forward into politics: to
be a Sikh, one must always be humble and contained within oneself and
always be modest. I have to tell hon. Members that that does not always
fit well with politics. As we know, this business is often about
self-promotion, and that goes across a central element of Sikhi, which
is always to be modest. When I get home on a Thursday evening and my
wife is waiting for me, the first thing to do is to bath the three
children, read them their stories and always remember who you are. That

Sikhism.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031340000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/halltext/130313h0001.htm#13031340000067">Sikhs

want to elaborate on the principle that
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T10:09:29"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Dartford alluded to, and make another link between buses
and military history. The battle of Saragarhi has not been mentioned in
115 years, and now it has been mentioned in Westminster
twice in 24 hours, so there you go—it is like buses coming all
at once. That element of history beautifully encapsulates the Sikh
philosophy. It was a battle in which 21 Sikhs fought against 10,000
armed Afghans. The battle of Saragarhi, fought by the young men of the
36th Sikhs in 1897, was the epitome of raw courage, sheer grit and
unshakable determination.</hs_Para>

was a signalling post between Fort Lockhart and Fort Gulistan on the
Samana ridge, in what now is the North West Frontier Province between
Pakistan and Afghanistan. On September 12 1897, about 10,000 Afghan
tribesmen swarmed towards Saragarhi, while another group cut off all
links. For the next six hours,  
<?notus-xml column=82?>the small detachment of 21 men stood firm and repulsed all attacks. The
Sikhs fought to the last man. All 21 men were posthumously awarded the
Indian order of merit—the highest gallantry award given to
Indian ranks in those days and equivalent to the Victoria Cross. When
the gallantry of Saragarhi was recounted in the British Parliament, the
account drew a standing ovation from the Members of Parliament present
and was brought to the notice of Queen Victoria. I highlight that
battle, because it illustrates not only Sikh courage, but a second
element of Sikhi—in no other community in the world would such a
battle occur and nobody talk about it. Only the Sikhs would do
something like that. I have gone into such detail because it
encapsulates the beautiful concepts and ideology of the Sikh spirit.
After his death, Guru Gobind Singh, the final guru, dictated that all
Sikh thinking should be embodied in the Guru Granth Sahib. It is often
referred to as the Sikh’s holy book, but it is much more than
that. It is a blueprint for how we should conduct our lives in a
modest, humble and wise
manner.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031340000072" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/halltext/130313h0001.htm#13031340000072">I

Prime Minster recently became the first serving British Prime Minister
to visit Amritsar, and I was lucky enough to accompany him on that
visit. There were some poor people there from Uttar Pradesh, and when
the Prime Minister went through the Golden Temple—the Harmandir
Sahib—I could see that the people who organised the trip were
anxious to take him away from them, but he indicated that he wanted to
meet them. As was highlighted earlier in the debate, there are four
doors in a Sikh temple—one on each side—which mean that
it is open to all faiths and communities. The Prime Minister met those
incredibly poor people, and I can tell hon. Members how humbling it was
for him. That, again, encapsulates the idea of

Sikhism will encourage more Sikhs to come forward. My parents are here
today, because they came for yesterday’s ten-minute rule Bill
debate and the debate today. This will annoy my family incredibly,
because my wife is always admonishing me for name-checking whenever I
make such speeches, but my oldest daughter encapsulated my feelings on
Sikhism quite wonderfully when she said, “Dad we have such a
cool faith, why don’t we talk about it much more?” I hope
that in some small way, by making this speech this morning, I have

steel and other heavy engineering works. The national story of course
goes back much further that that, as we have heard, with brave Sikh
service in two world wars. For those early immigrants in Wolverhampton,
life was not easy. They were often packed into crowded living
conditions, separated from family and friends and doing heavy physical
work. They sometimes met with friendship and good experiences, but they
also sometimes met with discrimination, perhaps even hostility and
certainly a lack of understanding. That has changed a lot over time,

campaigned, as did Sikh organisations. I acknowledge the good efforts
of the Department for Transport in working with the European Union and
other Governments to reach a successful conclusion. The result is that
the European Commission now says that swab and wand technology used in
UK airports can be used throughout the Community. I am a strong
believer in good, tough, strong security at our airports. My Sikh
constituents agree that it is essential, but if we can achieve it in a
way that respects people’s faith, so much the better,
particularly because freedom of movement is a founding principle of the
EU. The UK Government’s engagement with the issue has produced a
far better result than we saw on bank bonuses and other issues. If
there is a lesson in that, it is that positive engagement with the EU,

many others over the years can come to the UK, make a new life, put
down roots and be part of the country’s success. My own parents

second generation in having built up really successful businesses and
faith organisations, while recognising the connection that they still
had with the mother country, particularly through charity and in giving
in difficult circumstances. The third generation in

genuinely as Scots or Brits—see this country as their
own<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T10:38:54"></hs_TimeCode>. That is

Reynolds</B> (Wolverhampton North East) (Lab):</Member> Briefly, I am
proud that we have an incredibly strong Sikh community in
Wolverhampton; we have the second largest concentration of Sikhs in the
country. I pay tribute to the Sikh community for the contribution it
makes socially, culturally and economically, and to my predecessor, Ken
Purchase who, alongside other Members of Parliament and councillors,
has worked so hard over the past three or four decades with the Sikh
community and other communities to foster mutual understanding,
tolerance and community relations. That success is particularly
impressive given that we unfortunately inherited that infamous speech
of Enoch Powell, which, thankfully, now seems like a distant memory.
None the less, it is important to reflect on the progress that we have
made since that time, given that there was such awful discrimination in
the 1960s and 1970s and later. We have come a very long way, and the
debate is an opportunity to celebrate both the progress that we have
made in fostering those community relations as well as the fantastic
contribution of the Sikh community.</hs_Para>

carry with them their social values, the teachings of the guru and the
traditions of the past? That is why when they go to other countries,
their contribution to the society is based on the teachings of the

right hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton South East (Mr McFadden)
also made an important contribution. He talked about how the Sikh
community illustrates the benefits of immigration. He made the point
that very often the immigration debate is a negative 

<?notus-xml column=92?>one, and that we should celebrate and recognise the benefits of
immigration, which can be seen in the contribution
of the Sikh
community<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T10:46:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031371000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/halltext/130313h0001.htm#13031371000022">There
is very little time left, but I want to say one or two other things. It
is important to stress the fact that the British Sikh story goes back
more than 200 years, and that there is a long, honourable and close
relationship between the Sikh community and Great Britain, which is
clearly illustrated in the Sikh contribution to our armed
forces. Let me relate a personal story here. My dad served
in the Enniskillens during world war two and was in north Africa and at
Monte Cassino. Serving alongside him in the campaign to defeat fascism
were Sikh soldiers, who served with great valour and distinction in
the terrible battle that saw the loss of so many young
lives<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T10:47:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031371000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/halltext/130313h0001.htm#13031371000023">In
view of the shortness of time, Mr Owen, it is important to say one or
two final words about the contribution of the Sikh community to the
economy, and about the benefits of immigration to the UK. The Sikhs
have made a huge economic contribution to the nation, creating many
jobs and wealth for Great Britain. I also want to mention here cohesion
and integration, which is a topic that I am currently working on. The
Sikh community is a model of cohesion and integration and we could
learn many lessons on the way in which it has conducted itself in the
UK<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T10:48:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031371000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/halltext/130313h0001.htm#13031371000024">In
conclusion, I have a few questions for the Minister. If he cannot deal
with them today in his contribution, perhaps he could write to me
afterwards. Before this debate, I received a briefing note from the
Sikh community relating to a number of issues, one of which was about
celebrating the Sikh contribution to the UK in the school curriculum.
Will the Minister confirm whether that is something that is being
considered? As we move towards the 100th anniversary of the beginning
of world war one, another request related to the contribution of the
Sikh community to that war. It would be appropriate to ensure that the
contribution that Sikhs made in that war was recognised and perhaps the
Minister could confirm, one way or another, whether that will be the
case.</hs_Para>

with it on Government policy relating to a range of issues. I wonder

Members have touched on issues that persist to this day about
employment, whereby Sikhs are still discriminated against and find
problems in the workplace in relation to the turban. As a former
construction worker myself, I know that that is something that has been
addressed on construction sites, but there are still a number of
ongoing cases. I think that one relates to a lorry driver who is in
danger of losing his job, and there have been a number of other
incidents as well. I wonder whether the Minister could say a little
about dealing with those employment rights issues for the Sikh
community.</hs_Para>

issue that I have been told there is concern about in the Sikh
community is in relation to the funding for Sikh organisations. The
feeling is that it is increasingly difficult for voluntary
organisations in the Sikh community to obtain funding for their
activities from the national lottery, other trust funds and so on.
Could the Minister say anything about that issue?</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton South West called Sikhism a
“cool” religion. As he explained, there are good reasons
within Sikhism why individuals are called to serve their local
communities and British society in general, because the faith requires
believers to put others before self and to stand up for the vulnerable.
If someone goes to a gurdwara anywhere in the world, they can get a
free meal. Sikhism recognises the existence of injustices, and it
reminds Sikhs of their individual and corporate responsibilities to
work for a fairer
society<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T10:55:13"></hs_TimeCode>. That is
why Sikhs are often in the forefront of serving their communities.
There is a community centre in Handsworth that is run by Sikhs, which
is a particularly good example of that service.</hs_Para>

are also very much at the heart of inter-faith activity in this
country, because Sikhism teaches the equality of all human beings,
including the total equality of women, and Sikh gurus require their
followers to show respect for different faiths and different ways of
life. That is why we can note with great pleasure and pride the
contribution of Sikhs to bodies such as the Inter Faith Network for the
UK and in initiatives such as the inter-faith week and the Near
Neighbours programme. Sikhs were also very active in 2012’s Year
of Service activities, with a range of project around the theme of
“bringing sweetness”. We also look forward to Sikhs
participating enthusiastically in Together in Service, a new three-year
project that is designed to encourage, celebrate and link up
faith-based volunteering, which will begin later this year.</hs_Para>

previous Government did excellent work 
<?notus-xml column=95?>in this field, but we recognise that there have been problems. As we
have heard, some European countries have all too often required Sikhs
to remove their turbans during airport security screening, which Sikhs
find offensive. Until last month, the European regulations required the
hand-searching of turbans if a wearer caused the metal detector to go

work that can be done to preserve memorials. The Government are making

Heritage, to support the restoration of war memorials. In Dover,
adjacent to my constituency, there was an excellent project called the
Dover war memorial project, in which volunteers, students and children

talk briefly about the Step Short project in my constituency.
Folkestone was a focal point in the war effort, and 10 million
servicemen passed through the town during the first world war. It was
the major port of embarkation to, and debarkation from, the trenches of
the western front. It was home to tens of thousands of refugees from
Belgium and tens of thousands more servicemen from Canada, who were
based at Shorncliffe barracks just outside the town. Most families in
the country will have an ancestor who was in Folkestone at some point
during the war.</hs_Para>

people are recorded in the visitors’ books that were kept by two
sisters who operated a temporary canteen on the harbour arm, from which
they gave free cups of tea and bits of cake to men who boarded the
boats. Lloyd George, Churchill, Haig and private soldiers in the Army
signed the books, which provide a great living memory of those
men’s stories and give us a date, time and place, so that we
know where they were at that point during the war. For some men,
signing those books may have been their last act on English soil, to
which they would never return because they would make the supreme
sacrifice in the trenches.</hs_Para>

first world war, Slope road in Folkestone, which ran from the Leas on
the cliff tops in the town down to the harbour, was renamed the road of
Remembrance, because it was the road down which so many men marched. As
they marched down the steep road with heavy packs on their backs, the
command of “step short” was given, which told them to
break their steps. Marching downhill on the cobbles, wearing boots and
carrying heavy packs must have been quite an exercise even on a dry
day, but the soldiers managed it. Folkestone was the last stage in the
journey that they made to the
trenches.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031341000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/halltext/130313h0001.htm#13031341000028">In

Minister of State, Department for Culture, Media and Sport (Hugh
Robertson):</Member></B> I welcome you the Chair, Mr Owen. I
congratulate my hon. Friend the Member 
<?notus-xml column=101?>for Folkestone and Hythe (Damian Collins) on securing the debate. He is
not quite my constituency neighbour, but he is pretty close to it, and
of course he is a fellow Kent MP. As he spoke, I was reflecting that
many of us are familiar with Folkestone. I suspect that the hon. Member
for Barnsley Central (Dan Jarvis), who speaks for the Opposition, may
have done some training at Shorncliffe camp, as I have. Many of us did
our Northern Ireland training there. I did not know about the link with
the Canadians, but it is good to hear that that is still celebrated in
the way my hon. Friend outlined. I apologise for not being the
Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, my hon. Friend
the Member for Wantage (Mr Vaizey), who would normally respond to such
a debate. He is away at the moment, but I hope that, with my Kent and
military connections, my responding to the debate will not be too much
of a hurdle. I would like to associate myself with the remarks that my
hon. Friend the Member for Folkestone and
Hythe<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T11:12:49"></hs_TimeCode> made, most
appropriately, about Peter Wood.</hs_Para>

running through a prepared speech, I will pick up some of my hon.
Friend’s comments and detail how the Government might support
the efforts he is making. Part of the Government’s approach is
to set out a general strategy around remembrance, youth and education,
and then, in a sense, to encourage a thousand flowers to bloom. The
schemes that have been mentioned in Edinburgh and Folkestone are
perfect examples of what we hope will happen.</hs_Para>

congratulate my hon. Friend on his chairmanship of the Step Short
campaign, which sounds like a fantastic example of what I am talking
about. Those of us who have worn Army boots—especially those
with studs on the bottom, which soldiers would have worn in those
days—will know just how difficult it would have been to march
down a hill, especially with a heavy pack and particularly if it was
raining, as it often does in Kent at certain times of year. It is
fantastic to see that that is being commemorated. I had not really
considered that Folkestone was the major port of embarkation, but that
was very much the case. I encourage my hon. Friend to keep the
Department for Culture, Media and Sport closely informed about the
project and to see what we can do to help him and the town as it
undertakes those commemorations.</hs_Para>

by my hon. Friend’s remarks about school visits. I think that
for many of us who have visited the first world war battlefields,
however much we might know about the military, or conflict, their sheer
size and scale is what is striking. That strikes me every time I go
there. In my regiment three squadrons were wiped out within half an
hour, at a place called Zandvoorde ridge. Many regiments will have had
similar experiences, and the striking scale of what happened makes it
important that later generations should be reminded.

encouragingly, when we were in opposition, I visited a community scheme

initially at Spurs. The area is clearly quite a testing one
educationally, and all the children were working on a project about
that extraordinary man who, as my hon. Friend said, was born in
Folkestone and, having played professional football for Spurs and other
clubs, became the first black officer on the western front. I think
that he was put up for a military cross towards the end of the war. He
is an extraordinary figure, and not the only sporting figure from my

Robertson:</Member></B> The lovely thing about these debates is the
fact that we always learn something new, and that is a wonderful piece
of sporting trivia. The hon. Gentleman has reminded me of something
important, which I thought might be what he was going to say in his
intervention: next year provides us with a unique opportunity north of
the border, because of the Commonwealth games. The Department is
considering how to make use of the presence of many Commonwealth
leaders and athletes in this country to mark the Commonwealth
contribution. My hon. Friend has mentioned that, and I freely admit to
having been a little slow in picking it up early on when it was being
discussed in the Department. We should not be for a moment too
parochial about the anniversary. This country must recognise the
enormous Commonwealth contribution. I was struck, when I went to
Australia just before the Olympics to launch the GREAT
campaign—for a weekend, actually; oh joy—by what a
seminal moment Gallipoli is for Australians. It was the first time that
they came together as a nation to fight for Australia, and Gallipoli is
extraordinarily important to them, as places such as Palestine are for
other countries.</hs_Para>

have talked a little about the Government’s approach. It is

done by the Imperial War museum, and I encourage all hon. Members to
become acquainted with that. As I have said, the idea is to set up an

contribution in every conflict that this country has undertaken, in
pretty much every combat zone where it has ever fought. I think for
most who have memories of the British Army, the earliest ones are of
being shouted at by someone with a Scottish voice. I would expect the

“nearly half” of those leaving prison reoffended. He was
correct—the reoffending rate for those leaving prison is around
47%— but that suggests the overall reoffending rate is double
what it actually is. It would have been more straightforward had he
used the 26.8% figure to justify the

concerns are overwhelmingly about public safety, protecting the
existing good work of the probation service, questioning the suggested
and untested payment-by-results methods that will be introduced to the
private sector, ensuring that management and structure changes are
sensibly modified to suit the proposals and, importantly in this age of
austerity, ensuring that the costs are acceptable. As

division of the work distribution—low and medium-risk to the

on paper but ignores what professionals in the service say happens in
real life. Medium-risk individuals can move dangerously quickly to
being high risk. If the signs are not spotted immediately, high risk
may escalate into dangerous behaviour with harm to individual and
general public safety. That is a reality that experienced probation
officers live with every working hour, and it is a tribute to their
skill and dedication that it does not happen on a wider

would be wiser to introduce the private sector, if it must be
introduced on this scale, to deal initially with the low-risk group
alone. Even if that were seen as weakening the proposals’
profitability for the private sector, it would have the opportunity to
take on the new work load of prisoners serving less than 12-month
sentences. That would create a clear division and stop the overlap,
which will certainly cause a problem. It could also help with the
vagueness of the relationships and objectives of the differing
cultures.</hs_Para>

personnel and haul the offender back to court. On the one hand, we have
a public servant—a professional—who has no monetary
motivation and whose only objectives are public safety and working with
integrity with the person on probation. On the other hand, under the

Longevity should never be unchallenged by those of us who are public

supervision hubs—in the emerging jargon, ROSHs—could be
open to competition every three or five years. Surely, different
organisations will therefore run the hubs every few years and the

Payment by results has not been a feature of the culture or practice of
the Ministry of Justice, and the general feeling was in favour of
pilots if it were to be done; the Secretary of State, however,
cancelled the pilots. The Minister would do everyone a favour if he
indicated why that was so, 
<?notus-xml column=111?>apart from the mystical belief that the Secretary of State
knows best. The introduction of payment by results

set up by the previous Secretary of State to test that out have now

make not so much to the Minister but to the Treasury. It has been
confirmed that the Treasury is looking at costs. I understand that, and
as a member of the Treasury Committee, I hope that that is a good look.
When the Ministry of Justice budget is under severe threat, however,
the Secretary of State is suggesting the pulling in of the 30,000
people who leave prison after small sentences; he is also suggesting
doing that rapidly. That 25% increase in work load will involve a fair
cost, especially as he is talking about individual mentors and so on.
Can the Minister tell us whether that policy has been agreed with the
Chancellor? Is the money available? It will be surprising if it is; it
will also be surprising, because the Treasury has publicly voiced
worries, whether the rest of the business has been tested and costed.

the Member for Leeds East (Mr Mudie) for securing the debate, which is
important because our probation service faces an imminent threat from a
Government intent on cutting budgets at any cost to the

will set out three core reasons why I am so concerned about the
reforms: the cancellation of pilot schemes; the effects of payment by
results; and the removal of probation trusts. To start, I concede that
I am somewhat perplexed by the Government proposals. Our probation
service is staffed by a dedicated army of workers, who do an important
job keeping our community safe. It is vital and unglamorous work, away
from the spotlight of public and media attention. Indeed, as has been
mentioned, in 2011 the probation service deservedly won the British
Quality Foundation’s gold medal for excellence in recognition of
its outstanding and continued commitment to sustained excellence over
several years. That is not to be taken lightly. The probation service
is a proven success story and I simply do not understand why the
Justice Secretary is intent on its
dismemberment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031349000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/halltext/130313h0001.htm#13031349000055">The
previous Government recognised the importance of a secure and properly
funded probation service. Funding rose by 70% in real terms, the number
of 
<?notus-xml column=112?>offenders supervised by the probation service rose by 53%, and there was
a rise in staffing of more than 7,000. During the Labour
Government’s time in office, we proved our commitment to the
probation service and its important work. The present Government are
proposing to undo the hard-earned gains made under the Labour
Government. Cuts to staffing and office closures will be the only way
to achieve the deep cuts, and that will mean fewer probation orders
made and the risk of an increased prison
population.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031349000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/halltext/130313h0001.htm#13031349000056">I
welcome the spread of best practice and the introduction of innovative
ideas, such as bringing in outside expertise, but experience shows that
a headlong rush to privatisation risks breaking up the system
unnecessarily. Whatever the Justice Secretary might believe for reasons
of expediency, a pilot is not some half-baked measure, nor a dirty
word. It is how proper, well thought out, empirically driven policy is
developed. Without it, we have what the Justice Secretary calls
“believing”, and what everyone else calls “a step
into the unknown”. Impervious to criticism from the Treasury,
the National Audit Office and the probation service, he is taking a
risk with a system that deals with vulnerable and sometimes dangerous
offenders, and in doing so is taking a risk with
safety.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031349000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/halltext/130313h0001.htm#13031349000057">Similarly,
payment by results carries risks that the Government seem to be
ignoring. It is primarily dependent on accurate data, which are not
always easy to produce. Furthermore, the data, when available and
correct, are often crude. If the Government believe that offenders
least likely to reoffend and those most likely to reoffend are equals,
private companies will simply focus on those who pose the lowest risk
to people, and ignore the most prolific offenders, to turn a
profit.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031349000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/halltext/130313h0001.htm#13031349000058">The
system of payment by results is likely to lead to fewer, larger
corporations in the hunt for those contracts. Many smaller
organisations, such as charities and local groups—the very
people with the experience and networks to work with offenders most
effectively—will be unable to risk non-payment and will have to
withdraw. That would be a disaster, yet it is already being played out
under the guise of the Government’s Work programme, which for
many people has been a contradiction in terms. One reason for the Work
programme’s failure is that smaller organisations have been
squeezed out by larger firms, citing lack of
viability.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031349000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/halltext/130313h0001.htm#13031349000059">Finally,
I am worried about removal of probation trusts. Northumbria probation
trust is my regional trust and covers my constituency. It was given the
highest performance rating for 2011-12 by the National Offender
Management Service, and was declared to be exceptional. The success of
my local trust should be celebrated and copied; instead, it is being
dismantled. The irony, which is lost on few, is that a Government who
proselytise localism are replacing local trusts with Whitehall
centralisation. These reforms represent yet another false economy from
this Government, and I urge the Minister and the Secretary of State to
think

slightly different perspective. There is no doubt that the probation
service plays an important role in our criminal justice system, and
particularly reoffending. I have already said that we all 
<?notus-xml column=113?>agree that reoffending levels are far too high. I believe the Government
deserve great credit for focusing on reducing reoffending. It is
extraordinary that 58% of criminals who are sentenced to less than one
year in prison are convicted of further offences within 12 months of
their release. That says something about all Governments, whether red,

too high, but the 58% of short-sentence prisoners who reoffend are not

Patel:</Member></B> I do not, because at the end of the day we must
also think about the other side in the criminal justice system:
victims. The point is that all the figures are far too high and not
enough has been done historically to tackle reoffending. Victims are
hit hard and they suffer most from reoffending. They never feel
satisfied if they are hit again and again by serial criminals who
reoffend.</hs_Para>

about not making assumptions, and not dissing the idea that the

doing that. In fact, changes made over the years introduced other
players to work alongside the probation service. My concern is that
there will be a wholesale sloughing off of people with talent and of

talk about how such local organisations are working to good effect in
Northamptonshire and about my concern that that will be disrupted. As
my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds East made clear, our concern is
that payment by results in the criminal justice system is untested. The
Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, the right hon.
Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling), was responsible for the
Work programme, which is, as my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland
Central has said, a contradiction in terms. Will the Minister explain
why the Government are rushing headlong into the changes and ignoring
the pilots, rather than learning from them and developing reforms from
them?</hs_Para>

service does a good job in difficult circumstances and on stretched
budgets, and the Government rated the performance of every probation
trust as good or exceptional in 2011. After the proposed changes,
probation will deal with an extra 60,000 offenders a year. Will there
be additional funding or will the current money be spread even more
thinly, as my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds East suggested? Poorly
resourced support for rehabilitation will not effectively help to
reform offenders, and that poses a serious risk to

probation service is operating in the context of serious budget cuts,
and we have to bear those in mind as we consider the potential
additional costs of the reforms. The budget allocated to probation
trusts was cut from £820 million in 2011-12 to £814
million in 2012-13. That is part of a 23% cut to the Ministry of
Justice over the spending review period. Probation services face
serious cuts, and the total number of staff fell from 19,000 in 2010 to
17,800 in 2012. The Chancellor of the Exchequer confirmed yesterday
that another spending review is looming on the horizon, and we expect
staff numbers to be squeezed further.</hs_Para>

concerned that, as public bodies, trusts will not be allowed to bid on
their own or with partners for commercial contracts for the delivery of
probation services, because they will not be able to bear the financial
risks involved in taking on a payment-by-results contract. The
financial objects of trusts specifically forbid them from taking on
such a financial risk. I have spoken to the Minister about that, and I
look forward to his response. Trusts have worked on the assumption that
they could get around that impediment by setting up arm’s-length
commercial vehicles to take on the financial risks involved, but now I
understand that the National Offender Management
Service has told trusts that that is ultra vires. Will the Minister
clarify whether that is correct? Under right-to-provide legislation,
individual  
<?notus-xml column=116?>staff may bid if they can set up an independent mutual, but such a
mutual would have to compete alongside other
providers. As I understand it, probation trusts may not take the lead
in the development of a mutual. Will the Minister tell me whether that
is correct?</hs_Para>

number of specific questions, on which I will write to the Minister.
However, will probation trusts, as public bodies, be permitted to bid,
either on their own or with partners, for commercial contracts? Can
they set up special-purpose vehicles? Can they set up mutual delivery
organisations? Staff, including those in my constituency, are proud of
their probation service. They want to know what future they have, and
whether they will have opportunities to work around the reforms to
sustain the good work that has been done. If probation staff were to
set up their own mutual delivery organisation to bid for commercial
contracts for the delivery of probation services in the community,
would they have to resign from their employment with the probation
trusts to take part in the competition?</hs_Para>

informed estimates from various commentators, the reforms will result
in the contracting out of about 70% of the work of a local
probation trust. The Ministry of Justice claims that there
will be a role for a surviving public probation service, but will that
not be a tiny outfit of perhaps 3,000 staff—similar to the
Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service, for
example—which will operate as a courts and public protection
service? I am concerned that a rump of 3,000 staff will simply become a
national agency of NOMS, and the probation service as we
know it will
disappear.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031349000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/halltext/130313h0002.htm#13031349000087">Finally,
I want to touch on the success story in Northamptonshire. The Minister
will be aware of the high performance of Northamptonshire. I do not
want to dispute the claims that my hon. Friend the Member for
Sunderland Central has made about the performance of her probation
trust, so let us just say that they are both excellent. The
Northamptonshire probation trust is small, and it provides offender
management services for the benefit of people across Northamptonshire.
It excels against the Ministry of Justice performance targets, and the
county has one of the lowest reoffending rates in the
country.</hs_Para>

certain features that are worth highlighting. The staff work very
effectively in partnership with other local organisations. For example,
operational probation and police staff work closely in the
Northamptonshire integrated offender management team to monitor the
most prolific offenders and to intervene where necessary. The
trust’s strong working relationship with the police is reflected
in the multi-agency public protection arrangements, and issues relating
to the most serious offenders are well managed in Northamptonshire.
There is strong strategic partnership working with the local
authorities, with health providers and in areas such as housing and
education. The offender management approach in Northamptonshire, which
is working by reducing reoffending, is about really strong local
partnership working, and that points the way to the approach for the
future. The hon. Member for Witham mentioned reform, which we all agree
is needed, and I believe we need to build on the incredible, strong
local success story in
Northamptonshire.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031349000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/halltext/130313h0002.htm#13031349000089">My

points out that although the Justice Secretary is looking for
improvements in the reoffending rate, such improvements are
already being achieved by the probation service. According to the
Ministry’s figures, performance in relation to offenders under
statutory supervision has improved year on year over the past decade.
The data show that adult proven reoffending was 3.1 percentage points
lower in 2010 than in 2000; 66% of offenders subject to statutory
supervision by the probation service do not go on to reoffend. Those
include a range of offenders with a mixture of complex and demanding
needs who are assessed as being at low, medium or high risk of both
harm and reoffending. Conversely, according to National Audit Office
figures, 60% of offenders who are not subject to statutory supervision
by the probation service—those who receive a prison sentence of
less than 12 months—go on to
reoffend<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T15:21:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031349000093" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/halltext/130313h0002.htm#13031349000093">A
key concern of the South Yorkshire probation trust about the new
proposals is the proposal to split responsibility for offenders between
public and private providers, depending on the level of risk. Its
concern is that that could introduce a dangerous, artificial divide,
which would fail to take account of how risk levels fluctuate. It sees
the management of medium-risk cases in particular as a
“fundamental threat” and points out that there seems to
be a belief that medium-risk cases are assessed as such on the basis of
the seriousness of the current offence. However, that is not always the
case. Medium-risk offenders have already caused, or are assessed as
having the potential to cause, “serious harm”. They can
include those on life sentences, individuals who have a history of
domestic abuse, members of gangs, and individuals who pose a risk to
children.</hs_Para>

organisation might not be equipped to recognise that. Even if they did,
they would then presumably need to arrange a hurried transfer back into
the public sector. That would clearly be nonsense, and a bureaucratic
nightmare.</hs_Para>

probation trust also considers that the proposals show a failure to
understand the complexities of accountability in the criminal justice
system. If a judge or magistrate has concerns about the supervision of
a contracted-out court order, with one or more organisations involved,
whom should they ask to appear before them? Information sharing,
particularly with the police, will become complicated and relevant
information in relation to risk issues will be lost. Only a qualified
probation officer should be the offender manager of medium-risk cases:
that is how the trust operates, and it believes it is a reason for its
high performance. I would underline the importance of learning from
high performance to reduce reoffending.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T15:24:47"></hs_TimeCode> model that
the trust believes fully supports the Government’s plans to
bring other sectors together is based on the approach of the offender
manager and offender supervisor relationship; it builds on current
successful practice in working with many agencies from the public,

difficult and dangerous offenders in the

the Member for Scunthorpe (Nic Dakin), who is no longer in his place,
talked about the importance of local anchorage. The proposals for a
reduced number of trusts would make it more difficult for the probation
service to retain local links and a local profile, and what my hon.
Friend called anchorage. Those changes to structures, coming at the
same time as changes to who provides services, and how they provide
them, will be such an upheaval that it will put the success of the
Government’s scheme at significant additional risk. I ask the
Minister to listen not only to all my hon. Friends but to the
professionals in the field; to take account of the responses to the
consultation; and not to rush through changes that would increase the
risks to public
safety.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13031349000286" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/halltext/130313h0002.htm#13031349000286">3.25

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T15:26:07"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Leeds East (Mr Mudie) and thank him for the opportunity
to speak on a subject about which I care deeply. I have cared about it
for many years, having served as a magistrate from 1993 to 2009, when I
got to know probation officers closely. I am concerned that the
Government’s proposals are based on no evidence that 
<?notus-xml column=119?>a payment-by-results model will work in the context.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T15:26:40"></hs_TimeCode>By contrast,
Greater Manchester probation trust, which supervises offenders in my
constituency, has a good track record. Other hon. Members have also
spoken about the successes of their probation trusts this afternoon.
The Justice Secretary himself has, indeed, recognised Greater
Manchester’s innovativeness, and has said he wants to consider
the lessons learned there. I hope that that is sincere.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13031349000100" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/halltext/130313h0002.htm#13031349000100"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T15:27:02"></hs_TimeCode>As
others have pointed out, we need first to be clear about who is
currently supervised by probation, and about the fact that we cannot
assess the service’s performance in relation to offenders whose
supervision was never in its remit. The probation service does not
supervise those who leave custody after receiving sentences of less
than 12 months. That group of offenders has been missed by public
policy to date. The Government are right about that, and I welcome
their intention to introduce new supervision for that group. However,
the Minister will be interested to know that Greater Manchester
probation trust has already experimented with a programme to look after
that group of offenders. The Choose Change programme, a
through-the-gate initiative for those serving shorter custodial
sentences, offered support and supervision before and after
release.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13031349000101" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/halltext/130313h0002.htm#13031349000101">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T15:28:07"></hs_TimeCode>
evaluation of Choose Change shows the scale of the challenge in dealing
with prisoners who have had short custodial sentences, on release. They
were people with long histories of offending behaviour, and often
chaotic lives. It is clear to me that one reason why Choose Change was
less successful than we all hoped was that it was necessary to
intervene much earlier in those offenders’ lives. For those with
10 or 15-year histories of offending behaviour it was far too late to
start looking at through-the-gate solutions. However, we should also
recognise that Choose Change offered support to an extent that was both
intensive and costly. It is not clear to me that such intensive
through-the-gate supervision can be made attractive to the private
sector. In the absence of any wide-scale national provision against
which to measure it—that group of offenders has not been
supervised on a national scale to date—I am curious about how
the Minister intends to specify the provision, and about the sort of
pricing model that he envisages, to make it viable for commercial
providers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031349000102" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/halltext/130313h0002.htm#13031349000102">Secondly,
Greater Manchester probation trust has led the way in important
initiatives such as intensive alternatives to custody and integrated
offender management. Crucial to those programmes and, indeed, to Choose
Change, as other hon. Members have said, has been effective
inter-agency working, founded on long-standing close relationships. I
visited the Spotlight team at Stretford police station, shortly after I
became a Member of Parliament, where police, probation, the local
authorities, social services and so on are co-located. Workers are very
effective and are a well targeted, integrated team that
spotlights—as the name says—follows, tracks and
intervenes constantly on offenders who are either living during or
post-sentence in the community. It is absolutely vital that the success
of that programme, which is founded on those inter-agency
relationships, is protected. I know already that Greater Manchester
police are expressing concern that those relationships could be
disturbed by the roll-out of the Government’s proposals.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T15:30:24"></hs_TimeCode>I would be
grateful if the Minister could say how he 
<?notus-xml column=120?>envisages those inter-agency relationships being sustained and protected
when new private providers appear on the scene.</hs_Para>

we would all rightly acknowledge the importance of employment in
preventing reoffending; it is well understood to be crucial in keeping
offenders out of trouble in future. I very much welcomed the
Government’s decision to introduce “day one” entry
to the Work programme for those leaving custody, but we have to
acknowledge that the Work programme has not, so far at least, been a
roaring success.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13031349000104" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/halltext/130313h0002.htm#13031349000104">By<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T15:31:47"></hs_TimeCode>
contrast, the Achieve programme, developed by the Greater Manchester
probation trust, has proven very successful both with those on
community sentences, who make up 70% of the Achieve caseload, and with
those leaving custody, who make up the other 30%. Achieve is a
programme that works with partners such as Procure Plus, which is a
social enterprise based in my constituency, to offer real work and real
wages to offenders. It has been very successful in getting offenders
into sustained employment. Some 13.5% of those going through the
Achieve programme have remained in employment. As I think the Minister
would agree, that is a much better result than we have seen from the
Work programme, and we want to build on that.
As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T15:31:57"></hs_TimeCode> my hon.

Secretary of State for Justice has talked of probation staff forming
co-operatives or social enterprises, and, as my hon. Friend said,
probation trusts—including Greater Manchester probation
trust—have been anticipating, over the past 12 months or so, the
need and opportunity to create separate non-public sector provider
organisations, but with the probation element integral to their
success. It seems now as though probation services, such as GMPT, that
have created those models will not be able to use them to bid for
contracts, and we really need to understand from the Minister whether
that is right, and if so, why on earth is it right?
There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T15:33:14"></hs_TimeCode> is a
situation of total confusion out there now. We do not know whether it
is considered anti-competitive for those bodies to bid, or whether them
bidding is considered ultra vires, as my hon. Friend mentioned. We do
not understand why the Justice Secretary seemed to be so positive about
it but now seems to be rowing back. I would be really grateful if the
Minister—I am glad that he is shaking his head—could put
it on the record clearly this afternoon that they will have the
opportunity to bid.</hs_Para>

the Minister will not be in the least bit surprised that I want to
raise concerns about programmes for women in the contracted-out model,

in the context of the criminal justice system. I welcome the

Justice<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T15:38:24"></hs_TimeCode>, the
hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Mrs Grant), as champion for
women in the criminal justice system. I very much regret that this
afternoon, we see the Government rejecting the amendment that was
passed in the House of Lords to the Crime and Courts Bill, proposing
that there is a champion for women at the heart of the criminal justice
system. I am very pleased that the Select Committee on Justice is
conducting an inquiry into women in the criminal
justice  
<?notus-xml column=121?>system, and I encourage the Committee to look at how payment by results

Greater Manchester, we have developed the Women MATTA programme, which
is a partnership between the Pankhurst centre and Women in Prison. It
offers holistic support for women offenders or those at risk of
offending, and it has been able, by wrapping holistic support around
those women, to deliver substantial savings to the public purse. Again,
it is founded on a network of carefully developed relationships between
different non-governmental organisations, but it is very hard to see
that that voluntary approach would fit easily into the
payment-by-results model, and
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T15:34:59"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T15:39:34"></hs_TimeCode>

problems are that the number of women in the criminal justice system is
relatively small, as everyone knows; their needs are high and often
very complex; they are often mothers, so there are extra dimensions to
the support that is needed, because children are involved; and they
have often also been victims of crime and abuse over a very long period
of time. We can already see services to support women offenders and
women’s centres being squeezed. Ring-fenced funding that had
been provided by the Ministry of Justice is now being spread more
thinly across more women’s programmes.</hs_Para>

conclusion I draw is that it could be very costly for private providers
to develop the kind of dedicated programmes that are necessary to meet
the special needs of women. There is a real concern, therefore, that
they will not do so and instead, we will see women shoehorned into the
standard offer. I am sorry to draw yet again on the analogy of the Work
programme, but that is exactly what is happening there, where we can
see particularly poor outcomes for lone parents, because again, their
special needs as women and mothers are simply not being regarded in
that programme.</hs_Para>

am really grateful for the opportunity to raise those concerns at this
early stage, as Ministers are considering how they intend to roll out
the model. My concerns are very real, in terms of holding on to the
good practice that we have. Nobody in Greater Manchester probation
trust is against competition, or against the appropriate involvement of
the private and third sectors, but I know that the Minister will not
want to choke off successful initiatives and programmes that already
exist. I am very concerned that top-down, large-scale, nationally let
contracts will prove especially problematic, in relation to the very
effective local programmes that have been developed. The voluntary
sector will be squeezed out, as has happened again in the Work
programme, and the outcomes will be poorer as a result.</hs_Para>

within weeks, I think, of his taking office. I would like to know why
that happened. Why did the Government not believe it necessary to
collect objective information and then plan properly their response in
relation to the work that still needs to be done on reoffending issues?
He seems to have based his thinking on his experience as a Minister of
State in the Department for Work and
Pensions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T15:40:25"></hs_TimeCode> and
what has been experienced so far in the Work programme. That is seen as
the model, but it is worth pointing out that only 3.5% of people on the
Work programme are in work after six months. When that goes wrong, it
is bad for the people who are unemployed, but it is extremely worrying
when potentially dangerous offenders may go without proper support and

would like to ask five questions in particular. They are in part an
elaboration on what has already been stated. First, it is a very real
problem if there is a division of responsibility between the private
and public sectors. We must acknowledge that the risks can change, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T15:42:15"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Sheffield Central said. Prisoners are not the same
individuals always; the risks can change. That is a genuine concern,
but the Government’s proposals will lead to a lack of
co-ordination between the private and public sectors. There is an
inherent incoherence, therefore, in the Government’s
proposals.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031349000120" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/halltext/130313h0002.htm#13031349000120">My
second concern is about resources. To be fair, I think that it is good
that resources will be allocated for those on sentences of under 12
months. It is good that they are being catered for—let us be
clear about that—but where is the extra money coming from? We
are talking about cuts in the public sector generally and in this area
in particular, so where are the extra resources for this important work
to come
from<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T15:43:05"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031349000121" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/halltext/130313h0002.htm#13031349000121">Thirdly,
what we have in the Government’s consultation document is a
highly centralised approach. It is very much being driven and will be
driven from Whitehall, and it does not recognise the important
co-operation and networking that exists at grass-roots level, at local
level, among the private sector, the public sector and, indeed, the
voluntary sector. Moreover, this is happening at a time when probation
trusts in England and Wales are being reduced in number. There is bound
to be—it is inevitable—tremendous turmoil. To introduce
these changes at the same time as that fundamental change in the
structure of trusts is very worrying
indeed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T15:43:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031349000122" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/halltext/130313h0002.htm#13031349000122">Fourthly,
a very big question to be answered is how success will be measured. It
has been suggested by some—I think by some of the
Government’s own Back Benchers—that full payment will be
given to private companies only if individuals commit no more crimes
within a given period. Is that the case? Will the Minister confirm that
or state the position otherwise? That would be welcome because mixed
messages are coming from the Government on that point, which is central
to their proposals. We want coherent answers, at least, to be provided,
so that everyone knows where they stand. The Government must do
something to address the very real risk that the private sector will
cherry-pick; it will seek to work with the offenders who are easiest to
rehabilitate, not the
rest.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031349000123" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/halltext/130313h0002.htm#13031349000123">My
final question is about the
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T15:45:06"></hs_TimeCode>sharing of
information, which is central to tackling reoffending. At the moment,
the police and the probation service share information. Generally, they
do that very well indeed. What will happen when the private sector has
a large stake in the system? Will the police and G4S, for example,
share information on the same basis? If the answer is yes, certain
implications stem from that and they need to be addressed by the
Government<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T15:45:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031349000124" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/halltext/130313h0002.htm#13031349000124">In
essence, the consultation document that the Government have produced is
not sound. It is essentially based on dogma. It is motivated by
abstraction rather than hard facts. I very much hope that, even at this
late stage, the Government will listen not only to what has been said
in the debate but, more importantly, to what

are too high and that we need to bring them down. That has been a
common theme in the debate. The truth is that despite significant extra
investment, of the order of 70% over the past 10 years, reoffending
rates have not come down by as much as they should have. I think that
it was the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T15:47:41"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Member for Sheffield Central (Paul Blomfield) who said that the rate of
reduction in reoffending—we are talking now not about short

that. I think that people in the probation service accept that,

a set geographical area. The crucial question, which was raised a
number of times is, how do we pay for those extra offenders? It is a
fair question, so I shall start there.</hs_Para>

funding necessary to do what we are discussing will be released quickly
enough in this case. The best way to do it is to engage in exactly the

believe, ideological at all. It is very practical. It is about paying
for what works and investing taxpayers’ money in it. After all,
taxpayers expect us to invest their money wisely in effective outcomes.
In this case, the outcome is simple: the reduction of reoffending. That
is what we are after. It means fewer victims, less misery for
communities and lower costs to the taxpayer.</hs_Para>

wait for the Work programme to demonstrate its successes before using
it as a helpful model to run ahead with this programme. Some Work

employment as a key way out of offending behaviour, are those providers
likely to be paid twice, once as an offender’s Work programme

whether people have reoffended. I shall come back to some of the
difficulties with metrics, which were mentioned, in a moment. The Work
programme is different in that providers are rewarded for getting
people back into work. On the hon. Lady’s first point, I must
say that if we should wait two years to find out whether the Work

probation officers—they will retain responsibility for the
management of risk of serious harm for all offenders, not just the
highest risk ones—have the opportunity to do that job, which
involves the transfer of information and good relationships between
those engaged in what I might describe as the life management part of

vital to extend that intervention and support to them and that we find
the money to pay for that. That brings us to payment by results, which
is a sensible concept. It is a common-sense principle to pay for
outcomes that work in driving down reoffending, which are highly
valuable because they mean fewer victims of crime, less misery for
communities and lower cost to the

inquiry, we need to think through the objective of that inquiry and
what it is that we would learn that we do not already know. Given the
exhaustive nature of the police investigation, and without doing some
further thinking, I am not clear whether the answer to that question is
that we would learn something from having a public

is a long-standing problem. I have campaigned on it three times under
two different Governments. We in Newark do not have secondary schools
that are fit for our children. It is the most important subject in my
constituency. Although siren voices in the town talk about other
subjects, this is 100% my first priority and will remain so until the
problem is
solved.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031349000223" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/halltext/130313h0002.htm#13031349000223">The
difficulty is that although the fabric of the schools leaves a great
deal to be desired—I will expand on that in a moment—the
schools themselves are absolutely first class in the product that they
turn out. The children are well-taught; leadership is exemplary; and
the boards of governors are first class. It is desperately important
that we build confidence in schools such as the Newark academy, which
only recently became an academy, and the Magnus school, rather than
simply criticising them, given that the criticism rests on the fabric
of the school, not on the product being delivered.</hs_Para>

I undermine confidence in those schools and ensure by the words that I
speak in this debate that parents do not send children to them, I will
exacerbate the problem of the so-called Lincolnshire drift. I am trying
not to get excited about it, but it is terribly difficult when children
from Newark seek to have their secondary schooling in Lincolnshire or
at schools such as Toot Hill in Bingham or the Tuxford academy rather
than in their home town. The fewer children go to our schools, the less
money those schools will attract and the more their fortunes will
decline.</hs_Para>

instance, under the Building Schools for the Future programme, for
which I hold no brief and I know he holds none, it was proposed that
the Grove, as it was called at the time, would become a sample school.
I humbly suggest to him that we might be able to resurrect that plan. I

considered it. I ask him, with respect, to address the matter as

me to the fact that last summer, more than £2 million was spent
on the academy. As we have heard, it was spent just patching it up.
Yes, it is fit for purpose; yes, children can learn there adequately;
but by golly, it is sensitive and difficult. For instance, I have
recently been told that if more than 2.5 inches of snow falls, kids
cannot be taught in the flat-roofed areas of the academy in case the
roofs collapse. As a result, the school’s heating is
concentrated in those areas to melt the snow. They may as well have a
snow sentry standing outside with a ruler saying, “Ay up!
We’re approaching two and a half—everybody out.”
We cannot continue to lose teaching days at the school. It simply does
not answer in the 21st
century.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031349000231" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/halltext/130313h0002.htm#13031349000231">I

that the Magnus school cannot be rebuilt—I love it, but that is
not going to happen—but I cannot pass on without mentioning it,
any more than I can without mentioning Toot Hill school in Bingham,
which is not in Lincolnshire but which leaches students away from the
academy and the Magnus school, despite being in barely better condition
than the academy, from which it tends to take a large number of

hon. Friend the Member for Newark (Patrick Mercer) on securing this
extremely important debate. He has been and clearly continues to be a

raised a number of important issues today for his constituents and I

mentioning the Gladstone link that I should have known about but was

am grateful for the opportunity to address some of these important
issues. It is clearly not right for pupils and teachers to work in
buildings in such poor condition that learning is disrupted and staff
time is diverted from the necessary focus on teaching. Even if those
two things are not happening, having high-quality school buildings
sends out an important signal to young people and to those who teach in
schools about the importance that we place on education. It can also
help to raise the aspirations of many young people, in particular those
from more disadvantaged backgrounds, if they are educated in
appropriate settings. The Government regard this area as extremely
important<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T17:11:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031349000238" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/halltext/130313h0002.htm#13031349000238">The
coalition Government, as my hon. Friend hinted in his opening comments,
had no alternative on coming to power but to bring to an end the
previous Government’s wasteful, delayed and ultimately
unaffordable Building Schools for the Future programme which,
remarkably, did not prioritise those schools in the worst condition.
That was not the central criterion to allocate funding under the
programme. The Priority School Building programme that we have
introduced will replace those schools in the worst condition; it will
replace the 261 schools 
<?notus-xml column=141?>assessed to be the greatest priority on the basis of condition. In the
majority of cases, those were not even in the previous
Government’s Building Schools for the Future programme, which
shows the stark gap between the previous plans and the priorities in
many areas. In difficult economic times, we have to focus the limited
resources that we have where they are most needed—on the repair
and refurbishment of schools in the worst condition—and to
tackle the urgent demand for new good school places as a result of the
rising birth rate in large parts of the

May 2010, the Government have allocated  £4 billion for
the maintenance of the school estate to meet the needs of maintained
schools and academies, and more than £5 billion to local
authorities to support the provision of new school places. On 1 March,
my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced an additional
£4 billion for the period from 2012-13 to the end of the
Parliament. Over the Parliament as a whole, therefore, my hon. Friend
can be pleased that the Government that we both support will have
allocated some £18 billion for school capital investment,

invited bids to the new Priority School Building programme from schools
in need of urgent repair. We considered every application on a fair and

sixty-one schools throughout the country, therefore, will be rebuilt,
or in some cases have their condition needs met substantively through
the programme. As my hon. Friend is probably aware, 15 of those schools
are in Nottinghamshire, including the Newark academy in his

Priority School Building programme is being delivered by grouping
schools together into batches to ensure healthy competition for the
work which will deliver value for money for the public purse. We expect
to deliver the school works for considerable savings on the previous
Building Schools for the Future programme. We will continue to
investigate every option to accelerate the entire programme, but as far
as possible the needs of the schools in the worst condition will be
dealt with first. We are making good progress on the delivery of the
programme. We have appointed contractors to build the first two groups
of capital-funded schools, and construction work is expected to start
in May. Contractors are currently tendering for the remaining six
groups of capital-funded schools. Obviously, the first two groups
consist of the schools that we consider to be the highest priority out

the condition of the current school buildings at the Newark academy

schools are in the programme precisely because they have urgent
expected need—that is how we made the judgment on which schools
we wanted to take and put into priority need. They are schools that
otherwise we would have had to spend a huge amount on just refurbishing
buildings that would eventually have to be replaced. I must also thank
Nottinghamshire county council for continuing its support for the
academy by allocating funds from its capital refurbishment programme to
tackle the most urgent repairs at the site. Furthermore, I believe that
we have committed some £170,000 through an environmental
improvement grant to help fund some aspects of the works. I will ask
officials to work with the school and the local authority on
identifying sensible solutions to bridge the gap between now and the
date when we are able to complete the

condition needs, and quite a number of schools that bid to be in the

prioritised way. Our current information about the schools in his area
suggests that other schools are higher on the priority list. Senior
people from the Education Funding Agency have been looking closely at
the matter in recent months, and have already carried out some
scrutiny, but unless we can change our assessment of the
school’s needs compared with those of other schools, and
accommodate some change in the batching arrangement—it is
incredibly important to take them  to market in batches, as he
will understand—all we can do is move as rapidly as possible to
put in place the plans that we are discussing. I assure him that I will
do everything I can to move the whole programme forward—it was
always a five-year programme—as early as possible. We want all

close look to see whether we can do anything, but that will have to be
based on careful evidence because it would be inevitable that if one

potential for future economic growth. I am confident that this
increased co-operation and partnership with the countries of Latin

Benyon:</Member></B> In some circumstances smoke from bonfires can
constitute a statutory nuisance under the Environmental Protection Act
1990. That legislation gives local authorities the powers to deal with
statutory nuisances. Local authorities take into account a number of
case-specific factors when assessing statutory nuisance complaints,
including the reasonableness of the activity being carried out, the
time of day of the occurrence, its duration and its frequency of
occurrence. The local authority is best placed to assess and react to
individual and local circumstances, and to determine how it will
enforce the legislation and ensure that the local community does not
suffer from nuisance bonfires.</hs_Para>

carry out a range of duties, including ante- and post mortem checks

the House of Commons on casual contracts, where they are contracted to
work for an unspecified number of hours a week. This represents some
8.8% of the total work force. They work in a wide range of roles
including in catering and as visitor assistants. As far as possible,
hours to be worked—which vary considerably—are decided in
advance on the basis of mutual agreement. These staff are in receipt of
many of the same benefits as other members of House staff, such as 28
days annual leave a year (accrued based on each hour that they work)
and sick absence pay. They are also entitled to join the House of
Commons pension scheme from their first day and are automatically
enrolled into if they are contracted for a year or

number of pupils studying science and mathematics subjects at A level
and at university and we are taking action to support this. We are
funding the Further Mathematics Support Programme (FMSP) to encourage
more students to study Further Mathematics A level, the Cambridge
University mathematics project to improve the teaching of mathematics
at A level and 16-19 Maths Free Schools to provide a more challenging
curriculum for mathematics. The Government also funds the Stimulating
Physics Programme which supports schools to improve progression into
physics at A level. These programmes help prepare students for STEM

Government believes that prior to May 2010 millions of pounds of
taxpayer's money was wasted by under occupying freehold space within
London (and indeed beyond) while at the same time Departments were
taking out expensive leases on vanity properties. The current spending
controls on Government property, including the moratorium on lease
breaks and expiries, will result in a reduction in both the cost and
size of the estate. As at end March 2012, the moratorium has resulted
in a gross reduction in estate costs of over £312 million since
May 2010 and is on track to deliver a further £125
million by the end of the financial year
2012-13.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031380000361" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/text/130313w0002.htm#13031380000361">The

the recording of information on whether or not the offence was
committed while the offender was on bail is known to be incomplete.
This is because the police have available to them a number of ways of
recording the bail status of an offender of which the ‘offence
committed on bail’ field on the PNC is one. For operational
purposes police forces make differing use of these various sources and
as a result figures derived purely from the PNC do not provide a
complete picture of these offences, and therefore changes over

initially provide as many hours as a person wants can provide valuable
skills and experience and be a stepping stone to more hours when their
employer is able to offer them, or by using the experience gained to
move to a different job.</hs_Para>

Webb:</Member></B> As my answer on 12 February 2013, <I>Official
Report</I>, column 643W, sets out, pensioner well-being is a priority
for the Government. The triple lock ensures that the basic state
pension will go up by the highest of earnings, prices or 2.5% and we
have protected key benefits for older people including free eye tests,
free prescription charges, free off-peak bus travel, free television
licences for those aged over 75 and winter fuel

material deprivation indicator provides valuable insights into older
people's experience of poverty, arising for example from social
isolation and ill health. It complements the income measure and
underlines the need to enable people to have opportunities to work,
save and provide for themselves and their families up to and beyond
retirement. That is why the Coalition is 
<?notus-xml column=276?>reforming the welfare system to improve work and saving incentives, and
provide more effective support to those out of work. It is also why we
abolished the default retirement age, meaning most people can now
retire when the time is right for them, enabling people to work and
save for longer. Our plans for the single-tier pension, and for
automatic enrolment into workplace pensions, will provide clarity and
confidence to better support saving for retirement and make the default
decision a decision to
save.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13031380002747" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130313/text/130313w0003.htm#13031380002747">The
indicator also demonstrates the need to tackle non-financial issues
which strongly affect people's experience of poverty and deprivation.
For older people, many of these relate to isolation, and state of
health. I most recently discussed this at the 6 March 2013 meeting of
the UK Advisory Forum on Ageing, focusing on how Government and others
can work together to learn more about the issues at local level, and
what needs to be done to tackle them. Government and others are already
working together in this respect in the context of the Age Action
Alliance, an independent network of organisations focused on practical
means to improve older people's lives whose membership has just reached
315—a testimony to its value not only to central and local
Government, but also to commercial providers, delivery organisations,
