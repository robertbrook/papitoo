already achieved in terms of amending the arms embargo. We asked
specifically for it to be changed so that we could give technical
support to the opposition. We have achieved that, but the French
President and I discussed at the European Council looking for further
changes to the arms embargo, which will be discussed by Foreign Affairs
Ministers this weekend. The reason for that is twofold. First, that the
arms embargo still applies pretty much equally to this hateful regime
and to the opposition, who we now recognise as legitimate
representatives of the Syrian people, sends a peculiar message.
Secondly, the French President and I are concerned that we should not
be restricted for months and months ahead when we do not know exactly
what could happen in Syria—there are very worrying reports of
the use of chemical
weapons<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T12:08:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032055000123" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/debtext/130320-0001.htm#13032055000123"><B><Member ContinuationText="Edward Miliband" PimsId="4818" UID="13032055000879" xid="831" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/debtext/130320-0001.htm#13032055000879">Edward

but the Prime Minister will know that there is not only a lack of unity
among Syrian opposition groups, but the known presence on the

there was a slight similarity between some of the arguments being made
about not putting more weapons into Syria and the discussions we had on

available a discretionary fund that is there for the hard cases, but we
are also recognising that there is a basic issue of cost—about
£23 billion is spent on housing benefit every year—and a
basic issue of fairness, not just between the private sector and the

base; to let a bloated welfare system pick up the human casualties and

revised down its forecast for global economic growth, and has sharply
revised down its forecast for world trade. Growth in the United States
and Japan was flat in the last quarter, while the eurozone shrank by
0.6%. That was the largest fall since the height of the financial
crisis. The problems in Cyprus this week are further evidence that the
crisis is not over, and the situation remains very worrying. I can

sharply revised down its future growth forecast for the eurozone, and
expects it to remain in recession throughout this year. In its words,
“the underlying situation” in the eurozone
“remains very fragile”. I will be straight with the
country: another bout of economic storms in the eurozone would hit
Britain’s economic fortunes hard. Forty per cent. of all we
export, we export to the eurozone. There is a huge effort across the
Government to grow Britain’s trade with the fast-growing parts
of the world, and exports to Brazil, India and China are up by almost
two thirds. United Kingdom firms now export more goods to non-European
Union countries than to EU countries. This is the first time that that
has happened in over two decades. However, we are still very exposed to
what happens on the continent. Indeed, last year domestic demand was
actually stronger than forecast, but it is the weakness of net trade
that helps to account for much of the weakness in GDP. As the OBR makes
clear,</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13032055000733" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/debtext/130320-0001.htm#13032055000733">“the

for last year has turned out to be a little higher than the OBR
forecast in December, but this year its output forecast is reduced to
0.6% growth. Despite the recession in the eurozone, the OBR’s
central forecast today is that we will avoid a second quarter of
negative growth here in the UK. While it is less than we would like,
our growth this year and next year is forecast by the International
Monetary Fund to be higher than that of France and Germany. That is a

companies that for every one job lost in the public sector in the last
year, six jobs have been created in the private sector; the employment
rate has been growing faster than in the US and three times as fast as

revised up further its forecasts for employment. Compared with this

there will be 60,000 fewer people claiming unemployment benefit. We

Osborne:</Member></B> As I was saying, the facts show the opposite to
be true. The previous Government borrowed £159 billion in their
last year in office and this year this Government are forecast to
borrow £114 billion. So that is not more borrowing—it is
£45 billion a year less borrowing. Borrowing then falls from
£108 billion next year, and falls again to £97 billion in
2014-15 and to £87 billion in the last year of this
Parliament, before falling again to £61 billion and £42
billion in the following two years. To ensure complete transparency,
the OBR publishes the numbers without the asset purchase facility cash
transfers. They show that on that measure, too, borrowing is just
forecast to
fall.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032055000201" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/debtext/130320-0001.htm#13032055000201">We
committed at the start of this Parliament to a fiscal mandate that said
we would aim to balance the cyclically adjusted current budget over the
following rolling five years. I can confirm that the OBR says we are on
course to meet our fiscal mandate—and meet it 
<?notus-xml column=934?>one year early. However, the likelihood of meeting the supplementary
debt target has deteriorated. Public sector net debt is forecast to be
75.9% of GDP this year, 79.2% next year, 82.6% the year
after, 85.1% in 2015-16 and 85.6% in the year after, before falling to

response, there are those who would want to cut much more than we are
planning to and chase the debt target. I said in December that I
thought that with the current weak economic conditions across Europe
that would be a mistake. We have got a plan to cut our structural
deficit. Our country’s credibility comes from delivering that
plan, not altering it with every forecast—and that is why
interest rates remain so low. Our judgment has since been supported by
the International Monetary Fund, the OECD and the Governor of the Bank
of England, and I do not propose to change that judgment three months

borrow less is to borrow more. They would return us to the double-digit
deficits of the last Government and give us far and away one of the
highest deficits in the western world. That would pose a huge risk to
the stability of the British economy, threaten a sharp rise in interest
rates and leave the burden of debts to our children and our
grandchildren. I will not take that gamble with the future of this
country, especially when those representations came from the very same

Welfare reforms have been legislated for and are taking place, and here
is a clear sign of progress: the proportion of national income spent by
the state has fallen from 47.4%. three years ago to 43.6% today; and it
is on course to reach 40.5% at the end of the period. We have set out
the deficit plan, and we are delivering that plan. Taken together, the
measures that I will announce today are fiscally neutral overall. Ask
the British people and they will tell you: our problem as a country is
not that we are taxed too little, but that the Government spend too
much. I agree with
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T12:46:26"></hs_TimeCode>. So the tax

is the central plank of our economic plan that a tough and credible
fiscal policy creates the space for an active monetary policy.
Recovering from the financial crisis has exposed the shortcomings of
conventional monetary tools. We in Britain have had to innovate and
develop new tools; so have other countries. I confirm today that the
asset purchase facility will remain in place for the coming year. We
are now actively considering with the Bank of England whether there are
potential extensions to the successful funding for lending scheme that
will boost lending still further. We are also setting out our plans for
lending from our new business bank, but I want to make sure that an
active monetary policy plays a full role in supporting the economy, so
I am today setting out an updated remit for the Monetary Policy
Committee. Alongside it, we are publishing a review of the monetary
policy

confirms the primacy of price stability and the inflation target in
Britain’s monetary policy framework. The updated remit reaffirms
the inflation target as 2% as measured by the 12-month increase in the
consumer prices index. The target will apply at all times, but as we
have seen over the last five years, low and stable inflation is a
necessary but not sufficient condition for prosperity. The new remit
explicitly tasks the MPC with setting out clearly the trade-offs that
it has made in deciding how long it will be before inflation returns to
target. To ensure a fuller communication between the Bank and the
Treasury, I am changing the timing of the open letter system, so that
when inflation is above target the Governor will write to me on the day
the minutes of the next MPC meeting are published to allow for a more
substantive exchange of

new remit also recognises that the Monetary Policy Committee may need
to use unconventional monetary instruments to support the economy while
keeping inflation stable, and it makes it clear that the committee may
wish to issue explicit forward guidance, including using intermediate
thresholds in order to influence expectations on the future path of
interest rates. For example, that is what the US Federal Reserve has
now done, making a commitment to keep interest rates low while
unemployment is high, provided that inflation is not expected to rise
too much. This can help the economy because it gives families planning
their futures, and businesses wondering whether to invest, more
confidence that interest rates will stay lower for longer. So I am
asking the Monetary Policy Committee to provide an assessment of how
intermediate thresholds might work in Britain, and to give that
assessment in its August 2013 inflation report. That report will be the
first issued under the governorship of Mark Carney. Whether
intermediate thresholds are used will be an operational matter for the
independent MPC. I can confirm that Mervyn King and Mark Carney have
both seen the new remit and they have both agreed to
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032055000208" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/debtext/130320-0001.htm#13032055000208">Active
monetary policy can only operate freely when securely anchored by
credible fiscal policy. That is the next component of our economic
plan. We have instituted new public spending controls in government.
When money is short, we make no excuses for the rigorous financial
management we have run across Whitehall. Let me be clear with the
House: that is one of the reasons why we have got forecast borrowing
falling in this year and next. The traditional splurge of cash by
Departments at the end of the financial year, just to get the money
spent, has to be curtailed. And thanks to the tough financial control
of my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary, Government Departments are
forecast to underspend their budgets by more than £11 billion

the end of this Parliament. This will be done in the spending round
that will be set out on 26 June. I said last autumn that we would
require around £10 billion of savings from that spending round.
I confirm today that we will instead be seeking £11.5

Friends the Chief Secretary and the Minister for the Cabinet Office

Administration budgets will be adjusted accordingly in the spending
round. We will also seek substantial savings from what is called
progression pay. These are the annual increases in the pay of some
parts of the public sector. I think they are difficult to justify when
others in the public sector, and millions more in the private sector,

Government spending into two halves: fixed departmental budgets and

it was annually unmanaged expenditure—and it includes almost the
entire welfare budget as well as items like debt interest and payments

major projects from supporting the regeneration of the old Battersea
power station site to building the new power stations of
tomorrow. We have switched billions of pounds from current to capital
spending since the spending review to mitigate the sharp decline set in
train by the last Government. But on existing plans, capital spending
is still due to fall back in 2015-16, and I do not think that is
sensible. So by using our extra savings from Government Departments, we
will boost our infrastructure plans by £3 billion a year from
2015-16. That is £15 billion of extra capital spending over the
next decade, because by investing in the economic arteries of this
country, we will get growth flowing to every part of it. And public

Financial services are about much more than banking. In places such as
Edinburgh and London we have a world-beating asset management industry,

to go further. Today I want us to send a message to anyone who wants to
invest and create jobs here that Britain is open for business, so in
April 2015 we will reduce the main rate of corporation tax
by another 1%. Britain 
<?notus-xml column=940?>will have a 20% rate of corporation tax, the lowest business
tax of any major economy in the world. That is a tax cut for jobs and
growth. We will have achieved in one Parliament, and in these difficult
times, the largest reduction in the burden of corporation tax in our
nation’s history, and with it we will achieve major
simplification of our business tax system. By merging the small company
and main rates at 20p, we will abolish the complex marginal relief
calculations between them and give Britain a single rate of corporation
tax for the first time since 1973. As with previous reductions in the
corporate tax rate, I do not intend to pass the benefit on to the

Under Labour, we had the worst of both worlds: uncompetitive tax rates
that were not paid. When the 50p rate was introduced, tax revenues fell
by billions of pounds as the wealthy paid less. That is the wrong way
round. Under this Government, the tax rates are more competitive and
the wealthy pay more tax. That is the right way round. Here is an
inconvenient truth for the Opposition: in every year of this Parliament
the rich will pay a greater proportion of income tax revenues than in
any one of the 13 years of the previous Labour Government. During those
13 years, too many people were allowed to get away with aggressive tax
avoidance and abuse. They boasted that they were paying less tax then

to stop the abuse of partnership rules, corporate tax losses and
offshore employment intermediaries. That is another £2 billion.
This year we are giving Britain its first ever general anti-abuse rule,
and we will name and shame the promoters of tax avoidance schemes. My
message to those who make a living advising other people how to
aggressively avoid their taxes is this: this Government will not let
you get away with it. This year we are leading international action on
tax avoidance through our presidency of the G8 and with the OECD and
the G20. We want the global rules governing the taxation of
multinational firms to be updated from the 1920s, when they were first
written, and made relevant to the global internet economy of the 21st

part of the glue that holds our society together. So too is the

for their future and try to be independent of the state are not
undermined but supported. So to the working parents struggling with the
costs of child care, and the mother wondering whether it makes
financial sense to get a job, we offer this: tax-free child care. The
plans were set out yesterday: new tax-free child care vouchers for
working families, with 20% off the first £6,000 of

those who aspire to put aside money for their retirement, we offer
this: a simple, flat-rate pension accessible to everyone and worth
£144 a week. Any one pound you save will be a pound you can
keep. We are bringing forward the introduction of the new single-tier
pension to 2016. It will help the low-paid, the self-employed, and
millions of women most of all. Of course, if there is no longer the old
state second pension, there is no longer anything to contract out of.
For employers, that means paying the same employer national insurance
as those without defined-benefit schemes. Private sector employers can
adjust their pension benefits to accommodate the extra cost; public
sector employers will have to absorb the burden, as is always the case
with tax changes. Any spending review in the next Parliament will of
course take the £3.3 billion cost into account.</hs_Para>

we have already made clear, public sector employees, and the relatively
small number of private sector employees in defined benefit schemes,
will from 2016 pay more national insurance then they do today. They
will pay the same rate of national insurance as the rest of the working
population, and in return they will get a larger state pension than
before. For example, someone who is 40 years old when the single-tier
pension is introduced, and who has always been contracted out, will pay
an extra £6,000 in national insurance over the rest of their
working life—and in return get an extra £24,000 in state
pension over the course of their retirement. That is a fair deal, and
it is a progressive pension reform. We have

have put home ownership beyond the great majority who cannot turn to
their parents for a contribution. That is not just a blow to the most

been hard on the construction industry too.

to Buy has two components. First, we are going to commit £3.5
billion of capital spending over the next three years to shared equity
loans. From the beginning of next month, we will offer an equity loan
worth up to 20% of the value of a new build home to anyone looking to
move up the housing ladder. You put down a 5% deposit from your
savings, and the Government will loan you a further 20%. The loan is
interest free for the first five years. It is repaid when the home is
sold. Previous help was available only to those who were first-time
buyers and who had family incomes below £60,000. Now help is
available to all buyers of newly built homes on all incomes: available
to anyone looking to get on or move up the housing ladder. The only
constraint will be that the home cannot be worth more than
£600,000—but this covers well over 90% of all homes. It
is a great deal for homebuyers; it is a great support to home builders;
and because it is a financial transaction, with the taxpayer making an
investment and getting a return, it will not hit our
deficit.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032055000240" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/debtext/130320-0001.htm#13032055000240">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T13:16:20"></hs_TimeCode>
second part of Help to Buy is even bolder and has not been seen before
in this country. We are going to help families who want a mortgage for
any home they are buying, old or new, but who cannot begin to afford
the kind of deposits being demanded today. We will offer a new mortgage
guarantee. This will be available to lenders to help them to provide
more mortgages to people who cannot afford a big deposit. These
guaranteed mortgages will be available to all homeowners, subject to
the usual checks on responsible lending. Using the Government’s
balance sheet to back these higher loan-to-value mortgages will
dramatically increase their availability. We have worked with some of
the biggest mortgage lenders to get this right; and we are offering
guarantees sufficient to support £130 billion of mortgages. It
will be available from the start of 2014 and run for three years. A
future Government would need the agreement of the Bank of
England’s Financial Policy Committee if they wanted to extend
it.</hs_Para>

can hire someone on £22,000, or four people on the minimum wage,

sports clubs. The previous Government’s answer to

policy in response to the crisis came not from this Chancellor but from
his predecessor. More than two thirds of the fiscal adjustment
announced by the Chancellor in the 2010 Budget had already been
signalled by the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T13:47:11"></hs_TimeCode>
right hon. Member for Edinburgh South West (Mr Darling). In 2010, the
OBR estimated that the economy would grow about 4% more than it has and
the key question for the Chancellor has been how much policy should be
altered to take account of that—what he should announce this
afternoon and what adjustments he should make in response.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=951?><hs_Para UID="13032055000317" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/debtext/130320-0002.htm#13032055000317"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T13:47:31"></hs_TimeCode>It
is important to be clear that policy has already been altered a great
deal, something that seems to be lost in the brouhaha in this place.
Both the Government and the Bank of England have implemented massive
policy changes to stimulate the economy. Fiscal policy has been
loosened a great deal. The so-called automatic stabilisers—the
falls in tax receipts and rises in public expenditure that come with
lower growth—have been allowed to kick in. No one knows their
full value, but I note that the IFS used to think that they were worth
about £100 billion and said yesterday that they were worth
£140 billion.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T13:48:13"></hs_TimeCode>No one knows the
full effects of QE—quantitative easing—either, but we
know that since 2010 £175 billion of QE has been pumped in,
bringing the total to £375 billion in all.</hs_Para>

automatic stabilisers are delivering colossal extra sums to the
economy—they are massive policy changes—and the
Chancellor has exercised great flexibility in response to the downturn.
He does not always seem happy to acknowledge the fact that there has
been that huge adjustment, so I thought I would put the points myself
after his speech.</hs_Para>

want to say a few words about growth and the supply side, but before I
do I want to refer to the greatest single blight on the prospects for
the economy, which is the eurozone. Eurozone demand has remained very
weak, as the Chancellor pointed out. There could not be a more vivid
illustration of the eurozone’s capacity for self-harm than its
chronic mishandling of the Cypriot financial crisis over the past few
days. What on earth possessed policy makers to play with fire by doing
the very things most likely to trigger a run on the banks? I just do
not know, but it beggars belief.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T13:49:41"></hs_TimeCode>We cannot
influence policy in the eurozone directly, but we can—and
should—speak truth to incompetence. That is in Britain’s
interest, as well as that of the eurozone, and I urge the Government to
do that and ignore what will undoubtedly be bleatings from the Foreign
Office asking them to desist.</hs_Para>

the supply side we cannot, of course, do much about the eurozone, but
we can do something to improve the micro-economy. For nearly three
years, the Treasury Committee has been calling for more coherent and
tougher supply-side reforms. The Chancellor has had such an agenda for
at least 18 months, but implementing it in a consistent way is proving
difficult. The Chancellor has done what he can on tax reform and
simplification—a big ask given the lack of fiscal
room—and I pay tribute to him today because he has managed a
substantial cut in corporation tax and its simplification in one go.
That is both simplification and reduction, despite the lack of fiscal

the dysfunctionality of the banking sector. Again, that is something we
can control—unlike the eurozone—although it is difficult
for the Government to get to grips with. Britain’s economic
recovery will depend to a large extent on a return to growth in the
small business sector, and I strongly welcome the crucial measures
announced today by the Chancellor to help the small business sector,
but the plain fact remains that small and medium-sized businesses in
our constituencies cannot get the funding they need from the banks.
Banks lack the confidence to lend to them, and businesses lack the
confidence to borrow from banks on the terms
offered<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T13:55:21"></hs_TimeCode>. The SME

normal lending. Without that normal lending, SMEs will not recover. How
to address that issue during this crisis has been one of the abiding

blame everything on the previous Labour Government—it was to be

parties had agreed on Labour’s spending plans right up to the
banking crisis; never mind that the banking crisis was global and not
national; and never mind that, although the failure of the banks owed a
lot to failures in regulation,

Those facts were not going to get in the way of a clear political
strategy of blaming it all on Labour. The political strategy has had
some effect—the polls, which people such as Lord Ashcroft tell
us are the only glimmer of hope the Conservatives have, tell us
that—but the disastrous mistake for Britain is that the
Government believe their own rhetoric. They believe that, because the

Gentleman and all members of the Liberal Democrats said how disastrous
it would be to adopt the policies that they later supported. He makes
precisely my point. He adopted a position that was absolutely factually

Government’s strategy on cutting too far and too fast was bad
enough—it shattered confidence and took demand out of the
economy—but it was compounded by catastrophic failures in
policy. Because the Government convinced themselves that the only thing
that needed to be done was cutting the deficit fast, they abandoned
many of the tools available to them to stimulate growth. It was
interesting today to hear of a single pot for cities to bid for from
the Government who, within two months of coming to office, abolished
the regional development agencies and the whole development
infrastructure. They recognise, three years later, that that was a
disastrous 
<?notus-xml column=955?>mistake, as Lord Heseltine has told them, but at the time, they did not

Government also created massive uncertainty in the wider economy. The
truth is that there is no absolute shortage of money that could be used
to rebuild the British economy. The cash balances of giant companies

responsibility for that goes much wider than the Government, because
Conservative and Liberal Democrat Back Benchers have spent three years
creating uncertainty about wind power, nuclear power, HS2 and the
future of airports policy. For everywhere that business might look to
invest in this country, Conservative and Liberal Democrat MPs have, for
the narrowest of marginal constituency political interests, conspired
to create the maximum business uncertainty. It is therefore unfair to
blame all the uncertainty on the Chancellor’s misguided
policies. Much of it comes from a misunderstanding by Conservatives and

Sunseeker and Oyster Yachts and many smaller manufacturers, is a small

coherence in Government policy, but what do we find? We find that the
banks are not lending coherently as they once did to businesses in the
luxury yacht and leisure boat industry; that it is hard for dealers to
get finance to trade up and down in the second-hand vessels that need

is a considerable tribute to the strength of the Government’s

enacted. The Budget takes place against an extraordinarily difficult
background. I cannot remember, in 26 years on and off in this House, a
more difficult set of circumstances in which a Chancellor has had to
craft the Budget, nor such a heavy volume of advice across all media,
much of which has been contradictory. The article in last

the case for the morality of low taxation, is well worth reading and
sets out an argument that we do not hear often enough in this House.

was talking about the importance of engendering growth in the economy
through local activity, and mentioned specifically the work that Lord
Heseltine has done in respect of Birmingham. He underlined the
importance of the local enterprise partnership and the importance of
stimulating growth in an area that remains at the heart of this
country’s industrial base. I am reminded that it was only three
years ago that I visited the Jaguar factory just outside my
constituency in Castle Bromwich. At that stage, two of the three
production lines were lying idle and employees were unable to continue
to secure work. Now, just three years later, all three production lines
are in operation. We see a company that is storming ahead and cannot
produce enough cars to satisfy market demand. Last year, it exported
more than £10 billion worth of cars made in Britain and paid in
to the Exchequer more than £1 billion of taxation. That real
transformation offers hope at a very difficult time in the area of the
country I represent. The announcement that we will have a single pot of
central money to support local initiatives is enormously important, as
is the emphasis that Lord Heseltine places on more effective governance

ever, have a real chance to address. That is why I am pleased that the
Government are standing by our commitment, that every day they continue
to underline the effectiveness of development and that they are
maintaining the implicit bargain with the public to spend the money
well. I hope to hear far more from Ministers about why the development
budget matters to our country. I want to hear all of them making that
case, so that the sceptics outside can hear why it is important for our
country’s economic and political

more child care in child care settings. There are important and
detailed questions that I hope Ministers will consider and that I will
follow up for a proper response. Will the child care tax break only
apply to Ofsted-regulated chid care? If so, how does that chime with
the children’s Minister’s desire for lighter-touch, or
no-touch, regulation by that very important body? Does the
£2,000 national insurance break for small businesses also apply
to anyone employing child care directly, as well as the promised tax
break? We could see a double subsidy for the higher income earner, who
can afford to employ a child carer in their home, and much less help
for those at the lower end of the

only one parent is working, much more difficult issues arise.
Low-income parents have higher marginal costs. I think of two women I
met at a recent roundtable I organised in one of my child care centres:
one was a chef who, because of her working hours, found it much harder
to access the sort of child care that would get the subsidy the
Government have waved in front of us today; and the other was herself a
child carer working for a private nursery on £15,000 a year who
could not afford to pay for child care herself and whose employer,
shockingly, would not allow her to work part-time. How will those women
be helped by what the Government have offered today? We need more

Hillier:</Member></B> My hon. Friend, who does good work on the
Business, Innovation and Skills Committee, speaks clearly on this
issue. It is vital that we do what he suggests. The funding for lending
scheme has effectively been supporting more buy-to-let landlords, which
was not really what it was intended for, while businesses in
Shoreditch—businesses visited regularly by the occupants of No.
10 and No. 11 Downing street—are losing out.</hs_Para>

is interesting that the Labour Front-Bench team, even in opposition,
are encouraging local government to consider investing in one of the
peer-to-peer lending vehicles, Funding Circle, representing an
important part of the difference in ethos between the Government and
the Opposition. We want local money invested in local business and
creating local jobs—a break from the distant lenders that have
no connection to the business models and economies to which they lend.
We cannot say that the banks have stood up well to the test. They have
let the side down. They overextended themselves with risky lending and
brought the world financial system to the brink of collapse, and the
rest of us, including local businesses in my area, have been paying the
price.</hs_Para>

way to cut the banks out is to have better approaches to peer-to-peer
lending. The Government have said that they will channel £100
million to small businesses through alternative mainstream, but we do
not have the detail. The key issue about peer-to-peer lending is that,
although it is for profit, there is no necessary prior relationship
between borrower and lender. The lender, who buys into the model and
will believe in the business, can choose the loan recipients, but there
is no protection from the Financial Services Compensation Scheme and no
full regulation.</hs_Para>

first peer-to-peer lending company, Zopa, was founded in
February 2005, but we now have others: RateSetter, the
Funding Circle, ThinCats and MarketInvoice. Between them, they expect
to provide about £200 million this year alone in funding to
businesses with innovative models that are struggling to get money from
the banks, which, if they are not familiar with a business model, think
it a risk and do not lend, resulting in a vicious circle of not being
able to fund a business.</hs_Para>

the low level of regulation, there is a good case for peer-to-peer
lending organisations receiving more support even as they are. Zopa
says that bad debts account for just 0.84% of the £200 million
it has loaned over the last seven years, compared with 3% to 5% for
traditional banks, so I think the banks are missing a trick and the
Government most certainly are. The average increase in employment after
a Funding Circle loan was 25%. If we give businesses the tools to get
on and build their businesses, we see jobs created. The Chancellor
talks the talk on this issue, but he could have done more to help the
industry. The problem is that the industry is barely regulated and
lenders have to absorb the losses. Where was the discussion
today—or even a hint—that the Government might be looking
at better regulation? Where were the changes to taxation, for example,
to offset losses through bad debtors against tax, which would encourage
more people to lend through such models?</hs_Para>

party is strongly supportive of peer-to-peer lending, as it can help
small businesses such as those in Shoreditch and Hackney to obtain
access to funding that would otherwise not be
available—something on which the Government have failed to date.
In the current climate there is a lack of access to
funding—often to very small pots of funding. Indeed, the owner
of Lock 7 cycle shop in Hackney—the first cycle café to
open in the country—took out a personal loan to get her business
started. She did that because it was quicker and easier 
<?notus-xml column=962?>than trying to put her innovative business model—a café
that sells coffee and fixes bikes—to the banks. Actually, it is
not that innovative—I give her credit for being the first, but
it is hardly a risky business, given that both sides of the business
are likely to do well—but the banks would have been slow, had
they even coughed up. To take the chance, she took another route. The
Government need to be fleeter of foot if they really mean what they say
about supporting businesses.</hs_Para>

I must touch on housing. There is much of promise in what the

buy-to-let landlords and others looking to invest in second homes. From

John Redwood</B> (Wokingham) (Con):</Member> It is important first to
understand what the Government strategy is, because there have been a
number of misleading interpretations of it. Some have said that the
reason the economy did not grow last year and is still growing very
slowly is that there have been massive public spending cuts that have
reduced national output. There is a helpful table on page 53 of the
Office for Budget Responsibility report which shows that growth was
indeed only 0.2% in real terms last year. However, it shows that the
Government sector made a positive contribution of 0.6%, which is far
more than overall growth, and that growth was reduced by disappointment
in private sector housing investment, changes in stocks in private
sector companies, reflecting an absence of confidence, and a poor
performance on trade. A similar position is reported in forecasts for
the current year, in which it is assumed that the Government sector
will still make a positive real contribution to a rather low rate of
growth, while it is hoped that the private sector will not have as
disappointing a performance this year as it did last year.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13032055000397" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/debtext/130320-0002.htm#13032055000397"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T14:35:52"></hs_TimeCode>The
strategy was never about massive cuts in public spending overall; it
was about modest growth in public spending. The idea was to get the
deficit down through some very large tax rises. Unfortunately, as the
latest documents reveal, the 50p and the other income tax changes were
especially damaging to revenue. A loss of more than £7 billion
has been recorded by those on the Front Bench. The overall figures
imply that it was probably even more than that. In the most recent
year, tax revenues from income tax overall are down on the previous
year, not up. The strategy has not miscarried because it cut too much
or because the Government overspent compared with what was
planned—they have done a rather better job this year of
controlling spending. Rather, the strategy miscarried because the big
increase in tax revenue that had been forecast did not come through.
That was partly because tax rates were set that did not work, such as
the high rate of income tax. Also, the capital gains tax rate is too
high, so we will get less in capital gains tax receipts this year than
in the previous year. The reason is also partly that growth in the

most of my colleagues here are not, but I wish to be, because I think

them deeper into recession. It would do more damage to our export

removing the cap from the newly localised housing revenue account. We
have heard about families borrowing prudently, but local government
does borrow prudently, as its average level of debt is less than 5%.
The Chancellor told us that the national Government’s net debt
is 75%. We are talking about £7 billion, loosening the cap,
15,000 new council homes—not just for this year, as the
Chancellor has announced, but every year for the next five years. That
is the sort of borrowing we could do to invest, to promote jobs, to

delivered his first Budget, that the last Tory Government 
<?notus-xml column=970?>had cut capital investment too far, yet the Office for Budget
Responsibility has shown that for the first three years of this
Parliament, capital spending fell year on year—it is now

a difference: not all borrowing is bad borrowing. Interest rates on

for government, both national and local, to borrow for that investment.

start by welcoming some of the measures in the Budget. Although there
has been a 1% reduction in departmental spending, as a result of the
top-slicing, the way in which the Barnett formula works means that
Northern Ireland will actually benefit over the two years by about
£59 million of additional spending. I do not think the
Chancellor meant that to happen; I do not think it was deliberate. Of

measure was going to devastate all the electricity producers in

going to add to the costs of generating electricity in Northern
Ireland—£20 million this year, rising to
£45 million—which would have affected
household bills by about 15% and made us dependent on producers in the
Irish Republic. The one thing I want to say is that when a case is made

Ireland on which tens of millions of pounds have been spent, but which
have already begun to have an impact on the economy. First, there has
been investment in the broadband infrastructure in Northern Ireland as
a result of the Chancellor’s initiatives in previous Budgets.
Project Kelvin and broadband infrastructure around Belfast and
Londonderry have helped us to grow the financial services industry in
Northern Ireland, which employs nearly 30,000 people, and it has helped
us to grow the film industry there too. Both industries need
connectivity to North America, and there is faster connectivity to
North America from Northern Ireland than there is from the west coast
of North America to the east coast. That has stimulated a range of
other investments, and it makes sense when it comes to infrastructure
investment.</hs_Para>

respect to the Government’s economic strategy, a number of
Members have pointed out the difficult circumstances surrounding the
Budget from various points of view. The Government clearly have a
difficult deal to handle regarding the inheritance from the previous
Government. Obviously, there is the borrowing, but it is not just that.
The structural deficit passed on by the previous Government was much
bigger than anyone understood at the time, and that is just
economists’ technospeak for a society that has too much welfare
dependency throughout, including even the middle classes, and too much
inefficient—costly and expensive—delivery of public
services, which are properly needed but badly delivered.</hs_Para>

part, which is extremely important and has been alluded to slightly by
a few Members who have spoken so far, is the international backdrop
with which the Government have to deal. We are in a circumstance where
world growth is probably about 6%, but that divides sharply into two
sectors. The far east, the BRICs—Brazil, Russia, India,
China—Vietnam, Indonesia, and so on, have growth rates
approaching 10% or thereabouts. In the developed world, of which we are
obviously a part, the growth rate on average is nearer to 1%. So we are
in a 1% world, and the reason for that is pretty straightforward: it is
the dramatic change in competitiveness between ourselves and the far
east and other developing countries. That does not mean that it is
inescapable, but it means that competitiveness has to be at the centre
of the strategy that we undertake—competitiveness, pure and
simple. Everything else, all the other macro-economic tricks, frankly
do not work.</hs_Para>

respect I am addressing the comments of
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T15:29:28"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson).
If<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T15:31:20"></hs_TimeCode> I may say
so—and I do not mean to be rude—he talked very much like
a classical Labour Member. He talked about stimulus, and about this
being a balanced Budget. It is about £100-odd billion off being
a balanced Budget. There is a vast amount of deficit finance in there.
But my point is that, if we look at the historic examples of countries
that have been knocked off the historic growth rates—3% or
4%—down to something lower and at what has been done with them,
there are clear examples of success and failure. Let me tell him, just
for a second, about the biggest failure in modern times, which was
Japan some 20 years or so ago, which went from a 4% growth
rate, pretty much for all the post-war years, to a 1% growth rate after
a financial crisis not unlike our own. What did it try? It tried
Keynesian expansion. It now has pretty much the biggest public debts in
the world, with an annual deficit of 10% of GDP in recent years. Did it
work? No, it did not. It also tried monetary activism. I hope that
those on the Treasury Bench listen to this, because it had effectively
zero interest rates for a decade. Did it work? No, it did not. It also
went in for infrastructure spending—the fashionable item this
week—on a grand scale. It spent 40% of its Government budget on
infrastructure investment, more than was spent to build the entire
Panama canal—in one year. Did it work? No, it did not. I am
afraid that those macro-economic polices that people love because the
arithmetic seems to work are a dangerous allure. We must focus first
and last on competitiveness, because without that we will not be able
to earn our way in the

Davis:</Member></B> I will come back to the detail in a minute, but the
point I am making—it is a serious point—is that we can do
what Keynes said and pay someone to dig a hole and then pay someone
else to fill it in, and that creates employment. So long as we avoid
that and talk about the real value, we are on the same side. I will
come back to the real value issue in a
moment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T15:33:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032055000502" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/debtext/130320-0002.htm#13032055000502">The
problem with actions to promote competitiveness is that they are not
always politically popular. Very often, they are politically unpopular,
and I will elaborate on that in a second. The other element about
growth—everyone in the Chamber today agrees that growth is
necessary—is that it is also important to the deficit reduction
policy. In effect, if 1% is taken off the growth rate, the OBR’s
rule of thumb says that within a year or so that adds £10
billion to the deficit every year thereafter—not once, but every
year thereafter. So growth is fundamental to the central fiscal policy
as well. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T15:34:08"></hs_TimeCode>While
we are talking about growth, we have had much talk about double and
triple-dip recessions, but judging by the employment numbers, we have
not had real recessions, we have had bouncing around zero to 1% growth,
and that will show up when the numbers are corrected, as will be done
in a few
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T15:34:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032055000503" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/debtext/130320-0002.htm#13032055000503">There
are six key elements to ensuring the economy’s competitiveness,
and they are all pretty straightforward. I agree with what the
Government are doing on some of them, but on others I think that they
should go further. The first is straightforward: the Chancellor is
absolutely right not to hesitate or flinch in the deficit reduction
programme. That is absolutely essential. Canada, Germany and Sweden,
which are all successful examples—Japan is not—managed
their deficit reduction unflinchingly, and in all of them it delivered
3% plus rates of growth within a few years. Indeed, Canada had the
fastest growing economy in the G8 when it carried through. The simple
fact is that, even with the deficit reduction programme, we will be
£600 billion more indebted at the end of this Parliament than we
were at the beginning, and that is a devil of a burden for any country
to carry. Clearly we cannot hesitate on deficit
reduction.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032055000504" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/debtext/130320-0002.htm#13032055000504"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T15:35:46"></hs_TimeCode>The
second key element is the one on which I and my right hon. Friends on
the Treasury Bench might have a difference of view. One of the critical
drivers of competitiveness is tax policy. I wholeheartedly welcome the
actions announced today on corporation tax and national insurance,
although I would like them to go further. The simple truth is that
expensive, complex and high levels of tax returns are very
damaging to a country’s economic competitiveness. We
should be looking hard at the tax categories that are most responsive
to lower rates. We have heard today, even from the Labour Benches,
about a couple of measures—on beer, I
think—that will deliver more money for the Exchequer, not less,
so even Labour Members recognise dynamic tax strategy.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T15:36:47"></hs_TimeCode> certainly
want to see lower national insurance contributions for employers. I
would like to see the employment allowance scheme
that we put together extended considerably. Capital gains tax must come
down. At 28%, we are collecting much less money than we would if it was
somewhere between 15% and 20%. There is a series of other taxes, 
<?notus-xml column=980?>including corporation tax, on which action could be taken. Again, the
examples to look to are Canada, Sweden and
Germany.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032055000505" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/debtext/130320-0002.htm#13032055000505"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T15:37:11"></hs_TimeCode>The
third key element, which we did not hear much about from the Chancellor
today—perhaps we have not heard much because we are yet to go
through the detail of the Budget—is deregulation. The most
successful recovery in Europe in the past decade was Germany’s.
The Germans took it upon themselves to dramatically deregulate their
employment market for small companies. That is key, because small
companies are the biggest employment creator in the economy, bar none.
The Germans effectively removed employment law for companies with fewer
than 10 employees and created mini-jobs and other mechanisms to reduce
the bureaucracy and legislation surrounding employment. That is
massively important. It is one very effective way of creating new
employment, and it is something we should undertake as dramatically as
we
can.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032055000506" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/debtext/130320-0002.htm#13032055000506"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T15:38:05"></hs_TimeCode>Another
item that was raised
earlier—the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T15:38:07"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for East Antrim raised it with respect to Northern Ireland
alone—was the question of carbon tax and carbon floors. In the
next month or so, the changes that are being introduced will give us a
disadvantage of £10 a tonne, and not against China or
India, but against Germany, Holland and France. We will see a transfer
of heavy industry from this country to Europe. There will now be an
exemption for ceramics, but frankly there are many other
businesses—they employ about 600,000 people—in the energy
intensive industries. We need to address that. The previous Government
were very happy to deliver golden rules of one sort or another. I would
like to suggest a rule for us on environmental and energy
policy: we should not introduce any environmental policy that is not
matched by our European colleagues. That would ensure that we do not do
ourselves huge harm.</hs_Para>

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T15:39:12"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

agree with him. What I do not want to see is massive expenditure for
its own sake in the expectation or hope that that will simply generate
employment by itself. The Japanese experiment demonstrates that that
does not work. What we want to see is de-bottlenecking of our railways
and road systems and underpinning of things such as broadband. The

more. That is what will fundamentally allow growth to take off in

today’s announcements, I think that most Labour Members would

which the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T15:41:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Member for Bristol West (Stephen Williams) talked about. I felt that
the Chancellor should have emphasised that, but we heard very little
about it. As we saw in the figures published last week by the Office
for National Statistics, a fifth of our economic
output is attributable to London. One could draw from that the
conclusion that Londoners are twice as productive as people in other
regions of the country. The hon. Gentleman, in talking about his
region, wanted to emphasise that London and the south-east are getting
a bigger share of the pie than they should be. I want to challenge that
basic assumption.</hs_Para>

much of the Chancellor’s analysis—certainly my
constituents would want to communicate this—is the question of
whose London we are talking about. Should we be entirely preoccupied
with those in the City of London, with an elite arriving from Russia,
China or the middle east, or with the very many Londoners who did not
see sufficient for them in the Budget that he described? The north-east
and east of London, as a sub-region, is ranked 113th in terms of
economic activity, and there are only 139 sub-regions across Britain.
Of the 20 constituencies with the highest number of unemployed people,
seven are in London. Of the 20 constituencies with the worst
child poverty, nine are in London. This is not a London that feels as
though it is benefiting considerably from economic growth; it is a
London that is really struggling. We needed to hear from the Chancellor
a whole series of announcements that could meet the challenges of
unemployment and child poverty, and a London that does not feel as
though it is working for Londoners.</hs_Para>

Chancellor could, then, have had more to say about infrastructure here
in this city. He could have announced that the Government would bring
forward a hybrid Bill on Crossrail 2, which will benefit hugely the
transport infrastructure of London—and it will be in need of
such benefit after High Speed 2 is complete and we have extra people in
London’s transport system, which is creaking from the point of
view of someone who is on the tube in the peak hours early in the
morning or going home late at night. All we have heard about so far
from the Mayor and the Chancellor is a small extension to the Northern
line, when in fact we needed to hear something big and major. We hear
hon. Members pooh-pooh the need for greater investment in
infrastructure; HS2 was that, but we heard nothing more from the

heard a huge boast about how planning changes are generating growth in
house-building, but house-building has fallen to a level unseen in this
country since the 1920s, and that was during the depression. The
situation is absolutely dire. Some 59% of Londoners are
renting—the highest proportion since before the second world
war. There was a settlement in London whereby people 
<?notus-xml column=982?>could rent, get a council property and be part of the social-housing

we needed to hear was a Government commitment to house-building, which
would be a far more responsive approach to local government in

£1.6 billion to house-building in London. It is not sufficient,
but that is their commitment. Islington hopes to complete its target of
about 1,600 homes by 2014, and Southwark wants to complete, I think,
1,000 homes by 2020. As my hon. Friend has said, a small change to how
the Treasury allows local authorities to borrow against their assets,
with changes to the Treasury’s prudential rules, would allow for
a huge expansion in local government house-building. London local
governments estimate that 54,000 new homes could be built over this
next period, which is a significant amount that would go some way to
meeting the needs of those currently in temporary
housing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T15:47:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032055000518" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/debtext/130320-0002.htm#13032055000518">A

however, I would like to talk about tax. The Government are right to
try to take as many people on low and modest wages out of tax as
possible, and the savings so far of £326 a year for basic rate
taxpayers, whose personal allowance rose last year from £6,475
to £8,105, makes sense. However, if we are “all in it
together”, a saving of £326 makes rather less sense when
we are persevering with a tax cut for millionaires who might consider a
£326 saving no more than a decent lunch.</hs_Para>

is welcome that the Government are taking people at the bottom out of
tax, but we should look at what they are doing to those in the middle,
who have seen tax relief before the 40% band kicks in fall from
£37,400 in 2010 to £34,370 last year. Therefore, for
every £326 saved at the bottom on the 20p rate,
people have had to shell out an extra £560 at the 40p rate. I
welcomed the announcement that the basic rate tax threshold will
increase to £9,440 and then £10,000, but the Chancellor
has pulled the same trick with that as he did previously because relief
for the 40p band will shrink again to £32,010, as announced last
year. Importantly,
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T16:04:15"></hs_TimeCode> means that
in the three years before today’s announcement, the Government
have increased the number of taxpayers paying 40% tax from 10% to 13%
of all taxpayers—a whopping 670,000 extra people. In the past 25
years—this is instructive—the number has doubled. Some
2.1 million extra people pay tax at 40%. The rate used to be for the
rich, but the people paying it are not rich or
wealthier.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032055000550" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/debtext/130320-0002.htm#13032055000550">It
is not as if the economy has come out of the austerity
period—the UK teeters on the brink of a triple-dip recession.
People feel poorer because they are poorer. Last year, the Office for
Budget Responsibility changed its forecast by reducing household
disposable income every year from 2013 onwards. It has done the same
for this year’s Budget. People are poorer for many reasons. In
the 2010 Budget, child benefit was frozen, and later removed entirely
for many people, costing families £2.5 billion a year.
Households are and feel poorer because their wages have been frozen or
capped 
<?notus-xml column=987?>while inflation has been higher than forecast. For pensioner households,
notwithstanding the much vaunted triple lock, the pensions calculation
has gone from the retail prices index to the consumer prices

do the Chancellor’s previous decisions mean? The 1% benefit cap
hits 1 million households in Scotland to the tune of, on average,
around £165 a year; the tax credit changes hit 110,000 families

should explain that lesson in recent history. Last year’s Red
Book told us that the Government’s discretionary fiscal
consolidation—tax rises and cuts—would rise to
£155 billion a year every year from 2016-17 onwards. I checked
the Red Book today to find out the scale of the increase in the
discretionary consolidation—tax rises and cuts—only to
find that there is no 2017-18. Indeed, the Government have taken out
2016-17. They are hiding the future. The one thing we know from this
year’s Red Book is that the Government continue to be
determined to change the ratio of cuts to tax rises to
4:1.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032055000553" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/debtext/130320-0002.htm#13032055000553">We
therefore know precisely where the Government’s priorities lie,
and it is not with people, jobs or growth, as we have seen with the
announcement of another £11.5 billion of cuts, the
detail of which we will get in June. That tells us—the
Chancellor is the only one who does not see this—that plan A has
failed. He has failed according to his own metrics. The net borrowing
requirement, which was meant to be £126 billion last year,
falling to £92 billion for 2012-13, has been increased to
£121 billion. The national debt—this should worry
everybody—was due to peak at 92.7% of gross domestic product, or
£1.36 trillion, in 2014-15 on the treaty calculation. It is now
expected to peak at more than 100% of GDP—100.8% of
GDP—on the treaty calculation by 2016-17. That means a national
debt of £1.58 trillion. The Chancellor has therefore failed by
his own
measures.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032055000554" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/debtext/130320-0002.htm#13032055000554">On
the fiscal rules that the structural current deficit should be in
balance in the final year of a five-year rolling programme, and that
debt should fall as a share of GDP, the objectives were highly
dependent on GDP growth, which, as we have noticed in previous Budgets,
is massively dependent, according to the OBR, on incredible,
unbelievable, unmet and unmeetable rates of business investment. In
2010, the Government suggested that business investment had to grow by
between 8.1% and 10.9%. By the time we got to the OBR’s fiscal
outlook the next year, growth in business investment had turned
negative. So it went on year after year. The Chancellor is at it again
today, forecasting future business investment rates of 6.4% to 10.2%
from 2013 onwards. These will not be met either, and the Chancellor
will be back at the Dispatch Box making more excuses for why the
failure is not his fault.</hs_Para>

biggest disappointment is that although the Government announced a
modest stimulus of £3 billion a year in capital investment, it
will not be immediate. The crisis is with us here and now. This is a
delayed reaction Budget—it does not kick in until
2015-16—and implies a fiscal stimulus in capital expenditure
terms of less than 0.25% of GDP. The benefits of that, if there are
any, will almost certainly be offset by the other cuts, the details of
which we will get in June.</hs_Para>

the much-vaunted triple A rating has gone—that was not mentioned
today. The Government’s response is a 0.25% of GDP capital
expenditure stimulus, most of which will be gobbled up by cuts made
elsewhere. That is a timid, weak and inadequate response. What should
have been a bold demand to go for growth instead locks us into
austerity. To be frank, it risks a decade of austerity and a decade of
stagnant growth to go along with the Government’s failure to
invest when it was necessary, and when they could, to get the growth in

control of public expenditure. The Chancellor set out the position
clearly and frankly. It is refreshing to have such frank Budgets,

all the statistics presented today, the most important is the
trajectory of debt consolidation and dealing with the
financial deficit—one to which I do not think
the hon. Member for Dundee East alluded. Although
he chose to refer to the national debt, he did not refer to the fiscal
deficit, which is an important determinant of the national debt. As the
Chancellor rightly said, the deficit has been falling. It has fallen by
a quarter, and has now fallen by a third. The trajectory set out by the
Chancellor was encouraging: falling by 6.8% next year, 5.9% in 2014-15,

fundamental underlying economic strengths will, in time, allow the
government to implement its fiscal consolidation plan and reverse the
UK’s debt trajectory. Moreover, although the UK’s economy

a potential escalation in the euro area sovereign debt crisis, its
contagion risk is mitigated by the flexibility afforded by the

Opposition’s rhetoric runs the risk of creating an anti-business

future reference—this is not intended as a criticism

to give some assistance to, savers, as the Conservative party committed
to doing in a previous manifesto. The savings environment is not the
best for small savers, particularly older people looking to supplement

having obtained the best possible current easy access account, with the
forecast rate inflation in the country, at the end of four years will
have seen their savings lose in value the equivalent of the 6.75% levy
on Cyprus savers.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T16:19:17"></hs_TimeCode>That is the
hidden effect of inflation on savings. We know that inflation has been
rising and that savers cannot obtain high rates of interest from any of
our financial institutions. Very few if any will beat the rate of

urge my right hon. Friends to look carefully at that issue and, in
particular, at helping savers with individual savings accounts by
giving more flexibility to ISAs. That could be done by increasing the
limit for cash ISAs—this point has been made in many
circles—up to the same as that for stocks and shares ISAs, to
give people the opportunity to save £10,000 tax free in cash,
and also by giving people the opportunity to convert stocks and shares
ISAs into cash ISAs. People cannot currently do that—although
they can do it the other way around—yet it is something that
some in retirement or approaching it may wish to do. ISAs are the most
democratic form of saving, if I can put it that way. If future help is
to be made available, I would urge the Government to ensure that it
goes to our savers.</hs_Para>

changing course. If this had been a Labour Budget, we would have acted
to boost confidence, create jobs and support struggling businesses. We
need forward long-term infrastructure investment in schools and
transport, and we need to use the money raised from the 4G mobile
spectrum auction to build thousands of affordable homes—getting
builders back to work, creating the homes we need and strengthening our
economy for the future. Alongside that, we would have cut VAT
temporarily, including to 5% on home repairs, maintenance and
improvement, which would have helped the energy efficiency side of our
economy. The result would have been a plan for a steadier and more
balanced pace of deficit reduction with measures that support our
economy and create jobs

Members say that we cannot do that because it would mean more
borrowing. They neglect to mention that it is their policies that are
already leading to much higher borrowing. The Government and this
Chancellor are already borrowing £212 billion more than they
said they would to plug the holes in our public finances caused by a
flatlining economy and a higher unemployment bill. The Government
argument seems to be, “We will not borrow to grow the economy,
but we will borrow to shrink it”. Instead, the real question is
not whether we should borrow or not, but what we are borrowing for. Are
we going to continue to borrow to pay the cost of the Tory
Government’s economic failure and to keep people at home out of
work or are we going to act to support those small businesses that want
to invest in new equipment, to kick-start house building, to support
research and development and investment in low-carbon energy and
high-tech manufacturing with a proper plan to get people into work? In
other words, we need a real plan for jobs and growth, which would be
fairer, more successful in getting the deficit down and make Britain

commend my right hon. Friend the Chancellor for his Budget,
particularly for getting the macro-economic situation right. I would
like to quote again from the Library note cited by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T16:33:53"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Hertsmere (Mr Clappison), who is no longer in his place.
He quoted figures showing that the deficit is already down by a third
and that net borrowing as a percentage of GDP is set to fall to 5% in
2015-16 and 2.2% in 2017-18. Those figures are taken from the Red Book.
What is absolutely staggering is the fact that the last Labour
Government inherited a figure from us of just 0.7% in 1997, which rose
to a whopping 11.2%—this is contained in the Library
note—in 2009-10. If there were ever any doubt about the fact
that the last Labour Government—under the stewardship of the
shadow Chancellor—were at the root of all our present economic
problems, those figures would prove it to be the case. In absolute
terms, our borrowing rose from £5.8 million a year to
£158.9 million in the last year for which Labour was in
office.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032055000594" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/debtext/130320-0003.htm#13032055000594">I
believe that, surprisingly, the current employment situation shines a
bright light on our economy. It was interesting to hear the Chancellor
say this afternoon that the private sector was creating six jobs for
every job lost in the public sector. We have already created more than
1 million jobs in the private sector in the two years since the last
general election. It was also useful and, indeed, heartening to hear
the Chancellor estimate that 600,000 jobs would be created in the next
year alone. We are creating more jobs than France, the Netherlands,
Japan and the United States, and we are outstripped only by Germany in
this
respect.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032055000595" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/debtext/130320-0003.htm#13032055000595"><Member ContinuationText="Lindsay Roy" PimsId="5361" UID="13032055001068" xid="934" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/debtext/130320-0003.htm#13032055001068"><B>Lindsay

Clifton-Brown:</Member></B> I think someone is telling me that 400,000
jobs have been lost in the private sector. However, I am talking about
net job creation, which amounts to just over 1 million. That is the
important figure. Of course, in a dynamic economy some jobs will always
be lost and some will be gained, but as long as more are being gained
than lost, we are on the right side of the
argument.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032055000597" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/debtext/130320-0003.htm#13032055000597">The
Chancellor mentioned that the eurozone had contracted by 0.6% in the
last quarter. That, of course, is one of the reasons why our economy is
so difficult to 
<?notus-xml column=995?>repair. As the Red Book makes clear, 42% of our exports go to the
eurozone and 16% go to the United States. Both the eurozone and the
United States are experiencing little growth, and the economy of the
eurozone is contracting. However, there are some bright spots. Between
2009 and 2012, our exports of goods to Brazil, Russia, India and China
increased by 49%, 133%, 59% and 96% respectively. Last year,
indeed, we were the only country in Europe that managed to increase its
exports to China. The international markets have endorsed the
Chancellor’s policy in the form of our 10-year bond yields,
which, according to the table in the Red Book, would be virtually the
lowest in the eurozone, outstripped only by those in Germany.</hs_Para>

by the fact that, according to KPMG’s table, Britain is the best
place in which to do business—better than Switzerland, the
United States and France. However, I must issue a small caveat to my
hon. Friend the Exchequer Secretary. I fear that we are in danger of
losing some of our foreign direct investment, the inward investment
that sustains 40% of our GDP. Until recently we were in a fortunate
position, in that 70% of all the European corporate headquarters are
based within 75 miles of Heathrow, but owing to our current
indecision about where our major hub airport should be located, we are
losing those corporate headquarters by the day. I think that we should
persuade all parties to agree that whatever Sir Howard Davies comes up
with in relation to the hub airport should be implemented as soon as
possible after the next election, so that we do not lose that
international place. Let me also say that, while I fully support High
Speed 2, our most expensive engineering project ever, the route should
not be designed in isolation from the location of our major hub
airport.</hs_Para>

welcome some of the factors that KPMG identifies as making Britain one
of the best places in which to do business. I particularly welcome the
Chancellor’s announcement today that all corporation tax,
whether on large or small companies, is set to fall to 20%. I think
that that is a huge achievement, and I think that it will continue to
encourage companies to come to this country. I also welcome the fact
that the first £2,000 of national insurance will be left in the
pockets of the companies themselves. I welcome the fact that the small
business rate will be continued and that the Chancellor is abolishing
the fuel duty rise this autumn. All those are seen as welcome steps to
encourage employment. I particularly welcome the fact that well over
half a million new apprenticeships have been established this year,
including 570 in my constituency—that is a 63% increase on the
figure for the year before.</hs_Para>

welcome my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister’s initiative at
the G8 and G20 to make sure that although we lower the rate of
corporation tax, we require companies that make profits in a country to
pay a reasonable rate of tax on the profits in that country. Our
measure will help not only this country, but countries in the third
world, which often have difficulty collecting corporation tax from big
multinational companies on profits made in them. As the Chancellor said
today, these rules—these international tax treaties—were
written in the 1920s, and their updating is well overdue.</hs_Para>

me deal with some more domestic issues. As chairman of the all-party
group on wine and spirits, I welcome the Chancellor’s
announcement that the beer duty will fall in this Budget. However, his
announcement 
<?notus-xml column=996?>that the 2% alcohol escalator will continue will mean that wine duty
will have increased by 50% since 2008, while the duty on
spirits will have increased by 48%. The industry supports 2 million
jobs, many of them for young people in the hospitality industry, and it
contributes £16 billion-worth of duties. There are signs that
that is beginning to decline because of the rise in the duty escalator.
Alcohol consumption has fallen by 13% since 2004 because of the
responsible measures the industry has taken. Until now, the duty on
beer and wine per unit of alcohol has been broadly taxed the same. In
1983, the European Court of Justice warned the UK that it is illegal
for the UK to tax wine and beer at different rates, because they are
seen as competing products. There must now be a real risk of a legal
challenge, and I ask
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T16:41:45"></hs_TimeCode> Exchequer
Secretary to consider this matter seriously to see whether something
can be done about it before the Finance Act is introduced.</hs_Para>

conclusion, there are many things to welcome in this Budget. For
individuals who want to work hard and keep more of their own money, I
warmly welcome the fact that anybody earning less than £10,000
will not pay tax. We are helping to people to buy their own house, and
I have only one thing to warn the Exchequer Secretary about on that. As
he and others will have realised, house prices in central London are
rising very fast—they are literally increasing by the
day—and I hope that these measures will not lead to a housing
boom in London. We are also helping people with the cost of living,
helping people with their pensions and their retirement, and helping
people to keep their hard-earned life savings from being removed to pay
for the cost of their elderly care. There is a huge amount to welcome
in this Budget, but it has not been welcomed by the carping Labour
party, which caused many of our economic problems in the first
place.</hs_Para>

said that—with no change, and grim. In fact, it lived down to
all those trailing adjectives: it was a no-change Budget in a declining
economy. The main cause of anxiety among Labour Members is the fact
that the Chancellor has obstinately adhered to a set of policies that
have not worked—conspicuously so—and which have damaged
the country’s prospects. It is a Budget proposed for a nation in
comparative decline. We have missed out on 4% of GDP—the economy
has shrunk that much since 2008—and we have missed out on all
the normal growth that would have occurred since then. That is a huge
loss in the economy: a smaller economy is bearing a heavier burden of
debt. It is difficult, in that situation, for an economy to keep the

that economy cannot pay its way in the world. We have a huge and, until
the current recession, escalating balance of payments deficit. In such
cases, people either have to borrow overseas to finance the deficit, or
they have to sell assets at home. We have been selling assets apace in
this country: we have sold companies—we must be the most
colonised industrial economy in the world as a result of foreign
takeovers, which earn fees for the City. We have sold farms, houses and
anything that moves. We have set ourselves up as “Tax Haven on
Thames”, and international capital and funny money—the
funny funds and their manipulators—have been encouraged to come

debt, and of individuals. People are not 
<?notus-xml column=998?>spending on the high street, and there is no demand so the shops are

to do is spend. That is the only way out of a recession like this. A
litany of how we must not borrow more and that borrowing is evil is all
very well, but borrowing for public purposes is very different from
borrowing for private purposes. Borrowing to spend for public purposes
creates an economic stimulus and stimulates growth, and that is what we
have to do. It is the only way out of the present situation. I am sorry
to go on about it, but to Government Members’ taunts about
whether we would borrow more, I say yes, we must borrow more. We must
borrow to spend to do things to stimulate the economy, to stimulate the
animal instincts, as they are called, of the cautious capitalists in
this country, to get growth going. Once we get growth going, the
problem solves itself. We can only pay off debt in an economy that is
growing, as Labour did in our first two or three years of office. We
paid off an enormous amount of debt because the economy was growing. We
can do that again, but only with growth. We cannot do it by deflation,
because deflation increases debt. Deflation means we have to pay for
unemployment: we receive fewer taxes and have to cover all the costs of
companies going bust and all the weaknesses of the economy. There is an
increase in debts from deflation, but there is an increase in the
ability to pay off debt from expansion. We therefore have to borrow to
expand<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T16:50:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032055000613" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/debtext/130320-0003.htm#13032055000613">I
welcome the Chancellor’s measures on housing, but they are all
about owner-occupiers. The big need at present is to provide houses for
the two fifths of our population who cannot afford to buy them and to
whom the banks will not lend. The mortgages are not forthcoming in any
case, but those people are so impoverished that they need public
housing to rent. That is what we need to build primarily. Why not have
a massive housing programme—300,000 houses over two years? We
are already building 100,000 houses fewer than this community needs,
and it is those who cannot afford to buy, and who particularly need
housing, who are suffering the pain of the housing crisis and the

want to talk about three issues: interest rates, underemployment and
the place of young people in our economy. Before I do so, let me be
clear that in today’s Budget we heard conclusively that the
Government have failed on every economic test they set themselves. We
heard the Chancellor having to announce those debt figures. How he must
feel he has let himself down, but he has not just let himself down; he
has let the whole country down. He is not just the downgraded

borrowing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032055000629" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/debtext/130320-0003.htm#13032055000629"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T17:01:55"></hs_TimeCode>The
Bank of England has kept interest rates at a historic low. The
Chancellor had more to tell us about the framework within
which the Bank of England operates. When he was talking about the
arrangements for setting interest rates in the Monetary Policy
Committee, I noticed that some Government Members’ eyes were
glazing over slightly, so let me give them a warning. The Prime
Minister has lauded the low interest rates, and he is right to do so,
because, frankly, it is the only thing that has gone right. In fact,
the Government’s saving grace of low interest rates has resulted
from the use of the one economic tool that is not under their own
management. While the Governor of the Bank of England has got his foot
to the floor in holding interest rates low to try to support the
economy, the Chancellor keeps slamming on the brakes. Is it any wonder
that we are seeing such poor growth? Under the Chancellor’s
stewardship, we should have had growth of about 5.5%; in
fact, it has been less than
1<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T17:03:09"></hs_TimeCode>%.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032055000630" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/debtext/130320-0003.htm#13032055000630">It
is important that the Bank of England uses its economic tools properly.
What the Chancellor said about having a broader remit and taking the
long-term view on interest rates is extremely important, and I welcome
that discussion. But let us be clear that using monetary policy in this
way will not help rebalancing; in order to achieve this, we need
serious investment. Government Members need not take my word for it;
they need only listen to the Business Secretary, who has clearly been
listening to the shadow Chancellor, because they seem to be in
agreement that we need a different plan. When the Chancellor made his
announcement about the national insurance position of small companies,
I wondered whether he had taken a leaf out of the shadow
Chancellor’s book and it was an announcement about the
Government’s commencing our five-point plan. The Minister is
giving me a tentative smile, and being a cheerful soul I will take that
positively.

praise the Government hugely for abolishing stamp duty on AIM and ISDX

Members from all parts of the House talk about the difficulties that
businesses have in raising loan finance. We all recognise that, but
that is only one of the two ways in which businesses can get money to
grow. The other is to get share capital. Every school knows that if it
has a good nursery underneath it, it will have a good supply of
children. Exactly the same is true of stock markets. If we can help our
small and growing companies, which provide so much job creation, to
raise share capital, which means that they do not have to pay back
money in a fixed period and can decide when to pay as well as the level
of dividends to pay, that is hugely helpful, so the change for AIM and
the junior ISDX market is incredibly important and very welcome.

Sunderland, but the Vauxhall Ampera is made in the United States. I
want electric vehicles and other ultra-low emission vehicles to be made

anyone in the House, including those on the Front Benches—that
the Government’s current predictions are based on December
figures from the Office for Budget Responsibility. We might think that
that is okay, but since May 2010 the OBR’s predictions have been
conspicuously inaccurate 
<?notus-xml column=1007?>and over-optimistic. If its predictions for the next two years are
equally inaccurate and over-optimistic, we are in real trouble. That
may not be the case, but if we look at the Library research papers,
most other independent commentators and assessors of our economic
position predict a lower rate of growth than the OBR. That is of
concern and underlines the Chancellor’s failure to put in place
measures to combat that issue.</hs_Para>

The Prime Minister went, with his entourage of business men, to China,
Brazil, India and so on to bang the drum for Britain—I am glad
he did so—and the Chancellor has announced the lowest rate of
corporation tax for companies investing in this country. However, those
things are no good if, at the same time, the Home Secretary—we
recognise that the Prime Minister has his problems with

That leads me to a debate that the Government should have but are not

also need more money to be spent on investment allowances rather than
on corporation tax. It bothers me that the Government believe almost as
an article of faith that a reduction in corporation tax will stimulate
inward investment, but they are not considering whether there is a
better way of spending that money on alternative ways of investing in
British companies. Manufacturers say that investment in R and D is a
much more attractive and economically beneficial way of stimulating the
investment we need in this country. A large amount of money will be
forgone with the reduction in corporation tax. Would that money not be
better spent by providing better investment allowances, which will
enable British companies to invest, employ and export more, and
generally to contribute to the economy? A lot of companies that invest
here do not pay much tax anyway, and those that might come could as
equally be attracted by an attractive investment allowance regime as a
reduction in corporation tax. So far, the evidence in favour of a
reduction in corporation tax is not strong, which is why we are not
seeing the level of investment that the Government had hoped
for.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032055000673" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/debtext/130320-0003.htm#13032055000673">Low-carbon

previous announcements in previous Budgets, particularly on company car
taxation and the write-off threshold, have caused confusion and
actually delayed investment in this area. I hope that in the Budget and

Cowdenbeath (Mr Brown), had the opportunity to have his way

Elphicke:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman is right about the 3G
licences, but the taps were then turned on and public spending rose. We
had a structural deficit and we were seriously exposed when the crisis
struck in 2008. We can see that from the statistics relating to the
previous Parliament. We inherited a structural deficit of
11.2%—an enormous level of borrowing. We inherited a massive
rise in unemployment, as measured by the claimant count—it went
up by 80%. Youth unemployment went up by 78% under the
jobseeker’s allowance claimant count. Those were staggering
rises and real concerns. It is all very well for the Labour party to
say that there is a continual problem with unemployment. It is, of
course, a concern to us all in our constituencies, but youth
unemployment has been coming down. Unemployment has stabilised and we
have not seen the rise that we saw under the previous
Government.</hs_Para>

jobs and 1 million new apprenticeships. The deficit is now down by a
third. Rather than the structural deficit of 11.2% that we inherited,
it is down to 7.4% of GDP today and moving in the right direction. We
have had record low borrowing costs. The Opposition’s idea that
we should borrow more to borrow less will take us one way and one way

will do more to make work pay, and education reforms, which will help
Britons get the skills they need to compete in the global race. The
Government are right to help those who want to work hard, get on and do
really well. We hear from Labour Members about the difficulties faced
by, and the squeeze on, many hard-working families, but they forget to
say that this is nothing new. According to the Office for National
Statistics’ family spending survey, disposable income in real
terms was £600 in 2000-01 and was £600 at the last
general election—it has not moved in real terms for about a
decade. The challenge is that families have been squeezed for quite
some time. The Labour party forgets that the economy was shielded by
the boom of borrowing and debt and that, as a result, those
difficulties were glossed over for too long.</hs_Para>

that the Government are now getting the house in order and doing more
to help hard-pressed families and households. For example, council tax
in Kent has been frozen for three years, whereas under Labour it
doubled; fuel duty is now 13p lower than Labour planned; and as a
result of the £10,000 personal allowance to be introduced next
year, many will pay £700 less tax than under Labour’s
plan, which will help average families and take 2.7 million out of tax
altogether. I also welcome the axing of the beer duty escalator and the
1% outright cut in beer duty. The Government have 
<?notus-xml column=1010?>got the right priorities and are moving in the right direction. Their

growth and jobs not from Government, but from the private sector,
enterprise and businesses. The Government have done the right thing in
giving an awful lot of help to small businesses, but I want us to go a
bit further. We have had the new employment allowance and the seed
investment allowance, but I would like us to consider a “get set
and grow” scheme, under which somebody could set up a new
business and have a two-year holiday from all company filings,
corporation tax and employers’ national insurance, light or no
employment law and other measures. That way, somebody setting up a
business could focus on running it, rather than on ticking boxes,
filling in forms and dealing with paperwork. That kind of change would

Creation as a Driver of Growth in a Global Economy” in 2004,
show that enterprise formation, growth and entrepreneurship are
strongly linked. I hope that the Chancellor and the Government will
look more closely at measures to make it easier to set up a business up
to a certain turnover threshold or certain period of time. As I said,
the new employment allowance and the massive national insurance
reduction for many businesses are a big step in the right direction,

welcome the measures to deal with tax avoidance. Too much corporation
tax avoidance has gone on for too long. It grew up over many years. Tax

I would like us to go further and see whether we can reduce corporation
tax still more by restricting tax reliefs, which would put our home
businesses and multinational businesses from overseas on a much
clearer, more level playing field. We should look at minimising
deductions for interest and royalties, along with other deductions that
are available in the tax system, and restricting transfer pricing. We
should also look at the rules on tax presence and whether there is a
branch or establishment in the UK, and say to companies such as Amazon,
“You’re not really abroad; you’re trading in the
UK and you should be taxed as such,” and the international rules
should be changed accordingly. That would be the right direction of
travel, because we would have an even lower rate of corporation tax
than we do today or than we plan to have, and a level playing field for
businesses at home and those from overseas.</hs_Para>

thing I want to say—this will surprise Opposition
Members—is how much I agreed with capital gains tax being at 10%
for businesses. That was a real spur to entrepreneurs and perhaps the
only policy of the former Prime Minister that I agreed with. I regret
that the rate has become 28%. We ought to look at how we can foster
entrepreneurship, so that entrepreneurs can not only set up businesses
and get them going, but sell them and get new businesses going. It is
the serial entrepreneurs who are the real wealth creators in this
country—the people who drive small businesses, job creation and
enterprise 
<?notus-xml column=1011?>creation. The more we can get the tax system to be their
friend—to be on their side and support them in what they
do—the more we will drive the economy forward and create more

Back in 2010, he told us that he would ensure macro-economic stability
by maintaining the UK’s triple A rating. Well, we all know what
happened to that, with Moody’s downgrading the
Government’s status last month. Back in 2010, he also told us
that he would rebalance the economy, creating the conditions for higher
exports. A quick look at the statistics shows exports falling in
monetary terms and the balance of trade deficit increasing as a
percentage of GDP. Quite clearly the UK’s trade with the rest of

Davies</B> (Swansea West) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> This is very much more
a fudge-it than a Budget. It is a fiscally neutral programme that just
takes money from the poorest and gives it to the squeezed middle in a
somewhat cynical way. It is part of the Tory journey to a weak and
divided Britain. This Budget does contain a few good things, such as
the mortgage deposits idea. I would probably support that, although we
need to build more houses as well as helping people to get mortgages. I
would also support an employment allowance. Apart from that, this
Budget falls within the general envelope of economic failure. The debt
to GDP ratio is set to rise from 55% in 2010 to 85% in 2015, and that
is why we have lost our triple A rating. The way to get rid of such a
debt to GDP ratio is to reduce the debt, which is what is happening,
with the poor being hit hardest, and/or to increase the GDP—the
growth. There has been a marked failure by this Tory Government to
generate any growth at all.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13032068000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/debtext/130320-0003.htm#13032068000009"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T18:01:23"></hs_TimeCode>In
sharp contrast, the Labour party had a great 10 years of
unprecedented growth between 1998 and 2008—GDP grew by 37%. It
is no wonder the debt to GDP ratio was falling. That was a fantastic
economic record of growth, but we then hit the 2008 financial sub-prime
debt tsunami from the United States. We ended up with a deficit, moving
into 2010, two thirds of which was from the bankers and a third of
which was from our pump-priming—investing more than we were
earning. Obama and the previous Labour Prime Minister provided the
fiscal stimulus, which avoided a world depression. We had a shallow
recession which was moving into fragile growth, but then the new
Chancellor came along and announced half a million job cuts, consumer
demand fell through the floor and we have had zero growth since. It has
been a complete catastrophe.</hs_Para>

Government say, “Oh, we have an extra million jobs”, yet
there is no overall production growth. That implies that productivity
per person has fallen. That is the great economic failure. Why is it
falling? It is because we are not investing sufficiently in skills and
productive capacity. If we ask any sensible business person, he or she
will tell us that to grow we have to invest—in skills, in
capacity, in products and in sales—rather than cutting
everything all the time. There is a difference between 
<?notus-xml column=1017?>borrowing to invest in productive capability and capacity, and borrowing
simply to fund more and more people on the dole, which is the old Tory
story. Debt is going up and it is the cost of failure, not the cost of
success. What we need is investment in skills, infrastructure and
housing—the Mayor of London mentioned
that.</hs_Para>

we look abroad at the great emerging economies that are hurtling
forward as we are bobbling along at the bottom, we see that Brazil is
investing $5.3 billion in biotech and renewable energy. We see a much
bigger amount coming from China’s development bank. That is
because China is bigger, but again this is patient money being rewarded
in economic growth and economic success. The case is the same for
public sector research and development in the United States. When we do
the analysis of where the global players will come, we find that they
will come to clusters of research and development and skills. I am glad
that the European Investment Bank is investing in a second campus in
Swansea to bring investment there. I hope that the Government will
invest in super-connectivity for Swansea, and a lot of businesses have
written to the Chancellor about
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T18:01:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032068000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/debtext/130320-0003.htm#13032068000012">What
certainly will not make a difference is changing the rate of
corporation tax from 21% to 20%. That simply takes out 5% of the income
from corporation tax. If, as has been said, the United States has a
40% rate, Germany’s is 29% and France’s is
33%, we already have a competitive advantage. This move is just giving
away money when it should be invested in focused research and
development capacity that might get international capital and jobs to
migrate here. This approach is completely farcical. That deals with the
economy.</hs_Para>

society and fairness, we are just punishing the poor for the
bankers’ errors. As a result, cuts are hitting the poorest

and the Work programme: 890,000 people have been forced to pretend to
work, and if they do not turn up because their child is ill they are
sanctioned, they do not receive any income for weeks on end, and they
end up at a food bank. That is the direction of travel: punishing the
poor hardest for being poor.</hs_Para>

bedroom tax is not going to work. In Swansea, they are already thinking
about knocking down walls so that people are not decanted into the
private sector, which costs more, leaving empty public sector houses.
It makes no moral or economic sense. We do not seem to care about the
poorest, given the situation regarding child poverty and the knock-on
effect in schools, crime and so on. The Government are going to pay
tenants who must pay their housing benefit directly to landlords. There
is little money so it will mean arrears. We are asking people to access
universal credit online, when a quarter of people are functionally
illiterate. They cannot even follow the “Yellow Pages”,
so they will not be able to get their money. Two thirds of people
subject to the bedroom tax are disabled, so the measure is cruel,
callous and unthinking.</hs_Para>

know that the poorest spend most and are more likely to create growth,
so that leads to a difficult situation. We all welcome the fact that
the tax threshold has been increased to £10,000, which will give
people £13.70 a week, which is about the same as the £14
that people subject to the bedroom tax will lose as a result of

anything.</hs_Para>

year, which is why the Prime Minister gets up on his hind legs and
tells us, “A 50p tax would raise less”, as he knows that
his millionaire mates will move their income into the next tax year.
What is most despicable is the fact that this cynical divide and rule
between workers and shirkers, between strivers and skivers—the
undeserving poor, Victorian values, the workhouse—is the new
Tory party in action, not delivering a future that works and cares but
a future that does not work and does not care: a divided and weak

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T18:07:26"></hs_TimeCode> speech by

expect from the Labour party. I would simply say that the Labour
party’s determination to oppose the extra room subsidy paid by
the housing benefit system shows that it is determined to
make sure that there should be no reform of the welfare budget

expenditure on welfare, which takes up over a third of Government

the Member for Banbury (Sir Tony Baldry), who has just left the
Chamber, that I am happy to commend the Chancellor’s Budget
statement. He had incredibly little flexibility at his disposal, but
the Budget contains a number of really imaginative measures,
particularly the supply side reforms that always help to stimulate
economic growth. In whatever economy they are tried, such measures
prove to be effective. The reduction in corporation tax is another step
in the right direction; the abolition of employers’ national
insurance for small employers is a huge step in the right direction;
and the limitation on capital gains tax for business is a very good
step in the right direction.</hs_Para>

much welcome the substantial implementation of the Heseltine review.
The Select Committee on Public Administration, which I chair, took
evidence from Lord Heseltine, who gave a very good account of many of
the things that could and should be done to make the use of public
money much more effective away from London, as well as championing
things like swifter decisions on infrastructure, such as airport
capacity. I commend the review, and I hope yet that the Government will
speed up the decision about airport capacity, which is so vital for the

not to be diverted by

Government to start borrowing more money and spending more money, as
though that was a painless way of reviving the economy. It is
extraordinary that we have to go back to the lessons that we thought
the Labour party had learnt in the 1980s—that we cannot spend
our way out of trouble. It has forgotten all the lessons that made it

question that hangs over the Budget is whether we believe the growth
forecast. Hitherto, we have been disappointed, and that is because
energy costs are so high; it is because of excessive banking regulation
pouring out of the EU on to the City of London, which happens to be our
biggest export earner and our biggest generator of tax revenue; it is
because the banks are not lending because the Government have increased
the capital ratios for banks when they should perhaps have been
reducing them; it is because quantitative easing might make bank
lending cheap for the Government, but it does not necessarily make it
easier for the banks to rebuild their balances; and it is because of
the burden of high taxation.</hs_Para>

necessary to accelerate the spending reductions, the reductions in

infrastructure investment that is so necessary to get the economy to
grow. If we find ourselves once again set back by economic forecasts
that have not been delivered, we will have to begin to ask
ourselves not how we just let ourselves off the lead and
start spending money that we have not got and borrowing even more money
that we cannot afford to borrow, placing the burden on

remind the House that it is not just that the Government inherited a
very difficult situation. I commend chart 1.8 on page 21 of the Red
Book. At the peak of the economic cycle in 2007, the structural deficit
was more than 5%. As soon as the economy went into reverse after the
crash, it quickly became apparent that the previous Government had
vastly overextended themselves and had vastly increased public
expenditure beyond what we could afford, so that public expenditure
peaked at over 50% of GDP, the previous Government having inherited
public spending at below 40% of GDP. It was that expenditure that was
unfunded, even at the peak of the economic cycle, which is why we now
face such a dire economic situation. I commend the Chancellor of the

third really important issue, and the one I want to talk about most, is
the supply side, which is so important to the prospects of the real
economy. First, however, let me welcome the reduction in beer duty, the
increase in the personal tax allowance to £10,000, and the
measures to encourage people to buy their own houses. All those things
are part of the aspiration that I mentioned.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13032068000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/debtext/130320-0003.htm#13032068000066"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T18:40:00"></hs_TimeCode>On
the supply-side argument, there is a test: we have a lot of problems,
but does the Budget help those problems and come up with solutions to
make them less significant, or even turn them into
solutions? Our first problem is that we are not exporting
enough. We have exported a large number of cars and produced
1.5 million of them, yet only 30% of those cars are
constructed in Britain—they are assembled here, but their parts
are often imported. My first question is whether the Budget will
improve the supply chain by ensuring that it is more localised and
therefore forms a greater part of the economic growth needed by the
economy. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T18:40:51"></hs_TimeCode>I think
the answer to that is yes, because measures such as the
business bank and so on add up to appropriate support for small and
medium-sized enterprises.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13032068000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/debtext/130320-0003.htm#13032068000067"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T18:41:06"></hs_TimeCode>My
second question is about credit—tooling-up for new projects is
an expensive activity, especially for SMEs that need to get their hands
on appropriate money. High street banks are not always the best place
for that, and I like the idea that the business bank will effectively
reinforce and assist new forms of investment in SMEs from private and
innovative areas. That will give a huge boost to an SME’s
ability to get the investment necessary to develop its products. The
answer to my second question is yes.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13032068000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/debtext/130320-0003.htm#13032068000068"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T18:41:50"></hs_TimeCode>We
also have a problem with regional underperformance. That is a
significant issue for Britain and Lord Heseltine’s report
focuses on it well. His idea for local enterprise 
<?notus-xml column=1027?>partnerships to have core funding is powerful and will mean that they
can really focus on areas that are of interest to them and which they
know about. I think we will be seeing much more forensic activity at
that level, and around our cities and other areas where there are local
enterprise partnerships. In Bristol, which is near Gloucestershire, or
even in Gloucestershire itself, I can see how that would be useful.
Such a measure is a recognition of regional underperformance, so again
the answer is yes, the Budget actually
helps.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13032068000069" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/debtext/130320-0003.htm#13032068000069"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T18:42:50"></hs_TimeCode>Another
area of concern is the profile of SMEs, which I have been thinking
about for a long time. We have a large number of SMEs, many of which
are extraordinarily small. They perform an important role in innovating
and inventing but do not always have the critical mass to tackle large
supply-chain issues. We must encourage smaller firms to become bigger
ones. Does the Budget help with that? Yes, I think it does. Changes to
corporation tax and basically having one rate may, I think, encourage
small firms that in the past have seen the advantage of using two
different forms of corporation tax to come together.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T18:43:37"></hs_TimeCode>Other reasons
why firms might enlarge or unify include the industrial strategy, which
is already part of our overall plans to boost aerospace. I would like
to see that move into the automotive sector, which needs the same sort
of treatment.</hs_Para>

final point that bothers me is that, although we have already found
jobs for one and a quarter million people in the private
sector—a fantastic achievement—our productivity has not
increased by as much as we had hoped. The Bank of England’s
report on inflation from February 2013 makes that point well. We must
worry about how to improve the skills available to our work
force—those already working and those who are going to start
working—so that we get that extra boost to productivity. The
Budget does good things in that respect. For example, it introduces the
Technology Strategy Board and boosts sector councils. Both measures,
and the Government’s strident determination to improve skills in
our colleges and schools, are
excellent.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032068000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/debtext/130320-0003.htm#13032068000071">Lord
Heseltine was right to recommend that the Government make a huge effort
to ensure that we have high standards and good quality courses that
demand academic achievement in our colleges. That is what will
encourage people to do the work and decrease the productivity gap,
which has plagued our economy for too
long.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032068000072" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/debtext/130320-0003.htm#13032068000072">In

not ensure that money is available in the first few years of any new

Reynolds</B> (Wolverhampton North East) (Lab):</Member> It is an honour
and pleasure to follow
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T18:53:07"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Kingston upon Hull North (Diana Johnson). I want to
start my speech by welcoming one element of the Budget, but then I want
to set out why I think it fails three key tests of economic competence,
fairness and equality. Let me start with the positives.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13032068000088" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/debtext/130320-0003.htm#13032068000088"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T18:53:22"></hs_TimeCode>As
the chair of the all-party group on aerospace, I welcome the
announcement made earlier this week, and in the Budget today, that the
Government, alongside industry, are creating the aerospace technology
institute, which will support investment in vital areas of R and D.
Aerospace is a long-term industry, and it takes 15 years to develop a
product. It is crucial that long-term sustained investment and
cross-party support is in place, so I welcome today’s
announcement. Another important factor for the industry is our
continued membership of 
<?notus-xml column=1030?>the European Union. If the UK were to leave the EU, it would be
disastrous for the aerospace industry, and many other industries
throughout the country.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13032068000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/debtext/130320-0003.htm#13032068000089"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T18:54:08"></hs_TimeCode>In
addition to the aerospace cluster in Wolverhampton, there is another
chink of light and optimism on which I want to comment. Jaguar Land
Rover has already committed to substantial investment on the edge of
Wolverhampton and has just announced that it will almost double that
investment, which is a real shot in the arm for the city and will
create 1,400 jobs directly and many more in the supply chain and wider
economy. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T18:54:41"></hs_TimeCode>That
demonstrates the strategic foresight of the regional policy and the
regional development policy during our time in government. Had it not
been for Advantage West Midlands investing in and decontaminating that
site and designating it as a strategic investment site, the Jaguar Land
Rover investment, and the many other investments in that site, would
not be benefiting constituents in the city.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13032068000090" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/debtext/130320-0003.htm#13032068000090"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T18:55:06"></hs_TimeCode>That
said, however, I remain deeply concerned about the local economy in
Wolverhampton. The Government’s economic policies fail three key
tests. Will they kick-start the economy? Will those with the broadest
shoulders bear the greatest burden? Will their economic policies lead
to a more equal society? First, it is clear to me and many millions of
people that the Government are failing the test of economic competence.
They destroyed consumer and business confidence, sucked demand out of
the economy and failed to tackle the crisis in living standards. I
welcome some of the announcements—for example, on the
cancellation of the beer duty escalator and the fuel duty—but
this is simply too little, too late.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13032068000091" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/debtext/130320-0003.htm#13032068000091"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T18:56:00"></hs_TimeCode>Inflation
is high and rising, wages are falling in real terms and, as a result,
firms do not have the confidence to invest and are sitting on big
surpluses. There is no growth, very little investment and exports are
disappointing. I know that Government Members moan about the eurozone,
but France and Germany are outperforming our economy. In the past two
years, Germany’s has grown by 3.6% and France’s by 1.5%.
The Government have choked off the recovery, the economy is stuck in a
rut and the Government seem powerless to do anything about it.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T18:56:39"></hs_TimeCode>This bizarre
notion of expansionary fiscal contraction has not worked. They need to
think again, but unfortunately they are not.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13032068000092" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/debtext/130320-0003.htm#13032068000092"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T18:56:52"></hs_TimeCode>The
changes to take place in 11 days demonstrate that the Budget will fail
the fairness test. Some of the poorest people in Wolverhampton, many of
whom want to move to smaller council properties, will lose, on average,
£728 a year. The Government have ignored the fact that there is
very little alternative accommodation available and that the ties
people have to their local communities are incredibly important. Many
other changes will entrench the inequalities not only in Wolverhampton,
but in the rest of the country. In Wolverhampton, for every mile
someone travels from the west of the city to the east, they lose a year
in life expectancy. The difference between the poorest street in my
constituency and the richest street in the country is incredibly stark,
but the gap will only get
wider<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T18:58:04"></hs_TimeCode>, because
the Government were incredibly arrogant in last year’s Budget in
cutting taxes for the richest people in the country, essentially giving
13,000 millionaires a 100% tax cut.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13032068000093" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/debtext/130320-0003.htm#13032068000093"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T18:58:17"></hs_TimeCode>The
third test is of inequality. It is not just that deepening inequality
is a bad thing in and of itself—one reason I came into politics
was that I wanted to live in a 
<?notus-xml column=1031?>more equal society—but Richard Wilkinson has compellingly argued
that unequal societies also perform worse than more equal societies on
many other fronts. For example, they have better life expectancies,
less childhood obesity and lower crime levels. For that reason, the
Government’s economic policies are bad not only in respect of
unequal outcomes, but for the quality of life of everyone in the
country and for our future.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13032068000094" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/debtext/130320-0003.htm#13032068000094"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T18:59:12"></hs_TimeCode>I
regret to say that the Government’s economic policies fail the
tests of economic competence—more of the same simply will not
work—of fairness and of whether they will create a better and
less unequal society. I am very disappointed with the Budget.</hs_Para>

thanking Mr Speaker for allowing this debate on justice for the Tamil
people. I would also like to say in the first instance, on my own
behalf, but also, I am sure, on behalf of many hon. Friends, that we
are sorry, because what we are talking about is trying to get justice
for innocent victims who lost their lives—who were raped, who
were murdered, who were imprisoned. We cannot bring those lives back,
but we can try to get justice.</hs_Para>

is now four years since the end of the conflict in 2009, yet I and
others believe that there has been no real accountability or mechanism
for achieving it, and no meaningful settlements have been put in place.
We need to look at the root cause of the conflict in Sri Lanka, in
memory of those who lost their lives and for the sake of the children
who lost their parents and of the people who even today have not been
accounted for. I want to ask the Minister a number of questions on that
point. I accept that he will not be in a position to answer some of
them, but I want to put them on record none the less.</hs_Para>

the end of the conflict, many babies and young children disappeared. I
fear that I know what happened to them, but their relatives in the
diaspora and in Sri Lanka deserve some answers. I have asked the high
commission for those answers, and the Minister might be interested to
know that it contacted me yesterday, after many months, asking to meet
me. I would be happy to do that, as long as it will answer the
questions that I and Members in all parts of the House have been asking
for many years. We want meaningful answers and we want
justice.</hs_Para>

I and Members of all parties in the House raised the matter with the
Government of the day when it was happening, we should all, alas, hang
our heads in shame that nothing was done to try to stop the loss of
life. Now the United Nations has admitted that it let people down, and

happening.</hs_Para>

numbers are cited, but we are talking about tens of thousands of

cannot comprehend innocent women and children being taken out and shot.
I cannot comprehend it because it is just not in our psyche; it is not
how we would behave and we are not used to seeing others behave in that
way. I cannot comprehend the fact that decades after the liberation of
the camps following the holocaust, women and children would again be
sent to camps. And God forbid that I ever should be able to comprehend
it.</hs_Para>

innocent people were also on people’s mobile phones. Those

that there would have been some accountability by now, but I fear that
the Government of Sri Lanka are trying to fudge the issue. They appear
to be saying, “It’s not me, guv.” Over the
decades, we have heard people saying that they were only obeying
orders. We all know what that is an echo of, and it is

so emotional that I do not want to read out a prepared speech. As I
said, our minds cannot comprehend some of the atrocities that took
place. I keep on talking about justice, and I keep on talking about
accountability because those are the necessities of what must be
brought forward. To achieve that, I know there is a motion going
forward at the United Nations in Geneva, either as we speak or
tomorrow. I would like to see that motion made stronger. I know that it
is not a motion being put by the Government of Britain. I have every

Hughes</B> (Bermondsey and Old Southwark) (LD):</Member> I thank the
hon. Gentleman for initiating further debate on this important subject.
Does he agree that the difference between the responsibility of
Governments and that of others who are not in government is that
Governments take on a responsibility to honour their national and
international obligations by virtue of being elected to their posts?
Although it is clear that there were abuses of power on both sides in
what was effectively a civil war in Sri Lanka and that both sides
should be held to account, when it comes to the rights of the future
citizens in Sri Lanka, it is the Government who ultimately have to
answer for their responsibilities—both in their own interests
and those of everybody

Scott:</Member></B> My right hon. Friend is totally correct. There is a
responsibility on any country that calls itself a democracy or on any
country that has elected officials to honour international law and the
law of their own country and to address these concerns, which my hon.

interest you to know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that because I have spoken up
for justice on this matter, I have been accused on some websites of
being “a white tiger”. That is interesting because anyone
who knows me knows that I am by nature a coward—it has never let
me down—so that is not one of the many things of which I can be
accused. Equally, I would find it difficult to fulfil that role because
I have never set foot in Sri Lanka; I have fought for the rights of the
Tamil people from outside. I have been asked why I have not been to Sri
Lanka. Until such time as I would be allowed to visit where I wish to
visit, see what I want to see in any area, unfettered and unhindered,
there would be no point in my going. I do not want to go on a
Government-sponsored trip to see what they want me to see; I want to

me make it as clear as possible that I condemn any acts of terrorism by
anybody. However, in looking for justice and reconciliation and looking
at the list that the United Nations—again, not me—has
provided, it needs to be said that it is very hard to get justice when
people are already dead. We have seen on television footage of what the
Government of the day did and we have seen clear-cut evidence taken on
mobile phones, including by the troops. This evidence is not phoney; it

leads to people who have committed atrocities on either side of the
conflict brought to justice. Given how the conflict ended, however, it
seems highly possible that people in positions of power in Sri Lanka
today were involved, so if anyone is to have confidence in the

brought to

Scott:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right and we continue
to raise those points. In 12 months’ time, I do not want to be
having the same debate in the same Chamber about the same tragedy of
innocent people being killed. I want the journey along the road to
reconciliation, the road the justice, to begin. If that is to happen,
however, various issues need to be

could read out a long list of all the matters that need to be
investigated, but I am not asking the British Government—my
Government—to investigate those matters. I am asking for an
international investigation. I do not believe that there is any chance
that the Sri Lankan Government will investigate themselves, and I have
great fears about that, because I think that there will be a fudge. If,
as the Sri Lankan Government have said, they are not guilty of
anything, they have nothing to fear from an international
investigation, because that will be its finding. I was told
that they would not want Britain to be involved in such an
investigation, but there is no need for Britain to be involved. There
are many countries in the world that could conduct the investigation;
it does not need to be conducted by Great
Britain.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032068000125" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/debtext/130320-0004.htm#13032068000125">I
will end my speech shortly, because I want to give the Minister an
opportunity to respond to some of the questions that I have raised, but
let me first make a few requests. If the United Nations motion could be
stiffened— 
<?notus-xml column=1036?>and it may be too late—it would send a clear message to the Sri
Lankan Government, which would be extremely helpful. I also think that
we should think very seriously about our attendance at the Commonwealth

most important point is that, for the sake of the thousands and
thousands of women, men and children who have lost their lives, we
cannot just stand by and do nothing. I know that we have tried to do
something, and I know that the Minister cares passionately about this.
I am merely asking whether we can go that little bit further, in order
to secure justice for people who are no longer alive to secure justice
for themselves. That, surely, is the duty of this

His tireless work to raise the profile of human rights issues in Sri
Lanka and to seek accountability for events that took place during the
war is well known to the House. His speech demonstrated his passion and
commitment to the cause. I do not know what his definition of a coward

visited Sri Lanka last month, I am grateful for the opportunity to
update the House, and to hear Members’ views about a country
with which the United Kingdom has long-standing and deep ties. Our
relations have been cemented through trade, tourism and education, as
well as through the diaspora community in the UK. We value those links,
which reflect the strong bond that our countries continue to enjoy. I
am sometimes asked why the United Kingdom is so interested in Sri
Lanka, and why the issue arises time and again. I think that the reason
is a combination of that background of relationships and the real pain
that we all feel—the sense that following the tragedy that was
this conflict, everyone in Sri Lanka deserves something rather better
to look forward to. There are so many unanswered questions; we just
feel that more could be
done.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032068000129" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/debtext/130320-0004.htm#13032068000129">The
United Kingdom’s long-term interest is in a stable, peaceful Sri
Lanka, free from the scourge of terrorism, where the human rights of
all Sri Lankans are protected, but as the House is well aware in a
different context, certain things need to happen to enable a country to
rebuild itself after a tragedy. That is one of the reasons why we feel
so much for Sri Lanka, and why we talk in the way that we do about the
opportunities that exist. There must be a balance; there are issues to
be considered on all
sides.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032068000130" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/debtext/130320-0004.htm#13032068000130">As
my hon. Friend observed, the debate comes at an important moment. Later
this week, the UN Human Rights Council will consider a motion on the
human rights situation in Sri Lanka. As my noble Friend Baroness Warsi
made clear in her statement to the high-level segment of the Human
Rights Council, the United Kingdom supports the motion. Let me reply to
my hon. Friend’s query by saying that all international
resolutions of this kind are composites, and are put together in a
manner designed to create the greatest possible support for them. That
sometimes means a 
<?notus-xml column=1037?>degree of compromise on language. The United Kingdom felt that the most
important thing was that the demonstration of a significant number of
countries with concern about Sri Lanka was better than having a motion
that some might have felt unable to support. We wanted to give a clear
indication, as we gave last year, of the importance of these issues to
many nations, which is why the resolution is drafted in the terms it
is. We think it is still firm and

Government, having won a brutal war, are not winning the peace. There
should be no doubt about the fact that it was a brutal war and about
the importance of defeating terrorism, but the brutality of the
terrorism of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam is not sufficient, in

I have previously made clear to the House, progress has been made in
Sri Lanka in a number of areas—it is still important to say
this—including de-mining, the reintegration of child soldiers
and the resettlement of an increasing number of internally displaced
persons. Considerable investment has also been made in infrastructure,
as I saw during my visit in January. However, as the resolution
highlights, progress is lacking in other areas fundamental to the

hon. Members are aware, the Sri Lankan Government took steps to address
the root causes of conflict by establishing a Lessons Learnt and
Reconciliation Commission, which reported in 2011. Despite gaps on
accountability, the recommendations of the LLRC were, contrary to some
opinion that had been expressed beforehand, constructive and
far-reaching. Regrettably, however, the July 2012 plan of action for
LLRC implementation covers only about half the recommendations, and for
many the actions were scheduled to begin only in
2013.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032068000134" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/debtext/130320-0004.htm#13032068000134">I
have repeatedly encouraged the Sri Lankan Government to implement all
the recommendations, making it clear that the real test of the
LLRC’s recommendations is in their implementation. I stress that
these concerns and commitments made from outside Sri Lanka are
absolutely based on the desires of Sri Lankans themselves, as their
Government have expressed, to give effect to reconciliation and the
pathway to it. All people from outside who are concerned about the
future of Sri Lanka are asking for is that the Sri Lankan Government
implement the things they have said are necessary to be brought forward
if true reconciliation is to be achieved among all the people. The
Foreign Secretary was assured in a letter from Foreign Minister G.L.
Peiris just last week that all the LLRC recommendations will be
implemented. I warmly welcome that assurance, but we urge the Sri
Lankan Government to ensure swift implementation of all the
recommendations. Many, such as that for a national day of remembrance
for all those who died in the war, can be implemented relatively easily

short, it can only be helpful if members of the diaspora in the UK are
clear about their desire to be engaged in the Sri Lanka of today and to
work for the future of Sri Lanka, as well as about concerns about
accountability and issues in the past. There are strong and deep
feelings on both sides. I cannot see, given my knowledge of everyone
involved, that everyone is going to come together on this, but it is
true that elements in the diaspora community in the UK do want to be
engaged in that work and that is very important. There needs to be an
open door on both sides to try to engineer something that will be of

United Kingdom’s calls for the swift implementation of the LLRC
recommendations are not unrealistic. The UK has never suggested or
expected that reconciliation after sustained armed conflict would be
instant. We realise that the LLRC recommendations cannot all be
implemented immediately and that a credible process of accountability
takes time. However, to make progress in the long term there needs to
be a sense of urgency and a positive trajectory. This is particularly
the case in areas that require agreement between various parties,
changes to legislation and negotiated solutions to complicated issues
such as land rights. From our own experience of reconciliation in
Northern Ireland, we know well that these processes are complex and
require a long-term approach, tenacity, co-operation and, if I may say
so, political leadership.</hs_Para>

widens the circle of those affected. At present, our view is that a
number of key LLRC recommendations have not been tackled at all, or
have been tackled in name only. First, the military presence in many
areas may be less invasive than at the end of the conflict, but armed
forces continue to occupy significant areas of civilian land, which are
now classified as high-security zones or military cantonments.
Secondly, military involvement in civil and commercial activities has
reduced in some areas, but involvement in reconstruction work, and in
the wider economy, including the tourism sector, remains widespread and
a source of
tension<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T19:25:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032068000139" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/debtext/130320-0004.htm#13032068000139">When
I was in Sri Lanka, in the northern area, it was noted that I was not
alone. I was accompanied not only by UK officials and officials from
the high commission, but by a significant military presence, some
uniformed and some non-uniformed. It is not uncommon for a Minister
visiting someone else’s country to be protected and supported by
the military in those areas, and I raise no issue about that. I felt
safe, and it was only appropriate for the Government to do that.
However, the extent of military involvement was noticed by others, who
were keen to pick out the non-uniformed individuals who were there,
which raises a significant matter.</hs_Para>

observation is that military intrusion in the north is significant.
There are too many stories of people in the area who, if they speak to
non-governmental organisations or western journalists, are immediately
interrogated by non-uniformed military personnel, and an oppressive
sense of intrusion was reported by those who were able to report it.
People commented on my 
<?notus-xml column=1039?>visit and said how foolish I was. They said, “Don’t you
know that no one will be able to speak to you honestly?” Trust
me, Mr Deputy Speaker, I knew that full well, and I made no judgment in
relation to what was said to me. However, my going on that visit, on
which people could see how I was treated, made, I think, its own point,
and I would ask that in future perhaps there would not be quite as much
intrusion. That is something that needs to be recognised in the

detained. Finally, there has not been, even as we see new footage that

area not adequately covered by the LLRC is justice, or accountability,

Sri Lanka earlier today, all Sri Lankans deserve access to fair and
transparent justice, yet for many Sri Lankans, Sinhala and Muslim as
well as Tamil, the military defeat of the Tamil Tigers in 2009 has not
been followed by an accounting for the events that they experienced
during the war. The independent, thorough and credible investigations

Joyce</B> (Falkirk) (Ind):</Member> It is difficult to overstate the
importance of Kenya to the United Kingdom and, indeed,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T09:30:00"></hs_TimeCode> wider
international community. Perhaps first and foremost, Kenya is at the
centre of international efforts to ensure the security of our own
citizens. Citizens of Kenya have played a high price for that role and
for their pivotal location in the world in recent years, from the US
embassy bombing in 1998 through to the al-Shabaab attacks of last year,
yet that is rarely reflected in public discourse here in the
UK.</hs_Para>

is not necessary to go into detail about the way in which Kenya has
co-operated magnificently with her allies, because a good deal of that
information is public. However, much of it, by necessity, is unknown by
those who are not directly involved.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T09:30:58"></hs_TimeCode>What is a matter
of considerable public knowledge is Kenya’s leadership role in
stabilising its northern neighbour, Somalia. Authorities, from the UN
Secretary-General to the leaders of all the major states involved, have
officially recognised that Somalia is where it is today—fragile
but, I hope, on the road to recovery—because of the efforts of
Kenya’s servicemen and women in defeating al-Shabaab and
securing Mogadishu. What is more, Kenya has done that while showing
restraint and ensuring the appropriate UN and African Union mandates
are complied with, such as by re-hatting Kenyan troops as African Union
Mission in Somalia—AMISOM—troops.</hs_Para>

role extends well beyond military action, too. Virtually all
humanitarian efforts in Somalia are mounted from Kenya, and they have
saved the lives of hundreds of thousands of Somalis. Experts are in
universal agreement that Kenya has deployed only appropriate force to
assure its territorial integrity and that it has gone far above and
beyond the call of national duty to help developed nations, such as the
UK, to secure the safety of their citizens—here in the UK and
abroad.</hs_Para>

who has served in the British Army knows, like many others, how
important Kenya has always been to our military capacity. The
unrivalled training facilities that Kenya has always provided so freely
have been a fundamental component of the UK’s capacity to launch
military operations, including, for example, in our defence of the
Falkland Islands just over 30 years ago. Many British servicemen
regarded Kenya as the reason why we were able to mount that operation,
given the personal and unit training capacity. Anyone who goes on the
British Army’s website will read about the UK’s
continuing reliance on, and gratitude for, Kenyan facilities, notably
in respect of Operation Herrick in Afghanistan, but also in respect of
British Army operations around the world.</hs_Para>

military and security considerations, I have recently spoken to private

act together to build much needed infrastructure and services,
following even the direst of civil collapses. That has been made
possibly by Kenya, first and foremost. It will be some time before we

reconstruction, but when it is, we will have Kenya to thank for
that.</hs_Para>

in Kenya are also fundamental to investment throughout the region. I
have visited Africa many times over the past dozen years, and virtually
every time, I have travelled through Nairobi. It is a simple fact that
Kenya is Africa’s pre-eminent junction for flows of trade and
investment, people and, inevitably, information. From a trade and
investment perspective, Kenya has many buoyant businesses, and it is
the world leader in mobile payment systems. The Minister will be well
aware of the UK’s early role in facilitating M-PESA. Off the top
of my head, I believe that the former Commonwealth Development
Corporation—now the CDC—was involved in seedcorning that
project in Kenya.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13032048000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/halltext/130320h0001.htm#13032048000014">M-PESA is a
payment system that utilises the Safaricom network and harnesses
microfinancing principles to deliver a superfast and highly effective
means of bill payment. It has been so successful that conventional
banking institutions have made significant efforts to become involved,
through the Government, in the regulation of such systems. That is
because mobile platform providers such as Safaricom enjoy confidence
among local consumers at a higher level than that for the banks.
Although Kenya, unlike many African states, has a relatively mature
local banking system, I understand that almost 20 million
Kenyans—it has population of just over  41
million—have M-PESA accounts. That enables them to make payments
and transfer cash. It involves trading in what we would view as
relatively small amounts, but those amounts fit the size of the
domestic markets that small traders are
accessing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T09:35:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032048000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/halltext/130320h0001.htm#13032048000015">M-PESA
has also been successfully extended into Tanzania. One of the critical
aspects of the system is that in Kenya, and across Africa, the mobile
infrastructure is developed, but fixed-line infrastructure is
undeveloped, so services are jumping ahead. In the UK, we are looking
at 4G and considering how we might be able to access new services
through mobile platforms, but people in Africa really have no choice.
The sophistication of mobile platforms such as M-PESA is remarkable,
and in that way Kenya leads the

15 or 16 months ago, I attended the Internet Governance Forum in

said that Kenya is a junction for people and information within Africa.
I know people who arrange to meet African colleagues and potential
clients from across the continent in Kenya. I know people who go on
holiday there, and I also know people who, a few days ago, helped to
secure the release of 25 mariners from the Somali pirates who were
holding them hostage. Of course, the UK Government are wary of that
detail, but I will say a word or two about it, because it is pertinent
to Kenya. The whole business of security in relation to 
<?notus-xml column=265?>piracy off Somalia involves significant reliance on Kenya, and such
security is another area of activity that has saved the lives of many
people.</hs_Para>

the consequences of—if I can call it this—non-terrorism
related piracy. I know that we might call all Somali piracy terrorism,
but there is a clear distinction in my mind, because while it is all
done for money, some people are highly motivated by simply the
commercial gains, whereas others, such as al-Shabaab, are motivated by
what they can spend the money on. Nevertheless, piracy continues, and
Kenya helps to do everything that it can to help to fix the problem at
the macro level and, more significantly, in very practical ways that,
for good reason, are rarely discussed.</hs_Para>

should say, perhaps as a side note, that while it is in vogue for some
non-governmental organisations to say that they do not negotiate with
hostage takers, responsible employers ensure that their employees are
properly insured in case they are taken captive, particularly in
dangerous areas of the world. That insurance is almost invariably taken
out on the London markets, and the unsung people who get on with
negotiating and sorting immediate crises are almost invariably British.
Indeed, the overwhelming majority of people and companies involved in
ship security for anti-piracy work off Somalia are British. Britain has
an enormously important role to play, and Kenya sits at the core of
things, because during an arrest operation, pirates are often taken to
Kenya and then the Kenyan justice system endeavours to deal with the
situation, which is clearly a contentious issue in itself. The Kenyan
Government have handled things responsibly, and there is clearly a
close relationship between the various navies of the developed nations
and the Kenyan Government, because invariably such people could end
up—and in some cases do end up—on trial in
Mombasa.</hs_Para>

stressed some aspects of our crucial mutual relationship with Kenya, I
would like to move on to recent events regarding the Kenyan
presidential election and the International Criminal Court. Media
reports are still reporting the result of the Kenyan presidential
election as “razor-thin”. In fact, President-elect Uhuru
Kenyatta won by almost seven points on an 86% turnout in an election
that was regarded by observers as fair and free, and was, thank God,

the election, there was a perception in Kenya that the UK and US
Governments, as well as some others, were not wholly impartial. It was
said that UK diplomats had sought to encourage an Odinga win and that
they had made comments during the tallying process that had seemed to
work towards enabling a second-round run-off, which might have
disbenefited Kenyatta, the first-round winner. I have scoured all the
sources I can—as you know, Mr Bone, our resources in this place
are very good for scouring the international media—and I also
have many contacts and friends in the media across the world and in
theatre in Kenya, but I can find no source whatsoever that serves as
reasonable evidence of such a public bias. I could find no
example  
<?notus-xml column=266?>whatever of a public comment by a UK diplomat or Minister anywhere. We

wrong context, and whether it is accurate or not, it did, in itself,
have consequences. As I think the Minister will know, the quote was
taken by some in Kenya as an implied threat that if Kenya did not vote

present on the ground during the election period on this occasion, and
of course I do not claim the expert knowledge of our diplomats and
Ministers. However, I think that it is fair to say that there was a
strong perception in Kenya that powerful nations were threatening
Kenyans against voting for Kenyatta, who is now the President-elect,
but that made them more likely to do just that—why would it
not<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T09:41:52"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032048000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/halltext/130320h0001.htm#13032048000024">Going
into the election, analysts were suggesting that Prime Minister Odinga
perhaps had a two or three-point lead. I was never particularly
convinced of that, and such a lead would be more or less within the
margin of error in any case, but the vote was clearly very tight.
However, I believe that a significant element of Mr
Kenyatta’s margin of victory came in the form of a statement by
Kenyans that if they were required to choose between sovereign
self-determination and the patronage of foreign powers, they would
always choose the former. It seems to me that it would be best if
Kenyans did not feel—whether there is any foundation to this or
not—that they needed to make that choice ever

that the Minister will wish to be measured and careful with his words
on that subject, as he is with all his words. Although it is essential
that we respect the processes of the ICC—Kenya is doing
precisely that at the moment, as are the President-elect and Deputy
President-elect—it is important to understand the political
nature of the ICC. I am aware that the UK and other international
Governments are seized of the situation’s trickiness, to say the

years ago, I had the privilege of spending several hours discussing the
nature and processes of the ICC with its then chief prosecutor, Luis
Moreno Ocampo. He was incredibly generous with his time, and I left his
office with a far greater understanding of, and much more good will
towards, the ICC than I had had when I entered it. My concern was that
although the role of the ICC is of great importance and its writ runs
across the world—a country does not need to have signed up to
and ratified the ICC, in the admittedly unlikely event that it is
referred to it by a full member of the UN Security
Council—everyone who had been indicted was African. All 30
people who have been indicted to date are African. At the time, the
number was a little less  
<?notus-xml column=267?>than that—perhaps 15 or 20. However, the fact remains that all
31—I shall come to the one shortly—who have been indicted

I went to see Luis Moreno Ocampo, I was unsure of the sense of
indicting a Head of State, in the form of President Bashir of Sudan,
and I had doubt about the case of Jean-Pierre Bemba of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, who was indicted over allegations regarding
incidents in the Central African Republic. However, I was struck by the
fact that to the untrained eye, to put it mildly, the ICC was keeping
away from countries that might have implications for powerful nations
such as China, Russia, the United States and ourselves, and focusing
all its efforts on less powerful African states. As Mr Ocampo convinced
me, two wrongs do not make a right. There is, of course, evidence that
major abuses have taken place in Africa, and the ICC should of course
be able to investigate those cases and, if necessary, indict people.
Nevertheless, the fact that all 31 indictments to date have been
against Africans conveys the clear impression that the likelihood of an
ICC indictment depends on a country’s strategic
importance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T09:45:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032048000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/halltext/130320h0001.htm#13032048000028">To
cut to the chase, I have no idea—I am not a lawyer, and I am
certainly not an international lawyer—about the merits of these
cases. I do not even endeavour to look at the legal processes in the
ICC. I am not an expert, so I would not wish to argue the merits or
otherwise of the indictments in respect of Deputy President-elect Ruto
and President-elect Kenyatta. The violence after the 2007 Kenyan
election was of course serious, yet none of us can have any doubt that

to the point, there is strong face-value evidence that the ICC acts
when it thinks that it can have a benevolent effect—I mean that
in the broadest sense. For example, although the cases of Liberia and
Sierra Leone were not ICC ones, it is clear that the violence there
came to an end, and people were brought to account, because of the
combined effect of careful and decisive military intervention followed
by a due process of international justice. Indeed, that is the purpose
of the ICC, although I stress that the Sierra Leone case and the
Liberia case, involving Charles Taylor, were not under the ICC. The
principle is very clear. It does follow, however, that sometimes it is
more sensible and effective for the ICC to allow other mechanisms to
take

quasi-autonomous—call it what you will. Ultimately it can be
answerable to the UN Security Council, but its judicial and
investigative processes are entirely independent. I am sure, Mr Bone,
that you love quasi-autonomous bodies in the UK, and non-departmental
bodies in theory act independently—and often, one might say,
unaccountably—of Government. The processes of the ICC are robust

<?notus-xml column=268?>the Minister cannot comment on the legal processes of the ICC, I simply
flag up to him that it would be unconscionable if, for a considerable
period, a cloud  or a pall hung over the President of Kenya and
the Government of Kenya, and indeed our relationship with Kenya, which
is of such fundamental importance. This is not something that we can

not know the merits of the case against Bosco Ntaganda, although I do
know the case quite well. It seems to me that the ICC exists precisely
to deal with the fear that is created in places such as the eastern
Congo by rampaging bandits and the rape and murder that frequently
accompany them, rather than to deal with what are essentially matters
of state. However we have arrived at this situation, this really cannot
be up to the ICC and its processes. Governments cannot stand by and

benefit at play across the world. It is for politicians to fix this. We
benefit enormously as a nation from our relationship with Kenya, so
this is not entirely altruistic, but those of us who care about African
states, as all of us do, and particularly the importance and pivotal
significance of Kenya, need to get the balance right. The hon.
Gentleman will be aware of particular cases when we have to say,
“This is an overall objective.” It is about peace and
strong relationships, and ensuring economic growth and development, and
the protection and security of our citizens. We somehow have to make

is a degree of symbolism in the ICC. The US and China have not signed
up to it and Russia has not ratified the treaty. In each case, I
understand why that has happened. I remember vividly our debate in the
House 10 or 11 years ago when we passed the Act that implemented the
treaty. There was genuine concern on both sides of the House that the
ICC could be misused. Those three major states and India stayed out of
it because they were concerned that it would not dovetail well with how
they saw the world, which I can appreciate—that, in itself, is
an indication of the political aspect of 
<?notus-xml column=269?>the ICC. That is not to be cynical, but apportioning strategic
importance to countries, and thereby excluding them from the ambit of
the ICC—in effect, that is done by indicting only
Africans—is a significant issue. If we choose to do that, we
need to recognise that Kenya is far too important to be treated as if
it were a minor and strategically unimportant state, although of course
the UK Government would not treat anyone as if they were
unimportant.</hs_Para>

conduct of internal politics, as to some degree has been the case. The
current and previous Governments dealt with that well. Frankly,
however, President-elect Uhuru Kenyatta saw an opportunity, as any
proper politician would, to jump all over it, thinking, “This is
an opportunity to establish my own credentials as a defender of the

commitment is welcome, and I hope very much that he maintains it. Kenya
is a party to the International Criminal Court, and that is a matter of
pride for Kenya. I am not sure whether the

Falkirk was implying criticism of the International Criminal Court
process—a process I consider extremely important—but he

China. Unfortunately, and regrettably, China is not a party to the

interesting comments were made during the election campaign,
particularly the references to the British high commissioner and the

sure is rejected absolutely by the British  high commissioner,
Christian Turner, who has a very high reputation. We ought,
perhaps, to approach that with humility; we all sometimes say things in
election campaigns that we regret. Once in a position of
responsibility, however, we need to move on, and the same should apply
to Mr Kenyatta. He should now swiftly bury the hatchet and move on to
building much better relations with the British Government, because
there is a potential benefit for both

have referred to Kenya’s growth rate. It has achieved a rate of
5% over most years in the past decade, which is something I suspect the
Chancellor of the Exchequer would give his eye teeth to be able to
report about the UK later today. Kenya’s economy is the largest
and most diverse in east Africa, and the country is potentially 
<?notus-xml column=272?>a very valuable economic, trading and political partner for this
country. I think that we would all want to see a process whereby Kenya
moved from being an aid recipient, and came out of that post-colonial
mentality and relationship entirely, into a relationship in which
Britain and Kenya regarded each other as friends, and economic and
political partners. That should be the future for Kenya, and I hope
that British Government policy towards Kenya will do its utmost to make

realise where we are and take advantage of opportunities. The
importance of the link between us and Kenya is well known because of
the colonial relationships we have had over the years. We
have become very interdependent, and the strong traditional
and historical links between that nation and ours are important, as are
the links today as Africa changes. The economic links are also
important, and perhaps the Minister will comment on that in his
response. I am always impressed with the Minister, and I do not say
that in a condescending way, because when it comes to the issues that I
and others feel in our hearts, he recognises them too, and that is the
important thing when it comes to responding and encapsulating what we

links with Kenya are important, and we already have them in place.
Traditionally, those links have been more important for the United
Kingdom than for other parts of the world, but we must be aware that
other countries are now equally interested in taking advantage of them.
I had the opportunity of being in Kenya last year, and China’s

of how we can do that. We have very strong health and medical contacts

the life span of people there.
Tourism<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T10:07:51"></hs_TimeCode> is

Training Unit in Kenya—BATUK—of which
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T10:09:15"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Falkirk spoke. Our training camps in Kenya are vital, because they
train our soldiers before they go to Afghanistan. As the sphere of war
and our influence decreases in Afghanistan and the possibility of other
spheres of conflict in Africa increases, BATUK is more important than
ever. The British Government have spent a lot of money on their
training camps in Kenya. We were there last year, when they were
spending more money on a new training camp. That again underlines the
important role that, for many
reasons<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T10:10:12"></hs_TimeCode>, we in
this country have with Kenya. We need stability, and it is very
important to have that over the next

want to comment on the importance of Kenya and its stabilising role in
the area. As other Members have said, Kenya contributes 2,000 troops to
Somalia. Kenya is a very stabilising country in east Africa, but other
countries, including Somalia, are very destabilising. It is important
for this country and for Africa as a whole that Kenya is stable, and
that it can use its influence in other countries in the area to ensure
that peace reigns and that the destabilising influences of Muslim
jihadist and other terrorist groups are diminished. That comes off the
back of Kenya, backed by us and the United States of
America<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T10:11:27"></hs_TimeCode>, playing
a very clear
role.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032048000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/halltext/130320h0001.htm#13032048000062">Piracy
off the east coast of Africa has been touched on by other Members. I
believe that we can play a bigger role, as can Kenya, in addressing
that issue. Perhaps it is time for the Foreign Office to have an
officer in the embassy whose role would be to work with other countries
to ensure that the piracy issue is addressed at the highest levels.
There is a diplomatic role, as I have 
<?notus-xml column=274?>said, but there is also a military role, and perhaps that officer in the
embassy in Kenya might, if at all possible,
co-ordinate and improve such
matters<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T10:12:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032048000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/halltext/130320h0001.htm#13032048000063">To
conclude, Kenya’s role is critical to the future of Africa, but
the relationship of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland with Kenya is also critical to that, because Kenya alone cannot
achieve the stabilisation that is needed. It is time to move on from
the elections and to grasp the future for all the people in
Kenya<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T10:12:37"></hs_TimeCode>. Whether
people are religious or not,
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T10:12:59"></hs_TimeCode> was very
impressed to be informed on my travels in Kenya that no other place has
as many churches per 100 yards. I have never seen as many churches in
my life—Presbyterian, Elim Pentecostal, Jehovah’s
Witness, Roman Catholic, Methodist, Church of Kenya—and they
were incredible. That tells me that the people have a wish to do better
and have an interest in each other. It is in our interests to play our
part for Kenya, through this Government, as well as through this

of the scale of violence that the people of Kenya witnessed following
the elections in December 2007, which, it is worth reflecting, left
1,000 people dead and 600,000 people displaced. There was a real

everything went smoothly in the recent elections. On polling day, a

great sadness and frustration around the time of 2007 and 2008, and who
also felt that there was a lack of political and legal accountability

referred to the frustration that some people feel when looking at the
situation in Kenya, particularly those of Kenyan origin who are here in
the United Kingdom. I was in Kenya in 2002 and visited polling stations
during the presidential election then, and the optimism at the election
of President Kibaki at that time was palpable—it was a change.
Unfortunately, things deteriorated in the 2007 election and in the
violence afterwards. Does the hon. Gentleman share my sense of
frustration, and that of Kenyans who I have talked to, that things have
not moved forward, that  the optimism has not been capitalised
upon and that the great potential of Kenya has not been realised
for  its people?</hs_Para>

on the visits I have made to different African countries is the passion
for democracy and the passion to vote, which was reflected in the 86%
turnout in the recent election in Kenya. There is a thirst for
democracy and progress, so the fact that progress has not been made in
the last decade is a great source of disappointment. I hope that, even
though the ICC proceedings are taking place, we will now be able, given
the acceptance of the parties in the election of the result of the
election although there may be legal challenges involved, to make some
progress—both political and economic—in a way that has
not happened in the past decade.</hs_Para>

must tread very carefully. The Minister knows that in our dealings with
many, many African countries, they are very well aware of our colonial
past. We have a role that, of course, respects the principles of
self-determination and of elections within African countries, but
different African countries always have a particular relationship with
the United Kingdom, which is similar to the relationship of some
African countries with other countries, such as France, that have also
played a role in the continent in the past. That relationship is
different from African countries’ relationship with countries
such as China, which have not played the same role in Africa in the
past.</hs_Para>

we should give credit for the peaceful and determined spirit with which
the recent election in Kenya was conducted for the vast majority of

principles. We need to respect the authority of the Independent
Electoral and Boundaries Commission, and of other Kenyan institutions,
to deliver this election. The disputes that are under way at the
present time should be dealt with by the courts, which is the
appropriate place for any disputes to be dealt with. In terms of
governance, we should emphasise that our commitment is to international
principles of democracy and justice, and it is not—in any

tradition of democracy in this country, which we want to be shared
everywhere.</hs_Para>

important that the development of the structures of democracy

is an historic moment for Kenya, as it prepares for only its fourth
President since independence, so this is a timely moment for the House
to take stock of how the UK’s relationship with Kenya has
changed since independence. At the outset, let me be clear about the
United Kingdom’s perspective on the relationship. Although we
are often still thought of as the former colonial power, the modern-day
relationship between the United Kingdom and Kenya is one of
partnership. We are bound together by strong commercial, security and
personal links that benefit both our countries, not least of which, as
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T10:31:16"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Wrexham (Ian Lucas) said, is our growing parliamentary link through
the IPU, the CPA and the parliamentary armed forces scheme. From my
work around various countries, I have seen how valued those
parliamentary links are by people who are building democracy, who are
always searching for ideas. Equally, I have seen how we benefit, as the
hon. Gentleman said, from swapping ideas with newer democracies, some
of which are doing innovative work that it is more difficult to do in a
more established Parliament such as ours. We all benefit from
that.</hs_Para>

me say a little about the general relationship before turning to the
specifics that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T10:31:58"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Falkirk mentioned, particularly the elections and the ICC. The
United Kingdom is the largest commercial 
<?notus-xml column=279?>investor in Kenya and home to half the top 10 tax-paying companies in
the country. More than 200,000 British nationals visit Kenya every
year—the largest number of visitors from any country. As
colleagues have mentioned, the tourism industry is vital. A similar
number of Kenyans live in the United Kingdom, and the benefits include
the remittances sent back to the Kenyan economy.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T10:32:30"></hs_TimeCode> are the
second largest bilateral donor to Kenya, contributing more than
£100 million a year, and I will say a little more
later<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T10:32:44"></hs_TimeCode> about the
development matters that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T10:32:43"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood)
mentioned.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032048000090" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/halltext/130320h0001.htm#13032048000090">The
British Army trains 10,000 British soldiers in Kenya every year, to the
benefit of the Kenyan armed forces, as well as the wider local economy.
Let me say a little more about that because it was mentioned, in
particular by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T10:32:56"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Strangford. The British military has trained in Kenya for decades,
and we have an excellent, long-standing relationship with the Kenyan
armed forces and the local communities surrounding the training areas.
Kenyan troops are also trained at the MOD base, and Kenyans are
routinely welcomed to attend training courses at staff colleges in the
United Kingdom. The relationship is a partnership, and it is governed
by a memorandum of understanding that was signed by both sides in 2010.
When issues arise, we always seek to resolve them through discussion.
We will continue to have a strong shared interest in working together
on important security issues, starting with Somalia, which a number of
colleagues mentioned, where Kenyan troops still play an important role
in pushing back
al-Shabaab.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032048000091" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/halltext/130320h0001.htm#13032048000091">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T10:33:46"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Strangford mentioned piracy off the east coast. Kenya
is, indeed, an important partner in dealing with piracy. I recently had
the opportunity to visit Northwood, where all the east coast of
Africa’s maritime operations, involving 27 countries, are
co- ordinated. I also recently had the opportunity to visit the
area to see some of the work being done. All states in the region play
a vital part in that work, which is partly political and partly
military. There have been no successful hijackings over the past year
or so of vessels carrying an armed guard, and we now have 80% fewer
hijacking cases, although four ships and 108 hostages are still being
held. That dramatic success has been due to a lot of hard work by the
various countries involved, skilled leadership, in which the United
Kingdom has been heavily involved, and the application of resources. We
must continue that work so that the piracy issue does not arise again,
because it is far from solved. Of course, development efforts on the
ground are also crucial in giving some of the young people sent by the
ringleaders to do the hijacking at least the possibility of an
alternative occupation.</hs_Para>

was recently in the Seychelles to open the new criminal prosecution
centre, which the United Kingdom has paid for. It will deliberately
target the ringleaders—there are expected to be about a dozen in
the area—who cause so much damage to so many people. That is a
measure of the commitment to dealing with this issue, and Kenya is,
indeed, a key player. Dealing with piracy is a priority for our Nairobi
mission and our Somalia embassy, and their work is well resourced.
However, I will look at the issue again, as the hon. Gentleman asked me
to, just in case there is anything further that can be done.</hs_Para>

statement following the announcement of the results by the Kenyan

too, the way in which those who have been unsuccessful in the various
elections have accepted defeat or, in some cases, taken their disputes
to court for peaceful resolution. That is the clearest sign that Kenya
has learned lessons from the appalling violence that followed the
elections in December 2007, which led to more than 1,000 deaths and to
hundreds of thousands people being displaced. The Kenyan people should

the court’s ruling. The United Kingdom’s position is

That assertion is not based on facts. We are motivated by a desire to
respect Kenya’s sovereignty and to ensure that the Kenyan court

I am confident that the UK will want to continue working with the next

international independent organisation, is a court of last resort

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T10:46:48"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

that takes place with the UK and the way in which we hope that we
conduct business. It is noticeable that, in winning contracts abroad, a
key part of the offer of many big UK companies is capacity building and
training, which is in stark contrast to others who seek contracts with
the aim of maximising profit, sometimes to the exclusion of local
workers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T10:47:20"></hs_TimeCode>. UK
companies are urged by UK Trade &amp; Investment, although many do it
naturally, to ensure that their offer for winning a contract is
supported by efforts on further education, vocational training and
capacity building, so that something long term and sustainable is
offered to those places in which the contract is being
run<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T10:47:39"></hs_TimeCode>. That is one
reason why total trade exceeds £1 billion. UK exports rose by
38% from 2010 to 2011, and a substantial number of the largest

shall sum up the issues that are worrying people in three themes, which
an academic suggested to me. The first is that there is a narrowing of
focus. The draft programme of study for design and technology returns
to a 1950s DIY curriculum with an emphasis on basic craft and household
maintenance skills. It places at risk the creative, challenging
learning in design, engineering and technology that is part of the
present design and technology curriculum.</hs_Para>

there is a lack of rigour and challenge. The published draft programme
of study for design and technology lacks academic or technical rigour,
challenge or ambition. It is completely out of step with the needs of
our advanced industrial economy and sophisticated labour market. It
will undermine routes into further and
higher education for talented students by failing
to provide the skills and knowledge that they need to
progress, or to inspire students to pursue careers in the creative
industries, design, engineering, manufacturing and technology. Thirdly,
there is a reduction in value, status and popularity. The draft
proposals will further reinforce the perception that applied subjects
are less valuable, which in turn will lead to academically gifted young
people being discouraged from choosing technical and creative subjects
at
GCSE.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032048000125" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/halltext/130320h0001.htm#13032048000125">So,
what the Minister decides on the design and technology curriculum will
be every bit as significant for our country’s competitiveness as
what the Chancellor announces in his Budget speech in an hour or so, so
I hope the Minister’s voice lasts during her response. I am sure
she understands the importance of getting it right, and I am sure the

meaningful change. I hope she will regard my speech as a constructive

and woodwork were for the less academically able. I did well in maths
and physics, but I never really understand what I could do with them,
and that is probably why I am not an engineer today. A good D and T
curriculum helps students to appreciate the uses of maths and physics
and will inspire many young people—especially girls, I
suspect—to pursue careers in science, technology and
engineering. Some students might not have thought of that because they
thought that sciences were not for them, but D and T made science
relevant.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032048000159" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/halltext/130320h0001.htm#13032048000159">Worryingly,

designers and engineers come from? Another insidious influence that
affects the brightest students, both boys and girls, is that both sexes
are often turned away from STEM careers due to a totally mistaken
belief that they offer only technician-level activity: oily rags and
machine shops. We need more technology in schools, not less, to show

Conservative quote Harold Wilson, and perhaps the first time I have
heard Harold Wilson quoted in this House, which is interesting. I agree
with much of what my hon. Friend said. Design and technology is an
extremely important subject, which builds on this country’s long
history of leading the world in design, innovation, engineering,
manufacturing and architecture. The chain of British world-class
achievements stretches from the giants of the industrial revolution,

and technology has a vital role to play in inspiring young people.
Unlike my hon. Friend, I did design and technology at school and very
much enjoyed it. It taught me a lot and has been helpful in my later
life. It bridges theoretical and practical education, encourages the
application of mathematics and science to engineer solutions to real
practical problems, and delivers vital practical skills. My hon. Friend
captured some of the tensions in the subject—its domestic,
industrial and commercial application—but we need to address all
those issues because it is important that our young people can do
things in their own homes as well as apply them more widely. In
counties such as Norfolk, the catering and horticultural industries are
high-tech and require young people with specific skills in those
areas.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032048000168" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/halltext/130320h0001.htm#13032048000168">We

to teachers with a focus on computer-aided design, manufacturing,
electronics and communications technology. However, we have made
changes in the new national curriculum, and there has been a broad
welcome for the strengthened place of food and cooking in particular.
One issue with the previous curriculum was that it tried to shoehorn
food and cooking into a design process. It has its place in industry,
but also has a place in teaching young people about where food comes
from, nutrition and the ability to cook. We want more young people to
be able to do that. The Department of Health is very interested in how
we address Britain’s obesity problem. There has been a warm
welcome for what we have done with food and
cooking.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032048000169" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/halltext/130320h0001.htm#13032048000169">We
have sought in our draft curriculum to broaden what schools may teach
and to give them more freedom to inspire young people, which is why
subjects such as horticulture are included but are optional. If schools
have leading horticultural centres nearby, they may want to develop
that subject. The approach in our national curriculum is to focus on
what schools do rather than how they do it. We expect teachers and head
teachers to develop their curriculum and professional development much
more, so that they can inspire young
people.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032048000170" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/halltext/130320h0001.htm#13032048000170">I
was pleased that my hon. Friend mentioned developments in the maths,
computing and physics curriculum. I agree that it is important to note
the need 
<?notus-xml column=292?>for many more engineers and so on in this country. We need the subject
to be inspiring for girls and boys. Such subjects depend on maths,
physics and computing, and we have received strong support for our
reform of those curricula. I welcome my hon. Friend’s help in
pushing the agenda for getting more 16 to 18-year-olds doing maths, and
the Secretary of State’s long-term goal is for all students to

subjects that will encourage young people to go into particular
industries. There is a strong case for saying that subjects such as
mathematics and physics also need to be able to point to their
practical application. For example, we have included a greater
financial element to mathematics so that young people understand its
practical application and can apply it to their domestic circumstances
as well as to any future work.

is not appropriate for a subject such as cookery to be in personal,
social, health and economic education. Instead it should be part of
design and technology. However, it was not a deliberate act on our part
to give food and cooking a position of primacy in the curriculum.
Indeed, improvements could certainly be made to the curriculum, and I
take on board my hon. Friend’s suggestions. I recently had a
meeting with representatives from the Design and Technology

me provide a few more basic facts about biomass generation. It is the
only renewable technology able to supply base load renewable power at

of the low-carbon energy mix and one of the only deliverable and
affordable alternatives to the second dash for gas in which we might
have to engage. Excluding biomass from the energy mix would
significantly increase the cost of decarbonising our energy system. The
Department estimates that sustainably sourced bioenergy could
contribute around 11% to the UK’s total primary energy demand by
2020 and significantly more by 2050. Even taking into account the
energy used to grow, transport and process the fuel, biomass-generated

to home, I am mindful of the need to respect the effect of using
biomass as a renewable fuel on other UK industries. The wood panel
industry in particular is concerned about the impact on the
historically low wood prices it has benefited from recently, but it
should not have to worry because the wood that my power stations will
use will come overwhelmingly, if not entirely, from markets in which it
does not operate. The biomass industry relies on wood that no one else
has a use for, certainly on that scale. It cannot pay the prices that
the wood panel, paper, construction and furniture industries can pay,
so instead of representing a threat to those industries, it provides a
market for much of their previously unusable by-products that would
previously have been burnt or put in landfill where they would degrade

have stressed, perhaps overly, the conversion of my

the future of biomass. The conversion of existing fossil fuel plants is
a speedy, low-cost first step in the transition from the use of
carbon-intensive fuels to a greener alternative. It is an important
part of what I see as a continuum in the use of biomass as a fuel
source, which will also see new build, higher-efficiency power stations
fuelled by a robust and sustainable fuel supply chain. Converting our
coal-fired stations will not only see the country through an important
transitional period, but will create a bridge to keep the lights on at
the lowest possible cost. I suggest to hon. Members here today that on
the grounds of electricity supply security, benefits to the economy

until they had to close, they decided to make the groundbreaking
decision to explore the potential for conversion, so that they could
learn by doing and transfer that learning to developing biomass in
future. What they did was not only groundbreaking but risky, and they

meet its targets. That illustrates the potential of biomass generation
to give a new lease of life to existing power stations, which, without
conversion, would have to be decommissioned, but are sitting on top of
connections to the national grid. As we look at further investment in

ability to tap into that demand has given sustainable forestry a whole

its ability to run the dedicated biomass facility in Tilbury. I would

industry<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T15:14:16"></hs_TimeCode> needs
long-term certainty to encourage investment, particularly in a world

that coal-fired power stations are being built in Germany, when we have
made coal completely uneconomic in this country. When we are dealing

Stringer</B> (Blackley and Broughton) (Lab):</Member> I want to make a
few general points. First, I congratulate
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T15:15:23"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Selby and Ainsty (Nigel Adams) on initiating this important debate.
If I was in his situation and had in my constituency two major coal
plants that would shut if they were not converted to biomass, I would
take exactly his position.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13032052000074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/halltext/130320h0002.htm#13032052000074">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T15:15:52"></hs_TimeCode>
want to take a step back and give a slightly wider perspective on what
is happening, in line with what the hon. Member for Thurrock (Jackie
Doyle-Price)
said<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T15:15:55"></hs_TimeCode> about
energy and climate change. I can think of no country in history that
remained competitive while it had higher energy costs than its
competitors. At the base of our present energy policy is a huge gamble
that gas prices will increase and that therefore the investment that
the Government are making will make alternative energy competitive. At
the moment, however, it is not competitive, and we need to bear that in
mind, particularly given the worldwide increase in shale
gas<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T15:16:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032052000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/halltext/130320h0002.htm#13032052000075">The
second point I would make about the conversion to biogas is that it has
two drivers: one is bonkers  and counter-productive, while the
other should not be implemented. One is the 2020 directive from Europe,
which is an attempt to achieve a 20% reduction in carbon
dioxide emissions by 2020. On one level, that would be fine, but the
measure deals with only one side of the equation—emissions. It
does not deal with consumption, and the reason why the carbon budget in
Europe and this country is going up is that we are importing machines
and other products from elsewhere, which is why the amount of carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere is increasing generally. The policy is not
working and it is counter-productive—it is a deindustrialisation
policy disguised as an environmental
policy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T15:17:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032052000076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/halltext/130320h0002.htm#13032052000076">The
other problem, which the hon. Lady mentioned, is the large combustion
plant directive. I do not understand why this country must implement
the directive by a particular date. In that respect, the Minister, who
I think is excellent—I rather prefer his interpretation of the
country’s energy policy to the Secretary of
State’s—owes me, unusually, a letter. I asked him why we
had not applied to extend the deadline for implementing the directive,
which is allowable under its provisions. Perhaps he will tell us in his
response.</hs_Para>

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T15:18:42"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Selby and Ainsty made a good case, and he gave two reasons for
using biomass. One was jobs; as I said, I would make the same argument
if I was in his situation. However, when we give an industry a subsidy,
as is the case for biomass and the rest of the alternative energy
industry, there is a cost elsewhere, as
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T15:19:08"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Thurrock said. That subsidy could be costing jobs
elsewhere, even though it may not be
necessary.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032052000078" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/halltext/130320h0002.htm#13032052000078">The
second reason that was cited related to security of energy supply,
which I would always put at the apex of energy policy. One can argue
about price and how energy is made, but if we do not have any, we have
nothing to argue about. I remind the hon. Member for Selby and Ainsty
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T15:28:49"></hs_TimeCode>, in times
of difficulty, whether that is to do with energy or anything else, an

want to raise two constituency concerns about biomass, but that is in
the context of my huge support for it in general. The first matter has
a great constituency impact and comes into the category of unintended
consequences. There are two anaerobic digestion plants in Shropshire
that use maize, and they are devastating Montgomeryshire dairy
farmers’ ability to access maize land, so their traditional way
of farming will have to change. Those farmers have dairy herds and have
either rented land to grow the maize, or have bought the crop wholesale
to feed their stock. They can no longer afford that, because they are
being driven out of the market by plants that burn maize crops in
England. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T15:27:50"></hs_TimeCode>When we
consider biomass use, we must be careful about the unintended

second point relates to a constituent, Mr Clive Pugh, of Bank farm in
Mellington, who is a huge enthusiast for biomass. Twenty years ago, he
built an anaerobic digestion plant on his farm. It uses waste, and for
20 years it has been profitable and successful, but now he finds that
because he has a payment subsidy through renewables obligation
certificates, the support he gets is nothing like what it would be
under the feed-in tariff regime. There are competitors all over
Shropshire, in brand new plants, who probably get 11p or 12p a
kilowatt-hour for the energy that they produce. Many of them are
producing that energy from products that can be used for other
purposes, but Mr Pugh simply uses waste products—and nothing but
waste products. That helps the fertility of his land, which does not
need so much fertiliser, and it does not even need so much weed killer
because the process kills the weeds. However, he is being driven out of

I wrote to the Minister about that, I received the reply that someone
such as Mr Pugh really should have asked for his payment regime to be
transferred before 2011. However, small business people such as
Mr Pugh do not realise that, and now he finds that he is no
longer able to transfer—there was a cut-off date. New plants are
going ahead elsewhere, and Mr Pugh will be driven out of business, but
he is the pioneer. He was the man who established the examples and

Opperman</B> (Hexham) (Con):</Member> Everyone here would agree that
the fundamental concept of biomass is a good thing. There can be no
objection by any Member of Parliament or any constituent to the
fundamental principle and support for it. However, as always with
Government policy, including in the three years that I have been in the
House, the consequences are not always what we would wish to see. I am
faced with a situation—this is the third Minister in three years
whom I have addressed in relation to biomass subsidy—whereby, on
the one hand, the standard person who is buying timber, whether it is a
furniture maker, someone doing wood panelling, a caravan maker or any
other person using timber in any way, shape or form in this country to
run any kind of business whatever, buys at a price that is unsubsidised
by the
Government<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T15:31:39"></hs_TimeCode>. On
the other hand, energy companies that wish to purchase timber in this
country for use in a biomass energy plant are subsidised to a large and
significant degree by the
Government<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T15:31:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032052000105" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/halltext/130320h0002.htm#13032052000105">The
consequences are very clear. First, the timber price goes up. Secondly,
the energy companies have a competitive price advantage, which allows
them to purchase timber at a cheaper rate than all other purchasers in
the country. Every single person, save for an energy company, gets a
different price. That, from a Conservative coalition, I find illogical
and hard to believe, given that we are meant to be a free-market-based
organisation. The reality is that the subsidy is distorting the market,
raising the price of timber and, I regret to say to my hon. Friend the

kick-start energy policy, there must be subsidy—no one disputes
that—and there has been, in a multitude of different energy
fields over a long time, under successive Governments, that process.
However, just as the Government have reviewed the subsidy that exists
in relation to solar or other types of energy production, so the
Government have an obligation to review the extent to which they
subsidise domestic wood. I shall go further than that and say this. In
this context, it is having an impact on jobs. There is no question in
my mind about that. It is also having an impact on the consumer,
because as with all energy, there is a degree of subsidy, and that
subsidy is coming from the consumer. The consumer is paying, through
Government subsidy, for the consequences of the energy production.

would be simply

seriously and most particularly the fact that I have two minutes and 54
seconds in which to finish. It comes down to this. The Minister is a
free-market economics guru. He is a robust embracer of his brief.
However, I remain to be convinced of why we subsidise one item for one
particular organisation, while we do not subsidise on the other hand. I
am told by

hon. Friend the Member for Selby and Ainsty (Nigel Adams), who is both
a friend of mine and very eloquent in the 
<?notus-xml column=311?>way he puts his case, that there is no effectual usage of domestic wood
in this country—yet we still subsidise it. With respect, that is
totally illogical. Either the subsidy is required to continue for
domestic wood, or it is not. Mrs Main, I thank

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T15:38:03"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Selby and Ainsty (Nigel Adams) not just on securing the debate, but
on the comprehensive way in which he dealt with the issues in relation
to biomass. To start with, he is right to make the distinction between
biomass and biofuels. The Minister, I am sure, will recall that on
6 March we engaged in the discussion on the Renewables
Obligation (Amendment) Order 2013. Certainly the

wishing to disrespect that opinion, I am sure that he will be aware
that there are a number of different views about what the level of
capacity will and will not be. That is one scenario, but it is
important to highlight that similarly expert commentators have painted
other scenarios. We need to reflect on them all, to see where we are

hon. Member for Redcar referred to the decisions announced today on
carbon capture and storage. I was interested to hear the
Minister’s response, particularly on the two projects that were
not included in the announcement in the Budget today. If we are serious
about CCS, we need to ensure that we get the long-term support
regimes—such as those we are discussing in the Energy Bill,
which is awaiting its Report stage—right. That will ensure that
those two projects—and the Hatfield project, which was not
successful in the New Entrants Reserve 300 funding scheme, because it
did not get the go-ahead for match funding from the Treasury—are
not completely lost and that we do not lose opportunities in those
areas and in the export potential of our technological and academic
lead in the industry.</hs_Para>

Thurrock (Jackie Doyle-Price) talked about the power station at

grid since its very recent conversion. She also made an important point
about the cost of grid connections. It is about not only the financial
cost, but the time it takes energy sources to be connected to the grid,
particularly in the 
<?notus-xml column=312?>less populous parts of the British isles. There are complications, and
concerns about the time some sources take. Her important points add to
the case for making biomass part of the balanced mix, particularly
because, as is sometimes described, it can be used during a
transitional phase, while other sources are developed further. I do not
think that biomass is completely ideal, but we do not live in a
completely ideal world and we have a significant energy challenge to
meet over the next few

for Hexham on the all-party group on the wood panel
industry<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T15:43:14"></hs_TimeCode>. The
issue is what is, and is not, waste. We hear a different interpretation
of waste when we talk to the wood panel industry, as opposed to when we
talk to other industries, such as the furniture industry. There needs
to be a decent level of engagement between the Government and the
industry, because they have different data that show very different
things—the impact on price is just one factor that needs to be
explored properly. The Minister said earlier this afternoon that he
intended to ensure that there was that level of engagement. It is
important because anyone’s starting point with biomass is that
it needs to be sustainable and focused on genuine waste
products—products that cannot be used in any other meaningful
way, such as in furniture or in the wood panel industry, which can use
lower-grade wood than the furniture industry. I am sure that he is well
aware of those points.</hs_Para>

different interpretations. In debates about different aspects of energy
policy, sometimes differences of view are over-interpreted and

regrettable. In this case, if we go into the detail of the different

the Member for Hexham (Guy Opperman), who is a great champion of the

unintended consequences. The unintended consequence for farmers, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T15:52:42"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Montgomeryshire (Glyn Davies) mentioned, can also be
profound, and it is about straw too. Pig meat farmers, for example, are
concerned about the effect on straw prices of its use in biomass. My
hon. Friend raised the issue of dairy farmers. I take that point, and
we will consider the matters. It is important that there is no
displacement effect. The unintended consequence is as significant as
the virtue of what we are trying to
achieve.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032052000142" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/halltext/130320h0002.htm#13032052000142">But<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T15:53:17"></hs_TimeCode>
the virtue is a profound one. We are talking about a proven source of
energy. At the end of the third quarter of 2012, the total electricity
generating capacity of biomass electricity generating stations was 3.5
GW, which was an increase of more than 900 MW over the previous year.
It may not be known that landfill gas is 1 GW of that
capacity. For many years it has been  an important source of
energy, predating some other technologies that get more airtime,
perhaps because they are perceived to have greater
glamour.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032052000143" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/halltext/130320h0002.htm#13032052000143">With

transport and electricity—could be met from sustainably sourced,
biologically derived biomass. Most of it would be from wood, and our
analysis indicates that that can be done without significant effects on
food production or the environment. Biomass can, therefore, play a
greater role, but I am mindful of displacement and
sustainability<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T15:54:17"></hs_TimeCode>.
Biomass also offers controllability and predictability, as I suggested

is important to recognise that biomass conversion is a cost-effective

renewables obligation statutory instrument that we debated a week or

take account of the definitions of what waste wood really is. I have

work we are doing on sustainability requires ongoing consultation. The
sustainability controls that we have put in place are still
the subject of further discussion. Many hon. Members have raised that

must, however, also be cost-effective. We make no apologies for
insisting that we must deliver value for money for the energy bill
payer, maximising the amount of renewable energy and carbon reduction
we receive for our investment. Coal conversions offer, perhaps, the
best means of ensuring that value for money, and using waste to
generate electricity also provides a cost-effective route, as long as
we can accurately define what waste is. Let me just say this on waste:
it seems that the location of this kind of biomass plant should be
close to the source of supply, and ideally close to the source of

the Member for Brigg and Goole (Andrew Percy) reminds me. The
alternatives are less than adequate, it has to be said. There are three
lines out of Barnetby, the junction about 15 miles west of Cleethorpes,
all of which go to Doncaster, Sheffield and Manchester, but the line
through my hon. Friend’s constituency—through Brigg,
Kirton Lindsey and Gainsborough to Sheffield—is, in part, a
single track and passenger services are provided only on
Saturdays<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T16:01:48"></hs_TimeCode>. There
is an alternative route to the east coast main line, with a connection
at Newark, via Lincoln, but the service on that route is intermittent
to say the least, and it is not a reasonable
alternative.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032052000154" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/halltext/130320h0002.htm#13032052000154">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T16:02:05"></hs_TimeCode>
main operator on the Cleethorpes to Manchester line is First
TransPennine. I have to say that it provides an excellent service and
has done an excellent job in recent years to build up the patronage on
that service. Of course, First TransPennine is also suffering, although
there are compensation arrangements such as from Network Rail. As it
pointed out in an e-mail to me, it is losing 25% to 30% of its
customers from Grimsby and Cleethorpes, which equates to 2,500 a week.
Clearly, many of those people might be permanently lost to First
TransPennine.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032052000155" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/halltext/130320h0002.htm#13032052000155">Those
people who wanted to come to Cleethorpes at Easter and into the summer
season, for a day or a few days in the resort, will be completely lost
to the tourist trade. The inconvenience is not only to individual
travellers, including Members of Parliament I have to say, but more
importantly to people accessing leisure services. It has a real impact
on the local economy, and that is particularly relevant with the
approach of the Easter weekend, which is the traditional start of the
tourist

met Network Rail and First TransPennine on Friday, and I acknowledge
the difficulties that they face. The first priority is to get the line
clear and to get at least a limited service up and running. At a
conservative estimate, that will take another 12 to 16 weeks. As
Network Rail pointed out to me, there are still considerable unknowns.
I understand that Network Rail needs only three to four weeks to
replace the track, but it does not yet have access to the track,
because it has to move the slag heap that caused the slip and ensure
that it is safe for the
workmen<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T16:04:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

mentioned alternative routes. I accept that one priority must be
getting freight from Immingham docks to the power stations. In the
main, that uses the alternative Brigg and Gainsborough line, but there
is some limited access and First TransPennine is training its drivers
with the necessary route knowledge to run on that line. That is proving
difficult, but I understand that it is ongoing, although it will take
six weeks. First TransPennine is halfway through that process, so there
is hope that a skeleton service might be provided on that line by mid
to late April<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T16:05:04"></hs_TimeCode>.
As I have mentioned, Northern Rail operates a Saturday-only service. It
would surely not be beyond the wit of man to use those particular
slots, at least on Saturdays, and those available on Sundays, when
there is less freight traffic, to provide direct services. At least
getting people there for the weekend would be a boost to the tourist

is worth pointing out that one of the alternatives is the East Midlands
route via Newark, which, as I have said, is an intermittent service. It
is one of the faults of the present franchising system that there does
not seem to be an incentive for East Midlands to take advantage of the
lack of trains on the other route by providing additional trains. I
recognise that, as I know from correspondence about its normal daily
services, there are problems. Anyone who has travelled on peak-hour
services—most noticeably, for example, the 17.23 from Lincoln,
via Market Rasen, through to Grimsby—will know that the rolling
stock is totally inadequate, being provided by a single unit. East
Midlands readily says—I have quite a bit of correspondence about
this—that the rolling stock is simply not available. Clearly, if
rolling stock is not available to provide existing services, there is
very little scope for it to provide additional
services<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T16:06:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032052000159" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/halltext/130320h0002.htm#13032052000159">Through
First TransPennine, I have asked whether East Coast, which provides
most east coast main line services, would consider deregulating some of
the ticket restrictions that currently operate, at least to allow
people to leave London and get back to Cleethorpes by train, by
changing at Newark. In the evening, that unfortunately means having to
leave before the 7 pm cut-off at which cheaper tickets begin. East
Coast told First TransPennine that it was not prepared, in more or less
any circumstances, to do that. I subsequently wrote to East Coast, but,
sadly, it has not as yet bothered to reply. It does not seem
unreasonable to request that, for the 18.03 from King’s Cross to
Newark, which has a good connection through to Grimsby—not to
Cleethorpes, unfortunately, but at least people can get to
Grimsby—it could provide a derestriction to allow passengers to

want to move on to the actual incident, why it happened and who, if
anyone, was responsible. The slippage of the slag heap may have simply
been the result of movement in the earth—one of those terrible
things that, although it blocked a railway line, thankfully did not
cause any loss of life. However, I know from Network Rail that it has
had discussions with the Environment Agency, the Health and Safety
Executive and the mines inspectorate. I am in the process of
corresponding with those agencies to see what their response is. It is
worth mentioning in this debate—I hope the Minister will convey
this to other Departments—who, if anyone, is responsible for
monitoring the safety of the slag heaps. Agencies such as the HSE moved
in after the event, but was anyone other than the operator of the site
responsible? The operator, which was Hargreaves Services, only owned

forward investment work that is due in 2014. The removal of lineside

might help—up to a point—in alleviating part of the
problem that his constituents are facing at the moment. However, I also

benefit passengers travelling from Cleethorpes and Grimsby to

previous comments by my hon. Friend, it would be for East Coast to
assess any options there may be for extending its Lincoln to London

your chairmanship, Mrs
Main<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T16:30:00"></hs_TimeCode>. I pay
tribute to the person behind this debate, my late constituent, Khuram
Shaikh. Khuram was a Rochdale Red Cross worker who worked in some of
the most dangerous parts of the world, helping people who had lost
limbs from bombs, land mines and disease. The terrible irony is that he
was killed not in the crucible of war, but at a holiday resort in Sri
Lanka<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T16:30:27"></hs_TimeCode>, where he
was supposed to be recuperating before leaving for his next mission in
Cambodia. It was not a land mine in Gaza that killed Khuram Shaikh; it
was a group of thugs, running amok in the tourist resort of
Tangalle<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T16:30:41"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T16:30:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032052000195" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/halltext/130320h0002.htm#13032052000195">Khuram
spent his working life in harm’s way, but when he was killed, he
was sitting in a luxury hotel near a beach in an idyllic setting. I
looked at the hotel in a glossy brochure the other day and no one could
imagine a safer place to be, but the holiday brochures do not warn
people about the depraved gangs that stalk the tourist areas in Sri
Lanka, looking for
trouble.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032052000196" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/halltext/130320h0002.htm#13032052000196">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T16:31:16"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T16:31:26"></hs_TimeCode>

I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T16:31:26"></hs_TimeCode> want to
concentrate on two things today; the failure of the Sri Lankan justice
system to properly investigate the killing of a British tourist and the
wider failings of that country’s justice system, which is
rightly coming under more international scrutiny in the lead-up to the
Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting that Sri Lanka is due to host

want to set out the facts about the failure of the Sri Lankan justice
system to investigate the death of my constituent. The nature of
Khuram’s death was brought home to me in the most appalling way
possible, as I was presented with crime reports by the head of the Sri
Lankan criminal investigation department. I am now certain that Khuram
died trying unsuccessfully to protect his female partner from a
horrific and sustained attack, the details of which would make anyone
sick and are simply too distressing to repeat
here.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032052000198" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/halltext/130320h0002.htm#13032052000198">After<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T16:32:20"></hs_TimeCode>

men were immediately detained, including a local politician, who was
suspended from the ruling party, and police informed Khuram’s
family that they had sufficient evidence to make sure that the case
moved swiftly to trial. Then, when the media attention died down,
everything ground to a halt. Eventually, the eight suspects were
quietly released on bail and the local politician was allowed back into
the ruling party. Any pretence of justice went out of the
window.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032052000200" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/halltext/130320h0002.htm#13032052000200">On<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T16:33:32"></hs_TimeCode>
the anniversary of Khuram’s murder—Christmas day just

through the same routine of claiming that justice was taking its course
and that it was normal for suspects, even those suspected of serious 
<?notus-xml column=325?>crimes, to be out on bail. Inquiries were taking longer than expected,
we were told. Khuram’s family was quite right not to be
satisfied, and their wish to see justice and experience some sense of

this point, let me put on record my thanks to the British high
commission in Sri Lanka. Its help and support was extremely good, and
it is a credit to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and our
country.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032052000203" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/halltext/130320h0002.htm#13032052000203">While
out there, I was emphatically told by countless Sri Lankan people that
politicians are immune from prosecution in such cases and that the
local politician suspected of killing Khuram was protected by the
President. I was also told that some politicians were out of control
and running riot in many parts of the country. While I was there, it
was reported that two more British tourists had been hospitalised after
an attack by another local politician.
As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T16:35:24"></hs_TimeCode> I boarded the
plane to return to the UK, I picked up a copy of <I>The Island</I>, a
popular Sri Lankan newspaper. The front page ran a story of our visit
and underneath it was a cartoon of a man explaining how
“political goons” had killed hundreds of Sri Lankan
people.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032052000204" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/halltext/130320h0002.htm#13032052000204">If<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T16:35:52"></hs_TimeCode>
this was not horrifying enough, the lax attitude towards the case by
senior Sri Lankan civil servants was even more worrying. The permanent
secretary at the Foreign Office told me that, if politicians had good
lawyers, they could find a way to escape justice. When I put it to him
that he could not guarantee the safety of British tourists, he shrugged
and said their system needed more teeth. The permanent secretary at the
Ministry of Justice told me that they could not take foreign witness
statements regarding the case, because it would be too much trouble to
get them to travel to Sri Lanka for the
trial<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T16:36:31"></hs_TimeCode>.

Danczuk:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman raises an interesting point. I
am convinced that it is about political interference. The police out

still, the permanent secretary at the Ministry of Justice added that
the accused would be able to choose the trial that he wished. It would
be unlikely that 
<?notus-xml column=326?>he would want a trial at bar in Colombo, and the likelihood is that it
would be a trial by jury in Tangalle, where he has a fearful reputation
and where jury members are likely to be easily intimidated. With most
of the country’s media in Colombo, the trial would pass without
a great deal of scrutiny.
This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T16:38:03"></hs_TimeCode> case has
reached a sorry pass when it seems the best that we can hope for is a
sham
trial.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032052000208" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/halltext/130320h0002.htm#13032052000208">Police<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T16:38:10"></hs_TimeCode>

delayed for the best part of a year. Whenever we question the delay, we
get the same response: “the tests will be ready in a few more
months.” Although I accept that the Sri Lankan justice system
moves slower than ours, I remain convinced that political interference
is putting the brake on any efforts to move things forward.

European tourists are increasing and there is grave concern among
diplomats about the safety of foreign nationals, particularly women

the past month, the British journalist Faraz Shauketaly, who works for
<I>The Sunday Leader</I>, was shot in his own house by unidentified

known for its exposés of corruption in the country, was
killed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T16:44:42"></hs_TimeCode>. Too many
Sri Lankan journalists have been killed or have gone into exile, and

purpose of the debate is not only to shine a light on how the Sri
Lankan justice system is failing properly to investigate the murder of
a British tourist, but to honour the memory of Khuram Shaikh, who was a
well respected member of our community and a valuable and committed
member of the International Red Cross

grief for his family, and I know that his father makes the trip to his

Khuram achieved a lot in his life and tributes have been paid to him
from across the world, he was only 32 when he was killed, and he should
have had many years ahead of him. His death has left a huge gap in the
lives of those who knew him, and I am grateful to have had the
opportunity to introduce a debate that adds to the tributes for Khuram.
I am sure the Minister will agree that every necessary step must now be
taken by the British Government and others to press Sri Lanka to do
more to protect tourists, so that others do not meet the same
fate.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-20?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_20_PT_1/BCD588116E8C925EDD8D1DF5F79D0A84CF19AE45" __version__="1.2"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="20 March 2013">Wednesday

for Rochdale to securing justice following the brutal murder of his
constituent, Khuram Shaikh, in 2011, and I welcome the opportunity to
bring attention not only to that tragic case but to the wider
circumstances that have been described. It is no secret that the United
Kingdom has a number of concerns about progress in Sri Lanka, a country
with which we have long and very strong ties but about which we have
everyday worries that are shared by a number of other nations. One of
our dearest wishes is that balance and equilibrium are restored to our
relationship with Sri Lanka by those issues’ being addressed,
but that is not what we currently
see<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T16:47:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032052000225" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/halltext/130320h0002.htm#13032052000225">It
is important to note that we have a long-standing and strong
relationship with Sri Lanka. Our close ties are formed through history,
educational links and culture, as well as the Sri Lankan community in
the United Kingdom, which contributes so much to our rich and diverse
culture. We value those links, which we are determined to
maintain.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032052000226" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/halltext/130320h0002.htm#13032052000226">A<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T16:49:33"></hs_TimeCode>
key link, of course, is tourism. UK citizens accounted for more than
10% of tourists visiting Sri Lanka last year. Even in these tough
times, tourists are making a significant contribution to the Sri Lankan
economy. Together with Sri Lankan citizens, they deserve to know that
they can rely on the Sri Lankan authorities to keep them as safe as
tourists in any other part of the world. They also deserve a swift
investigation, with the perpetrators being apprehended and brought
swiftly to justice in a fair and transparent trial, should any crime be
committed against
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T16:48:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032052000227" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/halltext/130320h0002.htm#13032052000227">Unfortunately,
the events highlighted by the hon. Gentleman today have served to
undermine that trust. The horrific murder of Khuram Shaikh has gone
untried 
<?notus-xml column=329?>for 15 months, bringing further grief and frustration to those closest
to him. Of course, justice can take time, which we all understand, but
in this case we were encouraged by the quick arrest of the suspects and
the Sri Lankan Government’s early assurances that such a brutal
crime would be investigated quickly and thoroughly, and that all guilty
parties would be sentenced
appropriately.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032052000228" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/halltext/130320h0002.htm#13032052000228">No
trial has yet started, and the suspects, the most prominent of whom is
a local politician, have been released on bail, which is extremely
disappointing. There is a growing perception that the guilty parties
may escape justice due to political connections, despite repeated pleas
from Khuram Shaikh’s family and the British high commission in
Colombo. I welcome the recognition of the work of our high commissioner
and his team. It will be reported back to him. There is a sense,
15 months after this heinous crime, that those who deserve
to be put on fair trial for their actions might escape justice. We
sincerely hope that that is not the case, and that the accused will
soon face a swift trial, free from political interference.</hs_Para>

raise Khuram Shaikh’s case with the Sri Lankan Foreign Minister
during my visit to the country in January, as well as in a meeting with
the Sri Lankan high commissioner in London on 23 January. During my
meeting with the high commissioner, I was advised that progress would
be made within three months. I trust the high commissioner and the
Foreign Minister, and expect to hear soon of progress on the case. The
British Government, along with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of
State<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T16:51:02"></hs_TimeCode>, will
monitor closely the progress of investigations in the coming weeks, in
the hope that those assurances will lead to the justice that the Shaikh
family so deserve. It is unfortunate that senior members of the Sri
Lankan Government did not meet with the hon. Member for Rochdale or
with Khuram Shaikh’s brother, Nasir Shaikh, during their recent
visit to Sri Lanka to press the case further.</hs_Para>

concerned about the possibility of increased attacks on and threats to
our tourists abroad. Our travel advice recognises an increase in sexual
and gang violence in Sri Lanka. We condemn all instances of violence.
They must be investigated, and those responsible brought to justice
with a swift and fair trial. We advise any visitor abroad to read the
travel advice on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website. It is
kept up to date. It is accurate, factual and not used for any political
purpose; it honestly describes the situation there. It will change to
reflect circumstances and the UK Government’s concerns about UK
citizens travelling abroad. The hon. Gentleman is right to draw
attention to it. We draw the attention of tour operators and others to
our travel advice, and we hope that people accept it and understand
what it implies.</hs_Para>

wider issues mentioned by hon. Members, Khuram Shaikh’s tragic
case is, regrettably, not our only concern about justice in Sri Lanka.
Hon. Members have spoken eloquently about other concerns. We are clear
that judicial independence should be a principle at the heart of all
free countries. Since the impeachment of Sri Lanka’s Chief
Justice in January, many feel that that principle has been fatally
compromised, which is why we and others, such as the International
Commission of Jurists and the UN, have expressed deep concern at the 
<?notus-xml column=330?>impeachment. We are disappointed that the Sri Lankan Government
continued with the process despite objections from Sri Lanka’s
highest courts and outcry from its own
citizens.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032052000232" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/halltext/130320h0002.htm#13032052000232">The
Sri Lankan Government has defended the impeachment, stating that the
process was constitutional and followed due procedure, but many eminent
legal authorities, in Sri Lanka and overseas, have given a contrary
view. We also note that when the legal experts of the International Bar
Association’s Human Rights Institute planned to visit Sri Lanka
to investigate the impeachment, they were denied visas by the Sri
Lankan Government. Such actions do not inspire confidence in the claims
that the process would stand up to further
scrutiny.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032052000233" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/halltext/130320h0002.htm#13032052000233">Of
course, our concerns about the situation in Sri Lanka do not
end with justice issues. The long conflict in Sri Lanka
ended in 2009 with the defeat of the brutal Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam. After such a devastating period in their history, we believe
that all Sri Lankans deserve lasting peace, justice and reconciliation.
Following the end of the conflict, the 2011 report by the UN
Secretary-General’s Panel of Experts on Accountability in Sri
Lanka found credible allegations that both sides violated international
humanitarian law during the conflict. More recent work such as the
Human Rights Watch report and footage from a new documentary about the
final days of the conflict have also brought to international attention
important information supporting allegations of
abuses.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032052000234" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/halltext/130320h0002.htm#13032052000234">We
have consistently called for an independent, thorough and credible
investigation into the allegations. Until such an investigation takes
place, it will be difficult for the Sri Lankan people to move forward.
We are clear that all allegations must be investigated, whether
committed by the LTTE or Government forces, and that those responsible
must be brought to justice. We believe that fully addressing and
condemning events of the past is crucial to ensuring that justice is
done and that Sri Lanka can begin to look forward, not back,
but so too are wider measures recommended by Sri Lanka’s own
Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission. In order to ensure that
the dividend of peace can be enjoyed by all Sri Lankans, it is vital
that the Sri Lankan Government make concrete progress in implementing
the recommendations, which include investigation of alleged
extra-judicial killings and disappearances and implementation of a
mechanism to resolve land disputes
impartially.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032052000235" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/halltext/130320h0002.htm#13032052000235">We
recognise that the path to justice and reconciliation, particularly
after such a bitter conflict spanning generations and affecting so
many, will be long. It is also important for us to recognise that the
Sri Lankan Government have made some progress. I saw the situation for
myself during my visit to Sri Lanka in January. Infrastructure had been
rebuilt, and I saw roads being repaved in the northern area. I also
heard from non-governmental organisations about extensive de-mining
work done in former conflict zones. We recognise and welcome such
progress. We also recognise that there are obstacles to progress in
some areas, and that the way forward will never be clear of stumbling
blocks. Much more work is needed to guarantee a stable future for Sri
Lanka and ensure justice for all its citizens. The appropriate
application of the rule of law is clearly a key
factor<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-20T16:56:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Government meeting. The United Kingdom has still not made a decision on
our attendance at CHOGM. We look to Sri Lanka to demonstrate the
Commonwealth principles of good governance, respect for human rights

lack of it. It was decided at CHOGM 2009 that Sri Lanka should host the

require the consensus of all member states. We will look to Sri Lanka
to demonstrate its commitment to upholding Commonwealth values. We must
also be sure that the emphasis at CHOGM will be on the Commonwealth.
That is what it is about. Bearing in mind the location, however, there
is a risk that attention will be drawn to other factors. We are working
strenuously with other partners to ensure that Sri Lanka recognises its
opportunity to demonstrate its values; also, in the run-up to that
period, questions are being asked, exemplified by the individual
circumstance raised by the hon. Gentleman that is reflective of wider
concerns. We have similar questions, as do other members of the

I mentioned at the beginning, our relationship with Sri Lanka is long
and deep. We recognise the bitterness and difficulty of the conflict
that came to an 
<?notus-xml column=332?>end and the brutality of terrorism and the importance of seeing it
ended; if there is to be proper reconciliation and justice, however,
there has to be a recognition of accountability for what has happened,
as well as looking forward to the opportunities available for all the
population in Sri Lanka. All that the friends of Sri Lanka and its
people are doing is to draw attention to the need to reconcile the
statements of the Government of Sri Lanka about justice and
reconciliation with actions on the ground to deliver that. Government
statements about implementing the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation
Commission’s recommendations are emphasised because that is what
Sri Lankans themselves expected to see happen to deliver the justice

Environmental Science, and I will attend the EU Environment Council in
Brussels on 21 March. Paul Wheelhouse, Minister for Environment and
Climate Change in the Scottish Government, will also
attend.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13032049000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/wmstext/130320m0001.htm#13032049000006">Following
the adoption of the agenda and the approval of the list of
“A” items, the presidency will hold an orientation debate
on a proposal relating to biofuels and indirect land use change. The
presidency have suggested questions to frame the discussion and
encourage views on the effectiveness of the proposal. The UK supports
the introduction of indirect land use change factors into the
renewables directive and the fuel quality directive, which would allow
all emissions attributable to a given biofuel feedstock to be taken
into account when determining which biofuels should be supported. This
was discussed at the Energy Council in Brussels on 22
February.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13032049000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/wmstext/130320m0001.htm#13032049000007">The
next orientation debate will be on a proposal to amend the directive on
the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on
the environment (known as the EIA directive). The European Commission
adopted its proposal to amend the EIA directive on  26 October
2012. The intended purpose of the new 
<?notus-xml column=48?>proposal is to streamline the environmental impact assessment process
and to introduce provisions which will reduce the number of
environmental assessments that are undertaken unnecessarily. The
orientation debate will seek a ministerial steer on proposals for a
one-stop shop for assessments under different European legislation, the
use of accredited experts, and mandatory scoping of the content of
environmental
reports.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13032049000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/wmstext/130320m0001.htm#13032049000008">Over

Commission communication “A Decent Life for All: Ending poverty
and giving the world a sustainable future”. This communication
proposes a common approach to the implementation of the millennium

implementation of the Rio+20 outcome document. These issues were
considered at an informal meeting of Development Ministers on 11-12

the afternoon, there will be an orientation debate on the
“Access and Benefit Sharing of Genetic Resources” file.
The presidency have proposed two questions to steer further work.
Ministers will discuss the balance of obligations on users of genetic
resources and how effectively the proposed regulation will fulfil the
requirements of the Nagoya
protocol.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13032049000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/wmstext/130320m0001.htm#13032049000010">The

the REACH regulation, published in February 2013, and its communication
on the second regulatory review of nanomaterials, published in October
2012. This will be followed by an exchange of views on the main
findings of the Commission’s reviews. It is expected that the
debate will focus on ways of reducing the regulatory burden on SMEs,
the early signs of benefits accruing to human health and the

securing a licence. Licensed suppliers can refer to their work on the
2012 Games, in business to business communications, and at trade fairs,
both in the UK and overseas. The Supplier Recognition Scheme is another

April 2013, which will also only rise in line with inflation, ensuring
that level of APD will again remain constant in real terms. The

has recently set out how we intend to work with the current and future
consumer credit regulators to ensure a strong and co-ordinated response
to the problems identified, now, as well as from April 2014. This
involves tough enforcement action by OFT, as well as immediate work by
Government to clamp down on the advertising of payday loans. Government
is also strongly pressing industry to improve compliance with the
sector's existing voluntary codes and put in place new provisions to
address specific areas of concern, notably use of continuous payment
authority. Further, the new Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) will have
tough, responsive and dynamic powers to tackle emerging problems in
credit markets quickly and effectively from April 2014. The FCA has
committed to prioritise action on payday lending as soon as they take
on the regulatory responsibility in April 2014. During the rest of this
year, they will consider whether there are gaps in the regulation of
payday lending that need to be addressed from April 2014 and will turn
existing OFT guidance into rules that are binding on firms.</hs_Para>

the MOD has spent approximately £750,000 on defence education
for the SAF, of which £450,000 was spent on provision of
education within Sudanese military institutions. The education provided
in Khartoum included English Language teaching and the delivery of the
Management of Defence in the Wider Security Context (MDWSC) course. The

international efforts to promote stability, accountability and good
governance across Sudan. The intent is to encourage security sector
reform, with an emphasis on respect for human rights, professionalism,
and governance and accountability mechanisms within the armed forces.
This engagement has also allowed the UK to play a key role in
supporting African Union-led negotiations between Sudan and South
Sudan, influencing senior Sudanese military officials to make progress
on security-related post-secession issues, thereby contributing to
regional
stability.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032074000307" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/text/130320w0001.htm#13032074000307">The
MDWSC has formed part of our Defence education programme since 2010
with three courses delivered at the Higher Military Academy in
Khartoum. It is intended to increase awareness of the range of
processes and techniques that may be utilised to enhance the effective
governance and management of defence. The UK Defence Academy has
undertaken an internal validation of each MDWSC course to determine
whether it met its immediate objectives and to ensure that subsequent
courses are tailored to meet identified areas of need. MOD Defence
education in Sudan is also subject to scrutiny annually as part of the
Conflict Pool funding process. The Deputy Director of the International

monitoring of cull effectiveness will take place in the first year of
the pilots. If this monitoring indicates that the population in an area
is higher than originally estimated, then discussions will take place
between the licence holder, Natural England and DEFRA to agree an
appropriate remedy. If the badger population is lower than expected,
badger removal effort for the second year of culling may be adjusted
accordingly. However, in this scenario, there are additional safeguards
in place to ensure that the risk of local disappearance of the

the categorisation ‘nanomaterial’ relates to the particle
size, the behaviour and effects of nanomaterials are determined by a
range of properties. The European Commission has adopted a
Recommendation on the Definition of a Nanomaterial (2011/696/EU), which
is being applied in EU legislation where appropriate and will be
reviewed and adapted in future as necessary. Particle size is already
defined in the Ambient Air Quality Directive and associated guidance

changes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032074001127" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/text/130320w0002.htm#13032074001127">In
June 2012 NICE's independent QOF Advisory Committee reviewed the cancer
review indicator. As a result, NICE published a recommendation in
August 2012 that reviews should be carried out within three months of
the practice receiving confirmation of a cancer diagnosis, rather than
the current six months. This recommendation has been incorporated into
the GP contract for 2013-14. Guidance, also developed by NICE, advises
that as part of the review patients' health and support needs are
considered, along with the co-ordination of care between sectors. The
revised guidance for 2013-14 also refers to a template developed by
Macmillan Cancer Support in collaboration with the National Cancer
Survivorship Initiative to support GP practices in carrying out the
review.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13032074001128" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/text/130320w0002.htm#13032074001128">QOF

Act 2010 does not place any duties on local authorities to ensure that
schools comply with their responsibilities under the Equality Act 2010.
There is, therefore, no role for local authorities to ensure compliance
for academies. Under the Equality Act, local authorities have a duty
not to discriminate when carrying out their own education
functions—such as organisation of schools and arranging
admissions. The Equality Act clearly sets out the responsibilities on
schools and academies in 
<?notus-xml column=719?>respect of the discrimination provisions and the equality duties, and
they are responsible for ensuring their own compliance.</hs_Para>

of the number of people in employment beyond state pension age are not

the number of people above state pension age in the UK who were in
employment according to survey responses from the Labour Force Survey

for periods prior to this are not available. The state pension age is
the age at which people become eligible to claim the state pension in
the UK. For women the state pension age is currently being increased
incrementally to 65 in order to be equalised with that for men in 2018.
On the LFS the identification of respondents' eligibility for the state
pension is based on their age at the time of interview. During the
survey period for October to December 2012 the state pension age for
women varied between 61 and 3 months and 61 and 4
months.</hs_brev><hs_brev UID="13032074002928" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/text/130320w0003.htm#13032074002928">Estimates
are also not available for the number of young people who were
unemployed for parliamentary constituencies. As an alternative, table 2
shows the number of people aged 18 to 24 who were claiming Jobseeker's
Allowance (JSA) and its predecessor unemployment related benefits in
January 2013, the latest available period, and December of each year
from 1985 to 2012. Data prior to 1985 is not available. Data for the
current parliamentary constituencies, used in the 2010 general
election, are not available prior to 2004. The counts of people
claiming JSA are those who are claiming benefits for unemployment
related purposes. At a UK level the total number of JSA claimants is
around two thirds of the total unemployment level. As this data is

Kyrgyzstan, which we are committed to developing further. We were
pleased to open a British embassy in Bishkek last year, with the UK's
first resident ambassador accredited in March 2012. When he visited
London in 
<?notus-xml column=742?>July 2012, the then Kyrgyz Prime Minister met a range of UK Ministers,
including the Deputy Prime Minister, the right hon. Member for
Sheffield, Hallam (Mr Clegg). The Minister of State, Department for
International Development, my right hon. Friend the Member for Rutland
and Melton (Mr Duncan) and the then Minister of State for the Armed
Forces, the hon. Member for North Devon (Sir Nick Harvey), made useful
visits to Kyrgyzstan in October 2011 and March 2012 respectively. We
are keen to maintain momentum in these senior level contacts. The
Department for International Development (DfID) programme in Kyrgyzstan
totals some £7 million per annum and is focused on improving
governance and security, boosting regional trade and deepening
democracy. In addition, the UK Government is contributing nearly
£800,000 this year to projects aimed at conflict prevention
issues. We and the Kyrgyz Government are keen to deepen cooperation in
a range of areas including supporting Kyrgyzstan's reform programme,
regional security, trade, parliamentary links and educational
issues.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13032074000127" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/text/130320w0003.htm#13032074000127">Mozambique</hs_8Question><Question><hs_Para UID="13032074002830" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/text/130320w0003.htm#13032074002830"><B><Member PimsId="4830" UID="13032074003217" xid="814" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/text/130320w0003.htm#13032074003217">Mr

Palestinian and Israeli textbooks found that 58% of maps in Palestinian
textbooks and 76% of maps in Israeli textbooks made no reference to the
other. There is a profound need for both the Israeli and Palestinian
sides to do more to promote a positive portrayal of each other,

Simmonds:</Member></B> The UK has been at the forefront of
international efforts to support peace and security in Somalia,
including through leading negotiations on Somalia in the UN Security
Council (UNSC). UNSC Resolution 2093 authorised a time-limited, 12
month, partial suspension of the arms embargo for the Federal
Government of Somalia to acquire equipment, advice and assistance for
the development of their security forces. As a member of the Security
Council, the UK supported this resolution. We support the right of
sovereign countries to defend themselves and build their security
forces. This is urgently needed in Somalia. However, it is essential
that Somalia's security is not jeopardised. To ensure this, several
safeguards have been put in place, including the continuation of robust
restrictions on heavy weaponry as well as notification requirements and
monitoring mechanisms. We will follow the situation closely and the
UNSC will review the situation over the coming
year.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13032074000131" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130320/text/130320w0003.htm#13032074000131">South
