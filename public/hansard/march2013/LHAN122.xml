Northover:</Member></B> My Lords, the Government are committed to
encouraging more girls and women to play sport regularly as part of the
sporting legacy. Sport England’s £1 billion community and
youth sports strategy includes programmes designed to appeal
specifically to women and girls. In addition, my right honourable
friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport has been
working closely with the broadcast and print media to encourage them to
cover more women’s
sport<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T11:07:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000003"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Massey of Darwen" PimsId="1738" UID="13030791000640" xid="1343" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000640">Baroness

encouraging Answer, but can she expand on the consultation that is
taking place not only with the media but with sports advisers in
schools to encourage girls? In particular, what kind of sports are

Northover:</Member></B> The picture here is encouraging but there is a
tremendous amount more to do. In was struck by the fact that the latest
figures, from December 2012, show that 1 million more women are taking
part in sport than was the case when we won the Olympic bid in 2005. On
coverage, in 2005 the Women’s Sport and Fitness Foundation
estimated that only about 5% of media coverage was of women’s
sport. The BBC has just told us that women’s sport now amounts
to 25% of its sports coverage. Clearly, a lot more needs to be done and
one of the things that is being taken forward by Sport England is to
look at how best to encourage further development of this and encourage
more women and girls to take part in
sport<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T11:08:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000005"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Heyhoe Flint" PimsId="5922" UID="13030791000642" xid="2132" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000642">Baroness
Heyhoe Flint:</Member></B> My Lords, does my noble friend the Minister
agree that developing a sporting habit for life is something that needs
to start in primary school? There is a minimal amount of physical
education within that sector and teachers of primary school children
receive only a meagre six to 10 hours within a one-year training
session. Back in the last century, my physical education training took
three years. Would the Minister agree if I suggested that the
introduction 
<?notus-xml column=1606?>of physical education to primary school teachers would be a
great advantage in developing that habit for
life<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T11:09:26"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000006"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Northover" PimsId="2142" UID="13030791000643" xid="1368" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000643">Baroness
Northover:</Member></B> My noble friend speaks from a huge amount of
experience and she is of course right that it is extremely important
that we develop this from the earliest age—getting children out
of pushchairs, for example, and onwards. As for primary schools, she is
right. I am sure that she will be reassured to know that discussions
are happening at the moment about how to strengthen school sport from
primary schools upwards. An announcement will be made very
shortly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000007"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Grey-Thompson" PimsId="5494" UID="13030791000644" xid="2023" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000644">Baroness
Grey-Thompson:</Member></B> My Lords, media coverage is very important
and I declare an interest as chair of the Women’s Sport and
Fitness Foundation’s Commission on the Future of Women’s
Sport. However, for elite success and media coverage we also need good
participation figures and recent data have shown that mums are much
less likely to take their daughters to play sport than their sons
because of their own experience of sport in school. Can the Minister
say what plans the Government have to insist in changing the culture
around women so that they encourage their daughters to play as much
sport as their
sons<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T11:10:23"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000008" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000008"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Northover" PimsId="2142" UID="13030791000645" xid="1368" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000645">Baroness
Northover:</Member></B> Again, the noble Baroness speaks with huge
amounts of experience and the Women’s Sport and Fitness
Foundation is a crucial body in trying to take this forward. Sport
England has awarded a grant to that organisation to try to identify how
best to encourage women and girls to be involved in sport. The noble
Baroness is absolutely right that mothers who were themselves switched
off from sport are less likely to encourage their children to be
involved in sport. That is one key area where we welcome insights into
how best to tackle

Nye:</Member></B> My Lords, does the Minister agree that, after the
success of women athletes at the Olympics last year, it is a disgrace
that two-thirds of boards of sporting organisations do not meet UK
Sport’s minimum target of 25% female members and six, including
British Cycling, do not have a woman on them at all? Given that public
money is involved, do the Government have a strategy to deal with

Northover:</Member></B> The noble Baroness is right; Sport England and
UK Sport are both encouraging national governing bodies of sport to
increase the number of women on boards and the Government expect that
all publicly funded sports bodies should have at least 25% women on
their boards by 2017. That is very important but we also need more
women as editors of newspapers, political programmes and so

taking part in regular football matches, exercise and so on

Billingham:</Member></B> My Lords, the Government are determined that
competitive sport in schools is the key to greater participation; that
view is certainly not shared by the majority of physical education
experts, who fear that such a programme will alienate many boys and
girls and do nothing to produce a “sport for all”
approach and lasting participation. What evidence is there for the
Government’s proposed formula? Our evidence suggests the
reverse. As for representation in the media, will the Government look
at Title IX, the American system which guarantees equal exposure in
sport for girls? We cannot reproduce it perfectly here but we could do
a modified version, which may well help with the lack of women’s
sport seen in our media.</hs_para>

Northover:</Member></B> We now have 50% of schools taking part in
competitive games. There is mixed evidence as to the interest of girls
and boys in that, and the noble Baroness is right to highlight to need
to make sure that we analyse it properly. Sport England is looking at
how best to encourage girls as well as boys to come forward. Some girls
enjoy being part of a team, even if that may seem too competitive for
some. I hear what the noble Baroness says on Title IX. We are taking a
lot of measures to try to ensure that the media recognise the
significance of covering women’s sport and the appeal of
it—everybody could see how outstanding the women’s team

continue to see only glacial progress in the representation of women on
the boards of our 100 most lucrative companies. Women are now
successful at university and in their early careers, but attrition
rates increase as they progress through those organisations. The
companies are missing out. Evidence suggests that companies without
strong female representation are less successful because they are
unable to draw from the widest possible range. My concern is not women
who are European—although I know that they are
suffering—but those from black and ethnic minorities who are
willing to serve on

absolutely right that we want more women on boards. We do so because
they make up more than half of the nation’s talent and we cannot
afford for the best and brightest not to be there. The

the statistics for women on boards are not broken down in that way, but
I know anecdotally that they are not great. What I can say to
the noble Baroness is that, through a range of measures that the
Government are taking, we are ensuring that our effort expands to cover
all women. She may like to know that the Women’s Business
Council, which we set up to make sure that we address the pipeline
so that more women come forward, is chaired by Ruby
McGregor-Smith, who is chief executive of MITIE and the only Asian

Department for Education is committed to making the
cross-government action plan on violence against women as effective as
possible. The statutory guidance for sex and relationship education
makes clear that schools should ensure that young people develop
positive values and a moral framework that will guide their decisions,

understand how the law applies to sexual
relationships<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T11:23:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000032" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000032"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Prosser" PimsId="251" UID="13030791000670" xid="1701" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000670">Baroness

to work across different government agendas to increase activity to

been required to place this within the core curriculum in schools? How

agree with her that girls should be equipped to deal with threatening

important issues. The safeguarding of children in schools is an
important part of the training of teachers. They should all have the
skills and knowledge to identify and respond to bullying, violence
and signs of abuse or neglect. As she points out, if the abuse
is happening at home, that is an area where one might hope that
children would acquire some 
<?notus-xml column=1611?>moral confidence, strength and values. Teachers have a particularly
challenging role if they have to identify that it is the domestic
situation that is causing the problem. Of course, schools try to

friend the Foreign Secretary has quite rightly made human rights, and
Britain’s championing of human rights, part of his soft
diplomacy strategy. It has been greatly to his credit and to the credit
of the United Kingdom. It is important that we have a record that we

McNally:</Member></B> My Lords, I think that “dilute” is
the wrong word. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Neuberger, pointed
out in his interview the other day, the relationship between our
Supreme Court and the Strasbourg court is a healthy one of learning
from each other and looking at each other’s jurisprudence as it
develops. What we have been doing, and one of the proudest things I
have been involved in as a Minister, was the Brighton conference on the
workings of the court which looked at how we can build in a
subsidiarity to take notice of the importance of national supreme
courts while still retaining the strength and the moral authority of
the European Convention on Human
Rights.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T11:35:00"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para>

Faulks:</Member></B> My Lords, whether human rights are best protected
by the Supreme Court, by Parliament or by Strasbourg, all noble Lords
are anxious to 
<?notus-xml column=1614?>protect them. However, even human rights have a cost. Public authorities
are spending a great deal of money trying to make their policies
compliant with the convention—rather like with health and
safety—when the Strasbourg jurisprudence is extremely uncertain.
The diminishing pot of legal aid is being spent on often unmeritorious
cases about human rights, rather than on far more meritorious cases. I
was one of the commissioners, and we were not allowed to consider
questions of cost. I ask the Minister whether the Government, in the
whole human rights debate, could tell us how much human rights is

interest and names were added to the list. I now beg the leave of the

Stowell of Beeston:</Member></B> My Lords, it is an enormous privilege
to introduce the International Women’s Day debate. In the same
debate two years ago I made what was then my second speech in your
Lordships’ House. I seem to recall the noble Lords present
taking a sharp intake of breath when I said then that I had only very
recently become familiar with International Women’s Day. My
saying that betrayed two things. The first is that, unlike so many
Members of this House, I have no claim to involvement in the fantastic
advances that have been made in support of women over the past 100
years. Indeed, I feel a great sense of humility when I look down the
list of speakers today.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13030791000068" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000068">Of<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T11:39:59"></hs_TimeCode>
course, many other Members of this House—too many to
mention—have campaigned hard and achieved so much for the rights
of women over the years. However, I would like to mention two
Baronesses by name who we have sadly lost from this House over the past
year: my late friend Lady Ritchie of Brompton, who founded Women2Win
and helped so many women in my own party become MPs; and the late Lady
McFarlane of Llandaff, who was one of nursing’s great pioneers
and, indeed, the first nurse to become a life
Peer.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000069" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000069">Secondly,
my rather shocking remark betrayed that, unlike many other countries,
we here in the UK have not got into the habit of using International
Women’s Day simply to celebrate women. In fact, I was talking to
some Italian women the other day, who told me that in Italy the men
shower them with mimosas on this day. Now, I am especially pleased that
six noble Lords of the male variety have joined us, but I reassure them
that we are not expecting flowers; I would not want to overburden them
coming so soon after Valentine’s day and just before Mothering
Sunday. Seriously, though, I am pleased that this is not a women-only
debate. We will be discussing issues that affect women, but we cannot
address them without the support and input of
men.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000070" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000070">Today’s
debate is a chance for us to draw attention to the serious challenges
that women still face here and around the world. Last night, my noble
friend here with me on the Front Bench today responded to a very
powerful debate about the ongoing use of sexual violence as a weapon of
war. This morning we have 
<?notus-xml column=1617?>already responded to Questions, some of them rather interesting, about a
range of inequalities affecting women. I am sure that some of these
matters, as well as many others, will be raised again, and my noble
friend Lady Northover will be pleased to respond to
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000071" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000071">As the
person opening today’s debate, I will focus on women and their
careers, or more specifically on what we are doing to ensure that we
better utilise the talents and skills of all women, whoever they are,
wherever they come from and whatever they do. I want to celebrate the
contribution of women and talk about how we can support them in
achieving their full
potential.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000072" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000072"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T11:46:32"></hs_TimeCode>The
challenges facing women today are very different from those that women
faced in the 20th century. We know that in the past British society did
not see much value in educating girls. Indeed, this is sadly still true
in some parts of the world, as Malala Yousafzai’s ordeal at the
hands of the Taliban has shown all too graphically. Here, girls now
outperform boys in nearly every subject at nearly every stage of
school, yet too many girls lack confidence, self-esteem and
ambition.</hs_para>

the past, women were banned from universities. Now, more young women
than young men go to university, yet there are still too many subjects
where a female face is rare. As we all know, it was legal in the past
to pay women less than men for the same work. Women were barred from
too many professions entirely. Getting married could mean losing your
job; I will not even mention having a baby. Now we have some of the
most comprehensive anti-gender discrimination legislation in the world,
yet the gender pay gap remains and women continue to be
underrepresented in positions of power and
leadership.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000074" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000074">It
is clear that the way we respond to these very complex modern-day
challenges needs a sophisticated, modern approach. The solutions cannot
be found simply in more laws, regulations and targets. Of course,
finding the solutions is not easy when there is little money around. I
realise that women will wonder how we can make their lives better when
we also have to make significant cuts in public spending. The truth is
that it is not easy, but there are things we can do and are
doing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000075" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000075">I will
not go through the whole list, but the kinds of measures I am talking
about for those on the lowest incomes and most in need include lifting
more than 1 million of the lowest-paid workers out of income
tax altogether, the majority of whom are women. We will also increase
child tax credit by £180 above inflation for low to
middle-income families. Where we can we are spending money in ways that
empower women and give them real choice and control over their
lives.</hs_para>

top issue that comes up time and again for women is balancing work and
family life. Our current inflexible system of maternity and paternity
leave makes it incredibly difficult to break down the stereotypical and
intrinsic view that women should stay at home and look after the
children and men should go out to work and earn the money when a couple
start a family. What if the mother earns more? What if she is in a more
senior position than the father? What if the father simply wants to
take on more of the caring 
<?notus-xml column=1618?>responsibilities? In our modern world the state should not make it
harder for parents to choose the best arrangements for their
children.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000077" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000077">That
is why, after an extensive consultation, we announced last November
that from 2015 we will introduce a new system of shared parental leave
that will make an enormous difference to working women who want to have
children. It will mean that if fathers want to take on more of a role,
they can. If mothers want to return to work earlier, they
can. If parents want to spend some time at home together around the
birth of their child, they can. Parents will have a
choice.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000078" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000078">Crucially,
albeit over time, the new parental leave arrangements and the access to
flexible working for all employees—the other initiative
that we recently announced—will put men and women on a level
playing field in the workplace. Employers will no longer be able to
assume that only women take a career break to look after their
children. For my part, that was one of the biggest things that sold
this policy to
me.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000079" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000079">Until that
time arrives, we are also determined to help working women by boosting
childcare wherever and whenever we can, especially to those who need it
most. This includes but is not limited to 15 free hours a week in a
nursery or with a childminder for all three and four year-olds. From
September this year that will be extended to two year-olds from the
most disadvantaged
homes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000080" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000080">Even in
flexible and family-friendly workplaces, women can still hit the glass
ceiling, so we are working with employers to ensure that there really
is no limit to how far women can go in their careers. We have just been
talking about women on boards, and as a result of the fantastic work by
the noble Lord, Lord Davies, to increase that number, the number of
FTSE 100 all-male boards has now halved, and since last March 40% of
new appointments to boards have been women —up from 13% in
2010.</hs_para>

is, however, a pipeline issue for women in executive roles. Our Think,
Act, Report initiative to improve transparency on pay and wider
workplace equality is helping to make a difference. Employers who sign
up make a commitment to identify any barriers to women in their
organisation, to take action to address them, and finally to report
publicly on their progress. The transparent reporting bit of the scheme
is a particularly powerful tool with which to achieve
change.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000082" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000082">Since<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T11:54:29"></hs_TimeCode>
the initiative was launched just over a year ago, 73 organisations have
signed up. In total, they employ more than 1 million people and include
firms such as Marks &amp; Spencer, Tesco, BT, EDF and BP. As of today,
they have been joined by the Chartered Management Institute, which has
more than 90,000 members and huge outreach to other employers. However,
we are not stopping there. Because we recognise that we do not have all
the answers, last year we established a Women’s Business
Council, made up of exceptionally high achievers in business, to
provide advice to government on what we can do to maximise
women’s contribution to our future economic growth. It is
comprehensively examining the evidence, from the issues and choices
facing girls in school right through to the experiences of older women
who need to continue working into 
<?notus-xml column=1619?>their retirement but who face diminishing options in the labour market.
That council is due to report to the Government later this
year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T11:50:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000083" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000083">We
need to encourage all women to aspire to and be ambitious for success,
but too many young women still do not have the confidence to follow
their dreams and, even more distressingly, too many do not have dreams
at all. We are trying to change this through measures such as our pupil
premium to help schools better support their disadvantaged pupils and
close the attainment gap between them and their peers. We are working
with schools, advertising, retail and the media to improve perceptions
of body image through our Body Confidence campaign so that more young
women realise their future will be defined by their talent, hard work
and abilities, not by what they look
like.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000084" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000084">We are
encouraging women to choose more of the STEM subjects at A-level and
university that will allow them to flourish in today’s economy,
and we are giving them the skills they need to succeed. Noble Lords
might be interested to know that last year, for the first time, more
women started an apprenticeship than men, but let me say something
about aspiration, ambition and success, about which I feel very
strongly. There are many definitions of success. It is vital that we
have more women in positions of power, whether in business or politics.
We want those women on boards. We need more women around the Cabinet
table, as the Prime Minister said very recently.</hs_para>

we must not forget that many women have no desire for that kind of
success. They might want to run their own business instead or be a
doctor specialising in a particular field of medicine. Just because
people who work in Parliament enjoy power, we must not think that
everyone else does. We have to be honest here: there are also many
women for whom reaching the top of the tree is not a realistic
ambition. By concentrating so much on the high achievers, or telling
people to aim for the very top, I worry that sometimes, without meaning
to, we diminish other people’s achievements and even discourage
them from being ambitious at

She is an undertaker. She is roughly the same age as me and left school
with little in the way of formal qualifications, so was put on what we
then called a YOP scheme. I am sure she will not mind my sharing this
story with the House. On her first day at work, she thought that the
funeral company’s office was a car showroom when she turned up
because of all the big black cars outside. After a few false starts and
once she had got over the shock that she was working at a funeral
director’s, she knuckled down and started to progress up the
undertaker ladder.</hs_para>

a few years, Julie was put in charge of its new Beeston branch, which
included arranging funerals. That is a difficult task, as it means
talking to people when they are at their most vulnerable. However, she
was good at it, so much so that the family of a teenage boy who had
been killed in a dreadful accident requested that Julie direct the
funeral as well and be the person leading the cortege. She had never
done that before and it was a massive step. Because
the family insisted 
<?notus-xml column=1620?>that she did this, the firm quickly rustled up a uniform for her and she
did it. She was magnificent. She was so proud and walked through
Beeston in front of that hearse as if she had been doing it for years.
As she had been so successful, she was given that additional
responsibility and started to build a strong personal reputation
throughout the town. Word got around that she was very dedicated and
good at her job. After a further few years, after she had a short
maternity break, she tried to return to work but unfortunately was not
able to agree mutual terms at her old firm, and that was that; at
least, it could have
been.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000088" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000088">Not many
avenues were open to Julie and it would have been easy for her to enter
a system that led to nowhere. After a while, however, she spotted some
premises which she thought would make an ideal funeral home. With the
support of people who knew her reputation and that she was a sound
investment, she set up her own funeral directing business. That was
five years ago and the business is now thriving, so much so that she
keeps six people employed in full-time work and provides regular casual
work to another
four.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000089" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000089">I told

role model to the young women of Beeston as I might like to think I can
be. As much as we want all girls to be ambitious at school and aspire
to great things, because that is the most secure route to success,
those who do not can still achieve their own very worthwhile version of
success if they aim to be the best at whatever they find themselves
doing.</hs_para>

Parekh:</Member></B> I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Stowell of
Beeston, for securing and introducing this debate, which she has done
marvellously. As we celebrate International Women’s Day, I want
to introduce a note of caution. It is quite common to talk about
“the woman”, which leads one to think that all societies
think of women in more or less the same way. Coming as I do from India
and as a student of developing societies, I suggest that it would be a
great mistake to homogenise or essentialise the woman. The woman comes
in many roles: she comes as a mother, as a daughter, as a wife and also
as a companion. In some civilisations, woman as a daughter is not much
valued and is disposed of in arranged and other marriages. Woman as a
mother, however, is the subject of enormous power and considerable
authority. This is what happens in India. So if one looked at women
simply from the standpoint of what happens to daughters in arranged
marriages, one would be inclined to think that women do not enjoy
equality. However, this makes it very difficult to explain why India or
Sri Lanka or other developing countries had women Prime Ministers long
before we did and long before any western country. If 
<?notus-xml column=1621?>women were treated as inferior or unequal, why should India, for
example, have more women in the highest positions, as vice-chancellors
in universities or as Cabinet Ministers? The explanation is that, as I
said earlier, the woman can be seen in many different roles, and as
long as she is seen as the mother figure she wields considerable power
and authority. Women, while suffering from inequality at one level,
enjoy equality at another and the picture becomes much more
complex.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13030791000092" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000092">The
other point to bear in mind is that, for some reason that I do not have
time to explore, the equality of women in our
civilisation—certainly after the war—has gone in hand
with sexualisation of the woman, and this has created all kinds of
problems. On the other hand, in non-western societies it has gone hand
in hand with desexualisation because if a woman is seen as the mother
then, obviously, she is not seen as an object of sexual desire. In
India, a woman in a position of authority has to conceal her sexual
charm if she is going to carry any kind of authority, as has happened
to every Prime Minister or happens to women in any other position of
authority. Here the opposite tends to happen, with the result that
cultural historians and sociologists have introduced a new concept
called “erotic capital”. The argument is that having
charming, good-looking, beautiful women under a certain age in
positions of authority generates the business a certain amount of
capital and brings good will and customers who are attracted by the
ambience. That sort of thing has gone hand in hand with the
sexualisation of the body and the woman in the context of
equality<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T11:59:52"></hs_TimeCode>. This
relationship is contingent. It need not have happened but it has
happened. It has been a source of considerable worry, and those of us
who are extremely anxious to fight for equality for women in all
spheres—natural, spontaneous equality in ordinary relations, not
just equality of rights—would have to engage in a deeper
cultural critique to make sure that a woman is not understood in this
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T12:00:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

general point, which has been exercising me for some time, I want to

percentages of women in positions of power in our society are striking:
Members of Parliament, 22%; the House of Lords, 21.7%; the Cabinet,
17.4%, but the figure keeps changing; local authority council leaders,
12%, but local authority chief executives, 23%; senior ranks of the

vice-chancellors, 14%; academics in general, including lecturers,
senior lecturers and readers, 35%; professors, 20%; editors of national
newspapers, 5%; directors of FTSE 100 companies, 16%; elected mayors,
13%; senior management in the Civil Service, 31%, but Permanent

have given those figures because I want to draw four important
conclusions from
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T12:01:57"></hs_TimeCode>. First, if
a position happens to be elected, the chances of women being
underrepresented are considerable. Secondly, there is no difficulty at
the bottom level of a profession because women are represented there in
proportion to their presence in the population. As you go higher up to
the middle level, there does not seem to be much of a problem either,
but there is suddenly a narrow pyramid 
<?notus-xml column=1622?>at the top. Thirdly, there is underrepresentation at the top in the
private sector compared to the public sector. Fourthly, women’s
representation is very poor and they are only just beginning to break
through in new areas such as TV journalism or as editors of national
newspapers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T12:02:44"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T12:02:44"></hs_TimeCode>.
This tells us where we need to concentrate. Although it is striking
that progress is being made in all those areas, we still have a long
way to
go<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T12:02:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Whether in elected bodies or people at the top, why is this kind of
inequality persisting after all the attempts? My own study tells me
that four or five factors play an important part. First is of course
the conscious or unconscious bias of males in positions of power. They,
for all the kinds of reasons that I mentioned earlier about the way in
which female equality is understood, feel uncomfortable or threatened
by female presence. There is also the question of women themselves
feeling slightly diffident and therefore not displaying, or playing to,
their strengths as well as they could. Thirdly, there is the culture of
the organisations, which, being male-dominated, sets certain norms, and
women feel intimidated or unwelcome in those organisations. Fourthly,
there is the question of family responsibility. In spite of all the
talk, it is women who carry the family, with the result that women are
not to be seen in many branches of the medical profession, with which I
am familiar. For example, women generally tend to avoid those courses
in medicine or those areas of employment where they might be required
at any time or where there could be an acute emergency. There are
therefore a large number of women in ophthalmology, but there are very
few in general surgery or acute
medicine<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T12:04:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

point to bear in mind is that the male historically has been the
standard of reference and, therefore, the criterion by which to decide
how an organisation should be structured, who should be appointed and
who should not be. As a result, for example, in many cases a male on an
appointment panel would say: “This particular candidate is not
decisive or partisan enough, because that is what an organisation
requires”. The result is that women, who are not generally
pushy, partisan or aggressive and are more concerned to compromise,
tend to be under- appreciated and not
appointed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T12:04:54"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T12:05:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Brinton:</Member></B> My Lords, I declare my interest as a trustee of
Christian Blind Mission. Antoinette Androis, a young woman living in
the Democratic Republic of Congo, suffered the devastating loss of a
child a few years ago. Forced out of her home for over six years,
pregnant Antoinette was left to give birth on a few banana leaves out
in the bush. Shortly after cutting the umbilical cord with a machete,
Antoinette's husband and some women from the village watched helplessly
as the baby girl died in front of them. Antoinette’s latest
pregnancy, in 2011, was completely different from her experience in the
bush. Thanks to access to a clean delivery kit, distributed to women in
the Ituri and South Kivu provinces by Medair and UNFPA, Antoinette was
admitted to a health centre and gave birth in a maternity ward assisted
by a trained health worker. This time her child survived.</hs_para>

2009, the Liberal Democrats reaffirmed their manifesto commitment,
which was subsequently incorporated into the coalition agreement, to
guarantee giving 0.7% of our gross domestic product in international
aid. This aid will save the lives of 50,000 mothers and 250,000 babies
by 2015. It has already saved the lives of women like
Antoinette and her child, who directly benefit from UK

2000, as a signatory to the UN millennium development goals, we pledged
to improve maternal heath and reduce child mortality, among other
goals, by 2015. The international community has certainly taken big
steps forward in tackling each of these eight goals and it is important
to recognise the successes. For example, both the goals of reducing by
half extreme poverty and the number of people without proper access to
safe drinking water have already been met by these efforts. However, we
cannot forget that while progress has certainly been made, data that
have been disaggregated by sex tell us a grimmer story of continued

lack of access to financial resources can have a direct impact on the
likelihood of a mother and child surviving a pregnancy. In many places
in sub-Saharan Africa, as in the Democratic Republic of Congo where
Antoinette gave birth, overcrowded and underfunded health centres lack
sufficient supplies, requiring expectant mothers to provide basic
materials like soap, gloves, a razor blade and even a sheet,
which are needed to ensure a clean delivery. Women who are unable to
afford these supplies or who have not received a clean delivery kit

Antoinette gave birth, provides healthcare for over 30,000 internally
displaced people who have fled armed conflict. In attempting to treat
as many patients as possible, the clinic lacks funding for basic
supplies, and thus the burden of the cost of giving birth is
transferred to the expectant mothers, who are already struggling with
unimaginable
poverty.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000103" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000103">This

her husband, beaten and abused, and she was unable to work or seek

Howe of Idlicote:</Member></B> My Lords, listening to the range of
subjects covered already, it is quite clear that there is no shortage
of issues to do with achieving equal opportunities for women that we
can debate today. I fear the road to achieving equal opportunities is a
long one and will continue to provide ample material for speeches on
International Women’s Day for many years to come, before the
goals that we are all seeking are at last achieved to everyone’s
satisfaction. I will confine my remarks to two issues: women at the
top, which has been covered already today; and women in the penal

will start with women at the top. Clearly, the 2011 report by the noble
Lord, Lord Davies of Abersoch, <I>Women on Boards</I>, was a major step
forward. It reflected what had become, at last, a cross-party
agreement; that is, that percentage targets for female company board
directors should be set and backed by compulsion if voluntary efforts
continued to fail. For the FTSE 300 companies, this involved both
targets and a requirement to set out detailed plans of how their
percentage of women would be achieved. The aim for the FTSE 100
companies was to achieve a full 25% representation by the same date,
2015—but that is only
25%.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000111" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000111">However,
there has been significant progress. All-male FTSE 100 boards have
fallen from 21% to 7%, as we have already heard. Without doubt, too,
the annual published updates of the noble Lord, Lord Davies, on the
progress of these companies will certainly keep things moving in the
right direction. However, for this debate, it was helpful to
hear from the Minister about the plans the Government have to ensure
that a satisfactory supply of qualified women
candidates are aware of, and trained for, these opportunities
at appropriate earlier stages in their life. Education in their school
years will of course be vital and relevant careers advice is absolutely
essential. Girls’ interests and aptitudes need to be taken into
account, but so do national and international employment trends and,
more locally, the likelihood of job vacancies and remuneration
levels.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000112" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000112">It
would be useful, too, to know what further action the Government are
planning to take to encourage employers to allow men as well as women

their children are
young.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000113" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000113">However,
we all know that the percentage of women at board level is not the
whole story. It is also about those other areas where power exists,
whether for good or evil, a subject we have heard rather too much about
during the past few weeks. It is here that the <I>Sex and Power
</I><I>2013</I><I>: Who Runs Britain?</I> report, which has already
been referred to, tells rather a different story about women at the
top. We learn from that, as well as the figures we have already been
given, that women have slipped from 33rd to 57th place in international
power rankings since 2001. So it would be helpful to hear a little more
about the plans and priorities the Government will be pursuing
to help increase the percentage of women featured in all categories

penal system, I want to draw urgent attention to the continued neglect
by our criminal justice system of women held behind bars. In the UK we
imprison more women than almost any other western European country.
Decades of research and reports testify to the disproportionate harm
that this does to women themselves, their children, families and the
wider community. Although women comprise just 5% of the prison
population, they account for a third of all self-harm incidents in
prison, and every year nearly 18,000 children are affected by the

multiple rapes but are too terrified to report these crimes. They also

imprisonment in conditions that make it impossible for them to take

history of Coventry, framed through war and reconciliation, to which I
would like to turn, especially the effects of violent conflict on
women. Noble Lords will know that although International Women’s
Day had its origins in the movement for women’s suffrage, during
the First World War its focus shifted to the struggle against
war—war waged, through so much of history, by men but suffered
by women and their children, as in Syria today. My own grandmother was
one of those women who suffered and died in the First World War,
running down the steps of a London Underground station fleeing a
Zeppelin raid in 1917. She was pregnant, and my father was left
motherless, the only child of a single father who was so overwhelmed
that he turned to his own mother to care for his son. She did a pretty
good job. He died a few years ago, before I was made Bishop of
Coventry, and I had no idea of course that I would be speaking today.

decades later, in 1940, many women died in the Luftwaffe raids in
Coventry. Instinctive Christian convictions in Coventry cried out for
an end to the spiral of violence, calling not for retaliation but for a
reaching out to the enemy, armed only with the words of Christ,
“Father, forgive”—words that confess a common
complicity in war, that were etched into the east wall of the ruined
cathedral and that continue to speak eloquently to the violence of the
world. The ruins of the cathedral destroyed in 1940 were redesignated
in 2011 as a memorial to all civilians killed, injured or traumatised
by war and violent conflict. The Minister 
<?notus-xml column=1628?>will be glad to know that, as one of six themes that
guide the reconciliation ministry of Coventry Cathedral, we are working
to support those who stand up against the use of sexual violence as a
strategic means to demoralise, degrade and control the perceived enemy.

remarkable story of reconciliation. To be asked as an English bishop to
give a blessing in the now rebuilt Frauenkirche in Dresden on the

another act of extraordinary generosity, I have been asked to preach at

the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Coventry to this House. The
emotion, eloquence and relevance of his maiden speech certainly
captured the attention of his new congregation here in this Chamber.
The right reverend Prelate lists on his very worthy CV a plethora of
patronages of a wide variety of causes and charities. His parliamentary
interests list higher education plus conflict resolution and
reconciliation; one hopes that in this Chamber he has little conflict
resolution but plenty of reconciliation. As a fellow West Midlander,
which is perhaps why I have been asked to do this welcome, I also wish
the right reverend Prelate better fortune to his diocese football team.

am sure that, like me, the right reverend Prelate has beliefs that
women deserve a much higher level of recognition in sport and
recreation, which hopefully 
<?notus-xml column=1629?>should then encourage a more active lifestyle among UK females. Let us
start at the top. I was intrigued on Monday to read new research by the
Women’s Sport and Fitness Foundation that only 22% of board
members in 33 out of 57 national governing bodies are
female— up 2% from 2010, unchanged from
2011—despite government urging. Six publicly funded NGBs out of
those 57 have no women on their boards, as was mentioned earlier in
Oral Questions. The largest participant offender was British cycling,
despite the impact that British women cyclists made in the Olympic and
Paralympic Games. Indeed, only a couple of weeks ago 21
year-old Becky James made a further impact for British cycling when she
dashed into the record books when she won her second gold and a total
of four medals in the recent track cycling world championships in
Belarus—such an impact, no less, that Becky was featured on the
front page, in glorious technicolour, of the <I>Daily Telegraph</I>, so
perhaps the media are improving their recognition of our
sportswomen, but more on that
later.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000129" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000129">I am

making teas in the pavilions of England, if that is what the fear is

representation, as has been mentioned, should help to unlock the

let me go back to my theme of invisible women. In the 1980s, a feminist
called Dale Spender wrote several challenging books about the lack of
profile of women in education, literature and business. She maintained
that patriarchy served to subdue women and that they thereby became
invisible. She reminded us that there were very few women in some
professions and very few at the top of most professions. I want to
explore whether this is still an issue. An earlier feminist, Simone de
Beauvoir, speculated on why women always seemed to be wrong, why men
were more representative and more authoritative and why women’s
differences were seen as deficiencies. Is this still the
case?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000142" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000142">Dale
Spender maintained that men and power are the problem. She stated that
men are seen as authoritative; that male experience counts; and that
males have more influence on systems. Men are attributed with qualities
such as reason, objectiveness, leadership, independence, authority and
strength; women with being emotional, irrational, weak and hysterical.
In mixed contexts, Spender maintains, men talk more, interrupt more and
do not know that they are doing it. When women become visible and
assert power, then patriarchal values are under threat and it is
scary—look at the
Suffragettes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T12:42:58"></hs_TimeCode>. In
a recent survey, mentioned earlier, reference was

invisibility. I shall give a couple of examples from literature.
Spender points out that there were hundreds of women authors writing
for at least 150 years before Jane Austen—invisible women. Let
us take as an example the successful playwright and novelist, Aphra
Behn, writing in the 1600s, who produced plays, poetry and novels that
were immensely popular—Nell Gwynne starred in her most
successful play, “The Rover”. Aphra Behn was also an
international spy for Charles II. She was described by critics
as being “disgraceful” and “bawdy”, whereas
Virginia Woolf called her, more flatteringly, shady and amorous.
Another example is Mary Wollstonecraft, the 18th-century philosopher,
who wrote novels, historical plays and travel books, as well as being
an advocate of women’s rights. She was described by Walpole as
“a Hyena in petticoats”. When six volumes of biographies
on women were published in 1803, Mary Wollstonecraft was missed
out—invisible women. The novel <I>Mary Barton</I> was published
anonymously in 1848 to great praise. When it was known to be by a
woman, Elizabeth Gaskell, praise then turned to criticism. Women had to
publish under male pseudonyms—invisible
women.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000144" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000144">Has
this invisibility made a difference to how women see themselves today
and to why women are still largely absent from top posts in
industry, politics, sport, the Church and the media? Has it influenced
how men see women? Are women destined for certain jobs but not in the
first flight? Much worse than that, can women be treated with
disrespect—even violence? Is the status of women also improving

Women’s Day is to inspire, to celebrate women’s
achievements but, most importantly, to focus on issues that women have
to confront and the changes that need to take place. In the 1960s, the
feminist, bra-burning women’s lib movement set the scene and
signalled the beginning of real change towards equality. Hard-working
women like my beloved mother made many sacrifices for her daughters in
order for them to succeed, and I will be eternally grateful to my
mother.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000153" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000153">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T12:48:52"></hs_TimeCode>
am proud to say that, today, women are educated, influential and
powerful in many areas in society. Not all women—there are those
who are still struggling to break through the toughened glass ceiling,
especially women from culturally diverse backgrounds. But things have
improved dramatically from the days when the careers officer told my
mother, “I'm sorry, Mrs Benjamin, your daughter can’t
apply for that position. They don’t employ coloured people in
that company”. Thank goodness I had a feisty mother who never
took no for an
answer.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000154" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000154">Yes,
there has been progress but despite all this women’s equality,
as we sit here in the 21st century, on the eve of International
Women’s Day, we continue on an almost daily basis to witness
revelations of sexual and domestic violence against women, and the
sexualisation of young girls in a society where violent pornography is
only a mouse click away. This is a pan-global epidemic, underpinned by
the media and the internet which support imagery and attitudes that
relentlessly promote the idea that social emancipation and free speech
equal the freedom to flaunt the boundaries of decency, self-respect and
the sanctity of our bodies and souls. Women, especially young women and
girls, are the main casualties of
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000155" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000155">No
wonder that we witness highly sexualised behaviour by children and
young people when they are influenced so strongly to believe that
stardom, success, fame, riches and happiness can be achieved by using
sex as a commodity. Young boys are learning to see their female
counterparts as sexual objects, expected to perform in the same
way as they see on porn sites so easily accessible today to anyone with
a smartphone, computer or tablet. We now have degrading behaviour by
boys who force young girls to perform sexual acts, film the humiliating
action and then shame the girls by putting 
<?notus-xml column=1634?>it on the web. The girls in turn self-harm or even take their own lives.
This has to stop. The recent NSPCC report, <I>Saying the Unsayable</I>,
highlighted a dramatic increase in girls self-harming and committing
suicide because of sexual exploitation and
degradation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000156" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000156">We
are all aware that the sexual exploitation of women is ageless but in
recent times the globalisation of media and the internet has led to an
explosion in the sexual objectification of women. Women are encouraged,
paid, enticed and forced to portray themselves in more and more
explicit sexual ways. Young women university students advertise
themselves on websites as looking for a sugar daddy, and see this as a
perfectly acceptable way of advancing themselves both financially and
socially. My main worry is that, while all this is happening every day
before our very eyes, children and young people soak up this imagery
and accept the messages and culture that they portray as the
norm. In the era we are now living in, children and young
people lose their innocence far too early as they are exposed
relentlessly to this sexual culture, where many young women allow
themselves to be exploited, degraded and
manipulated.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000157" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000157">I
tell young women that I mentor never to compromise themselves with
their beauty, to respect themselves and keep their dignity intact. It
pays off in the long term. We have opened a Pandora’s box and I
have no answer as to how we can reverse the trend in the sexual
objectification of women or protect our children against its influence.
But I know that the global and domestic challenge is for women to join
together and lead the fight against this, and stop allowing females to
be exploited by the culture of sexualisation—for the sake of
their daughters and
granddaughters.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000158" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000158">Organisations
such as the Parent Zone are fighting back. They believe that the
internet and technological developments have given women access to
economic, social and political opportunities across the world but as
mothers they feel disempowered by an environment that ignores their
right to protect their children online. Access to their
children’s data and images is withheld by companies who have
created their children’s online world. There are international
laws in place protecting children online. However, mothers are
beginning to realise that in the UK their online rights do not match
their rights offline. In response to this, the Parent Zone has launched
the first <I>Charter of Parents’ </I><I>O</I><I>nline
</I><I>R</I><I>ights</I>, calling for the two to be brought into
line. The charter calls for parents to have the right to know
what data are stored about their child and challenge inaccuracies. They
should be able to intervene on behalf of their child if problems arise
online, have their consent sought when a child signs up to use an
online service and expect minimum safety standards for
children’s websites. This is the sort of initiative we must
promote and encourage to help parents—especially
mothers—fight back against a seemingly unstoppable march into a
moral wasteland. I hope that the Government will give support to this
initiative.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000159" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000159">I
tell children when I visit schools to learn to love and respect
themselves, have self-esteem and feel worthy even though they may be
suffering abuse. They must never feel it is their fault. They must live
their lives with integrity, honesty and above all have the moral 
<?notus-xml column=1635?>courage to stand up against those who want to take
advantage of them. We must ensure that all children understand the
meaning of unconditional love and long-term relationships within which
they can enjoy a fulfilling, healthy sexual partnership. We must give
our children—boys and girls—the guidance, education and
protection they need to achieve this well into their adult lives. As
women, we have the power to make the change for good so let us all join
forces together and do just that. I say to all women: let us celebrate
International Women’s Day and fight for this change, wherever
you are in the
world.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13030791000592" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000592"><I><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T12:55:57"></hs_TimeCode></I>12.56

O'Loan:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady
Stowell, for her introduction to this debate on International
Women’s Day. I also pay tribute to the right reverend Prelate

the erudition, eloquence and compassion that he will bring to debates
in this

UN theme for International Women’s Day is, “A promise is
a promise: time for action to end violence against women”. Women
come to their experience of violence through many routes.
Predominantly, they will be victims, either of domestic or war-zone
violence. In places such as Northern Ireland, where the Troubles have
dominated our lives for so long, that still takes a toll on
those who suffered: on the relatives of the dead, the maimed and the
families of the disappeared. There will also be those women who decide
to take an active part in conflict as combatants: up to 40% of some
groups are female. Those women combatants may ultimately be
peacemakers. No matter what role they play or position they hold in
relation to the conflict, the range of potential effects of violence is
similar. It is important to acknowledge that, to acknowledge that
violence has so many facets, and to identify what must be done to
address
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000162" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000162">I want
to address some of those facets. First, there is physical and sexual
abuse, and the lack of mechanisms, structures and the necessary
determination to prosecute such crimes. Reparations for rape, real
property theft and lost educational opportunities when children are
taken for camp slaves have to be dealt with quickly and effectively. In
many conflicts, the warlords openly acknowledge that they will rape
whole villages as a clear statement of the threat that they represent
and to force people into compliance. We have seen the abduction of
children from their families to be used as child soldiers, including
girls. In some conflicts, tens of thousands—some 50% of all
child soldiers—are girls. We probably all know the pressures to
which children are subject in organisations such as the Lord’s
Resistance Army: pressures to murder members of their family and each
other as the combatants seek to take total control of them. We have
seen the abduction of women and girls to be used as camp
slaves.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000163" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000163">Each
state has a responsibility—as does the international
community—to put an end to impunity and to prosecute those
responsible for such crimes. That does not happen very often. The
consequential exposure to sexually transmitted infection and
trauma-related illness give rise to huge medical and PTSD 
<?notus-xml column=1636?>treatment needs That can have an enormous impact on people’s
ability to deal with the ordinary challenges of life. They will have
higher levels of mental and physical illness, injury and suicide. That
is what we have experienced in Northern
Ireland.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000164" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000164">Displacement
from and the loss of their homes is a major problem. These women often
end up in IDP and refugee camps for years. Even when the conflict has
been resolved to the extent that it is possible for them to go home,
they may be reluctant to do so even where there is funding available
for them because they have access to health services, education and
maybe some protection and security. It has often seemed so terrible yet
so understandable to me that they can prefer living in UNHCR tents for
years, without electricity or running water, to going home where the
impact of the destruction of a local community in terms of
unsettled scores, suspicion and resentment may linger for years and
where people see the perpetrators of violence walking the streets and
even in government, occupying influential and highly paid
jobs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000165" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000165">That is
part of the price of peace. It can be very hard for those who still
seek reparations and the recovery of the disappeared. In Northern
Ireland we still have seven families grieving people who were abducted
and murdered, and whose bodies lie in unmarked graves that may never be
found. For each family this is a daily agony as it remembers the young
man or boy who went out one day and never came
back.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000166" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000166">In
conflicted societies one of the biggest barriers to equality for women
is often the existence of traditional laws and justice procedures.
Women are often not allowed to own property. That will have to change
and be a priority in each conflict zone. Where huge numbers of men have
died the widows and children risk homelessness and destitution unless
change is made. Returning combatants, often traumatised themselves,
often bring higher levels of domestic
violence.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000167" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000167">Issues
around demobilisation, decommissioning and resettlement must be dealt
with. Women have to fight for their share of funds, as money is
normally paid principally to men, who have had front-line posts,
leaving a disproportionate amount of the very scarce funds that are
available in the hands of men only. There is also the new phenomenon of
the vulnerability of some women to fundamentalism and the honour that
is perceived as coming to families when one of their number becomes a
suicide
bomber.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000168" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000168">Loss
of the opportunity to be educated, because of war, because teachers go
to war, or because it is not safe to go to school, impacts on
women’s ability to participate in society at all levels. Often
they cannot drive, even where motorbikes are about. That means that
their capacity to engage in commercial initiatives is limited. Women
need, above all, security so that they can access water, food and fuel.
In countries where there has been conflict and in others where there is
great poverty women will suffer not only violence but all the problems
associated with the daily trek for water and fuel, and with the grind
to grow food. In those circumstances men may resist attempts to bring
water to the community, because their women will then have free time
which they may not use as the men would wish.</hs_para>

times of violence there is also difficulty for women in accessing
health and other services, because of costs of travel, time, and the
fear and insecurity around travel. Often there is no hospital because
of a war, or they cannot afford the fare, they have no access to
transport and they are afraid. When you are about to have a baby this
can be a time of great need. I lived in Kenya when I was expecting my
third child. The rains were coming. It was a 40-kilometre drive up a
dirt road to the nearest mission hospital that had no electricity or
running water. Yet we knew that we had to go before the rains came. I
had that option. The other women in the community did not, because they
had no access to a
car.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000170" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000170">The
international community must urgently address the needs of the
“UN babies”, born as a consequence of a relationship,
prostitution or rape involving UN personnel. These babies may be
rejected by their fathers and the societies in which their mothers live
simply because they are visibly of a race different from the community
in which they
live.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000171" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000171">These
things will involve not just policy change, and planning, training and
development, but also changing the hearts and minds of many of those
who were the perpetrators of violence and who have lived often for
years in abnormal circumstances. There will inevitably be unsettled
scores, old hatreds, and a desire for punishment and vengeance that may
well have the capacity to destroy an embryonic state. Old combatants
will have to come to terms with living at peace with each other. It
will take time and energy. Many women have great skills that can be
utilised for the benefit of an emerging nation in those matters that
require mediation, such as prisoner release, disarmament, resettlement
and
reintegration.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000172" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000172">Gender-responsive
policy-making can be life-changing. Gender-responsive changes in the
mandates, practices and cultures of states and international
institutions are occurring. On International Women’s Day we
applaud the courage and determination of women who have emerged to take
their rightful place in local and national politics across the world.
We meet many of them at Westminster as they travel here to learn more
of our practices and procedures, and to be affirmed and encouraged in
their role as parliamentarians in situations infinitely more complex
and dangerous than those in which we operate. Those women will bring
the gender perspective to the debates and law-making of those
assemblies, so that each society and state can function to maximum
effect, benefiting from the talents of all its
members.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-07?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_07_PT_1/C8FF5BC59A282BA67139C9776F2C690C55A1153C" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 7 March 2013">Thursday,

play a central part in keeping families and communities together. There
is a strong link between achieving peace and the sustained development
and advancement of gender equality. Earlier this week I spoke in a
debate on the plans to mark the centenary of the First World War. This
was a key influence in the 
<?notus-xml column=1638?>development of women’s rights in the United Kingdom as women
often replaced the millions of men who had been called up to fight on
the front line. During this time, approximately 1.6 million women
joined the workforce across government departments and in business
administration, and played an invaluable role in our munitions
factories.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000175" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000175">The
past 100 years are full of numerous examples of the contributions to
world history made by remarkable women, such as the suffragettes, led
by the Pankhurst sisters. In that time we have covered a great deal of
ground, particularly in respect of voting rights, the opening up of
various professions, opportunities in higher education and positions in
businesses. I am heartened by the progress that we have made in

Nancy Astor took her seat in 1919, we have seen female representation
in the House of Commons increase to 22%, which is a significant step
forward, but we must move faster. We have a similar situation here in
the House of Lords. It is, however, encouraging that the numbers are
much healthier among our younger politicians, with women consisting of
half of the 28 MPs under the age of 30. It is accepted
nonetheless that women are still underrepresented in many aspects of

believe that this Government appreciate and understand the challenges
that we face. On a visit to Mumbai two weeks ago, the Prime Minister
stated that there are not enough women in boardrooms, or indeed around
the Cabinet table, and that companies and political parties need to be
more proactive in attracting women. We have already seen a number of
measures over the past two years that have helped women in various
respects. One of the most notable has been the establishment of the
Women’s Business Council. This looks to challenge the barriers
that women face in playing a fuller part in business and the workplace.
As a businessman, I am particularly excited by the potential benefits
for economic growth in addition to the further female empowerment that
could come from this. As an employer, I have always promoted my staff

accelerate our economic recovery and it is estimated that such action

United Nations theme for International Women’s Day 2013 is
ending violence against women. Domestic violence against women often
takes place in households where children are present, and in some cases
these children are also victims of abuse. There should be an increase
in support services for children who have witnessed abuse and for those
who are victims of domestic violence. Research suggests that a
number of adults who witnessed domestic violence as children
are perpetrators of violence against their partners. It is 
<?notus-xml column=1639?>also thought that the current economic climate could
have the effect of increasing acts of domestic violence in households

more attention should be given to identifying those who are most

people greater opportunities. Women have historically been deprived of
chances to gain access to further education, and this has contributed
to further inequality in the workplace. I am pleased to note that there

higher education in Britain. Last week, I was asked by the high
commissioner of Bangladesh to present awards to British Bangladeshi
school leavers who had attained very good results, and I was pleased to
note that more girls than boys had been given the awards. However,
these improvements are not reflected in the poorer parts of the world.

Prosser:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, thank the noble Baroness, Lady
Stowell, for initiating this debate in celebration of International
Women’s Day. The title of the debate enables us to roam far and
wide, and we know that the issues are many and various, but I have
chosen to concentrate my remarks on ways in which
the situation of women can be improved by the actions 
<?notus-xml column=1640?>and interventions of men and boys, which the
Minister mentioned in her opening remarks. It was the subject of the
thematic debate at the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women
in 2004 and 2009, and is reflected to some extent within the detail and
requirements of a number of the millennium development
goals.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000185" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000185">Before
we depress ourselves completely on the downside of the situation, let
us consider how far, over the past 50 or so years, society’s
view of women has moved on. Last year, my noble friend Lord Monks
forwarded to me an e-mail entitled “Can You Believe
This?”. The content of the e-mail consisted of a series of
American 1950s newspaper and magazine advertisements commonly used at
that time without a hint of irony or even a raised eyebrow. One is an
ad for a Kenwood Chef food mixer. The man is saying, “The Chef
does everything but cook, but that’s what wives are for”.
His happy, smiling wife is looking very grateful. The second is for a
vacuum cleaner, which is decorated with a lovely blue satin ribbon. A
beautiful woman is lying on the floor beside the object, stroking it
and reading the gift card. The wording on the ad says,
“Christmas morning she’ll be happier with a
Hoover”. I somehow doubt she was happy even then, but she
certainly would not be now.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13030791000186" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000186">Of course things have
moved on, and the advertising industry would not dream of suggesting
such copy now, but media images of women still concentrate on a
woman’s looks, size and age. Older women lose out on television
and in theatre and film because there are so few strong and central
roles available to them. Female presenters and newsreaders have to look
perfect with not a coiffed hair out of place. This would not be so
irritating if the same criteria were applied to men but, judging by
some of the sights we see, this clearly is not the case. There is a big
responsibility here for men at the top of TV and radio to recognise
that this is not only silly and unfair but presents a skewed image of
women and helps to promote the notion of woman as
object.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000187" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000187">Advertising
and the media are not, of course, the only areas with room for
improvement. Comments have been made this week by the previous Master
of the Rolls, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Neuberger, regarding the
small number of female senior judges. He unsurprisingly comes out
against positive discrimination, but positive action programmes could
be used to help improve the balance. Special events not just for women
but to which senior women from the legal profession are invited could
be used to help those women get to know the senior men in the
profession, and to help the senior men realise that women lawyers are
not, after all, such a strange species, and that just like the men they
too might have hopes of moving on and
up.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000188" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000188">The
Government’s encouragement of the work of my noble friend Lord
Davies in increasing the number of women on company boards is to be
lauded and welcomed. However, the businessmen in those companies should
not need to wait for government initiatives and pressure. They could,
for example, introduce special training programmes to help bring
forward some of the women already employed in the company so that
they feel ready to move through the pipeline. It
makes economic sense and helps to instil commitment to the 
<?notus-xml column=1641?>organisation. Companies should also ensure that they have good
return-to-work programmes enabling mothers to continue with their
careers, and add to that by welcoming and encouraging paternity leave
and flexibility for
fathers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000189" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000189">Encouraging
women to hold down senior positions in the public and private sectors,
and ensuring that they can do so, should not be seen as some sort of
extra-curricular activity, but still we continue to have to press the
point home. Why, for example, are there not more opportunities for good
quality part-time jobs? This is not rocket science, as was shown by two
young women in 2005 who started an organisation called Women Like Us.
This came about from frustrated conversations at the school gates
between them and other young mums looking for decent part-time work.
Linking their demands with the needs of local employers proved a very
successful approach and, late last year, with the sponsorship of Ernst
&amp; Young, Women Like Us launched Timewise Jobs, a website dedicated
to providing access to quality part-time professional employment
vacancies.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000190" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000190">Come
on, all you male employers: use a bit of imagination and initiative.
Not only will you be on the road to providing a better gender-balanced
workforce, you will save money by not losing good and committed female
staff who find it impossible to balance full-time employment with being
a
parent.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000191" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000191">There
are a million and one ways in which men could be more helpful and could
use their influence to increase women’s chances and status. Most
important is to start at the beginning, and to look at the role of
families and education. It would be wonderful if all families were
sufficiently well organised and caring of each other to allow us to say
that the home is where appropriate influences should begin and end. It
is of course key that we encourage parents to set a good example by
treating each other with respect. Seeing fathers help in the
home—cooking, tending children and so on—also provides
good role models.</hs_para>

not all families are able or willing to do this, and the role of the
state then becomes important. This could be encapsulated in the
Department for Education’s personal, social, health and economic
education programme. Unfortunately, this is not part of the core
curriculum so many young people will not have the chance to look at
life, women and girls in a different and, I hope, more respectful way.
This is a missed opportunity on the part of the Government to be able
to say that they are playing their part in ensuring that the gender
gap, which manifests itself in so many ways in our society, is
recognised as being in real need of attention, and that they will play
a leading and strategic role in addressing the part that can be played
by men and
boys.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-07?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_07_PT_1/CCFE70E3DDF4F6EC87FC836CE0C583E126C46527" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 7 March 2013">Thursday,

Women’s Day is always a time to reflect on the rights of women,
proclaimed, of course, in the 18th century—as the noble
Baroness, Lady Massey of Darwen, reminded us—but secured only
very gradually across many decades in many different countries, in many
different legislatures and by the action of many different people. We
should remember in all this that the rights of women are not to be
contrasted with the rights of men; they are rights that today, as
earlier, are claimed and defended in the name of our common humanity.
They are affirmed in some of the great documents of the modern world:
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 and the European
Convention on Human Rights of
1950<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T13:22:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000195" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000195">Earlier
today at Question Time, there was reference to the question of whether
the United Kingdom might withdraw from the European convention. I will
just observe that the irritation that people express is often directed
at the court, not at the convention. If we had a British Bill of human
rights, I am pretty convinced that it would contain the same rights
that are in the European convention, but of course we might lose touch
with some of the necessary jurisprudence for interpreting those rights
if we made such a
shift<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000196" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000196">However,
we must all admit, and there have been many illustrations of this
point, that the extension of rights to women is a very long-fought
battle. It is a battle in which many countries have entered
reservations, sometimes in order to afford additional protection to
women—in matters such as night work, pregnancy or military
service—but sometimes to differentiate the rights of men and
women in areas such as family law, inheritance or succession. Hence the
complexity of the process by which the United Nations has gradually
inched the issue of women’s rights
forward.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000197" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000197">Despite
continuing disputes about some of these reservations, though, the most
remarkable thing is the progress that has been made in recognising the
rights of women and girls, not merely—and proudly—in this
country but across virtually every country in the world. There are, of
course, still horrifying cases in which the rights of women are
systematically ignored, where legislation does not restrict forced
marriage or domestic violence, genital mutilation or—unmentioned
so far but as serious as any of these—forced child-bearing. The
deepened recognition and protection of women’s rights is one of
the most profound social transformations of the past century, and it is
to be greatly
welcomed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000198" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000198">It
is very easy to miss the profundity and scope of that transformation if
one concentrates only on the human rights declarations and conventions.
Human rights documents, in the nature of the case, set out certain
aspirations. They seem lofty and abstract. The realisation of
women’s rights is another matter, for rights are indeed no more
than rhetoric if we do not secure the counterpart obligations. This
fundamental point about rights was made with great elegance and
accuracy by Clement Attlee, speaking in Scarborough in 1951. He

us a sense of what women’s rights are really about. I do not
mean that we should focus once again on obligations or duties at the
expense of rights, but we should acknowledge the indispensable
interdependence of rights and obligations. Rights without duties are
indeed mere rhetoric. Women’s rights are not going to be
realised by proclamation—although proclamation has its point and
there is a time for it—but rather by respect for and fulfilment
of the corresponding obligations. These obligations are rather too
often identified with securing legislation in each jurisdiction that

we now know that it requires more than legislation, legislation by
itself is not enough to secure respect for rights. There is a tendency
to imagine that in the case of human rights, all obligations lie with
states. That is patently mistaken. Often, obligations lie with
individuals and with the institutions of civil society, and the role of
states and of legislation in particular is to back up and secure the
performance of obligations, when that is the right way to secure

public service progressing in taking steps to encourage the appointment
of a reasonable proportion of women to senior posts, and to the boards
to which it makes appointments? Secondly, our progress in securing and
supporting women’s rights is monitored under CEDAW, the
United Nations Convention on the Elimination on All Forms of
Discrimination against Women. The seventh periodic review of UK

means much to me as my father was one of the millions who suffered the
horrific conditions in the trenches. I would like us to quickly reflect
on how far women have come since then. That Great War was a real
turning point for women. The first “total war” effort
demanded the mobilisation of the whole country. The traditional
workforce of millions of men was sent out to battle. This created a
need for new workers, a need that could be filled only by women. Truly
significant numbers started work, but the impact of war on the
employment of women meant that suddenly they were able to break into
jobs that had previously been the preserve of men, such as heavy
industry, munitions and police
work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000204" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000204">Since
then, each year has seen what may appear to be slight, incremental
changes for us as individuals. When they are viewed as a whole, though,

Emmeline Pankhurst, who as a Tory has always been an inspiration for
Conservative women. We have had universal suffrage, women attending

apprenticeships. Last year the scheme’s founder, Diane Johnson,
the first woman president of the ECA, won a prestigious First Women

started the two-year Wired for Success course, which, when completed,
will give them a qualification to work competently and safely in a
domestic environment. There are now 10 women nearing the end

securing this debate to mark International Women’s Day, which
allows me to raise the plight of women prisoners in the UK and to mark
another noteworthy event: the groundbreaking report published six years
ago this month by my noble friend Lady Corston. Thanks in large part to
her review, there have been improvements in some aspects of treatment,
notably the ending of the routine strip-searching of prisoners, but
there is still much to do. I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Howe of
Idlicote, for raising this issue so eloquently earlier; I hope that
noble Lords will forgive me if I restate some of her

consensus that there are better ways to deal with young
vulnerable women, often addicted, with mental health issues,
unemployed, often homeless yet also parents, than by locking them up
for short-term prison sentences for non-violent crimes. However,
despite this consensus and the key recommendation by my noble friend
Lady Corston in 2007 that custodial sentences for women must be
reserved for serious and violent offenders who pose a threat to the

noble friend Lady Corston’s report set out the stark facts. Most
women prisoners were mothers, some were pregnant and they were often
drug users, with habits of £200 a day for crack and heroin. Many
were alcoholics and many were unwell, in poor physical and mental
health. Common experiences included sexual, emotional and physical
abuse, leading to chaotic lifestyles. There was often
self-harming.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000212" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000212">The
Corston report argued strongly that there are fundamental differences
between male and female offenders and those at risk of offending that
indicate that a different and distinct approach is needed for women.
Proportionately more women than men are remanded in custody. Women
commit a different range of offences from men. They commit more
acquisitive crime and have a lower involvement in serious violence,
criminal damage and professional crime. Relationship 
<?notus-xml column=1646?>problems feature strongly in women’s pathways into crime.
Coercion by men can form a route into criminal activity for some women.
Drug addiction plays a huge part in all offending and this is
disproportionately the case with women. Mental health problems are far
more prevalent among women in prison than in the male prison
population. Self-harm in prison is a huge problem and more prevalent in
the women’s

represent just under 5% of the overall prison population, standing at
3,967 this month. At the end of June 2012, 58% of sentenced women
entering prison were to serve sentences of six months or less. The life
chances of these women, even before offending, are severely
disadvantaged. According to statistics published by the campaign group
Women in Prison, one in four women in prison has spent time in local
authority care as a child. Nearly 40% of women in prison left school
before the age of 16—almost one in 10 were aged 13 or
younger—and 30% were permanently excluded from school. Over half
the women in prison report having suffered domestic violence, and one

already vulnerable women suffer more, once in prison. Women account for
47% of all incidents of self harm, and 30% of women as compared to 10%

attempted suicide at some time in their life; 51% have severe and
enduring mental illness; 47% have a major depressive disorder; 6%
suffer from psychosis; and 3% suffer from schizophrenia. Eighty-three
per cent stated that they had a longstanding illness, compared with 32%
of the general female population, and 73% were on medication on arrival
at prison. The Ministry of Justice has admitted that women may be less
able—for example, because of mental health issues—to
conform to prison rules and therefore are often subject to higher rates
of disciplinary proceedings than
men.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000215" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000215">Not only
do women suffer grievously by being imprisoned but so do their
families. It is estimated that more than 17,000 children are separated
from their mothers each year by imprisonment. Only half of the women
who had lived or were in contact with their children prior to
imprisonment had received a visit since going to prison. Maintaining
contact with children is made more difficult by the distance at which
many prisoners are held from their home area. This is a particularly
acute problem for women given the number of women’s prisons; in
2009, 753 women were held more than 100 miles from

statistics prove the need to fully implement the Corston recommendation
that community solutions for non-violent women offenders should be the
norm, and that community sentences must be designed to take account of

Afshar:</Member></B> My Lords, I add my thanks to the noble Baroness,
Lady Stowell, for putting this debate on the agenda. On this occasion I
will speak on the experiences of Iranian women, whose access to
education has been systematically curtailed over the past decade, and
ask whether it would be possible for conditions allowing bright,
qualified, English-speaking Iranian students who apply for universities
and have the resources to be more easily admitted via the visa
requirements. However, before doing so, I point out that the reason why
the access of Iranian women to education has been severely curtailed by
the Iranian Government over the past decade is the fear that, through
education, they will gain familiarity with and knowledge of their
Islamic
rights.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000222" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000222">Some
14 centuries ago Islam gave women rights that are the subject of
discussion in this debate today. I will begin with the right of
independent means. Muslim women never lose their property on marriage.
As I said to my husband when I married him, what I have is
mine—and what he has is mine too. The reason for that is, to
follow the comment made by the noble Baroness, Lady O’Neill, the
duty of reciprocity. That is to say, Muslim men first have the duty to
pay for women to agree to sign a marital contract. Marriage is a matter
of contract between consenting partners, and men must pay women to
participate and sign in the first place. They can impose any condition
they like, and these are contractually binding
agreements<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T13:45:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

marriage and motherhood are not indivisible. The noble Baroness, Lady
Prosser, raised questions about paying for childcare and motherhood.
The reality is that Islam, 14 centuries ago, gave women the right to
choose. If they chose to be mothers, they were entitled to payment, not
by the state but by men—by their husbands. If they chose to do
housework they were entitled to ask for payment—again, by their
husbands. Therefore, essentially, rights that as a feminist in
the West I have been fighting for ever since I have been
in England were bestowed on Muslim women 14 centuries
ago<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T13:46:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000224" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000224">However,
in order to exercise these rights women need to be familiar with the
Koranic teachings and with what Islam offers them. This is
the Iranian Government’s fear. In fact, they have two fears: the
first is of women knowing their Islamic rights, and the second is the
fear of the West—of West-toxification, of Iranian women being
intoxicated by the West. They have nowhere to
turn<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T13:46:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000225" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000225">After
the Iranian revolution, the post-revolutionary Iranian Government
closed all universities in order to cleanse them of any kind of western
influence. When they reopened the universities only 10% of university
students were women, because women were deemed unsuitable to attend
university. However, using their Koranic rights and the teachings of
Islam, women fought, and within a decade they made up 18% of university
places, eventually reaching 50% of the student
population.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000226" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000226">Far

fear was exacerbated when women made further progress until they
comprised 65% of students at universities, simply because they were
willing to work harder; they passed entrance exams, which are set for
all, and they did better than men. We all know that women often do
better than men if they are given the
chance.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13030791000228" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000228">By
2009, 68% of all graduates in the sciences at Iranian universities were
women. This caused real fear on the part of the Iranian Government.
Ayatollah Khamenei, the spiritual leader, ordered a second cleansing of
university material—and Islamification all over again. As part
of this, they felt that there had to be severe segregation between men
and women; women would study particular subjects while men would study
other, more suitable subjects. The result of that was that by the year
1213, 77 fields of study were considered to be male only, and therefore
unsuitable for women. The one women-only subject was nursing; it was
recognised that we might be good carers, but nothing else
mattered<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T13:49:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that because the female dormitories were limited, fewer women would
attend universities from towns other than Tehran. Furthermore, it was
felt that educated women who accessed universities and read the limited
range of subjects that they were allowed to study caused a very serious
problem. First, they tended to marry later. Secondly, they tended to be
much choosier about who they married and they preferred to
marry men who were equally well or better educated than themselves, so
the poor old uneducated men were 
<?notus-xml column=1649?>left on the shelf. That was not considered
acceptable. Of particular importance was the fact that educated women
had fewer children. Following that, the Iranian Government have imposed
draconian measures that have resulted in a number of prestigious
universities, such as the Oil Industry University and Isfahan
University, no longer admitting women. Those universities that do admit
women limit them to a very restricted range of subjects. Human rights,
English literature, women’s studies and a whole raft of subjects
are considered unsuitable for women. I suppose they think that women
might get interested in other subjects through reading English
literature<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T13:51:04"></hs_TimeCode>. At
this crucial point it is very important to open doors for those Iranian
women who are able to go to university to enable them to do so in
countries such as the UK and to treat them as freedom fighters, not
potential
terrorists.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13030791000599" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0001.htm#13030791000599"><I><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T13:51:20"></hs_TimeCode></I>1.51

those memorials and see the names of the people who died, comprising
family name after family name, it is very reminiscent of some of the
memorials in eastern Europe to the dead of World War 2. Bosnia was the

the slow process of matching these bones has begun so that bodies can

been said, International Women’s Day gives us an opportunity to
reflect on progress made and to call for change. To reflect on
progress made, it is perhaps best to begin here in Parliament and in
government. There are now 20 countries in which a woman is head of
state or government or both, which is a small but upward trend, but
fewer than one in five parliamentarians in the world are women. As
someone has already said, at the current rate of progress a child born
today will draw her pension before she has any chance of being equally
represented in the parliament of her country.</hs_para>

the Prime Minister’s pledge to have a third of ministerial

happening now for parliamentary constituencies, we must all work even
harder to improve the momentum for political parties to improve the
numbers of women represented in Parliament. Women in parliaments
everywhere can make a difference. Two weeks ago, on Valentine’s
Day, parliamentarians from all parties joined the One Billion Rising

sing and dance to stop violence against women. The theme of
International Women’s Day this year is “A promise is a

50% of sexual assaults are committed against girls under the age of 16.
Over 600 million women live in countries where domestic violence is not
yet considered a crime. Up to 70% of women in the world report having
experienced physical and/or sexual 
<?notus-xml column=1652?>violence at some point in their lifetime, and over 60 million
girls are child brides before they are 18. The One Billion Rising
campaign in the UK ran workshops to find out what would make the
biggest difference in addressing domestic violence. The overwhelming
majority thought that a change in attitude had to start with education
to prevent it happening in the first place and that sex and
relationship education should be statutory in all schools. I would
include free schools and academies in that as well. They are not alone.
Most of the agencies that work in this field, including the PSHE
Association, have also been campaigning for this.</hs_para>

know that the Government have conducted a review of PSHE, and I hope
the Minister will assure us that they have taken note of these informed
voices and will indicate when the outcome of that review will be
published. We need to move away from sex education that focuses
exclusively on the reproductive aspects of adolescent sexuality and
recognise that sexually active and sexually abstinent young people need
information in order to be able to make informed choices. Currently,
parents can withdraw their children from sex education up to the age of
19, even though the legal age of consent is 16. Horses and stable doors
come to mind.</hs_para>

role to play in helping young people develop healthy attitudes and
behaviour, especially when figures show just how routine sexual
bullying and harassment are in schools. One in three 16 to
18 year-old girls say they have been groped or have
experienced unwanted touching. One in three teenage girls have
experienced sexual violence from their boyfriends. We need specialist
staff who are committed, experienced, mature and comfortable with this
obviously sensitive issue. A recent survey by Brook showed that more
than a quarter of secondary school pupils received no sex and
relationship education and over a quarter of those who did reported
that the teacher was unable to teach it well, so a greater emphasis on
PSHE education in initial teacher training and in qualification
programmes for head teachers is also needed.</hs_para>

has changed, as the noble Baroness, Lady Benjamin, has said. Mobile
porn has replaced internet porn. Young people need help to distinguish
between healthy relationships and unhealthy ones, especially as many
have no example to follow at home. Research shows that boys
have a higher tolerance of sexual violence than girls and need to be
challenged at an early age about what is acceptable behaviour. However,
new technologies and new ways of communication can play a helpful role.
Thanks to a Twitter storm at the weekend, Amazon was forced to withdraw
from its website T-shirts with slogans promoting rape and violence.
“Keep calm and knife her” was one of the nicer ones that
I can repeat. The company involved claimed that the slogans had been
automatically generated using a scripted computer process, but no
T-shirts denigrating men were on sale. So now we know that computers
are also

Black of Brentwood:</Member></B> My Lords, I have always believed that
it is one of the priceless privileges of our House that we can give a
voice to the voiceless. In this excellent debate on International
Women’s Day—I join others in thanking my noble friend for
securing it—I want to lend my voice to a lady named Florence
Ky’eeyse, who lives in a small plot of land on the outskirts of
a village called Butale in Uganda. Her story comes to me from a very
dear friend who knows her well. Florence is a 35 year-old, educated and
dignified woman. She is a widow whose husband died seven years ago and
she is bringing up two children—one boy and one girl—on
her own.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000251" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000251">Life
for Florence is increasingly tough. Her late husband’s family
keep trying to evict her from the land she inherited when her husband
died. A woman’s property rights are often undermined when the
husband dies. Bringing up her children is a struggle. She wants them to
have a better life than she had, but she cannot afford the tuition
fees. Only one child is entitled to free schooling at the mission
school. Money is very tight. Her two- acre plot of land would once have
supported the family, but in recent years Uganda, which had until
recently a very balanced climate, has been suffering from the effects
of extreme weather, and the banana trees, which provide the staple
food, have been struck with banana wilt, a disease that kills
them.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13030791000252" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000252">Florence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T14:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
works very hard growing matoke to scrape a living and keeps some
chickens. In a good month her income is about 100,000 Ugandan
shillings, which is about £25. From this she must keep her
children fed, clothed and educated. There is no money for luxuries such
as electricity, and water must be fetched from a well.
Charcoal, which is increasingly expensive, is the only way to
cook, and kerosene is used to light the house. Very
occasionally, Florence and her family have some meat, but that is very
rare because the chickens are too valuable to consume. While Florence
earns 100,000 shillings a month, her outlay just to subsist
is 103,000 shillings: a gap that is small but which is getting bigger.
That is where the most terrible problem—the one I want to talk
about today—bites. Florence has AIDS; she was infected by her
late husband. Of her two children, one—her young son—is
also HIV positive.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13030791000253" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000253">Too many, I fear,
believe that the problem with HIV in Africa is getting better because
of the increasing availability of antiretrovirals, and indeed there has
been some welcome progress. However, Florence’s story tells us
something different. There is no medical care in her village. There
used to be a small clinic but it closed two years ago. The only place
she can get medicine is in Masaka, 12 miles away. That would cost her
1,500 shillings in transport on a boda-boda, a local bicycle taxi:
money that she does not often have. The alternative is to walk the 24
miles there and back, which means that she is unable to work on the
land to earn money to keep the family, a vicious cycle of poverty and
illness.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=1654?><hs_para UID="13030791000254" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000254">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T14:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
short, Florence and her family have no access to life-saving drugs. She
takes them irregularly when she can get hold of them, but that
irregularity is doing her great harm. She goes to the hospital only
when she is desperately ill, which happens all too frequently, because
her and her son’s shattered immune systems leave them
easy prey to infection. Malaria, too, is a real problem, and frequent
bouts of that terrible illness leave them increasingly weakened.
Antibiotics are expensive and frequently compromised or out of
date.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000255" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000255">All<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T14:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
that means, I am afraid, is that Florence will die before too
long—as I understand it, possibly in the next few
months—and her son soon after. Her 14 year- old
daughter, instead of completing her education, will have to nurse them,
and watch what remains of her kith and kin leave her. It is another
hard-working, educated, decent family entangled in an inescapable web
of poverty and disease, and destroyed by
AIDS.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000256" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000256">Florence’s
terrible story, replicated in thousands of cases all over Africa,
contains one central point that we should remember on International
Women’s Day; although there have been major advances in treating
HIV and AIDS, many organisations ignore the fact that in the rural
areas of Africa it remains next to impossible for those suffering to
access the drugs that could save their lives. Even though the drugs are
free, the distance and costs involved are beyond their reach. The
problems are deeper than that, for women in rural Africa have always
worked the land; often they are the primary workers. However, they
cannot work the land if they are sick or making long journeys to find
care. It is a cycle of despair that consumes
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000257" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000257">A few

sub-Saharan Africa, young women are 205 times more likely to be
infected than young men. Little wonder that women now comprise 50% of
people living with HIV worldwide. The burdens of stigma, discrimination
and marginalisation combine with the harsh economic realities of life
that I have just described to create conditions that mean that women
such as Florence will continue to die in their tens of thousands. We
cannot sit back and watch. It is surely time for a holistic policy
approach to the treatment of HIV and AIDS among women in the developing
world, one that tackles the problems that prevent them accessing
life-saving drugs that those in the developed world take for granted.
It is therefore not just about medicine but about infrastructure,
transport and money.</hs_parafo>

ask my noble friend to ensure that this issue stays close to the top of
the Government’s agenda for tackling disease and poverty in the
developing world. If the message from this House today and the actions
of government within the international community and the NGOs are loud
and clear, we could perhaps begin to end this spiral of disaster. To my
deep regret, and to the shame of so many, that will be too late for
Florence and her son. All I can do for them is send them a copy of the

world on International Women’s Day will show us that one in
three women will be raped or beaten in her lifetime. According to UN
Women, up to 70% of women in some countries face physical and/or sexual
violence in their lifetime. In addition, some 140 million girls have
suffered female genital mutilation, and millions will be subjected to
forced marriage and trafficking, as referred to by the noble Lord, Lord

that poverty is a close relative of violence against women. It is

campaigns and call for international targets to be achieved and aid

implementing UK law where it exists to protect girls and women. I am
thinking of the law already on the statute book, the intention of which
is to protect little girls in this country at our state schools from
the lifetime horror of female genital mutilation. The campaigning work
on FGM of my noble friend Lady Rendell is rightly to be acknowledged,
as is the work of the present and previous Governments on this issue. I
welcome the Government’s announcement this week of £35
million towards the eradication of FGM. It is a national disgrace that
some 24,000 girls living in

tortured in this barbaric procedure. Why, we must ask, after
30 years of law on this issue, have there been no
prosecutions? I would like to hear from the Minister what the

debate and thank the Minister, the noble Baroness, Lady Stowell of
Beeston, for her gracious contribution. The Minister referred to
yesterday’s debate in this House about sexual violence. I was
unfortunately unable to take part because, for a rare moment, the role
of motherhood triumphed and I attended a parents’ evening. Had I
been present, I would have commended our Government’s progress
in eradicating the use of rape as a weapon of war.</hs_para>

begin by saluting my noble sister Baronesses across the House, if I may
be allowed to call them sisters. I salute them for their tenacity,
resilience and contribution to enhancing our public life. It is not
often that we give a roll call to our own champions and heroines.
Therefore, I want to remember that our Parliament has been enriched by
the contributions of Diane Abbott and Dawn Butler; the noble
Baronesses, Lady King of Bow, Lady Howells of St Davids, Lady Amos,
Lady Young of Hornsey, Lady Falkner of Margravine, Lady Flather and
Lady Prashar; the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Scotland; and the

these women continue to inspire our generation and young women and men.
As the first Muslim appointed to this House, I have found it staggering
that it took more than a decade to get our act in order. A layer of
discrimination has been broken by honourable Members in another place
with the election of Rushanara Ali, Yasmin Qureshi, Shabana Mahmood,
Seema Malhotra, Valerie Vaz, Priti Patel, Helen Grant and Chi Onwura.
These women have given strength to Parliament. Theirs are the hitherto
missing voices of Asian and black women in Parliament. Their collective
entrance to the mother of Parliaments demonstrates that British-born
women of minority heritage are just as capable and confident as
any others. Access to networking opportunities prevents many
more participating in the political process and holding office. As well
as those in the other place, I also acknowledge the work of the noble
Baronesses, Lady Warsi and Lady Verma, who contribute as Ministers to
this Government.</hs_para>

full of complex emotions. While women of course have the vote and are

face impossible odds to succeed in senior management positions and on

military objectives as a weapon of war. Many women with these

I am in awe of the amount of experience, passion and expertise which

my working life has been in public service. I have never worked in the
private sector. I have worked for local authorities, for the NHS or in
the voluntary sector. Because I know what a hugely fulfilling
experience this has been, I am concerned, even appalled, by recent
reports about the fact that the number of women in British public life
is plummeting; that there are fewer women now in senior positions in
the judiciary, 
<?notus-xml column=1659?>the arts, education, finance, the Civil Service and government than 10
years ago. Nearly 40 years after the Sex Discrimination Act and despite
a huge influx of women into professions such as law and medicine at the

positions remains very firmly
uncracked.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000281" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000281">I
count myself extremely fortunate to be able to sit in a legislature
without standing for election, because of the peculiar institution that
is the House of Lords. I know that it is ironic that I am saying that
we should have more representation of women when I sit in a House that
has only 21% women and, although we have many bishops, no women
bishops, as the marvellous maiden speech of the right reverend Prelate
has reminded us. It is of concern to me, and should be to all women,
that we are 51% of the population, but only 22% of the House of Commons

point came in 2008 when Gordon Brown appointed Jacqui Smith as the

40 female MPs had ever held ministerial office. By the time that

a third of all ministerial posts. Currently, I am sad to say, many

the battle for equality was won a while ago—by my generation,
perhaps—but it is simply not true. Some people might say that it

we find ourselves going backwards? One reason might be lack of
leadership from the top. We still have a female Home Secretary, and
other women do very well in some branches of industry, but the fact
that there are so few sends a message to other women. Is the treatment
by the media of women in public life harsher than it is for men? I

it is hard to give up power. Power largely resides in the hands of men,
who understandably want to retain it. Inadequate childcare is certainly
a factor. A recent survey shows that two out of three local authorities

is in all our interests to enable those women, many of them over 50, to

contribution to the economy is vital in both roles but we must also
ensure that the caring role does not of itself lead them to live in
poverty or build up poverty for the future because of a lack of pension
contributions or savings. I am pleased to say that, yesterday, Carers

as public service goes, we must ask: what can we do about it? We can

hundreds, of people in my time, I know that men tend to oversell
themselves while women go the other way and undersell themselves. In
that regard, increasing the self-confidence of women is all-important.

potential. This is not something that only holds back women, it holds
back general economic performance and growth. According 
<?notus-xml column=1661?>to a recent International Labour Organisation report, the percentage of

imaginative mix of events of all types, many involving children. An
event that particularly caught my eye was called, Suffragettes—A
Liverpool Story, highlighting the struggle of women for the right to

apposite as we are now just three months away from the centenary of the
death of Emily Wilding Davison, the incredibly brave woman who took the
suffragette movement’s slogan “deeds not words” to

afield, I noticed earlier this week, an all-female climbing team

it has not all been good news, and contrasting with the many positive
stories of this week there was one that represented a set-back. Two

further, sinister, example of some men's prejudices against women
emerged as recently as last week. The internet sales company Amazon was
advertising T-shirts for sale which encouraged violence against women,
using slogans that I will certainly not repeat, although 
<?notus-xml column=1662?>one went as far as to encourage rape. The garments were removed as soon
as both Amazon and the company selling the T-shirts began to be
bombarded with texts, tweets and emails expressing outrage. However, it
is instructive that someone, somewhere, must have sat down and drafted
these slogans, clearly from the viewpoint that they were not only
acceptable but that people—men of course—would be willing
to buy them and then wear them, publicly stating that they regarded
women as suitable objects for serious violence in various forms. It is
telling that the company that produced the T-shirts was initially
surprised at the reaction. I am pleased to say it soon got the message,
which was rammed home in no uncertain terms as widespread anger
inundated its social media sites, all of which had to be closed down as
a result. The company said that it had received death threats and that
its Twitter account was bombarded with scores of angry messages, many
of which said, “Rape is not a joke”. It is appalling that
in 2013 people still need to be reminded of that self-evident
truth.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000301" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000301">I want

Equal Pay Act. It may be recalled that, although that Act got onto the
statute book in 1970, there was a five-year lead-in period for
employers to make the changes necessary to accommodate the legislation.
That was always an optimistic aim, but I doubt that anybody then would
have thought that, 40 years later, more than a quarter of the gender
pay gap would remain to be filled. In 1975, women earned 36% less than
median male hourly earnings; the latest available figure which was
issued in April last year in the <I>Annual Survey of Hours and
Earnings</I>, is 9.6%. That represents the comparison between full-time
workers, and excludes overtime earnings. But, of course, more men than
women work overtime, and more women than men work part-time, so the
9.6% figure gives a distorted view of the gap in actual take-home pay
between men and women. Taking all employees into account, the gender
pay gap in 2012 was
19.7%.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000302" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000302">So only
three-quarters of the journey that began four decades ago has been
completed and much remains to be done before the destination is
reached. Some years ago—2006 to the best of my
knowledge—the report of the Women and Work Commission was
published. The commission was ably led by my noble friend Lady Prosser,
from whom we heard earlier in this debate. That report demonstrated
that the gender pay gap in Britain was then one of the worst in Europe.
Six years on, progress has certainly been made, but many of the
underlying issues that underpin and perpetuate the gap
remain.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000303" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000303">I cite
one example. There has been much publicity in recent years over certain
public sector jobs where pay discrimination has been tolerated for
years; too often, it should be said, with the connivance of the trade
unions of which those women were members. Now, following industrial
tribunal decisions and in some cases courts at the highest level, local
authorities and some health authorities are faced with massive bills to
give women the back pay that is due to them. That is a difficult
situation for them as employers, but 
<?notus-xml column=1663?>it is not the women's fault that the discrimination was allowed to
persist for so long. It is totally unfair that some should attempt to
make them feel guilty for seeking what is rightfully theirs. Public
sector bodies ought to have seen this coming and acted accordingly.
Some of them have claimed that they now face a choice between their
legal commitments and maintaining services. They should face up to
their responsibilities and ensure that women do not need to return to
court to receive the fair settlement due to them. One means of dealing
with this may be to offer an immediate lump sum, with staged future
payments which would have the effect of enhancing women’s
pensions over the
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000304" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000304">There
are different issues in the private sector, where there is often much
less transparency. I have spoken to people who say that they have been
told by employers that disclosing their pay to work colleagues
constitutes a disciplinary offence. That is surely unacceptable because
it is no more and no less than a device to enable employers to pay
less, certainly not more, than a fair rate, and it hurts female workers
disproportionately. It also highlights the need not just for collective
bargaining, but for trade unions to enforce it and to continue
campaigning for equality of treatment for all in the
workplace.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000305" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000305">In
conclusion, in almost all countries, women continue to be
under-represented in decision-making positions. Women's work continues
to be undervalued, underpaid, or not paid at all. That is why
International Women’s Day is so important. It spells out our
responsibility to work for enduring change in values and attitudes, a
message clearly enunciated by noble Lords participating in this debate
today.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-07?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_07_PT_1/47BF05F8413F5BA4CDFFB32EC5A94D4828AC09B4" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 7 March 2013">Thursday,

Thornton:</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate the noble Baroness,
Lady Stowell, on initiating this debate, and particularly congratulate
the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Coventry on his great maiden
speech. We look forward to more speeches from him as time goes on. My
maiden speech was referred to in this debate. I have to say, it
happened not just to me but to the noble Baronesses, Lady Uddin and
Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer. We all made our maiden speeches about
family-friendly working hours at 10 o’clock at night. Indeed, my
children were in the gallery in their pyjamas watching me at the
time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000307" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000307">We have
had some brilliant speeches today. I am particularly drawn to the
comments by the noble Baroness, Lady Heyhoe-Flint, in her remarks about
barriers to women in sports and clubs, being stuck in the car park, and
so on. It reminded me of an experience I had about 30 years ago when I
decided to throw my hat in the ring for selection for a by-election in
Bradford, which is where I am from. I turned up to one of the selection
meetings at a working men’s club. I was the only woman who was
being seen. All the men walked in to take part in the meeting, but I
was not allowed to walk in—I had to be signed in by the
secretary of the club, because women were not allowed to be members. I
am happy to say that I doubt whether that goes on in working
men’s clubs these days.</hs_para>

Women’s Day is a day for celebration, there is no doubt of that,
and I am sure that noble Lords and the Minister will all be joining
women across the world in singing “One Woman”, the
International Women’s Day song which will be launched tomorrow.
It is a musical celebration of women world wide, featuring more than 20
artists from across the world. Unlike the Minister, when the first
International Women’s Day was launched by the United Nations in
1975, I was at the London School of Economics and the women’s
group there had a party to celebrate it. However, I do not remember
much about

thousands of events will take place not only tomorrow but throughout
the month of March to mark the economic, political and social
achievements of women. As has already been mentioned by noble Lords,
the theme which has been declared by the United Nations for 2013 is,
“A promise is a promise: time for action to end violence against
women”. In 2012 the theme was, “Empower rural women: end
hunger and poverty”. In fact, every year since 1975 there has
been a different theme. Parliaments and countries can choose their own
theme for International Women’s Day, of course. In 2012, the
European Parliament used a theme around equal pay for work of equal
value. We can be proud of the 400 events in the United Kingdom. As my
noble friend said, the United Nations website indicates that the UK is
the most active country in the world in terms of celebrating
International Women’s Day. It could be that other countries have
not bothered to send in what activities are taking place, and certainly
I am in favour of a few flowers being presented.</hs_para>

can be proud of the role played by the UK on the international stage,
and particularly of our role in the creation of UN Women, the
United Nations entity for gender equality and the empowerment of women.
When it was founded, the United Nations took an historic step in
accelerating the organisation’s goals on gender equality and the
empowerment of women. I am particularly proud that during the time I
was in Government with Harriet Harman and as part of the equalities
team, we were key to the promotion and establishment of UN Women. In
fact, on one occasion I had a tiny part to play. I was sent to an
international women’s event and my job was to lobby some of the
leading women from around the world to persuade them to persuade the
United Nations to cough up the money to establish UN Women. That lobby
included Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the president of Liberia. I have to say
that she was one of the most impressive people that I have ever met in
my life—and of course she was completely solid on the objectives
we had in mind<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T14:52:16"></hs_TimeCode>.
I also congratulate the Government on the fact that they have continued
to support and fund UN Women; indeed, according to the annual report
which I read recently, they have increased their
contribution<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T14:52:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that the United Nations has made significant progress over many decades
in advancing gender equality through landmark agreements such as the
Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the Convention on the
Elimination of Discrimination Against Women—CEDAW—which
was referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady O’Neill. It is also
true to say 
<?notus-xml column=1665?>that the United Kingdom is represented at all these
bodies by cross-party groups of women. It is to the
credit of this country that whichever Government are in power, they
have undertaken to take representative groups of women to all of these
events. I know that many of my noble friends have taken part in them
over the years, particularly my noble friend Lady
Gould<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T14:53:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

are proud of the historic role we have played in supporting gender
equality over the years. That support goes right back to the days of
supporting the family allowance being paid to women. Moreover, Votes
for Women was part of our original platform when we were founded as a
party. We have supported all the equality legislation since the Second
World War: the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, the Equal Pay Act 1970,
maternity rights and domestic violence legislation, the Equality Acts
2006 and 2010; and support for women at work and parents with children.
As my noble friends Lady Nye and Lady Pitkeathley mentioned, we have
the best record of any UK political party in terms of women’s
representation with more women MPs than all the other political parties
put together. We have near-equal representation of women and men in the
devolved bodies, and many women representing their local communities on
councils up and down the

doubt that the two Ministers seated opposite me are totally committed
to the representation of women in their parties and that, along with
their colleagues, they have worked and endeavoured over the years to
try to increase the representation of women. Indeed, I know they have
done that because I have spoken about this to women in other political
parties over many years. But the fact remains that if our political
parties are left to their own devices in their selection
processes—I include my own in this—predominantly, they
are going to select men. That is why the Labour Party went down the
road of all-women shortlists, and that is why in our target of 80 seats
for the next general election—this is set out in a document that
we published last week or the week before—half of the selections
will be made from all-women shortlists. That is because we are
determined that we should have a Parliament that represents the
electorate and is at least 50% women. However, we cannot do that on our
own. We need the other political parties to take positive action. I do
not enjoy the fact that we force our constituency Labour parties to
pick women candidates, but the reality is just as I have said: if left
to their own devices, all but the most progressive will select men as
their candidates, whether consciously or unconsciously.</hs_para>

we really believe that women are any less capable than men as
politicians? I will just point to the fact that our all-women shortlist
system has delivered a more representative and stronger Parliamentary
Labour Party with a new generation of talented women MPs. I mention
Rachel Reeves, Gloria De Piero, Stella Creasy, Bridget Phillipson and
Luciana Berger. All of them were selected on all-women shortlists and I
would dare anybody to suggest that they are second-class candidates or
second-class representatives of their communities; of course they are
not. It shows that positive action works. The challenge I would like to
pose to the other

two other matters because although this is a time for celebration,
there are a couple of things that we need to look at. The first
concerns older women—and I include myself in the group. We are a
generation of active older women who have led very different lives from
those of our mothers. We are the first generation, if you like, who
have been doing it all. We have had jobs and we have brought up
families. Some 71% of women aged between 45 and 64—I am towards
the upper end of that group—think that employers offer too few
opportunities to older women when recruiting staff. In 1983, only 13%
of older women thought that. We live longer and we are in better health
than our mothers were at our age. However, this group is losing out the
most from the Government’s pension changes because they will
have to continue working longer than they expected. This generation is
angry about being regarded as “past it”, being overlooked
for responsibility and promotion, and being prioritised for redundancy.
Some of us are very annoyed that the wisdom and experience of older
women are not valued in the same way as they are for older men. That is
exemplified by the portrayal of older women on television, as we all
know<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T14:58:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

include myself—are holding families and communities together, a
point made by the right reverend Prelate. We pick up the pieces. We
look after the grandchildren because childcare costs are going up. We
care for our elderly relatives as social care services are shredded. We
are the ones being stretched in every direction. It is time that public
policy caught up with this generation of older women. In the Labour
Party we have launched the Commission on Older Women, chaired by
Harriet Harman MP, to investigate the policy implications for women in
their fifties and sixties and what they are facing, and to look for
longer-term policy solutions. The commission will focus on older women
in the workplace, older women and their caring responsibilities, and
older women in public life. All I can say is: watch this space,
because I think that the commission is going to produce some
interesting
results<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T14:59:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

earlier end of women’s lives and the position of younger
mothers. The noble Baroness, Lady Stowell, said that the Government
have helped women, are positive about them, and are doing a great deal
for them. In some senses they are, but I think we need to look at the
objective evidence because some of it points in the opposite direction,
particularly for young mothers. David Cameron promised to lead the most
family-friendly Government ever, but since this coalition Government
came to power, new mums have been among the hardest hit by the
coalition’s tax and benefit changes. From April this year, the
Government will restrict maternity pay to a 1% annual increase and by
2015, in real terms, this cut in maternity pay will effectively be a
£180 “mummy tax” on working women, on top of the
additional cuts being faced by new mums. Nationally, up to 1.2 million
people, including previous children and dads alongside mums, will be
affected by the mummy tax each year. We estimate—this is from
the House of Commons Library so is almost 
<?notus-xml column=1667?>certainly true—that 210,000 new mums will be
hardest hit by this cap. That is why the Labour Party is launching a
campaign for this International Women’s Day and for Mothering
Sunday called “mums not millionaires”. At the same time
as the Government are cutting taxes for people earning over £1
million, the figures compiled by the House of Commons Library confirm
that the lowest-paid new mums will lose £1,300 during pregnancy
and the baby’s first year, and a further £422 from cuts
to child benefit over the same period. This is not a women-friendly
agenda<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T15:01:08"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T15:01:06"></hs_TimeCode>.

conclusion, I join with everyone in the House in this celebration of
women, their achievements and the progress they have made. However, as
my noble friends Lady Massey and Lady Crawley said, this is a long road
that we tread. As the noble Baroness, Lady Afshar, my noble friend Lord
Mitchell and the noble Lord, Lord Black, said, this is a very tough
road indeed for millions of women across the world. We should not
forget that it was through political activity—sometimes militant
political activity—that women won the vote and have made
possible the progress that we celebrate today.</hs_para>

Northover:</Member></B> My Lords, the debates in the House of Lords for
International Women’s Day are always outstanding and this one
has been no exception. There is such a huge range of experience and
commitment among your Lordships in this area that it is a great
privilege for me to respond for the Government. I start by paying a
particular tribute to right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Coventry,
who chose to make his very moving maiden speech in this debate today
and who will clearly make a major contribution to our debates in the
Lords. I welcome him and, with him, hope that it will not be too long
before we do indeed hear a maiden speech from a woman

have marked International Women’s Day for more than a century,
and it is right that we do so. The lives of women in this country have
been transformed over that century, as my noble friend Lady Seccombe so
clearly showed. The noble Baroness, Lady O’Neill, noted this as
the most profound social transformation, and she is surely right. For
many of us, we are the first in our families to go to university, yet
our daughters, as well as our sons, expect nothing less should they
wish to do so. We have the vote and the right to own property, to be
employed on equal terms and not to belong to our husbands, fathers or,
for that matter, to our sons. However, as noble Lords have made very
clear in their speeches, inequalities persist: women earn less and we
have by far the larger responsibility for children, the home and the
care of elderly relatives as well as working. As the noble Lord, Lord
Parekh, 
<?notus-xml column=1668?>the noble Baroness, Lady Nye, the noble Lord, Lord Watson, and others
pointed out, women are less likely to be in the House of Commons or
House of Lords, on boards, at the top of companies, in our Supreme
Court, among our judges, on our sports boards, editors of newspapers
and so on. We see progress but sometimes it seems to be at a
snail’s pace. As the noble Baroness, Lady Howe of Idlicote,
said, it is a long road. Where women are not able to fulfil their
aspirations to play their full part, in whatever way that might be, as
my noble friend Lady Stowell so effectively explained in relation to
her friend Julie, that is quite simply a loss of talent. Our economy
and, more importantly, entire society misses
out.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000322" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000322">Supporting<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T15:05:11"></hs_TimeCode>
the most vulnerable in our society has been fundamental to our
approach. That is why we are cutting tax for more than 23 million
working people, lifting 2 million out of income tax altogether, the
majority of whom are women. We are making changes to our state pension
that will provide enormous benefits to older women, who may have broken
records or contributions because they took time out to care for
children or the elderly. Our ring-fencing the health budget
particularly assists women, who are greater users of healthcare than
men, whether through maternity care, through taking their children for
care or in later life. Our acceptance of the Dilnot proposals,
addressing an issue that has plagued our health and social care system
since the establishment of the NHS, and about which no party in power
since has been willing to do anything other than undertake yet another
inquiry into, is game-changing. Noble Lords will recall that it is
women who are disproportionately the recipients and givers of
care.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000323" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000323">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T15:06:18"></hs_TimeCode>

encourage young women to make ambitious choices. As the noble Baroness,
Lady Massey, suggests, there are areas of the labour market where women
still seem invisible. We need to encourage women to choose subjects
such as science, technology and engineering at A-level and at
university to enable them to flourish in today’s economy. We are
introducing shared parental leave, extending the right to request

now only six all-male boards. The Women’s Business Council will
also be making recommendations on how we support women executives
progressing up the executive ladder. I do not think that there is a
shortage of potential talent. I was a trustee in a leading
organisation, and when I stood down I urged that more women should be
appointed. However, I was told there were none. I mentioned a name;
they said, “Yes, but besides her, there aren’t
any”. I mentioned several others; and, as with the
“Life of Brian” and the Romans, they  
<?notus-xml column=1669?>said “Yes, but besides those there aren’t any”. To
my satisfaction, that board is now chaired by one of the women I
recommended.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000325" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000325">We
have role models elsewhere. This summer, we have seen so many. London
2012 was a triumph for women’s sport, showcasing positive role
models such as Jess Ennis, Victoria Pendleton and Ellie Simmonds, as my
noble friend Lady Heyhoe Flint made so very clear. Hearing my noble
friend on the subject of various sexist golf courses reminded me of an
experience I had in Saudi Arabia. I was part of a parliamentary
delegation staying in a very western hotel. I hope that my noble friend
Lady Heyhoe Flint will appreciate that I took my swimsuit with me and,
one evening, went down to the pool to swim. I was told that I could not
because it was not the “women’s hour” to swim. I
asked when the women’s hour was and was told that there was not
one. There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T15:09:00"></hs_TimeCode> are

tackle violence against women and girls and take it very seriously. We
have protected central government funding for tackling violence against
women and, last year, we announced that forced marriage will now become
a criminal offence in England and Wales. We are also clear that we will
change damaging behaviour only when we have changed the underlying
attitudes that cause that behaviour, a point referred to by the noble
Baroness, Lady Nye. Prevention is key, which is why, with our teenage
relationship abuse and rape prevention campaigns, we are helping young
people to recognise abuse and understand when to seek help. The noble
Baroness, Lady Nye, asked about PSHE and when the outcome of the review
will come through. The Government’s internal review was extended
to take account of the outcome of the wider national curriculum review
and the Department for Education expects to make an announcement
shortly. I assure her and my noble friend Lady Benjamin that the
statutory guidance for sex and relationship education makes clear that
schools should ensure that young people develop positive values,

noble Baroness, Lady Crawley, and others mentioned the powerful One
Billion Rising campaign, and it is extremely important to have that
kind of campaign keeping us all on our toes. The noble Baroness
specifically mentioned FGM and rightly paid tribute to the work in this
area of her colleague, the noble Baroness, Lady Rendell. The Government
are also frustrated, as was the noble Baroness, Lady Crawley, by the
lack of prosecutions in the past 25 years. We welcome the fact that
Keir Starmer, the Director of Public Prosecutions, who published a CPS
action plan in November, is seeking to improve prosecutions for FGM. As
the noble Baroness will know, a major new programme is also being
designed by DfID to support 
<?notus-xml column=1670?>efforts to end the practice in sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East.

to follow through from the work done by the previous Government to keep
women out of prison. I visited Holloway prison and realised very
strongly how important it is, not only to the women themselves but to
the children who are usually dependent on these women. I saw in

published his recommendations last year. We are using these to
work with media, business and regulators to implement, and they include
stricter guidelines from the Advertising Standards Authority on
sexualised on-street adverts, the launch of the ParentPort website for
people to make complaints about media and advertising—we heard
some horrendous stories earlier—and an agreement from four of
the largest internet service providers on a code of practice, including

270 or so, there is a quota for 60 women’s seats. When I visited
in 2006, women parliamentarians were marginalised, but they have used
their block of seats in the most extraordinary fashion in the past five
years. Working together across political parties, they have identified
laws that discriminate against women and had them thrown out. They have
moved on to laws that protect women; for example, on workplace
harassment and criminalising acid attacks. The women have carried out
70% of all parliamentary business and their achievements are
remarkable. I visited the survivors of acid attacks; for example, a
woman who sought a divorce from her husband and he threw acid at her.
If he was not to have her, then no one should want her. She sat bravely
on the steps of the Parliament when the Bill came up, supported by
civil society and highlighted in the media. The women persuaded their
male colleagues and saw the Bill passed. I think that the work of the

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, this is a timely debate
ahead of Commonwealth Week, which starts on Monday and provides a
platform for countries around the world to join together in celebration
of the links that they share as members of the Commonwealth. As my
right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and
Commonwealth Affairs recently affirmed in his response to the Commons
Foreign Affairs Committee report on the role and future of the
Commonwealth, the Government are committed to strengthening our
engagement with, and our role within, the Commonwealth. A strong
Commonwealth is important to the national interests of all its member
states. It can help us to promote democratic values, good governance
and prosperity. This is no longer the British Commonwealth but a
network of like-minded nations with shared history, values and
interests within which the UK plays an active and leading
role.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000343" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000343">One
of the greatest challenges we face is ensuring that the Commonwealth
keeps pace with today’s changing world. Much work has already
been done to respond to this challenge and the UK has been active in
this. Our Commonwealth policy over the past two years has focused on
modernising and improving the organisation’s internal
institutions and strengthening respect for its values. We are pleased
that modernisation discussions that started before the Commonwealth
Heads of Government Meeting in Perth in 2011 reached a conclusion last
year, and that the heads have endorsed a number of reforms including
the new Commonwealth charter. That we were able to agree so many of
these reforms is a testament to the work of my right honourable friend
the Minister of State for the Commonwealth and my noble friend Lord
Howell of Guildford, whose speech will follow mine. In some ways, this
debate is a celebration of my noble friend’s two and a half
years in the FCO as Commonwealth Minister, to which I pay
tribute.</hs_para>

hope that all noble Lords will join me in welcoming the adoption of the
Commonwealth charter, which we see as one of the most important
outcomes from the Commonwealth modernisation process. The charter
conveys clearly the values that the Commonwealth stands for, bringing
together commitments set out in previous declarations and
affirmations. Next week, the charter will be presented to Her
Majesty the Queen as head of the Commonwealth and launched across the
Commonwealth.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000345" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000345">For
the first time in its 64-year history, the Commonwealth now has a
single document setting out the core values and aspirations of its
members, and it is all the more significant because it has come at a
time when human rights and democratic values are demanded more vocally
than ever by citizens across the world. It is now important that we
work collectively to raise the charter’s profile, both within
the UK and throughout the Commonwealth, to embed it within the
Commonwealth’s architecture and ensure that all its members
uphold those values. We support the Commonwealth
Secretary-General’s call for members to launch the charter
nationally during next week’s Commonwealth Week. We are
delighted that debates are taking place in both Houses and we are in
touch with Commonwealth, civil society and youth organisations to
promote the charter in the
UK.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000346" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000346">We
recognise, too, that there need to be mechanisms in place to ensure
that all Commonwealth countries support the values that they have
agreed to in the charter. We strongly supported the reform of the
Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group, adopted in Perth, giving the
group more teeth to respond to violations of Commonwealth values.
Through its timely and robust response to the political crisis in the
Maldives last year, the group demonstrated that it could work in new
ways and make a positive contribution to international reconciliation
efforts. We would like to see the group demonstrate that it can play a
valuable and effective role in addressing a range of situations of
concern.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000347" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000347">Our
work on the modernisation agenda has helped to focus the Commonwealth
on the importance of democracy and respect for core values. This
creates the conditions in which businesses can flourish by giving them
confidence to invest in trade. That in turn creates more jobs and
drives greater prosperity. This is what the Prime Minister has called
the “golden thread”: the link between the rule of law,
effective but limited government, strong civil institutions, well
protected property rights, open markets and successful and sustainable
economic development. The Commonwealth Week theme this year,
“Opportunity through Enterprise”, is particularly
relevant for encouraging innovation at this time of global economic
challenge.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000348" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000348">Commonwealth
members share principles of democracy, the rule of law and good
governance, and we have similar legal systems. These provide solid
foundations for doing business and a platform for trade,
investment, development and, all pulled together, prosperity. Some
studies have estimated this Commonwealth effect of a shared legal and
regulatory market framework to be between 20% and 50% in trade
advantage. As it should, the UK out-trades its European
comparators—Germany, Italy and France—in trade with
Commonwealth countries.</hs_para>

Commonwealth network has influence in nearly every international
country grouping, making it a key vehicle for promoting regional trade
integration. India, South Africa, Canada, Australia and the UK
make up a quarter of the G20, the world’s premier global
economic forum at present. The Commonwealth exports over £3
trillion of goods and services a year, so the potential for all of us
is great; but for trade with Commonwealth countries truly to flourish
the Commonwealth needs to encourage conditions that will allow it to do
so. One example is to remove barriers to trade, such as unnecessary red
tape and, sadly too often,
corruption.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000350" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000350">Trade
is not the only way to increase prosperity. The Department for
International Development’s Bilateral Aid Review in 2011
confirmed that many Commonwealth states still need international aid
and support. DfID has increased the proportion of bilateral programme
expenditure to Commonwealth countries. Total DfID bilateral spend in

and as a leading voice on global issues and a niche development
assistance provider. To continue to add value when there are many
larger and often better resourced development providers, the
Secretariat needs to improve its efficiency and effectiveness and to
carve out a niche role for itself. The secretariat’s strategic

completely were Commonwealth markets washed out of British concerns in
the previous century that, even today, it is frankly very hard to come
by any statistics of what is now happening with incredible speed across
the global trade and investment pattern. Most figures are gloriously
out of date. However, we know that exports to Commonwealth countries
have jumped by 120% in the past decade, and much more if one just looks
at services. We know that a fast-growing Commonwealth GDP is poised to
overtake the GDP of the entire European Union, and that
intra-Commonwealth trade has been rising fast. We know that vast new
consumer markets are opening up in India, south Asia, parts of Africa
and Latin America. We know that thanks in part to the new shale oil and
gas revolution, which is totally transforming the world’s energy
balance, many African countries now face a far brighter future. We know

course, the Commonwealth stands for the highest ideals of human rights,
the rule of law and good governance, summed up in successive
declarations—Singapore; Harare; and, finally, the Charter of the
Commonwealth, which was agreed last December. It is unique and diverse,

Caribbean and Pacific islands and the members of the overseas

already done to this Chamber in another capacity, a unique experience
of global affairs through his visits to all parts of the Anglican

right to contribute to this debate. The first is because the history of
my city in the past 40 years is quite inexplicable without

40 years ago after Idi Amin’s expulsions, set in
train a series of migrations from the subcontinent, Africa, and more
recently from around the world, which have transformed the culture,
economy and reputation of the city for the better. They have also
embedded networks of family relationships, friendships and business
connections with Commonwealth countries in south Asia and east and west
Africa in particular. Further, they bring a familiarity with the
concept of Commonwealth as a network of different religions, cultures
and ethnicities under a common leadership for the common

the three world-class universities of Leicester, Loughborough and De
Montfort all educate large numbers of young people from Commonwealth
countries, as any visit to a degree ceremony demonstrates, with the
immense potential that that creates for inter- generational

many others expressed in the Home Affairs Committee’s report

temple, the priest of which is a Tamil refugee whose family were killed

I draw attention to the capacity of the Anglican Communion’s
network of partnerships with dioceses in Commonwealth countries to plan
and execute exchanges between individuals and communities for mutual
learning and understanding. From Leicester two years ago, 24 junior
clergy from towns and villages across the diocese visited Trichy
Tanjore in Tamil Nadu in south India, establishing friendships and
links that change outlooks and perceptions for a lifetime. They were
followed by a group of young adults from sixth forms and colleges,
experiencing at first hand a range of development programmes with tea
planters, Dalits and fishing communities. Their experience
“conscientatised” them to many of the issues around tax
avoidance and the hiding of money from public scrutiny that so
massively reduces revenues that could promote
development.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000389" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000389">At
the same time, we are planning similar visits to our links in Tanzania.
Schools from Leicester, Tanzania and south India are now in regular
contact, and we are in the process of creating a triangular
relationship between churches and communities in the United Kingdom, in
Tanzania and in south India. These friendships and relationships are a
vivid reminder that the Commonwealth is more than a political or
economic entity and its significance extends beyond the political
classes. I hope that that vision of the Commonwealth will be deepened
and broadened by our debate

Williams of Oystermouth:</Member></B> I echo the gratitude expressed by

subject.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000391" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000391">I
note, as have other noble Lords, the wholly distinctive character of
the Commonwealth as a family of independent nations allied, not
primarily for military, or even economic, security, but by a shared
history that has been translated into a shared vision of ethical
politics. The proposed Commonwealth Charter, which has rightly been so
warmly welcomed, sets out the main lines of this ethical vision with
clarity and force and we must all hope that it will work as an
unambiguous point of reference in dealing with crises and failures in
the life of individual Commonwealth states, to which reference has
already been made.</hs_para>

attention to the points made about the eradication of all kinds of
discrimination—especially today mentioning discrimination
against women—a properly pluralistic and transparent political
culture, 
<?notus-xml column=1683?>environmental priorities and the protection of more vulnerable states.
In short, the charter defines an impressive project that deserves the
strongest support from this country and its Government. For this
project to be realised, a number of commitments on the part of the
United Kingdom will need to be honoured and developed. The extensive
support given to Commonwealth students, not least through DfID and the
FCO, remains a key element in this. I was very much encouraged to hear
the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, underlining this in his opening
remarks.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13030791000393" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000393">We
could enumerate the fruits of these exchanges at length, but perhaps
the most important thing to note is the way in which Commonwealth
students can be equipped to promote a transparent and accountable
political culture in their own contexts, in large part by the
experience that they gain here of active civil society networks. Even
where it is a matter of students coming from so-called developed
countries in the Commonwealth, there is still an agenda of building and
cementing partnerships and learning to collaborate effectively in
support of the more vulnerable members of the family. We should
therefore applaud the support given as part of our development
programme to such student opportunities and keep a sharp eye out for
any suggestion that there are easy economies to be made by reducing
these. That would be a very short-term view: if we indeed want a stable
and just international environment, the Commonwealth will play its part
by fostering cadres of young leaders with a strong commitment to civil
society and human
rights.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000394" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000394">We
need to keep under review those aspects of our Border Agency activities
which may impinge negatively on the welcome offered to those who come
from the Commonwealth to study, a point touched upon by the right
reverend Prelate, the Bishop of Leicester. This does not apply only to
students. Is it really appropriate, for example, that a respected
academic from a developed Commonwealth country should be required to
provide for the central administration an account of every trip that he
or she makes away from their academic base? I refer to a case that has
lately become somewhat notorious in Cambridge. Similarly, the immense
complications that attend the visa system for many who plan short-stay
study trips or attendance at conferences or training events in the UK
have not done much to win hearts and minds. I think back to the hours
spent by former colleagues at Lambeth Palace arguing about the bona
fides of bishops and others from Commonwealth nations seeking to attend
church gatherings here. I do not suggest that there is a quick fix to
these concerns, only that the current situation maximises the
possibilities of embarrassment and unfairness and needs constant
monitoring and
review.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000395" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000395">I move
briefly to a second point. The Commonwealth Charter’s clarity
about transparency and the vision of what a moment ago I called a
stable and just international environment should combine to prompt some
continuing questions about the effectiveness of tax governance in
Commonwealth countries. Effective and fair taxation would be agreed by
all of us to be a cornerstone of good political governance and social
stability, and that point has been underlined very strongly in a recent
Commonwealth Secretariat paper. Christian Aid, of 
<?notus-xml column=1684?>which I have the honour to be chair-designate, has estimated that $160
billion are lost annually to developing economies worldwide, many of
them Commonwealth states, because of the evasion of local tax by
multinational interests. At the same time, ironically, a significant
number of Commonwealth states and British Overseas Territories function
as tax havens, and so compound those
problems.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000396" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000396">Her
Majesty’s Government have given welcome signs of concern about
these matters and they will be on the agenda for the next G8 meeting. I
trust that others will join me in hoping that the Government will bring
some pressure to bear within the Commonwealth itself on these matters,
looking to a commitment to better sharing of information on hidden
assets and perhaps raising the matter at this year’s Overseas
Territories Joint Ministerial
Council.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000397" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000397">Those
issues represent wide cross-party concern; but more
importantly for today, they are entirely in line with the vision so
eloquently set out in the Commonwealth Charter. The potential of our
Commonwealth to be a beacon of equitable practice is very great, and
the will is manifestly there. I trust that today’s debate may
assist us towards a future in which we may continue to be proud of our
unique Commonwealth family as a model of both cultural diversity and

Watson of Invergowrie:</Member></B> My Lords, the Commonwealth is a
force for good in many ways and I welcome the charter. It gives the
organisation, for the first time in its 64-year history, a single
document setting out its core values. Yet the <I>D</I><I>eclaration of
Commonwealth P</I><I>rinciples</I> from 1971 includes
this:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13030791000554" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000554">“We
believe in the liberty of the individual, in equal rights for all
citizens regardless of race, colour, creed or political belief, and in
their inalienable right to participate by means of free and democratic
political processes in framing the society in which they live. We
therefore strive to promote in each of our countries those
representative institutions and guarantees for personal freedom under
the law that are our common
heritage”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="13030791000530" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000530">However,

certain human rights issues, the record of many Commonwealth countries
is out of step with much of the developed world … The
FCO’s 2011 report on human rights and other sources have
recorded intolerance of homosexuality in a number of Commonwealth
countries … and the FCO reported that it had recently found it
necessary to raise concerns about the possible criminalisation of
same-sex marriage in Nigeria and the human rights of homosexual people
in
Cameroon”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="13030791000532" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000532">The
language used was guarded and the report gave no suggestion that the
Committee had pursued this fundamental issue of human rights any
further, but at least it mentioned homosexual repression, unlike the
Government’s response to the Foreign Affairs Committee’s
report, which did not mention it at all. That is a matter of great
regret, because the attitudes and policies of many Commonwealth
Governments are shocking. I argue they require urgently to be dragged
into the 20th century, never mind the 21st. Article II of
the newly signed charter
states:</hs_parafo><hs_quote UID="13030791000557" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000557">“We

have already referred to. The “other grounds” are not
specified but they clearly include lesbian, gay, bisexual and
transgender people, even though consensus could not be achieved for
spelling that out in the charter. Of course, that serves merely to
highlight the bigotry and discrimination that is rampant among so many
of the Commonwealth’s member countries, a disgrace that should
give every Member of this House pause for
thought.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13030791000410" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000410">Indeed,
the level of homophobic persecution in the Commonwealth beggars
belief. More than 40 Commonwealth countries—80% of the
total—currently criminalise homosexuality, mostly as a result of
laws imposed by Britain during the colonial era that were not repealed
when these nations won their independence. For example, penalties for
homosexuality include  
<?notus-xml column=1687?>25 years in jail in Trinidad and Tobago, and 20 years plus flogging in
Malaysia. Several Commonwealth countries stipulate life imprisonment
for sex between men: Bangladesh, Guyana, Pakistan, Sierra Leone,
Tanzania and Uganda. There are currently, or have been, severe
homophobic witch-hunts in several other Commonwealth countries
including Cameroon, Ghana, Malawi, Nigeria, the Gambia, Uganda and
Zimbabwe.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000411" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000411">The
Government have already expressed concern about the anti-gay Bill that
is currently in front of the Nigerian Parliament. Nigeria already has
extremely tough anti-gay legislation that designates up to
14 years in jail for men who have sex with men. In the north
of the country, where Sharia law prevails, gay and bisexual men can
face the death
penalty.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000412" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000412">Enough
is enough: it is time the Commonwealth took a stand against such
barbaric behaviour. There are four policies that I believe Her
Majesty’s Government should urge all Commonwealth member states
to agree to enact: first, the immediate decriminalisation of
homosexuality; secondly, the introduction of laws prohibiting
discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity;
thirdly, the introduction and/or enforcement of legislation against
threats and violence, to protect lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender
people from hate crimes; and fourthly, the offer of consultation and
dialogue with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender
organisations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000413" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000413">Until
such steps are instigated, the reputation of the Commonwealth as a body
that seeks to uphold and advance human rights throughout its membership
will remain indelibly tarnished. Indeed, until such steps are
instigated, I believe that the Commonwealth is not an organisation that
deserves to be taken seriously in that area of its work, which is a
statement that I make as much in sorrow as in
anger.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13030791000616" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000616">4.17

Howe of Aberavon:</Member></B> My Lords, there may be some surprise
when I commence by saying that this has been one of my interests for
more than 75 years. I long cherished the card that was given to me
through the Carmel Sunday school in Aberavon, which was issued by King
George V on his Silver Jubilee. The card
said:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13030791000558" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000558">“I
ask you to remember that in days to come you will be citizens of a
great
Empire”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="13030791000534" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000534">I
am glad to welcome that proposition, although the conclusion may be
rather different from that which the King was expecting at that time.
The contents most compactly set out in the Charter of the Commonwealth,
which have been explained and endorsed already by a number of
colleagues, set out what should be the non-imperial
conclusion.</hs_parafo>
<hs_para UID="13030791000415" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000415">I look back on the
period when I was able to struggle to play some part in it. some 12
years after that Sunday school, I found myself on the equator in Kenya,
as a lieutenant in the Royal Signals but attached to the East African
Signals, themselves attached to the King’s African
Rifles. One of my tasks was to run the educational part that we were
meant to play with our very effective, long-serving African soldiers.
There were about 100 soldiers in that unit including about a 
<?notus-xml column=1688?>dozen Britons, almost all of whom had been in the Burma campaign. Some
of the African soldiers had been in London for the victory parade and
had been able to establish partnerships with British citizens here at
home. I was trying, when doing the non-military work that I had to do,
to persuade them that Bwana “Kingy George” was rather
better than Bwana Joe Stalin. I hope that I succeeded to some extent.
It means having the direct experience of a reality that was less of an
empire and more of a partnership, which is what many speakers today
have already identified
with.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000416" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000416">The
concept of empire implies authoritarianism. We can see some examples of
imperial authoritarianism, which loom in my mind, which help to distort
or reform our thinking. I remember, when I had come back from Kenya and
arrived at Cambridge, that a gentleman called Patrick Gordon Walker was
the Secretary of State for the Commonwealth. He provoked a tremendous
student demonstration of horror when he sacked the head of
Bechuanaland, Seretse Khama, for the incredible reason that Seretse
Khama had married a former London typist. That was struck as something
contrary to all his other aspects. Many of us reacted with great
hostility to that. It led, among other things, to the emergence and the
creation by Conservative young colleagues like myself of the Bow Group,
when we saw other features taking place. Between 1950 and 1960 there
had been an inflow of some 750,000 people from this empire, and it very
much strengthened our feeling that we had to make sure that
discrimination did not become part of our
territory.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000417" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000417">Since
then, I have been able to see the way in which the Commonwealth worked
during my time in office, in a very pragmatic and positive way. For
example, the Commonwealth Finance Ministers meeting, of which I was
chairman during my time as Chancellor, was in itself all the more
important than the IMF in that way. Tension, of course, was not unknown
because of the difference in our attitudes between different members of
the Commonwealth towards the persistence of apartheid in South Africa.
Our Commonwealth conference meetings were dominated by the extent to
which we could and should do more to challenge that. We had one CHOGM
meeting establishing an Eminent Persons Group led by Malcolm Frazer,
the Australian Prime Minister. He led a mission on behalf of the
Commonwealth to South Africa to challenge apartheid as it then was.
They were able to secure Nelson Mandela’s release from Robin
Island. When Malcolm Frazer went to see him in his cell, Nelson Mandela
rather startled him by asking the question, “Do tell me, is
Donald Bradman still alive?”. That seems to underline the unity
of the Commonwealth, binding many of us together. It is in that sense
that Britain, as one of the Commonwealth countries, was able thereafter
to bring pressure to bear against apartheid. We were able to propaganda
like that in South Africa, and were able to see substantial success
there in the
end.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000418" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000418">That
background, with the Commonwealth as a collective organisation,
supporting, encouraging, offering up advocacy of the right course of
events, underlines to me the extent of the value of the Commonwealth
declaration today. It underlines the positive value of the most
practically effective UK/multinational 
<?notus-xml column=1689?>organisation in this context, whether that is
alongside the UK/People’s Republic of China relationship, the
EU, NATO, the UK/US or the United Nations. In the context that we are
talking about, the Commonwealth has a collective wisdom that can help
to advance matters in the right
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T16:24:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

all I need to say. I have spoken not about contemporary events but
about the history and background that have brought us to the present
position. It is that background against which the United Kingdom should
approach and influence Commonwealth members and benefit from the
collective relationship, one that has come into existence and deserves
to be enhanced and amplified.</hs_para>

Luce:</Member></B> My Lords, I am glad to follow the noble and learned
Lord, Lord Howe, under whom I served on numerous occasions, one of
which of course was in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The noble
and learned Lord has inspired the commitment of the coalition
Government to policies on the Commonwealth. I am glad
that he is keeping his hand in on the Commonwealth by, for example,
leading the Commonwealth Day ceremonies next Monday in Westminster

debates in this House on the Commonwealth over the past six or seven
years, I think that on some occasions they have been somewhat
frustrating and certainly repetitive about the strengths and the assets
that the Commonwealth offers. There was always a feeling that no one
was listening very much, either in the Government or outside.
However, I think that there is now a greater realisation of the
importance of soft power and diplomacy. I should perhaps remind the
House that the Commonwealth is not a substitute for membership of NATO,
the European Union or the United Nations; that vast network
of 2 billion people is something quite different that
complements it. What seems to have happened over the past year or two
is that various strands have come together: the Eminent Persons Group
reporting to the Perth summit meeting in October 2011 with some of the
recommendations being accepted, followed by the Diamond Jubilee
celebrations, a strong report from the Foreign Affairs Committee of the
House of Commons and on to Commonwealth Week next
week<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T16:27:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

result of the Perth meeting, for the first time we have a kind of
framework for action within the Commonwealth. We have a chance to
monitor progress in the Commonwealth and for Commonwealth parliaments
to take reports from Governments about progress on the Perth
recommendations, over 100 of which were made. As the noble Lord, Lord
Anderson, said, it was disappointing that a number of the proposals
were not accepted at Perth, such as for a commissioner for democracy,
human rights and the rule of law, but enough were accepted to
demonstrate that, if they are implemented, we can build more confidence
in the Commonwealth and perhaps tackle some of the more difficult
issues at a later
stage<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T16:27:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

inter-governmental side, like others I welcome the importance of the
Commonwealth charter, which consolidates the values expressed in the
Commonwealth, but it is important to put flesh on to them. For example,
it is good to see that there are going to be 
<?notus-xml column=1690?>stronger measures to deal with good governance in supervising elections.
Goodness knows that is needed, for example, this week in Kenya. The
Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group, which deals with conflict
resolution, will be given stronger powers, and the Secretary-General
will be asked to use his good offices more forcefully in that
direction. All this helps towards the creation of a more stable climate
to deal with conflict resolution, which is extremely important for
trade. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, said, that is
extremely important and sits at the heart of the
Commonwealth<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T16:28:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

have said that CHOGM next time round is important. To my mind, it is a
litmus test of the Commonwealth because it is essential that it shows
evidence of progress on human rights issues. I refer to the treatment
of the Tamils and the fact that, contrary to the advice of the Supreme
Court, the chief justice has been dismissed. Canada has taken a lead on
this and it is important that the British Government should express a
firm view about it, otherwise there will be a great deal of
disillusionment with the Commonwealth.</hs_para>

side—the non-government side—I will just highlight two
areas that the charter stresses. First, in respect of young people,
with over 50% of the Commonwealth being under 25, there is the proposal
for a youth corps. I myself have been privileged to have been the first
president of the Commonwealth Youth Orchestra and am delighted that my
noble friend Lady Prashar will succeed me. These kinds of areas are an
expression of the importance of the Commonwealth. The right reverend
Prelate the Bishop of Leicester and my noble and right reverend friend
Lord Williams mentioned education, which is absolutely vital to the
development of the Commonwealth. For example, there is the Commonwealth
scholarship scheme, from which 27,000 people within the Commonwealth
have benefited. There are numerous proposals, for example from
Professor Dilks, for more exchanges in the medical world, as well as in
the teachers’ and the youth world. All these areas strengthen
the network of the
Commonwealth<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T16:30:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000426" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000426">The
second aspect is civil society, which the charter stresses is also very
important. Here, as a former chairman of the Commonwealth
Foundation, I ask the Minister what is being done to strengthen the
Commonwealth Foundation to act as a catalyst in the non-governmental
area and civil society and for the promotion of youth in the
Commonwealth. I feel, rather contrary to the view of the noble Lord,
Lord Anderson, that we now have a chance to give the Commonwealth a new
lease of life. The secretariat and the Secretary-General have a vital
role. The regions may even have a chance in the Commonwealth to give
new momentum. This is an opportunity that we must take, and it is in
Britain’s interests that we do

with many other noble Lords who have spoken, I strongly believe that in
order to ensure its future the Commonwealth must be seen to be
relevant. The greatest danger to its long-term survival is inertia, as
a prelude to irrelevance. The Commonwealth charter is a sound attempt
to avoid that fate. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Anderson of
Swansea, put it, the charter is of no use unless words are backed by
actions. I draw particular attention to Article V of the charter, on
freedom of expression. It
states:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13030791000559" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000559">“We

in 2002, the Coolum declaration for the first time listed freedom of

founded. Since then there have been many other similar declarations.

Empey:</Member></B> My Lords, I wanted to address a couple of issues
this afternoon, the first being the economic dimension to the
Commonwealth. As we have heard from many speeches, approximately
one-third of humanity is engaged in the Commonwealth and it very
largely shares with people and businesses in this country a common
language and very similar approaches to law. Among these diverse
countries are those that are extremely rich in natural resources, such
as Australia, Canada and many parts of Africa, and many that are
growing fast, particularly in Asia and Africa. It seems reasonable that
if this country has a connection with many of those countries, while in
no way is it a substitute for our membership of the European Union,
surely it should be another string to our
bow<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T16:37:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000437" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000437">At
the beginning of our membership of the European Union we turned our
back on many of our former trading partners in the Commonwealth. Some
felt great resentment and at that stage it was not necessarily in our
economic interests. It most certainly is not in our economic interests
today. We should pursue, as hard as we can, the economic development of
the Commonwealth, because just as the founders of the European Union
had it in their minds that strengthening economic co-operation would
also go a long way to preventing conflict, similarly economic
development in the Commonwealth can also help to eliminate conflict. As
we heard from the noble Lords, Lord Black and 
<?notus-xml column=1693?>Lord Anderson, there are things that are far
from perfect, and I welcome the charter. It is a very fine
foundation upon which to
build<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T16:38:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000438" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000438">The
second issue, referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Howell, is the
possible membership of the Commonwealth by the Irish Republic. This is
something I would strongly welcome and I ask the Minister if this issue
has been raised by Her Majesty’s Government with the Irish
Government. If we go back some 30 years to 1982, there was
considerable conflict at that time with the Falklands war and others.
It was Sir Shridath Ramphal, then the Secretary-General of the
Commonwealth, who implored Ireland, as he put it, to “come
home” to the Commonwealth of
nations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000439" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000439">The
Commonwealth consists of 54 nations, more than 60% of which are
republics. It is no longer, as the Minister said, the British
Commonwealth; it is the Commonwealth. Given the diversity of countries,
given the new charter, given the fact that the majority of members are
republics and given the commonality of history and all that goes with
it, it seems to me that it could go a long way towards putting on an
even stronger foundation the relationship between this country and the
Republic of Ireland, taking its place in the Commonwealth of nations,
which will, I believe, be a very strong trading bloc as well as a
strong soft-power bloc diplomatically throughout the world. It would
strengthen relationships within these islands.</hs_para>

should not do anything and everything in our power to strengthen our

consistent with its long-held views and expressions; and there is no
military involvement whatever. Given the progress
that has been made in the past 15 years—we are coming up to the
15th anniversary of the signing of the Belfast agreement next
month—this could be a further step that we could take together.

Commonwealth is often described as a link between the first world and

the potential to play key roles in conflict resolution and the
development of democracy in unstable nations through the use of soft
power. Perhaps most notable was the group’s substantial
contribution to the end of apartheid in South Africa. However, it
should now become more involved in conflict resolution. It is also

have also spoken in your Lordships’ House many times on the need
to increase overseas trade from and between Commonwealth countries. The
Commonwealth itself must be more strongly appreciated as a potential
trading network, with more emphasis placed on trade—which at the
moment stands at about £1.7 trillion. It has £62 billion
of foreign direct investment flowing out of it, constituting more than
20% of all international trade and investment. In fact, most member
countries conduct between a third and half of their trade with other
member countries. We should look very closely at the economic potential
of using such an obvious grouping of countries to build business and
trade relationships that could be mutually beneficial to all involved.
Quite simply, it provides us with a ready-made relationship with some
of the most promising emerging markets in India, Africa and Malaysia. I
have visited a number of countries in these
areas.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000449" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000449">Business
and trade aside, what makes the Commonwealth so unique is that its
citizens have an exceptional sense of pride from being part of the
club. Unlike other regional blocs or trading territories, the
Commonwealth gains much of its strength from the sense of affinity that
binds its countries together. This year is of course particularly
special because we are establishing the Commonwealth charter: a set of
core values that the nations of the Commonwealth believe in and are
expected to uphold and protect on behalf of their
people.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000450" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000450">We
currently face a multitude of global challenges that threaten the
long-term health and stability of our planet, so we can again use the
Commonwealth as a force for good by mapping out a consensus on major
international issues such as terrorism, poverty and climate change.
Although the charter does not set contractual obligations, it
encourages a sense of shared responsibility and is set within the moral
and ethical context from which the Commonwealth has always 
<?notus-xml column=1695?>drawn its strength. National Governments are often
more receptive and a lot less hostile to this type of approach, which
frees them from the restraints of bureaucracy or quotas but holds them
accountable for their principles by their
allies.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000451" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000451">Far
from being an outdated institution, the Commonwealth is perhaps the
greatest of all international associations. It has a unique reach
across countries, continents and oceans that both celebrates our unity
on liberty and democracy, and encourages national sovereignty and
diversity. It is the ultimate network fit for the continued challenges
of the 21st century. My noble friend Lord Howell deserves praise for
greatly raising the profile of the Commonwealth on the world stage. It
is vital that the Government continue upon the course he started in
adopting a clearer strategy for their relations with the

of developments in the Commonwealth: the Eminent Persons Group report
triggered some changes to increase the effectiveness of the
Commonwealth; the adoption of the new Commonwealth charter; and a
renewed focus on the Commonwealth by this Government, thanks to the
efforts of the noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford. All these changes
are very significant and welcome. They provide a real opportunity to
keep up the momentum for change and revitalise both the Commonwealth
and its
institutions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000453" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000453">The
potential of the Commonwealth at all levels is enormous, as we have
heard from other contributions this afternoon. The aspirations and
expectations of the Commonwealth are high, and those of this Government
are very ambitious indeed. The Foreign Secretary, William Hague,
identified three main areas where he would like to see the role of the
Commonwealth strengthened: human rights and democracy; engagement on
global issues, working to liberalise trade and break down barriers to
international trade; and an even greater role in development and
conflict prevention. To meet these enormous challenges we need
effective Commonwealth institutions, ones which are nimble, agile and
able to develop mature and constructive partnerships with other
regional, international and civil society
organisations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000454" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000454">In
response to the Eminent Persons Group report the Commonwealth
Secretariat is developing a new strategic plan, as we heard earlier,
and efforts are being made to reform the institution. While these are
welcome developments we need further radical thinking and reform. This
is not a criticism of what has been achieved but we need to recognise
the current realities. We must be sensitive to the diversity of needs
in the Commonwealth and its competing priorities. Different members of
the Commonwealth have different priorities. Some want to concentrate on
development issues, others on democracy, rule of law and human rights,
and others on business. These are interrelated but the starting point
for different Commonwealth countries may be different. I am not sure
that the Commonwealth Secretariat based in London can deliver the
ambitious agenda expected of it.</hs_para>

charter that provides a strong framework of core values, should we not
be thinking of creating regional Commonwealth hubs, or at least
offices, in three regions—for example, the Caribbean, Africa and
Asia—with a slimmed-down secretariat in London? This may seem a
bold suggestion but it would enable the secretariat to respond to the
relevant needs and priorities of countries in those regions, within the
framework of the charter, develop purposeful links with civil society
and other regional organisations there, and have a greater
impact.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000456" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000456">In the
time allocated it is not possible to spell out the notion of regional
hubs and offices in detail. In response to the Foreign Affairs Select
Committee, the Government said that they would continue to seek to be a
positive influence on the Commonwealth Secretariat, working with and
through it to make it more efficient, focused and relevant in
today’s world. It would be helpful if they could now urge the
Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group to set up a group, similar to the
Eminent Persons Group, to explore options for further reform of the
secretariat and the feasibility of regional offices and
hubs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000457" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000457">This
group could also look at what implications this would have for the
future appointment of the Secretary-General and his or her senior
staff. In a modern world and Commonwealth, appointments should be made
through open competition, backed by a clear idea of skills, experience
and qualities required for the job. I am not the first person to
suggest this; it has been recommended
before.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000458" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000458">The
same can apply to organisations like the CPA and the Commonwealth
Foundation. They, too, could look to be part of regional hubs.
Similarly, Commonwealth civil society organisations could work and
collaborate with devolved regional hubs and be more effective on the
ground. As former chairman and president of the Royal Commonwealth
Society, I know that there is appetite within civil society
organisations to help and support the secretariat. Good practice
already exists. For example, the advocacy campaign on ending child
marriage in the Commonwealth, led by the Royal Commonwealth Society and
Plan International, an organisation with offices across the world, has
made and continues to make a real
impact.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000459" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000459">The

Selsdon:</Member></B> My Lords, I should declare that I suppose I am,
by accident, what might be defined as a child of the Commonwealth. When
I first came back with my sister from Canada, where we were left during
the war, we were introduced to our family, my mother in particular.
Most of her family were called Williams, a lovely patronymic surname
that I have always admired. More than that, for family bonding we went
on holiday for the first time, which was quite difficult when there was
no petrol around, to Mumbles. I therefore have a great affection for
the current position of—I must get 
<?notus-xml column=1697?>this right, because my noble friend Lord Howell, got
it wrong—the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Williams. That
was my most difficult research before speaking today. I am most
grateful to him for a debate that he introduced some time ago on the
importance and effect of religion in the Middle East, which touched me
deeply.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13030791000537" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0002.htm#13030791000537">As a
child of the Commonwealth, and knowing that there is so little time
left, one must always have a theme. I will take the theme of a minute.
A minute is, as noble Lords know, one nautical mile upon the surface of
the earth. Therefore, when I look down from heaven or up from wherever
it might be, what do I see? Seventy per cent of the earth is ocean or
sea. The land is only a very small percentage. It is spread far and
wide, and you either look down on it from above the Antarctic, the
Arctic or the equator, but, in general, when you look down upon it, the
map that you see has Greenwich, which is in the United Kingdom, in the
centre, as it should be, due to the technology of the Harrison
chronometer. It matters not, but technology was what enabled us to go
out into the world.</hs_para>

70% water become important to me because, by some strange calculation,
it seems that the United Kingdom, its British territories and the other
main Commonwealth countries are the most dominant with their economic
exclusion zones of 200 nautical miles controlling the oceans of
the world, where there are 22,000 shipping vessels and others. In
comparison, the United States has 6.2 million square kilometres against
our 27 million square kilometres. The rest of NATO has 4.5 million
square kilometres, but the French territories become quite important
with 7.7 million square kilometres. Does this mean anything? Possibly
it does not, but it can do strategically, and if we look at such issues
as global warming or trade. If we say that 90% of all trade goes by
sea, of the 100,000 vessels upon the face of the earth, 20% are
Commonwealth and 20% are fishing vessels. This may be utterly

seen the best ones working around officialdom and engaging directly
with the community, and often representing them where elected
politicians fail them. Some are bureaucratic, but most give value for
money. Some are dominated by strong personalities with political
motives, but there is no harm in that. My own interest in politics
stems from working with Christian Aid. I firmly believe in the

says, the Commonwealth needs to tighten up its act. As we have heard,
the new charter adopted at the Perth CHOGM last year brings together
the key values uniting the Commonwealth: democracy, human rights and
the rule of law. The charter emphasises the role of civil society,
albeit in its final paragraph 16. I welcome that because it is not only
a hallmark of such a diverse organisation but a means of extending
important principles that might otherwise remain mere aspirations. For
example, I can think of a number of countries where there is little
progress towards those values but where civil society nevertheless has
a strong tradition of

Westminster-centred approach towards a more respectful recognition of
local traditions. Here I concur with what the noble Baroness, Lady

human rights. The Secretary-General intends to deepen the

South Sudan had been left to its own devices, I rang the South Sudanese
Ambassador, Mr Sebit Aley, and he told me that that was indeed the
position. His Minister had discussed the application with his
Australian counterpart. The FCO was present, and he had received an
assurance that South Sudan would be assisted in its application.
However, he said that he had heard nothing since then and was still

welcoming the elections, I have deep concerns about the fact that more
that 12 million women will not be able to participate in them because
they do not have an identity card and therefore cannot register to
vote. That says much about the status of women in our Commonwealth,
although some wonderful advances are being made by women in Pakistan,
which I will briefly mention in due course if time

take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Commonwealth Parliamentary
Association and the work that it does in bringing together
parliamentarians and facilitating discussions and exchanges of best
practice. Sometimes the deeper understanding and new relationships have
very practical outcomes: for example, in developing partnerships
between organisations and institutions in the UK and other Commonwealth
countries. There are also many examples of links that have been forged
between small and medium-sized enterprises in the UK and other
countries, providing trading and employment opportunities. Again, this

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, this has been a
very valuable debate. We covered only a little bit of the
Commonwealth, which is a highly diverse, very complicated network. In
reading up for this, I become conscious that the value the Commonwealth
provides is often extremely different for different members. The
smaller states in the Commonwealth find it a huge extension to their
global engagement and an opportunity for them to express their strong
concerns. For example, in developing a Commonwealth perspective on
climate change, the small island states of the Pacific had a major role
in explaining to their neighbours and Commonwealth partners just how
vital the issue of climate change was for their future
viability.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13030791000495" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0003.htm#13030791000495">I
was struck by the interpretation of the Commonwealth from the noble
Lord, Lord Luce, so I will start with that. The Commonwealth is not
like the EU or NATO. It is a very different organisation of networks,
links, soft power as opposed to hard power, aspirations rather than
obligations. That makes it very difficult to assess and to judge and
very easy to get deeply frustrated with the moderate lack of progress.
It is a loose and diverse association that has to be judged by criteria
different from those we currently use to assess the EU, the
transatlantic relationship or NATO. I say, as someone who occasionally
reads the Europhobe blogosphere, that the Commonwealth is not an
alternative to the EU and NATO. It is a very helpful complement to it,
which the British Government and other members of the Commonwealth
should do their utmost to develop to the
full.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000496" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0003.htm#13030791000496">Some
states fall some way short of the values that we have now agreed in the
Commonwealth charter. A few sometimes fall a long way short and, as
noble Lords will be well aware, every now and again a Commonwealth
member falls so far short that its membership is suspended for a
period. That is the way the Commonwealth works, but it works by
consensus, not by qualified majority voting. Organisations that work by
consensus move unavoidably and necessarily slowly. That can give rise
to the more critical perspective presented by the noble Lord, Lord
Anderson, but we have different sorts of frustrations with the European
Union and other tighter organisations than we do with the Commonwealth.
We must make the best of what the Commonwealth is and not get too
frustrated that it is not something else.</hs_para>

suggested, there are several dimensions of the Commonwealth
relationship. Shared values, shared heritage and shared approach to the

<?notus-xml column=1705?>rule of law are crucial and it is a major step forward that we have
managed to agree the Commonwealth charter. Alongside good governance,
rule of law and human rights, there is a commitment to development and
assistance for sustainable development in particular that has taken us
into the area of climate change in which, as a network that crosses
regions and the developed and developing world, the Commonwealth has a
very useful voice to play.</hs_para>

brought us all sort of human links between Britain and other
Commonwealth countries. I spent a day canvassing in Southwark at the
last election and was amazed by how many different Commonwealth
countries I discussed with people I met on the doorstep. We have human
links like dual citizenship and intermarriage and there is also
increasingly a two-way link. Tata owns major British companies; we
invest in India, the Indians invest in us. That is something else that
we should exploit. This leads on to economic and commercial ties that
we should be developing as much as we can. It is a concern
that only 10% of Britain’s exports currently go to the
Commonwealth. It ought to be a great deal more. It is excellent that
they are increasing, but that is not to say that we should be reducing
the quantity of exports that go to the European Union; we should be
exploiting Commonwealth markets as much as we
can<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T17:24:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

global intergovernmental network, which brings together diverse states
to discuss problems of common interest such as financial regulation,
tax avoidance and tax havens, which again gives us the opportunity to
talk to other important states. In recent years, the Commonwealth has
necessarily been discussing renewal and modernisation. We have now
agreed a limited reform agenda. The Commonwealth Ministerial Action
Group has been strengthened and Her Majesty’s Government are
committed to ensuring that the reforms agreed by Commonwealth heads of
government are now implemented. We will monitor this closely, assess
the impact of the adopted reforms and keep both Houses
updated.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030791000500" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-0003.htm#13030791000500">A<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T17:25:34"></hs_TimeCode>
key part of the reform agenda will be ensuring that the Commonwealth
Secretariat sharpens its focus. The secretariat’s new strategic
plan is important to refocus Commonwealth programmes on the areas where
it can add more value than other organisations. I note with interest
the suggestion of the noble Baroness, Lady Prashar, that we should be
thinking about regional hubs for the secretariat in the future. That is
probably something that needs to come from regional groups
within the Commonwealth, but Her Majesty’s Government would
welcome such a development if viable proposals were put

number of noble Lords have spoken on the Commonwealth charter, the
aspirations that it spells out and by how far a number of Commonwealth
countries fall short of those aspirations. The noble Lord, Lord Black,

Lady Berridge, spoke about religious freedom and freedom of minorities;
and a number of noble Lords spoke about the persecution of homosexuals,
the death penalty and so on. I can assure noble Lords that Her 
<?notus-xml column=1706?>Majesty’s Government do raise those issues
bilaterally and multilaterally within the Commonwealth. As I read
diplomatic telegrams within the Foreign Office, I frequently
see reports that Ministers have vigorously addressed these questions

that other Commonwealth Governments do the same, and we work with them

Commonwealth responds to invitations to monitor, it does not invite

I entirely agree that these are key elections and we would very much
like to see a Commonwealth monitoring mission. I am sure that everyone
is aware that there is a Commonwealth electoral monitoring mission now
in Kenya that is doing its best to monitor the elections there. In

After all, Ireland has a very strong record in international

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, I am pleased to introduce this instrument
which was laid before the House on 30 January. I am
satisfied that it is compatible with the European Convention on Human
Rights. The aim of automatic enrolment was to broaden access to
workplace pensions and increase savings levels, often from a very low
or zero start. Our job today is to consider the figures that will apply
from April. This will be the second year of live running when companies
employing between 10,000 and 250 people start to go live. The automatic
enrolment earnings trigger determines who can save in a workplace
pension. It sets the automatic entry point. The qualifying earnings
band then determines how much people save and sets employer
contribution levels.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13030770000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-gc0001.htm#13030770000003"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T14:01:06"></hs_TimeCode>This
is a balancing act. Automatic enrolment is a tailored policy. It does
not force pension saving onto everyone regardless of age, earnings or
individual circumstances. In setting the figures in this instrument,
our overall aim is to maximise the number of people saving who can
afford it, while excluding those who cannot. To do this, we need to
exclude those very low earners for whom saving on top of the pension
they will get from the state may not make economic sense, especially
while they have other family
priorities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030770000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-gc0001.htm#13030770000004">We
also need to provide low earners access to pension saving, with an
employer contribution, if saving is the right decision for them. To
meet all these aims, we need to bring in employers who have never
provided a workers’ pension, or never paid into one, while being
realistic about the costs that they will have to bear. We need to cap
minimum employer contributions for higher paid staff and let existing
arrangements cater for this market.
To<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T14:02:03"></hs_TimeCode> deliver these
several objectives, we need a system that makes sense for individual
workers and their employers. The way that we set these figures can help
to achieve this.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13030770000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-gc0001.htm#13030770000005">I think that we all
accept the powerful arguments for income smoothing. We put money aside
now while we have it and while we are earning so we have it in our
retirement. But of course the very lowest earners may not have the cash
now to sacrifice for retirement saving. That is why we believe that the
automatic 
<?notus-xml column=300?>enrolment trigger should exclude those people who may not
be well placed to make that sacrifice unless they
themselves want to save.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13030770000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-gc0001.htm#13030770000006">Saving should be an
individual decision for people whose earnings hover around the tax
threshold. We believe the state’s role is to provide access to
saving where automatic saving is not the right approach. That is why
the right to opt in, with an employer contribution, is such an
important feature of these reforms.</hs_para>

fully recognise that any rise in the trigger disproportionately affects
women. I want to be completely clear that we are not weighing equality
against cost. Gender is not the issue. We think the outcome of this
review is right for people on very low incomes, regardless of gender.
In particular, we do not believe that it is right automatically to
enrol people who do not earn enough to pay
tax.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030770000008" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-gc0001.htm#13030770000008">Nevertheless<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T14:03:25"></hs_TimeCode>,
as noble Lords will know, it is possible for non-taxpayers to get tax
relief on pension saving depending on the scheme. This top-up may have
an impact on pension savings. We are seeing evidence that schemes
designed to cater for the under-pensioned market and those targeting
low to moderate earners are using, or intend to use, the
relief-at-source mechanism precisely because it helps low
earners.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13030770000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-gc0001.htm#13030770000009">This
illustrates the point that however carefully the policy targets the
right groups, the enrolment process needs to work in practice. We know
that people see their employer as the first port of call for anything
connected with wages or their pay-slip. Automatic enrolment will work
best when it is simple for employers to understand, simple to
administer and when pension contributions are simple to explain. We may
not be quite there yet in all respects, despite some really clever and
effective work from some of the lead companies to demystify pensions in
the workplace. Aligning automatic enrolment thresholds with existing
recognisable payroll figures can be of considerable assistance and this
was strongly recognised in the response to the consultation. This will
be the second year of live running and it is likely to be a challenging
year, as activity starts to ramp up. The overall message we heard is
that this is not the time to change course.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13030770000010" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-gc0001.htm#13030770000010">The automatic enrolment
trigger does not exist in isolation. It is an entry point to saving
that works hand in hand with the qualifying earnings band. The band
sets a minimum definition of pensionable pay. In simple terms, if you
earn £9,500-odd a year, you will pay pension contributions on
anything over £5,500. This point about minimum savings is
important. Some schemes will have their own definition of pensionable
pay, perhaps more generous than the savings band we set today. We are
setting a universal minimum quality standard for pension saving, rather
than an aspirational target.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13030770000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-gc0001.htm#13030770000011">We have been debating
how best to set the parameters for pensionable pay for automatic
enrolment since the pensions commission reported in 2004. The
commission originally recommended aligning private pension saving to
the national insurance threshold for the state pension—at around
£5,000. That was a starting point. It established a core
principle: that private pension saving should build on the foundation
of the state pension. The commissioners envisaged year-on-year rises,
in line with average earnings.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=301?><hs_para UID="13030770000012" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-gc0001.htm#13030770000012">Perhaps I may take your
Lordships back to our target market of low-to-moderate earners. This is
a group whose wages are less likely to increase by average earnings, so
a qualifying earnings band that rises by average earnings will have a
disproportionate impact on these people. We considered a variety of
other approaches but perhaps I might deal here with the two distinct
ones that came out of the consultation we undertook last autumn:
abolishing the lower limit or freezing the band.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13030770000013" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-gc0001.htm#13030770000013">Abolition would mean
putting contributions on earnings from pound one. This would add around
£130 million to employer costs next year. It would also hit low
earners very hard indeed, to the extent that pension saving could start
to look like something to be avoided rather than embraced. As to
freezing this year’s figures, we come back to the practical
aspects of automatic enrolment. It should work in practice and it
should be easy to explain and to understand. Thresholds that bear no
relation to anything else on payslips would fail all those three
tests.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13030770000014" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-gc0001.htm#13030770000014">As
noble Lords will be aware, the national insurance contributions upper
limit is going down. If we continue to align with national insurance,
the upper limit of the qualifying earnings band would go down too. The
upper limit serves two purposes. It caps mandatory employer
contributions; it also distinguishes the target group of standard-rate
taxpayers from earners in a higher tax band. Higher-rate taxpayers tend
to have greater access to a pension scheme offering more that the
minimum. The issue is whether a reduction in the top limit of the
qualifying earnings band would have a disproportionate impact on the
target group. The evidence suggests that it will not. Average earnings
in the UK are around £26,500 a year. Average earners would not
be affected by a change in a contributions rule that bites on people
earning nearly £15,000 more than they do. The evidence suggests
that the practical advantages of alignment outweigh a reduction in the
nominal value of contributions for a subset of higher-rate
taxpayers.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13030770000015" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-gc0001.htm#13030770000015">I
said earlier that setting these thresholds is a balancing act. There is
no perfect answer, either in theory or in practice. Nevertheless, we
believe that we have used the evidence to consider how we can best
achieve the policy intentions and have made reasonable judgments about
the various trade-offs. We believe that these proposals continue to
provide broad access to pension saving and maintain contributions for
the target group. I commend this instrument to the

German:</Member></B><B> </B>My Lords, I have a single question on
determining the balancing act which the Minister has just talked about.
However, my question is in multiple parts. No one is more enthusiastic
than I about the raising of the income tax threshold. I have used it in
many speeches in your Lordships’ House to illustrate how we have
taken many lower earning people out of the tax bracket altogether.
However, this is an area where the balancing act does not necessarily
work because of the use of the income tax threshold, which has risen
well beyond the level of earnings increases and well beyond that of
price increases. Here there is a negative aspect to that balance. The
number of people 
<?notus-xml column=302?>who will now be excluded from the automatic element—the
“automatic” in the title of the
order—is about 420,000 individuals, of whom 320,000, or 76%, are
women. The question that primarily worries me and should concern the
Committee is whether these are people who should be saving for the
future and will be able to maintain over a lifespan the appropriate
level of saving for a worthwhile pension. This is where my question
splits into several
parts<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030770000017" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-gc0001.htm#13030770000017">Of
course, people who are excluded as a result of the above earnings
increase in the income text threshold can opt into the system. But
there are ways of opting in that may not be as obvious as you might
think to many people. I understand that employers are required to make
the offer and provide information to their employees if they are below
that threshold and within that bracket. Therefore, can the Minister
tell me what is the actual requirement on employers to provide
information? If<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
it is a piece of paper stuck in an envelope along with the payslip,
that may not be the most appropriate information source. This is a
tricky area for people to understand and the information may not be
being provided in a meaningful
way<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>. It should
certainly be in clear language. There is probably a whole pension
industry that has developed a language of its own in explaining what
are essentially straightforward implications in a way that is often
impenetrable to many
people<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030770000018" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-gc0001.htm#13030770000018">My
second question relates to when people are excluded from the automatic
element, the declared intention being that it may be inappropriate for
some people to save for a pension. Will the Minister explain what
“inappropriate” means to lower earners? In the
Explanatory Memorandum it is quite clear that people may not need to
save if the state will provide. But as noble Lords will know, the
pension schemes that the state provides are not static. There is
progress towards a single state pension, which may make a difference to
the way in which people see their pensions over a longer period of
time.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13030770000019" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-gc0001.htm#13030770000019">I<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
understand that if people will be low earners for the whole of their
working lives it may not be appropriate because they might find that
they would get a better deal from just relying on the state. But you
cannot determine what the state will provide in 30 or 40 years’
time when you are entering the jobs market at the beginning of your
life span<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>. I
would be grateful for an explanation of what makes these pension
contributions inappropriate for some
people<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030770000020" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-gc0001.htm#13030770000020">The
third element to the same question is about the relief at source. The
Minister has already spoken about that for people who are below the
income tax threshold. They can still, using the RAS scheme, benefit
from having the tax contribution taken off at source. Do the Government
have any intention of promoting the relief at source in order to assist
people when making a decision about whether they want to opt into the
system? Do they have a view about whether that is something that should
be promoted? It is another useful piece of information. If you were
told that it would cost you less than if you were paying tax, you would
naturally look differently on any contributions that you might have to
make. With those few questions rounded into one major question with
many parts, I am pleased to support the
order<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-07?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_07_PT_1/CD109F33075619A66DC73D83497E50502F858B59" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 7 March 2013">Thursday,

Lord, Lord Newby, for introducing this order. I find myself on pretty
much precisely the same page as the noble Lord, Lord German, concerning
the points and questions that he raised. When we considered this matter
in May last year, we looked forward to the introduction of
auto-enrolment and acknowledged the contribution of the many people
along the way who had made it happen. Indeed, we also acknowledged the
role of this Government in taking it forward. Perhaps this would be an

year, we see the merit of simplicity in the earnings band limits being
aligned with the national insurance lower and upper earnings limits.
This is notwithstanding that the raising of the former and the
reduction of the latter means that the band is squeezed by some
£1,100 for the upcoming year, with the Government estimating a
reduction in pension savings of some £30 million. However, we
welcome the fact that the broader definition of earnings, or its
equivalent in other schemes, is being

I am sure will come as no surprise to the Minister, is the one touched
upon by the noble Lord, Lord German, of raising the earnings trigger to
the new personal allowance level. On the Government’s own
figures, this will exclude around 420,000 individuals, 76% of whom are
women. Of course, this is on top of those who have been excluded by
aligning the trigger to the personal allowance threshold in the current
year. We have heard some of the justification for that. It concerns
simplicity and whether people are in a position to afford to
save.</hs_para>

it seems that there is a breakdown in the Government’s logic.
Let us say that the Government got the balance right in the current
year. Looking at the current year, why should the increase in the
personal allowance for other policy measures, which we may or may not
agree with, by more than the rate of inflation and more than earnings
cause the balance in adjustment as to what people can afford still to
equate with the personal allowance threshold? I do not think there is a
logical connection between the two. However, we are where we are on
that.</hs_para>

Government’s explanation was that persistent low earners tend to
find that, through pensions and benefits, the state provides a level of
income in retirement similar to that in working life. Of course, that
assumes that today’s low earners will be tomorrow’s low
earners. We would hope that as a matter of government policy that would
not be the case. The noble Lord, Lord German, touched on the much
heralded single-tier pension, which is supposed to negate the need for
earnings-related support in the future. It takes us back to the big
debates that we had around “pays to save”, when the whole
concept of auto-enrolment was being considered and the structure was
being put in place. If the single-tier pension is to be introduced and
is successful, negating a whole raft of earnings-related means-tested
support, that should make it easier to make the judgment about when it
will pay to

tax relief and relief at source. If people are excluded from
auto-enrolment due to the personal tax threshold, they are potentially
missing 
<?notus-xml column=304?>out on this chunk of government support. The noble Lord, Lord German,
raised absolutely the right point by asking what employers are required
to do to make sure that people are aware of this potential benefit. I
hope that the Minister can confirm that there is absolutely no
intention of changing the structure of tax relief. I think it was
confirmed last year that NEST will operate the relief-at-source system,
so anyone who was going to be enrolled or who wished to opt into NEST
would receive the benefit of that tax support.</hs_para>

as the noble Lord, Lord German, which is: if this is the way things are
going to go and if there is to be this increasing raising of the
threshold, which will really change the landscape over time if it
continues, what publicity will be given to the right to opt in? That
becomes ever more important if the threshold is to continue to be
raised. What are the Government planning to do generally? What are the
requirements on employers, so that those who miss out on auto-enrolment
at least have the chance to consider the opt-in route? The key point of
auto-enrolment was to deal with inertia, to get people into pension
saving because they had to make a decision to opt out. Once you remove
that requirement from them, inertia reverts and the onus is on
individuals. I think that they have to be above the lower earnings
limit to opt in. What support and encouragement will they be given?

of the context for this is that even with the uprating of the tax-free
limit, in terms of income level we are talking about 29 hours at the
minimum wage, so the vast bulk of people in the category we are
discussing—people who could join if they wish but who are not
automatically enrolled—are likely to be part-time workers. That
comes to the final point of the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, about what
their career paths will be. I would expect quite a number of people in
that category now would not necessarily be part-time workers for the
rest of their lives. A lot of them will be women with children, who may
go on to have a full-time job when their children are older, and we
would hope that they would do so if that is appropriate. Of course if
they do, they would then be automatically

how we make sure that people know of their rights, which is obviously
important, employers must write to employees with information about
rights setting out the full picture. The department has developed a
language guide and template letters to help employers to communicate
clearly with people new to pension saving. I must say that I have not
seen that letter. I will now make it my business to read it. If it is a
letter that communicates clearly on pensions, it will probably be the
first one that I have seen. I am sure that the finest minds in the
department have been worrying about that. It is a major problem. By and
large, people are ignorant about their pension savings and pension
options. 
<?notus-xml column=305?>It is a challenge in any scheme, but particularly here, where a lot of

noble Lord, Lord German, asked for a definition of
“inappropriate”. It is easy to see why for a
single-parent family with children, where the mother is working
part-time, it is not so much inappropriate as impossible. There just is
not the amount of money in the household to enable much saving to take
place. Another example of where it might be inappropriate would be if a
household had built up debts and had large outstanding payments due, as
many people on low incomes do. It would probably be in their financial
interest to try to get those debts down before undertaking any savings.
I am not sure that is the complete answer but I can see circumstances
where, if you were a debt adviser or financial adviser to people who
had got into debt and were on low incomes, you would be advising them
to pay off those debts
first.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030770000033" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-gc0001.htm#13030770000033">There
was a question about relief-at-source schemes and how these will be
made clear. I hope that the letter explaining to people what their

will be looking at that. If it is able to do that in very clear terms,
that will be an even greater achievement. I have great confidence in
officials at the Department for Work and Pensions being able to clarify
what most people find opaque. We are still looking at how
relief-at-source schemes are operating as the new system rolls forward.
The evidence so far is that schemes aimed at this population are
actually using relief-at-source, so at least in that respect the system
is working well.</hs_para>

have gone out of business and who have not brought any action for

contracted mesothelioma but were unable to claim compensation for that
disease under the 1979 Act. It covers those whose exposure may have
been due to environmental causes, instead of being a result of their

of disability, the higher the level of payment that is made. All
payments as a result of contracting mesothelioma are made at the 100%

can advise noble Lords that the number of deaths from mesothelioma in
Great Britain continues to rise. In 1968, there were 153 deaths from
mesothelioma. The disease has a long latency, taking decades for
symptoms to become apparent. Today, more than 2,300 men and women each
year are dying from the disease. The information currently available
suggests that mesothelioma deaths in men will plateau at around 2,100
by 2016. Accepting that accurate predictions are difficult, the current
thought is that deaths in women will peak at a later period than they
do in men, but the number of deaths will be lower. The total number of
deaths will likely be around 4,500 each year if we include other
asbestos-related deaths such as asbestosis and lung
cancer.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030770000052" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-gc0001.htm#13030770000052">It is

Wigley:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for
outlining in some considerable detail the statistics relating to these
two schemes. I will come back to a question that I would have put to
him had I been able to intervene earlier. The regulations under
consideration 
<?notus-xml column=309?>today make provision, as has been outlined, for  the uprating of
the amount payable to sufferers of pneumoconiosis and mesothelioma in
line with inflation. As the Minister reminded us, there is in fact no
statutory obligation to do this. However, the previous Government did
so and I am very glad that the present Government are doing likewise,
so that the value at least comes somewhere close to keeping up with
inflation.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13030770000057" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-gc0001.htm#13030770000057">A
lump sum is payable under the Pneumoconiosis etc. (Workers’
Compensation) Act 1979 for sufferers of lung diseases including, as the
Minister said, byssinosis, pneumoconiosis—including
asbestosis—diffuse pleural thickening,
asbestos-related lung cancer and mesothelioma. When the Minister quoted
figures relating to the past year, I was wondering in that context
whether, under the 1979 Act payments, he can differentiate between
those relating to mesothelioma and those related to the other sources
of lung disease which qualify under that
Act.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030770000058" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-gc0001.htm#13030770000058">The 1979
Act was one in which I and my party, Plaid Cymru, had some considerable
involvement, as some colleagues may recall. That was because the
legislation had considerable significance for the slate-quarrying
industry, as well as for some aspects of coal mining. I was also
involved in issues relating to mesothelioma associated with working
with asbestos, as a number of cases in the old Ferodo factory in
Caernarvon were arising then. There is still a tale that leads out of
that period. More recently, I have become quite alarmed by the
potential number of mesothelioma sufferers from a range of industries,
particularly construction industries. Even among those who have been
working in schools, including teachers, some of the answers received
indicate the worry that may arise in that context.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13030770000059" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-gc0001.htm#13030770000059">None the less, the
payment is made to claimants who are awarded industrial injuries
disablement benefit and is geared to the age of the claimant. If the
claimant dies before submitting a claim, dependants of course receive a
lower rate of payment. This can lead to increasing stress on the very
individuals who are ill, who feel forced to rush through their claims
to maximise the compensation available to their families. If these
people are too sick to make a claim before their death, their families
will be left with the lesser amount.</hs_para>

accepted that the differential payments between the living claimants
and the dependants of those who have died is, frankly, not fair. The
annual uprating of these payments is debated each year in both Houses,
and in 2010, Committees from both places agreed that this was
especially pertinent to mesothelioma cases, where claimants often pass
away shortly after diagnosis. I think the Minister acknowledged that in
his opening speech. This means that their families will not have had
sufficient time to submit a claim prior to their relative’s
death. Both Houses thus decided in 2010 that the Government should
reduce the difference between payments that year, with the eventual aim
of eliminating the differential. Despite this commitment, since 2010 no
ground has been made on ending this inconsistency, as I understand it.
Bearing in mind that dependency claims represented  
<?notus-xml column=310?>only 8% of all claims in 2011, and only 5% of the total cost of all
claims, surely the Government can see the
expediency of ending this anomaly.</hs_para>

would also mean extending the upper age limit for dependency payments
from  67 and over to 77 and over. This would bring payments in
line with those for in-life claimants—yet another inconsistency
that unfairly disadvantages the families of individuals who, for the
most part, were too ill to make claims before their death. I urge the
Government to commit to finally ending this anomaly. The same should
apply to the scheme set up under the Child Maintenance and Other
Payments Act 2008, which provides for a lump sum to be paid to
mesothelioma sufferers who did not qualify for payment under the 1979
Act, due to being self-employed or having not had occupational
exposure. With this scheme, too, dependants of those who died before
submitting a claim are paid a lower rate.</hs_para>

further disadvantage due to a mistake which the Department for Work and
Pensions made in 2010 in calculating the dependency payments for all
ages at 50% plus disablement. As a result of this mistake, the
department has overpaid since 2010 and, as I understand it, is now in
the process of correcting that mistake. The result of all of this is
that payments have been cut from £7,915 in 2012 to £7,180
in 2013. So as well as failing to equalise the in-life and dependency
payments, the Government have also reduced the amount available for
dependants in mesothelioma cases because of this mistake. I understand
that mistakes have to be corrected. None the less, it has that effect.

is grave misgiving that using the portal process will prove to be
wholly unsuitable for complex mesothelioma cases and is unlikely to
speed up decisions in such cases. I would be very grateful for the

Avebury:</Member></B> My Lords, I echo what the noble Lord, Lord
Wigley, has said about the commitments that were made two years ago and
about the inconsistency of the Government’s response to the
demands that were made, I think in both Houses, at that time. When the
equivalent to this order was debated two years ago there was criticism
by the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, and my noble friend Lord German of
the gap which had developed between payments under the Child
Maintenance and Other Payments Act 2008 to living mesothelioma
sufferers and to their dependants after they had died. As the noble
Lord, Lord Wigley, has said, it may take some time before a claim is
submitted. Very ill patients may not be capable of addressing the
matter in time. Equally, it is very awkward for relatives of the
sufferer or for the local Asbestos Victims Support Group to get a
signature from a patient who may be in great pain and on the point of
dying, so that a claim can be submitted on his behalf.</hs_para>

result was that in 2011, there were 2,952 in-life claims and 270
dependency claims. The Minister gave some statistics about the payments
made to these individuals but it would be useful if, when he winds up,
he could say something about the rates of claims submitted and separate
them into in-life and dependency for 2013 and for the years up to the
plateau which he says will occur in 2016. I think that that is a year
later than we had previously been
told<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T14:48:24"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T14:48:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

in-life payment was £15,204, while the average dependency
payment was £9,026, which is trivial enough compensation when
you think about someone who has got this frightful disease and even
more so for the widow who has gone through the traumatic experience of
seeing her husband die in excruciating pain. Of course, these payments
are intended to tide the patient or the widow over pending the
settlement of a claim which may lie against the former employer in
whose service the exposure to asbestos occurred. For some patients,
however, as the noble Lord has explained, the discrepancy is actually
widening this year. One would have no hint of this from either the
order or the Explanatory Memorandum, but the widow of a mesothelioma
victim aged 67 at the time of his death will get £7,180 in 2013,
compared with the equivalent figure in 2012 of £7,915 and
£17,799 for the in-life claimant.</hs_para>

the noble Lord, Lord Wigley, said, the reason for that discrepancy, the
9% cut, was explained by the DWP by the fact that it had made a mistake
in 2010 in calculating the dependency payments for all ages at 50% plus
disablement, and that resulted in overpayments to the band of
dependency claimants we are concerned with in 2011 and 2012. As a
result of that mistake, the dependency rate moved closer to the in-life
rate, which, as I said, was clearly the intention of both Houses when
we debated the matter in 2011. Nothing in the Explanatory Memorandum
gives a hint of that bizarre outcome. I would be grateful if the
Minister could explain why it was not drawn to the attention, at least
of the Asbestos Victims Support Groups Forum UK, run by Mr Tony
Whitston, who discovered it only by
accident<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-07T14:51:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030770000068" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-gc0001.htm#13030770000068">I
should also like my noble friend to explain why we have departed from
the principle that used to operate. When a mistake of this nature
occurred that operated to the benefit of the citizen, we used to say
that public faith was thereby pledged and that the Government would
stick to the errors made and pay the amounts now to be issued in
recognition of the mistake. Since 2008, lump-sum payments have been
recovered by the DWP claims recovery unit in cases where civil claims
for compensation are successful, and £21.3 million was recovered
under the scheme in 2011. The Government expect that a further
£49 million will be recovered over a 10-year period through the
tariff scheme funded by insurers to pay compensation in cases where it
is not possible to trace employers’ liability

the Minister could give an estimate—I do not suggest that he
should immediately, but when he has had a chance to discuss it with
officials—of the net cost of dependency payments over the 10
years, based on the assumption that equalisation would be achieved in a
straight line over that period, that would be 
<?notus-xml column=312?>helpful. The calculation should assume that over the same period, the
cut-off age for those payments is raised from 67 and over to 77 and
over, the cut-off age for in-life payments over the same 10 years. That
would be useful in assessing the likelihood of being able to equalise
the payments over that 10-year

recognise that we will not secure any improvement in the lump-sum
payment scheme for this year, because the parliamentary process does
not allow that to happen. It is a defect in our system that so much is
done by secondary legislation, which cannot be amended. In cases like
this, where the Government obviously know that what they are proposing
is highly controversial, they should offer the stakeholders concerned
the chance to put their views forward at a Select Committee-type
hearing before coming to a final decision. It is surely wrong that

note that the alignment of payments between the two schemes both for
claimants and dependants has been maintained, and this is obviously
something that we support. It is an important matter. But both the
noble Lords, Lord Wigley and Lord Avebury, raised the point about the
disparity between claimants and their dependants. Certainly, it is my
recollection that it was the aspiration that the gap between these
amounts be closed, or at least narrowed. Perhaps the Minister can tell
us when an assessment was last made of the prospect of achieving this

statistics, which have prompted questions from a number of noble Lords.
The noble Lord, Lord Wigley, asked about payments made under the 1979
Act related to mesothelioma, as opposed  to other diseases. I
do not have the actual figures to hand, but I can say that over 60% of
payments made under the 1979 Act are in relation to mesothelioma, and
the rest to other conditions. My noble friend Lord Avebury asked
whether I could supply an estimate of the net cost of payments over the
next 10 years, including equalisation, if that were to occur. I shall
gladly write to my noble friend; it would not be right for me to come
out with a figure this afternoon, because it is likely to be
incorrect.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030770000084" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130307-gc0001.htm#13030770000084">My
noble friend also asked me for a forecast of payments from 2013 to
2016. We have not formally forecasted figures for these schemes, but
the split for the last financial year, 2011-12, is: under the 1979 Act,
2,480 sufferers and 270 dependents claimed; and under the 2008 scheme,
450 sufferers and 30 dependents claimed.</hs_para>

Wigley and Lord McKenzie, asked me to comment on the proposal that
payments to dependents and sufferers should be equalised. First, I
share the concerns about the plight of dependents. I understand the
difficulties that families face when their loved ones suffer illness.
That is why the department is always working to improve the processes
to ensure that claims are dealt with as quickly as possible: as the
noble Lord rightly said, sometimes sufferers and dependents struggle to
make claims before the person dies. At the same time, we need to fulfil
our obligation to ensure that all claims are appropriate and
legitimate. Ministers have to balance competing priorities, and because
of the current financial situation, it is our duty to ensure that all
available resources are well targeted. As around 85% of payments made
under these schemes are paid to those who are suffering from the
disease, I believe that they are currently rightly targeted on the
sufferer to help them and their families to cope while living with the
stress that illness inevitably brings.</hs_para>

these schemes under review. While in the current economic situation we

Wigley and Lord McKenzie, and my noble friend Lord Avebury referred to
the error that caused some people to have been overpaid lump-sum
payments and they asked what the situation was regarding that overpaid
amount. Before last year’s debate, officials in the department
identified an error in the rate tables for a specific subset of
dependant resulting in a dependant receiving a higher award than a
sufferer would have received. Even though this error would apply to
only very few people, it did not reflect the policy intention that
available resources should be focused on the sufferers of the disease
rather than dependants. Consequently, the position was rectified and
the amended regulations were debated and approved last year. However,
an operational error was made to 
<?notus-xml column=315?>the effect that the revised figures were not input into operational
systems and this resulted in a number of dependants being overpaid. The

made by the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, concerning the amount of
compensation recovery that the department receives in relation to
payments made under the 1979 Act and the 2008 scheme, and the
suggestion that this should be used to offset the cost of increasing
the number of dependant payments. The total amount of compensation
recovered from civil compensation claims in respect of payments made
under both schemes exceeds the cost of making the payments under the
2008 scheme. However, these recoveries are also used to offset the cost
of payments made under the 1979 Act, which still results in an overall
cost to the department of making these valuable lump-sum payments. I
have some figures in front of me on the amounts recovered in recent
years. The noble Lord may like to note that in 2010-11 the amount was
£18.4 million, and in 2011-12 it was £21.3

authorities monitor levels of air pollution across the country to
identify any pollution hotspots, and where any problems are identified
