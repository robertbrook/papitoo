people affected by what is effectively the removal of a spare-room
subsidy. Clearly some will find that they are capable of paying to
retain that extra room, some will look to work, some will look for
lodgers and some will look for shared tenancies. Where the options are
more limited than that, apart from downsizing, we have had substantial
discretionary housing payments transferred to local authorities in
order to ameliorate those
situations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T14:39:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Palmer of Childs Hill:</Member></B> My Lords, has the Minister
considered the effect that these cuts are having on people? For
instance, within the ward that I represent on Barnet council, one
person in a two-bedroomed flat in a high-rise block will, because of
the changes, have to pay an extra £14.50 per week from the
beginning 
<?notus-xml column=1266?>of April out of the very small amount of benefits they receive. This
also applies to people on low working wages. This may be all right in
principle and on paper but does my noble friend believe that it is

move

Freud:</Member></B> My Lords, I said that people will make a range of
responses. Some will decide that the best thing they can do is to
downsize and they will be supported in that. Clearly, in areas where
there is no appropriate social housing, there is the option of moving
into private rented housing. However, the essential point is that there
is a limit to what the state can afford. We have had quite a lot of
changes in the private rented sector, and this brings the social rented
sector into line.</hs_para>

there were real concerns about homelessness, just as there are now. I
stated to the Select Committee that we did not expect any significant
increase in homelessness as a result of these changes. We have now run
through the LHA changes—they were completed last
December—and I am pleased to say that while there have been some
modest increases in homelessness in London—it is up 600-odd
households—that compares with predictions put out 
<?notus-xml column=1267?>by Shelter and the Cambridge group that up to 134,000 people could move

unfortunately have proved to be justified? That view is echoed by the

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and
Local Government (Baroness Hanham):</Member></B> My Lords, localising
council tax support reduces the cost of council tax benefit by 10%.
That contributes to our deficit reduction programme, makes councils
responsible for support and creates incentives to get people into work.
In designing schemes, local authorities should take into account the
impact on low-income families. On 16 October, the Government announced
a £100 million transitional grant to assist development of local
schemes. Some 195 billing authorities have adopted schemes that are
compliant with the criteria for the
grant<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T14:52:36"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T14:52:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030411000032" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0001.htm#13030411000032"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord McKenzie of Luton" PimsId="1827" UID="13030411000656" xid="1824" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0001.htm#13030411000656">Lord
McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> In thanking the noble Baroness for that
reply, I must say that it is somewhat complacent and out of touch. The
Resolution Foundation estimates that three-quarters of the 326 local
authorities responsible for council tax support schemes will be forced
by government cuts to adopt schemes giving less support than the
current national scheme. That 
<?notus-xml column=1270?>will see working families losing £165 a year on average and
non-working families even more. Therefore, taken together with all the
other cuts about to hit low-income families, including the bedroom tax
that we have just discussed, the 1% capping of benefits and other tax
credits, and the benefit cap, is this not going to lead to increased
personal debt, more food banks, lower collection rates for local
authorities, more bailiffs knocking on the door and all the misery that
that entails? Why do the Government find this

Naseby:</Member></B> My Lords, is it not the flexibility that is being
offered to local authorities which is most encouraging? When I was
leader of the London Borough of Islington, under the guidance of Harold
Wilson, there was nil flexibility to local authorities. We had a diktat
from the centre and we had to follow it. At least this coalition
Government, recognising that change had to come, have given flexibility
for local authorities to decide exactly how they should use the amount
of help that is available.</hs_para>

bringing reality into this situation. It is correct that the Government
have given not only flexibility but also responsibility to local
government for making its own decisions, particularly on council tax
and the support that comes with that. Local authorities should
be—and are—in a good position to make their own schemes
and to deal with their own council

Farrington of Ribbleton:</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate the
Minister on managing to shift all the responsibility for increasing
poverty and problems with having to pay bills to the poorest. I
recognise that the noble Baroness referred to the fact that we are all
having to make very big sacrifices, but from where I sit in the north
of England, the sacrifices are not being made by the better off in the
south but by the very poor in the English regions. In the name of
flexibility the Government have passed the responsibility to local
authorities in a way that is at best dishonest and at worst sheer lying
about the opportunities available to local government. They can keep
their libraries and everything else provided that they

Baroness to the fact that local government is being given
responsibilities in many areas, many of which have been devolved from
central 
<?notus-xml column=1272?>government, something that I think she would have welcomed during her
distinguished years in local government. One of the things that local
government wanted was access to the council tax support scheme, which
it now has. It is now up to local government to provide schemes in
individual local boroughs that are satisfactory at all stages. The
money from council tax benefits comes into councils’ main
budgets and they can use it to make changes and reductions which absorb
that 10%. I encourage them to do
that.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-04?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_04_PT_1/4B4EABA421ED92821B7BCE6365628B3EE9C5D566" __version__="1.9"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 4 March 2013">Monday,

deal for the Union and for this country, bearing in mind the balance of
severe spending restraints at one end but long-term real infrastructure
investment at the other? Is it not now the job of Conservative
Ministers in the coalition to explain properly how the EU budget system
works: a modest budget in comparison with other member states, no debts
or deficit, no borrowing, payments that are always less than
commitments, and a budget that does more and more good with less and
less spent on farming?</hs_para>

Deighton:</Member></B> I thank my noble friend for congratulating the
Prime Minister on the excellent deal he brought back. We accomplished
our three main objectives, which were to restrain the size of the
budget, to make sure that we kept hold of our abatement and to resist
any new EU-wide taxes. We shrank the budget and shifted it away from
the more traditional areas, such as the common agricultural policy,
into growth-oriented funds. I agree with my noble friend that we are
shifting towards a pattern of expenditure that is more consistent with
the reformers among us.</hs_para>

Tomlinson:</Member></B> My Lords, will the noble Lord accept that what
we have here is a seven-year financial framework, but what really
matters now is the annual budget year by year over the next seven
years? Can he give an undertaking that this Government will pursue a
system of zero-based budgeting in each of those seven years so that we
can cut out budget lines that are wasteful and increase those budget
lines which need to be increased rather than take this rather
conservative approach of across-the-board cuts which cut the good as

always in the detail and that it is our traditional practice year by
year to negotiate very effectively on behalf of this country to bring
about a better outcome in the annual budgets. However, it was extremely
important to cap the overall size of the budget as a first step in the
necessary reforms that we are all in favour

into the UK. The first was to make sure that our universities were very
well positioned to bid for the grants available. That part of the
budget has gone up and the rewards are based on excellence, so they
should do well there. Secondly, he wished to make sure that our farmers
are protected in terms of the environmental programmes that they
support, which he did. Thirdly and finally, the structural aid that
goes to our less well-off regions has been protected at the existing

national income and other such factors. The spirit of the question is
indeed correct: our net contribution is likely to go up. That is simply
because of the concessions made in the 2005 negotiation, when we

Minister has said that Section 3 wrongly implies that it is for the
commission alone to bring about these changes in our society. However,
Section 3 was amended in this House to make clear that this was not the
intention. The commission’s duty is to encourage and support
others to realise their aims in Section 3 whether Government,
Parliament, the courts, public bodies, business, the media or civil
society. It is ironic that many of the reforms proposed or under way
will hamper the commission’s ability to work with others. For
example, it has lost its helpline, its capacity to make grants and its
authority as a source of advice to

argued that Section 3 is too broad. This suggests that she considers
the duties in Sections 8 and 9 to be more restricted. Repealing Section
3 will do nothing to reduce the scope of issues with which the
commission might engage. Therefore, we must assume that the repeal is
to limit what the commission can do about those issues, otherwise it is
unclear what will be
achieved<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T15:17:11"></hs_TimeCode>.
Ultimately these reforms, including the repeal of Section 3,
will focus the commission on law enforcement, especially in
the field of discrimination. Bizarrely, this will stem from a Bill to
promote enterprise and growth by reducing regulatory burdens. We risk

fewer resources, the commission will have to be more judicious in the
issues on which it focuses. We will do it no favours by leaving it

headlines remind us that our human rights protections cannot be taken
for granted. It is more important than ever that we retain the
principles enshrined in Section 3. Section 3 is a declaration of our
commitment to those principles. It requires us to be vigilant in their
protection and restless in their promotion. It provides a direction of
travel for the commission and others involved in the work. It makes
clear that pursing those aims requires both enforcement of the law and
the development of a deeper cultural respect for equality and human

However, I have read the debate and the balance of opinion clearly lay
with the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell of Surbiton—not
surprisingly, given the powerful speech she made and the one which she
has also made today. It is a privilege to support an amendment moved by
such a respected champion of equality and human rights, who I would

put forward in the debate was that repeal of the general duty would not
make any difference anyway, as it is of symbolic rather than practical
importance. This is the official stance taken by the commission itself.
I have two responses to that: first, as a number of noble Lords noted
in Committee, this justification was challenged by Professor Sir Bob
Hepple of Cambridge University. He argued that Section 3 has
an important legal function and that without it equality law would be
“rudderless” and would lack the “important
unifying principle” that Section 3 provides, and which the Joint
Committee on Human Rights welcomed in its report on the Equality Bill.
However, 
<?notus-xml column=1279?>even if the significance of the general duty were more symbolic than
practical, symbols matter in politics and we should not underestimate
the symbolism of removing the section. The deluge of e-mails that I

further point. The distinction between compliance and a general duty
implies that there is no need for anything until the

protected characteristics are often cultural, and may not get to a
point where compliance is necessary straightaway. It would be much
better for that culture—for example, the treatment of adults
with learning disabilities, perhaps in one or two homes before it
starts to gather momentum—if there were a general duty on the
sector, and if the commission could go in, offer support and start to
change the culture before a crisis develops that requires compliance. I

Low of Dalston<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T15:36:49"></hs_TimeCode>.
Unfortunately, my noble friend Lord Low cannot be here today; I cannot

is another person who cannot be here today for a different reason. He
was mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Wigley, as one of those who led
the way in this area of the law in the 1990s and long before that. I
refer, of course, to the late Lord Morris of Manchester. 
<?notus-xml column=1282?>It is not difficult for me—or I suspect, anybody else in the
House today—to imagine what Lord Morris’s reaction to the
proposed repeal of Section 3 would have been. I do not doubt for one
moment that he would have regarded it as a serious backwards step, and
he would have said so in his usual trenchant
terms<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T15:37:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

with the argument of the noble Lord, Lord Lester, as a lawyer—I
am sure that his heart was not really in it—that if we leave out
Section 3 we are losing nothing. Secondly, I want to comment
on the reasons given by the noble Baroness, Lady
Stowell<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T15:38:19"></hs_TimeCode>, at the
end of her reply for the Government’s decision to repeal Section
3. The noble Lord, Lord Lester, gave two reasons for his view. The
first was that Section 3 was purely aspirational, so it would make no
difference if it were repealed. It contained nothing, he said, that
could be enforced in a court of law.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13030411000103" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0001.htm#13030411000103">However, if that
argument were correct, it surely proves too much. If Section 3 is
purely aspirational, so, surely, are Sections 8 and 9. How would the
noble Lord enforce in a court of law the duty under Section
8 to promote understanding of the importance of equality and
diversity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T15:39:22"></hs_TimeCode>?
How<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T15:44:47"></hs_TimeCode> would he
enforce in a court of law the commission’s duty under Section 9
to promote understanding of the importance of human rights? If the
legal argument of the noble Lord, Lord Lester, were correct, it would
surely mean that we should repeal not only Section 3 but Sections 8 and
9, which would leave us with absolutely nothing. Of course, the truth
is that the argument is misconceived. Recent legislation is littered
with examples of duties which cannot be enforced in a court of law but
serve, nevertheless, a very useful purpose. For example, Section 1 of
the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 provides
that:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13030411000194" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0001.htm#13030411000194">“This

example that occurred to me is Section 1 of the Climate Change Act,
which provides
that:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13030411000195" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0001.htm#13030411000195">“It

I should say, when—is that duty, clearly stated by Parliament,
to become enforceable: in 2048, 2049, or when? Therefore, with respect,
that argument carries very little weight. For all those reasons, I
suggest, with the utmost delicacy, that the legal argument of the noble
Lord, Lord Lester, should not deter us in any way from supporting this
amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T15:41:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13030411000105" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0001.htm#13030411000105">However,
the noble Lord had a second argument. He said that there is nothing in
Section 3 which is not also contained in Sections 8 and 9, so Section 3
is in effect otiose. I suggest that he is wrong, but suppose for a
moment that he is right: if Section 3 adds nothing to Sections 8 and 9,
how is that consistent with the Government’s argument all along
that Section 3 is too broad? As the noble Lord, Lord Low,
pointed out, the Government simply cannot have it both ways. I suggest
that he was right. In truth, Section 3 does indeed add something which
is not in Sections 8 or 9, and something of the very greatest
importance. It provides for the first time in legislation the unifying
link between equality and other fundamental human rights. This was the
point made by Sir Bob Hepple in 
<?notus-xml column=1283?>his memorandum, which I hope the noble Baroness has read, and which has
already been referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady Lister. That
deserves an answer and I hope that it will get
one<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T15:42:53"></hs_TimeCode>. Indeed, the
assertion of a unifying principle in Section 3 was surely one of the
main objectives of the 2006 Act, as the noble Lord, Lord Lester,
himself pointed out when he was promoting the Bill. Therefore, I again
suggest, as delicately as I can, that the noble Lord might in this
instance have done better to follow his heart than his
head<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T15:43:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030411000106" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0001.htm#13030411000106"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Lester of Herne Hill" PimsId="1473" UID="13030411000704" xid="1310" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0001.htm#13030411000704">Lord

extraordinary brevity. When I joined this House almost 20 years ago,
Lord Alexander of Weedon said to me, “Remember, Anthony, that
the House of Lords is not a court of appeal, it is a jury. Try, if you
can, to speak to a jury”. I totally disagree with almost
everything that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, has
said today, and would do so in a court of appeal. However, when we are
dealing with a jury whose sentiment has already been powerfully
expressed, I do not think that it would do the slightest good if I were

previously.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030411000107" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0001.htm#13030411000107">By

I disagree, and there are many people in the Chamber today who also
disagree. For example, the Care and Support Bill includes principles
which are perhaps individually unenforceable but they are critical
because they remind us all that the primary purpose of care and support
is ultimately to support the well-being of people. If we want to know
how well our care and support system is doing, the well-being of older
and disabled people and their families is our litmus test. Section 3
serves the same purpose. It imports these enduring values and

helping people to wash, dress or eat in time slots of 15 minutes or
less. The dignity of older people was not being respected by a system
which most assumed to exist principally for that purpose. It also
highlighted how, as a consequence of outsourcing home care to private
and voluntary sector providers, coupled with a narrow judicial
interpretation of the meaning of “public authority” under
the Human Rights Act, the majority of older people receiving care in

better one—agree with the noble Baroness and her Government? Why
does she think that Sir Bob Hepple has given the advice that he has
about Section 3? Has she had discussions in the past month with the
bodies which care about this matter? If so, what is the outcome of
those discussions? Given that the Government are in absolutely no doubt
that all these organisations are concerned about this and 
<?notus-xml column=1289?>do not want this change to happen, have the Government had discussions
with them? Have any discussions influenced their position? I hope that
their position will be that they will accept this amendment. Certainly,
from these Benches, we are adamantly opposed to the deletion of Section
3. If the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, decides to test the opinion of
the House, we will be with

Stowell of Beeston:</Member></B> My Lords, this has been an important
debate and I am grateful to all noble Lords who have contributed. We
have covered an important matter about which we all feel strongly. We
all want a society based on equality of opportunity which respects
human rights. I pay tribute, as I did in Committee, to all noble Lords
who have worked hard in this arena over many years. I especially pay
tribute to the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, not just for everything
that she has done but for the very open and straightforward manner in
which she and I have discussed her amendments at various stages of the
passage of this Bill. I really am grateful to her for that.</hs_para>

since we last debated this issue. We have appointed new commissioners
and the commission’s budget has been announced. I will come back
to these points later today when we debate the accountability of the
commission in the final group of amendments. First, I shall be
absolutely clear about what this Government seek to achieve via this
Bill. We want a strong and independent Equality and Human Rights
Commission which promotes and protects equality and human rights. We
want it to be recognised and respected as the national expert in these
areas as well as for being a strategic enforcer of equality
law.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13030411000139" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0001.htm#13030411000139">Under
the leadership of the noble Baroness, Lady O’Neill, who is
respected and renowned the world over for her evidence-based approach,
we are confident that the commission’s work will be respected,

priorities and agree a coherent strategy, we must first be clear on the
purpose of the commission.</hs_para>

some good work since it was established in 2007—most recently,
the inquiry into the home care of elderly people and the disability
harassment inquiry, among other things, which were referred to by the
noble Baroness, Lady Hollins. Let me be clear: removing the general
duty would not prevent this kind of work taking place in the future. I
will explain in a moment why that is the case. However, we also have to
acknowledge that the commission has not been universally acclaimed as a
national institution. Indeed, it has been criticised for the way that
it has been run. Poor financial management resulting in qualified
accounts was the most serious evidence of its failures.</hs_para>

years things have started to improve. Indeed, the past two sets of
accounts have been clean and substantial savings have been made. I pay
tribute to all those who played their part in that, which includes
several Members of this House. However, when an organisation seriously
underperforms, it would be negligent not to understand what caused
those problems and take steps to put things right. As most successful
leaders, whether they are in business or politics, will testify, when
things go wrong in an 
<?notus-xml column=1290?>organisation it is often because the organisation lacks clarity of
purpose. Indeed, they will argue that for any organisation to be
successful, it needs clarity of

stand by it. The Government’s argument remains that several
institutions—Parliament, the Government, other public sector

sets out. Having such a wide-ranging and unrealistic general duty would
make it harder than it should be for the commission to prioritise its
work. That would be the case for any organisation given that general
duty.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13030411000144" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0001.htm#13030411000144">The

commission lacks enthusiasm in the language that uses for the
Government’s proposals to remove the general duty, it none the
less acknowledges that it would not impact significantly on its work.
She also agreed that that general duty is aspirational, the nature of
the Equality Human Rights Commission is for it to be aspirational and
that that is not required to be set out in
statute.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030411000145" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0001.htm#13030411000145">The
noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd
of Berwick, and other noble Lords referred to the memo from Sir Bob
Hepple and questioned the unifying link that Section 3 provides between
equality and human rights. The commission can perform its functions
under its duties in respect of equality under Section 8 and of human
rights under Section 9, so that any unifying link between these two
concepts provided by the duty is not essential. As the commission made
clear in the briefing distributed at the end of last week, it sees the
general duty as symbolic rather than practical.</hs_para>

clear that the commission’s core purpose is to promote equality

compliance notices or entering into agreements with organisations and
instigating or intervening in judicial reviews or other legal
proceedings.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13030411000226" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0001.htm#13030411000226">4.15

opening remarks, the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell of Surbiton,
referred to the banking crisis and argued that the removal of the
general duty would 
<?notus-xml column=1291?>prevent the commission becoming involved in addressing the kinds of
problems associated with that. I would make a different point. To put
it in its simplest terms, Sections 8 and 9, covering equality and human
rights, should inform the commission’s strategic and business
plan—in other words, its proactive work—and its
enforcement panels are what authorise it to act when it suspects
unlawful activity is occurring. So there is in the Act, without the
general duty, the clarity that is necessary to inform the activity that
the Equality and Human Rights Commission rightly needs to be able to
carry out, which is important to it and what it is there to do. As I
stated in Committee, the repeal of the general duty will neither stop
nor hinder the commission’s ability to fulfil its important
equality and human rights duties. I believe that by providing the
clarity which will come through removing the general duty we will help
it become more effective.</hs_para>

stop the commission reflecting the contents of the general duty in a
mission statement, if it feels that that would help it in its work.
Several noble Lords asked me to respond to the proposal circulated by
the commission at the end of last week about an alternative to the
general duty, reflecting some other kind of language. Let me be
absolutely clear: the Government are not proposing an alternative to
Section 3. We are clear that Section 3 is not required; if the
commission decides it wants to produce its own internal mission
statement, that is a matter for it.</hs_para>

the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell of Surbiton, is about monitoring duty
and seeks to halt the changes to Section 12 of the 2006 Act. I
reiterate the point I made in Committee that this change is being made
to ensure that the commission reports on progress against its core
equality and human rights duties. It is a consequence of the
changes that we are making to remove Section 3. It will also
amend the reporting cycle from three to five years. As I also stated in
Committee, I should like to be clear that there is nothing to stop the
commission reporting more frequently if it wishes to do so. Our change
would simply reduce the risks of overburdening the commission with
reporting obligations and of it being unable to fulfil its duty of
monitoring progress adequately.</hs_para>

with a clarified legislative mandate, the commission will continue to

before and so will gain the respect we all want it to have as our

also been able to give the noble Baroness the assurance she needs that,

forward evidence with brilliance and accuracy. I also thank the
Minister. She is right to say that we have spent honest time together
discussing this issue in great detail and she has tried hard to
understand and reflect upon the arguments, but I have to say that I am
disappointed with her reply. As the noble Lord, Lord Cormack,
suggested, I thought that perhaps we could come back at a later stage
to discuss an alternative that would meet the requirements of noble
Lords who have participated in this debate. Like many
organisations—I would say all of them—we feel that this
is an area of enormous significance in terms of culture change in this
country. I do not feel that Section 3 hindered in any way the
difficulties faced by the commission when it came to
merge.</hs_para>

me five years to get them to work together successfully and well, so I
do not think that that is a good argument. I do not agree with the
arguments around wideness and ambivalence or on the fact that Section 3

Harries of Pentregarth:</Member></B> My Lords, this amendment seeks to
add the word “caste” into the Equality Act 2010 and I
will very briefly sketch in its background. The Dalit communities in
this country, which are about 480,000 strong, have been concerned for
some time about discrimination against them. The previous Government,
aware of this, introduced an order-making power into the Equality Act
2010 and to assess the evidence commissioned a report from the National
Institute for Economic and Social Research. The NIESR concluded that
there was discrimination in the areas covered by the Equality Act;
namely, education, employment and the provision of public goods and
services. It recommended legislation as one of the ways of dealing with
this<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T16:37:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13030411000156" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0001.htm#13030411000156">The present Government,
understandably, wanted time to consider this issue but on Friday gave
their response. They recommended that discrimination be tackled by
education first rather than by triggering the order-making power in the
Act. The Dalit communities in this country are deeply disappointed by
this long-awaited response. Indeed, there are more than 400
community leaders from all over the country expressing their feelings
outside the House at the moment. I find it disappointing and genuinely
distressing because not only are the recommendations a distraction from
the real issue but they could cause a great deal of hard feeling and
resentment and be seriously
counterproductive<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T16:38:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030411000157" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0001.htm#13030411000157">I
want to explain briefly why I believe this to be so. It is natural in
every society for people to mix with other like-minded
people—those with the same education, background, religion,
class or occupation. If sometimes 
<?notus-xml column=1296?>this goes along with feelings of superiority to other groups this is
reprehensible but when it is manifested only in social life it is not a
matter for legislation. By focusing on education there is a huge danger
that these kinds of social distinction will become blurred and confused
with the real issue of discrimination in the public sphere when people
are not employed or are harassed in their jobs because of their caste.
An education programme, however sensitive—and frankly one
wonders how on earth this one is going to be costed—is likely to
be regarded as patronising and interfering, while at the same time
distracting from the essential issue.</hs_para>

opposition to triggering the order-making power. I find it very
difficult to work out what are the grounds of this opposition. The
NIESR is a highly reputable academic body, well used to doing this
research, and it has concluded that there is clear evidence of
discrimination in the public sphere. Therefore, I wonder about the
Government’s second recommendation, which is that the Equality
and Human Rights Commission should be asked to look again at the
evidence. Is there something flawed with the original evidence? Why is
it being asked to look at it again?</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13030411000159" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0001.htm#13030411000159">Another possible reason
is that discrimination does indeed exist, as the Government seem to
accept, but should be tolerated. That position would be quite
unacceptable to all your Lordships. So we come to the third reason. Is
the law really needed? We know that in the case of legislation on race
nothing has been more effective in reducing racial prejudice than the
law. It has had a most powerful educative effect. Nothing could be more
significant and effective in reducing discrimination on the grounds of
caste than to have a clear-cut law saying that discrimination in the
public sphere will not be tolerated. India, Bangladesh and Nepal all
have laws against discrimination on the grounds of caste. The problem
in those countries is that the caste system is so deeply entrenched
that the laws are not properly enforced. The situation in this country
is very different. The law is, on the whole, effective. If other
countries see nothing shaming in having a law, why should
we?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030411000160" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0001.htm#13030411000160">There are
something like 200 million Dalits in the world and the
institutionalised prejudice against them is one of the most degrading
and humiliating forms of rejection invented by cruel human beings, of
which being confined to jobs such as manual scavenging is only one
expression. It is indeed a surprise and a shock to learn that caste
prejudice has come to this country. It is not, of course, in that
extreme form but we need to show that in any public form it is totally
unacceptable. We can do that quite simply and clearly by accepting this
amendment.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13030411000161" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0001.htm#13030411000161">At
the moment, when a person believes that they have been discriminated
against because of their caste, they have no legal means of redress.
Someone I once interviewed had had a good training in India as a
medical technician and was employed by the NHS in this country. All
went well until this person asked their Asian boss for leave to go back
to India for a family wedding. There then followed a set of highly
intrusive questions about their family background, after which the
person’s life was made hell for the next year, which nearly
brought on a breakdown. The trade union that 
<?notus-xml column=1297?>he consulted thought that he had certainly been the subject of unfair
discrimination and harassment, but had to advise him that at the moment
it was not possible to bring a case for discrimination on the grounds
of caste.</hs_para>

likely to be few such cases, it is essential that there should be a
proper means of legal address for those that exist. I appreciate that
the Government are serious in wanting to do something about caste
discrimination but I honestly believe, for the reason I have given,
that their education programme could turn out to be highly
counterproductive. No less importantly, it will blur the issue and
distract attention from what is really needed: a clear legal signal
that discrimination in this country in the public sphere—in
education, employment and the provision of public goods and
services—is quite unacceptable. I beg to

Deben:</Member></B> My Lords, I put my name to this amendment because
it seems a very fundamental and simple question. Is it right that a
person who is a subject of Her Majesty in this country shall not be
able to claim against discrimination when they would be able to in
India or Nepal, or indeed in Bangladesh? Is it right that when we have
clear evidence that caste has become a feature in this country, they
have no defence against
it?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030411000164" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0001.htm#13030411000164">I have had
very informative and helpful discussions with the Minister responsible
in another place and the usual extremely well thought-out discussions
with the noble Baroness. It is with considerable sadness that I have to
say to her that I am not convinced by the Government’s argument.
First of all, it has only just become the Government’s argument.
In opposition, the Conservative Party said that this was necessary
because it was the only way in which more than 400,000 of Her
Majesty’s subjects could properly be protected. If it were
possible for the Government to explain to the House that in taking
office there were circumstances of which they were unaware that changed
their mind, then I would be happier.</hs_para>

the argument that has been put forward. What has been suggested is that
we need to have yet another investigation. As the noble and right
reverend Lord, Lord Harries, rightly says, the investigation by the
previous Government was not by some small, unimportant body without
respect, but by exactly the people to whom one might turn to find that
answer, and their answer was unequivocal. It seems difficult to suggest
there should be yet another investigation unless there is a clear
statement of what has changed since that one, what was missed out by
that one or what the Government felt should further be looked at which
had not been looked at. Yet that is not anywhere in the
Government’s response.</hs_para>

look at this extremely carefully for a reason which will be perhaps
more understood on these Benches than anywhere else. If there is one
thing that really annoys people about immigration, it is when people
bring to this country attitudes that are wholly contrary to the
traditions of Britain. That is why people have reacted so firmly
against the attempt, for example, to introduce Sharia law into this
nation.

fewer Jews in this country than there are Dalits. They are wholly
protected under the laws. There are fewer Sikhs in this country than
there are Dalits, but they are wholly protected under the laws. Most
people would say that there is no place for discrimination by caste in
Britain. If there is no place for that discrimination, how can it be
that all the other discriminations for which we think there are no
place are covered by the law but this one alone is not?</hs_para>

noble friend that I find the arguments used deeply distressing because
they go like this: first of all, that we do not know quite enough about
it so let us have a further investigation. Frankly, having had the
investigations up to now, if it turns out that there are no cases, what
harm will have been done? We will have protected people and they will
feel protected. If it turns out the investigation that took place under
the previous Government was unnecessary and its findings were not true,
then we have done no harm. However, if we leave it for another
year—and I am told, with some authority, that we will have to
wait only a year for a further investigation—we will have
another year in which people have no recourse, and at the end of that
we may still have no recourse, because there will not necessarily be a
legislative opportunity for us to bring this home to the
Government<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T16:50:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

I find so difficult to hear is that we will not deal with it that way
anyway, but will deal with it through education, with or without the
investigation. Here I do not want to follow the noble and right
reverend Lord, Lord
Harries<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T16:50:22"></hs_TimeCode>, except
to say: what do people say in this education? A Dalit in a class says
“Okay, I shouldn’t be discriminated against, but what
happens if I am?”. The fact that there is now education on this
means that the answer will be, “Tough luck, because there is
nothing you can do about it, as we have specifically refused to ensure
that there is an opportunity for you to take your case”. That is
a recipe for lack of integration, poorer community relations, and a
worse situation than would have arisen had we had no education or had
not raised the matter in the first
place<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T16:51:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030411000170" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0001.htm#13030411000170">The
third reason that comes up is one that I find more distressing than any
other. Every Minister who speaks about it—and we have two
Ministers of particular quality here—assures me that they are
totally committed to the eradication of discrimination, which includes
the eradication of discrimination on the grounds of caste, but that
theirs is a better way to do it. I believe that a decision has been
made somewhere else that is not on this ground at all, and is not
worthy. It is no good listening to those who, in their own
circumstances, have a view of caste that is different from that of the
majority of us in this House.</hs_para>

Britain no one should suffer discrimination on the grounds of anything
that they cannot help. They cannot help their sexual orientation and
their colour; they very often cannot help their religion, or they have
chosen that religion; and they cannot help their gender. What on earth
is different when they cannot help their 
<?notus-xml column=1299?>caste? You can change the name from “untouchable” to
Dalit, but you cannot change the fact that some people are treated in
an appalling way, simply because of the person they were

have absolutely no doubt that it would be utterly wrong for us to say
to the world that we had the opportunity to protect people from this
disgraceful discrimination but decided not to do it because we had to
have another investigation. I invite all noble Lords to look back on
the history of the fight against discrimination. What happened at every
point? Those who did not want to change suggested that we looked again
and examined it once more. They said, “Let education deal with
it; it’ll all come right in the end”. It was only when we
changed the law, however, and made it wrong not only morally but
legally as well, that we actually had a change in attitudes and gave
the protection which was needed.</hs_para>

group—let them make sure that they do not fail the Dalits,

Avebury:</Member></B> My Lords, I have seldom listened to a more
powerful speech in this House. I agree with every single word that was
said by the noble Lord, Lord Deben, except for one very minor point
which has to be mentioned. The Government are not proposing to
undertake any further investigation, but simply to review the
investigations that have already taken place. Therefore, what they are
proposing to do is of even less consequence than he credited them
with<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T16:56:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the study undertaken by the National Institute for Economic and Social
Research—which was mentioned by the noble and right reverend
Lord, Lord Harries, in introducing this amendment—that caste
discrimination actually occurs in the United Kingdom. That study
confirmed that discrimination and harassment of the type that would be
dealt with under the Act exists in the UK, as was reiterated only the
other day in a letter from one of its authors, Hilary Metcalf, to my
noble friend Lord McNally.</hs_para>

respectfully suggest that Parliament wisely decided that legislation
was indeed the right way to tackle discrimination across the board
after many years of trying to apply remedies to particular kinds of
discrimination such as for race—with the Race Relations
Board—or gender, by compliance with the 1979 UN Convention on
the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Nobody
ever said that before including race and gender in the Equality Act, we
needed to be satisfied that it was the most appropriate and targeted
way of dealing with the problems that still remained. Legislation was
seen as the top story of the edifice of ways of tackling discrimination
of all kinds. The onus is on the Government to prove that, in the
unique instance of caste, we should return to non-legal remedies which
proved insufficient in respect of the nine existing protected
characteristics and are no substitute for the right to take complaints
of discrimination to
court<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T16:59:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo>

given by the Government for failing to enact Section 9(5)(a) was that
there was no consensus on the need for legislation even among the
communities that were potentially most affected by
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T16:59:23"></hs_TimeCode>.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T16:55:30"></hs_TimeCode>We naturally
interpreted that as meaning the Dalit communities whose members are the
victims of this discrimination. However, it emerged in a letter from
the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, to the noble Baroness, Lady Prashar, of
May 2012, that the reference was to the wider Hindu and Sikh
communities. In that sense, there is never a consensus for legal
measures against particular kinds of discrimination. The policy of
ending apartheid in South Africa was vociferously opposed by certain
groups within the white population. At one time, plenty of men’s
organisations were opposed to women’s equality, including, I may
say, Parliament itself, and there are still institutions opposed to
LGBT rights. Fortunately, the absence of consensus was not used as an
argument for blocking legislation for the rights of racial minorities,
women or gay

I realised quite recently that some Hindus and Sikhs believe that what
we are seeking to do labels their communities as a whole as persecuting
Dalits. I assure them that nobody has any such idea, any more than the
Equality Act labels native British as being intrinsically racist, or
men as being intrinsically misogynist. There are already cases where
litigants such as the Begraj have done their best to use the existing
law to make a claim on caste discrimination grounds in the courts.
However, there has been no suggestion that a handful of cases point to
a general pattern of conduct among people belonging to certain
religions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T17:01:15"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T17:11:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13030418000117" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0001.htm#13030418000117">5

the Prime Minister raised an additional objection that needless red
tape, as he calls it, and additional unnecessary cost burdens for
business might be caused by this provision. That is not the case.
Employers would already have the duty to prevent caste discrimination
as part of their general duty of care towards their staff, and to take
remedial action if it occurred. The difference would be minor one-off

apparent rarity of caste discrimination, judging from the NIESR report,
and the fact that employers would already be looking carefully at race
anyway, of which caste would be a subset, means that the amount of
extra work is likely to be minimal. One suggestion in the letter from
Helen Grant MP is that gender reassignment is included in the protected
characteristics because of our obligations under EU law rather than
because the Government considered that it was wrong in principle to
discriminate against transgender

recommendation of the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial
Discrimination, echoed in the UN’s universal periodic review of
the UK, that we should include caste in the protected characteristics

there are no sanctions against non-compliance and whether or not the
CERD recommendations should be treated as obligatory depends more on
the Government’s sense of loyalty to their international
commitments than on legal principles. However, it is not good to see
the UK in the company of states which flout the recommendations of the

Government’s proposals, which we received only a couple of days
ago, reminded me of Groundhog day. We are back where we were three
years ago, with the Government commissioning a study, this time on
whether caste discrimination is likely to be more effectively addressed
by legislation or by other unspecified solutions. This is another act
of procrastination, as has already been said, because the question is
precisely the one they have been considering since the NIESR report in

Equality and Human Rights Commission, which has been asked to undertake
this study, expressed its opinion shortly after I and a few colleagues
had a meeting with its legal director, John Wadham, on 25
September last year. It supported the activation of Section 9(5)(a) and
issued a statement to that effect which is on its website. I suppose
that now Mr Wadham has left the EHRC, it could do a U-turn, but the
legal arguments have not changed, nor has the experience of
unsuccessful attempts to combat discrimination over many years prior to
2010. I am surprised that the noble Baroness, Lady O’Neill, has
accepted such a thankless task, particularly as the Government have
given no undertaking that if the EHRC reaffirms its opinion that
legislation is the right way forward, the Government will take its

reducing the means of legal redress available to victims of human

principles, not suggest to others that somehow or other to import those
kinds of conditions into the United Kingdom would ever be acceptable.
Furthermore, however important things such as trade relations
are—and they are important to British industry in developing
cordial and good relations with India or China—none the less,
the stand we take on upholding not just human rights but human dignity,

what a terrible and shameful thing the caste system is for us Indians.
Two issues are the most shameful in Hindu culture—caste and
dowry. Both have significant effects on people. Dowry leads to the
aborting of girl foetuses and the killing of girl children. Caste puts
people down; a whole group of people are there to do the worst jobs
that no one else will do. That can never be right.</hs_para>

Hindus are discriminating against other Hindus. Very few British people
understand the caste system or even know what caste means, other than
that there are higher and lower castes. Hindus in this country
discriminate against lower-caste Hindus. That is so appalling and
unacceptable that I cannot understand how it can be allowed to go on.
In India, as the noble Lord, Lord Alton, said, the caste system is
getting worse, not better. When India became independent in 1947 and
Ghandi started a campaign to allow lower-caste people to do all
different levels of work, we all thought that by now there would be no
caste system in that country. There was a great hope that the caste
system would die out. It has not done so but has got worse. People have
killed their own children because they have married a person in a
different caste. There are organisations in Delhi that find and 
<?notus-xml column=1304?>bring back young people who run away from their villages to escape the
wrath of their parents. They pick them up and bring them to their

caste but look to the inner light within”. At a time when even
the shadow of a lower caste person was said to pollute the food of a
higher caste, he instituted the system of langar, where people of all
religions and social backgrounds were, and are, welcomed to share a
gurdwara meal. The historic Golden Temple in Amritsar, recently visited

It has its origin in the desire of the Aryan conquerors of the

and then those engaged in more menial tasks. The conquered indigenous
people were considered lower than the lowest caste. Accident of birth

superstitions and cultural practices contrary to underlying ethical

emphasising difference and exclusivity, the Sikh gurus stressed the
importance of showing respect for sister faiths. The fifth guru, Guru
Arjan, showed his respect for Islam by asking a Muslim saint, Mian Mir,
to lay the foundation stone of the Golden Temple. The ninth guru, Guru
Tegh Bahadhur, gave his life defending the right of Hindus to freedom
of worship at a time of forced conversion by the Mogul rulers. At the

amendment because it deals with a problem which ought not to disfigure
our national life. My only point is somewhat technical. I notice that
in one of his quotations, the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, mentioned race,
of which he said caste is a subgroup. I believe it is quite reasonable
to suppose that the definition of race in the Equality Act, including
ethnic considerations, will include caste. The fact that an additional
power was taken to make orders in relation to caste puts that, in the
context of the Equality Act, in a certain amount of doubt. However, it
is quite important that we recognise that “ethnic” is a
broad consideration and 
<?notus-xml column=1306?>idea. According to the <I>Shorter Oxford English Dictionary</I>, which I
suppose has a special authority in some parts of the House,
“ethnic” means,</hs_para>

effect, that is what caste is. In the context of the 2010 Act, the fact
that a separate order-making power was introduced may have been
unnecessary. However, it is worth recognising, as the quotation used by

subgroup of race which, of course, is a characteristic that is at

debate too much because it is quite clear what many of your Lordships
think. However, I will make three brief points. First, I go back to the
theme touched on by the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries,
and others about the Government’s plans to address this
underlying issue by way of education. We have just been reminded about
dictionary definitions. Education is from “educere” to
lead us out; to lead us out, surely, into greater truth and the
fullness of that truth; for us to flourish as human beings; and to
become the best human beings we can be. Within that, I believe, the
spirit of God leads us into the fullness of that truth of all being
valued in the sight of God.</hs_para>

we need consistency in how we approach these issues. Yes, there should
be education but not only education. As we have been reminded by the
noble Lord, Lord Deben, where does that lead? If it does not lead to
the possibility of those who are being educated to treat others
equally, to have the law support that as well, we let them down and
fail them. Surely, our law is but the right ordering of our society. As
we have been reminded by the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord
Harries, this issue is about the public

and to which the noble Lord, Lord Alton, has drawn our attention,

to this point, we cannot let ourselves turn away. That would cause more
harm, more damage and more discrimination. I hope very much that the

listened to them for the best part of three or four hours and were
deeply affected by what they learnt from them. It was decided to
include a power in the 2010 Act precisely to deal with the problem
about which they had heard and to get the necessary research, which
they did, and then to deal with the problem of legal uncertainty. As I
understand it, the whole reason for the power was because it was

years ago when India became independent. I thought of that
conversation, too, when the noble Baroness, Lady Flather, was
addressing us a few moments ago. My father said, “India will
have its independence, and I hope that that will mean the end of the
caste system”.</hs_para>

wanted to speak briefly on the amendment of the noble and right
reverend Lord, Lord Harries, relating to the inclusion of caste when
considering cases of 
<?notus-xml column=1310?>discrimination. This is not a new debate; indeed, when the Equality Act
was published in 2010, a specific provision was included to allow for
caste to be added as an aspect of race at a later date. Later that
year, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research undertook
an extensive government-commissioned study into the prevalence and
severity of caste discrimination in the United Kingdom and concluded
that it does in fact occur in many of the areas covered by the Equality
Act, such as education and the
workplace<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T17:37:52"></hs_TimeCode>. That
led me to conclude that government action is indeed required as a
matter of some urgency.</hs_para>

a man with Indian ancestry, I am all too aware of the deep-rooted
prejudice and unfair treatment that results from allowing the
caste-based system to persevere. The Minister may be aware of the
religious concept of untouchability, whereby certain individuals are
declared untouchables due to their perceived association with impurity
and pollution. As a result, they are ostracised and isolated from the
rest of society in order to protect and preserve the quality of the
majority.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030418000059" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0001.htm#13030418000059">In
particular, across much of south Asia, the Dalit community has suffered
greatly from this deep, ingrained form of discrimination. Dalits are a
community considered so lowly in the social hierarchy that in some
circles they are in fact excluded from the caste system altogether and
completely segregated by social
customs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030418000060" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0001.htm#13030418000060">Historically,
in countries such as India, Dalits have also been physically separated
from the rest of society, housed outside the main villages and entitled
to perform only the most menial of jobs. This horrendous social
mentality still prevails in some rural communities, although thankfully
it is becoming less common. Today, the Indian constitution outlaws
discrimination based on caste and provides for the reservation of seats
in the House of the People and the states’ legislative
assemblies for those who have been historically disadvantaged due to
the caste system. There are also programmes to promote and provide
educational and employment opportunities for those such as Dalits.
Many<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T17:40:33"></hs_TimeCode> people in
this country will be completely unaware of the existence of such a
caste system and its history in suppressing minorities here. This is

drawn to support this amendment. Following further reading and a highly
reassuring discussion with the Minister this morning, I am now very
much aware of how seriously the Government are taking this matter. They
have been very clear that nobody should suffer prejudice because of
their caste, and as such have developed the Talk for a Change programme
to work with the communities affected by this discrimination. As with
so many of the most deep-rooted cultural ills, education and awareness
is the key to prevention and this is
exactly the approach this programme will take. I
also appreciate that there will be a political focus on the Hindu and
Sikh communities where the problem is most prevalent. Such
assertive action is extremely welcome and is necessary both in the name

been clear that they have no plans to remove the provision contained

Stowell of Beeston:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to all noble
Lords who have contributed to this very important debate. Let me start
by being absolutely clear: the Government recognise that there is some
evidence of caste prejudice and discrimination taking place in the
United Kingdom. Such behaviour is wrong; no one should suffer prejudice
or discrimination, whether because of caste or any personal
characteristic, and it should not be condoned whether or not it is
prohibited by
legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T17:44:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

further, I should like to pay tribute to the work of those who have

discrimination, particularly the noble Lord, Lord Avebury and the
noble<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T17:44:06"></hs_TimeCode> and right
reverend Lord, Lord Harries of Pentregarth. I think they underestimate
what they have achieved through their efforts over the last few years.

involved in this campaign know, the Government were already reviewing
the NIESR report that has been referred to before my noble friend Lord
Avebury tabled his amendment to this Bill at the end of last year.
However, a decision by the Government as to what action they would take
had not emerged at that stage. During debate in Committee, I undertook
that the Government would reach a decision which would be announced
before today’s Report. In the light of the strong arguments in
Committee, I also undertook to ask the relevant departmental Minister,
my honourable friend Helen Grant, to meet representatives from all the
major pro-legislation caste organisations. That meeting took place
earlier in February and my noble friends Lord Avebury and Lady
Northover and the noble Baroness, Lady
Thornton<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T17:45:13"></hs_TimeCode> were

rather, “What is the best course of action when all the evidence
is taken into
account<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T17:46:04"></hs_TimeCode>?”.
My noble friend Lord Lester referred to some statements that my noble
friend Lady
Warsi<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T17:46:08"></hs_TimeCode> made when
we were in opposition about there being a serious problem of caste

noble Lords have rightly acknowledged, made an incredibly powerful
speech in this debate. One of the things he said was that no one should
suffer discrimination on the grounds of something that they cannot
help. He was referring to castes and I agree with him. However, there
are other people who suffer prejudice in this country because of their

Government’s response, I will answer more directly the points

other forms of prejudice from which people in this country suffer to a

it
happening<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T17:48:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030418000073" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0002.htm#13030418000073">The

make it clear that we remain willing to consider whether there may be a
case for 
<?notus-xml column=1313?>legislating specifically in regard to caste discrimination, and hence
our willingness to meet representatives of the key groups. I will
return in a moment to the circumstances that would lead us to such a
decision, and why we remain unconvinced that legislation is the best
answer. It is clear from the NIESR report, which is the most robust
study available so far, that the majority of incidents of caste-related
prejudice or abuse would not be covered by equality legislation. Our
assessment is that the great majority of cases in the report are either
in areas outside the legislation—such as in relation to
volunteering, which is not covered by discrimination law—or
would already be subject to redress through a range of measures from
claims for constructive dismissal to criminal prosecution. That said,
we are clear that no one should suffer prejudice because of caste. Such
prejudice should not be condoned and it should never be ignored, and
that is why I am pleased that the Government have announced that they
are taking clear action to tackle caste prejudice and discrimination
through an education
initiative<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T17:50:51"></hs_TimeCode>. I
thank my noble friend Lord Sheikh for his support for this initiative,

Stowell of Beeston:</Member></B> I hope that, as I continue my remarks,
I will be able to answer the points made by my noble friend and the
noble Baroness. My noble friend Lord Avebury talked about business only
needing to familiarise itself with caste legislation when a case of
discrimination occurs. I would argue that that is not the case.
Employers and service providers have to familiarise themselves with the
law in order to avoid being faced with claims for
discrimination<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T17:52:47"></hs_TimeCode>.
The noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, asked about the cost
of the education initiative. I can inform him that the estimated cost
is around £20,000. I should also say that I thought that the
contribution made by the noble Lord, Lord Singh, on the history behind
caste was very illustrative because it demonstrated the point I have
just made in response to my noble friend Lord Avebury about the need,
if we were to introduce a law, to educate business in just how complex
an issue this is and therefore how much education will be
necessary.</hs_para>

joint initiative between the Department for Communities and Local
Government and the Government Equalities Office has already appointed a
body called Talk for a Change to take this work 
<?notus-xml column=1314?>forward in partnership with any organisation that wishes to become
involved in finding practical, community-based solutions to the
problems and harm that caste-based prejudice can cause. Over the next
few months, the programme will see Talk for a Change running a series
of regional workshops that will engage with individuals and
organisations from local communities to explore the nature and
sensitivities of the caste system and the emotional harm that caste
prejudice and discrimination can cause. In response to a point made by
my noble friend Lord Deben, I say that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T17:54:24"></hs_TimeCode> workshops
will also be used to raise awareness within those communities of the
channels of redress that are already open to those who feel themselves
to have been victims of caste prejudice, discrimination or harassment.
The outcomes from these events will be used to provide material that
can be made available to local authorities, schools, colleges,
employers, the police and any others who may come into contact with
caste-related issues. The details of how those who wish to participate
in this project can get involved will be available shortly on the Talk
for a Change website, and we will also ensure that these projects are
widely

education programme, which will explore all the issues, not just those
covered by discrimination legislation, is an appropriate and targeted
way of dealing with incidents related to caste that are not already
susceptible to the criminal law or other remedies such as employment
law or informal grievance procedures. However, that is not all we are
doing. As has already been referred to, the Equality and Human Rights
Commission was mentioned several times during our debate in Committee
as an important player in this issue. We have been in discussions with
the commission about caste discrimination, and both the Government
Equalities Office and the commission have agreed that it would be
useful to examine the evidence from existing studies and the extent to
which different approaches might address the problem. This work will
not duplicate the previous work undertaken in the area, such as the
NIESR

noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, and my noble friend Lord
Avebury, who I think used the term Groundhog Day when commenting on
this issue, let me make it absolutely clear how this is going to be
different. NIESR carried out primary research to determine whether
caste prejudice and discrimination exists in Great Britain. That
research included discussions with a range of organisations and
interviews with individuals who have claimed to be the victims of such
behaviour. The commission will use the evidence that is currently
available as part of its consideration of the nature of caste prejudice
and harassment and the extent to which this problem is likely to be
addressed by legislative or other solutions. The commission intends to
publish its findings later this year, which we will of course consider
carefully<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T17:56:54"></hs_TimeCode>. My
noble friend Lord Avebury asked whether a budget had been set aside for
the commission to look at this issue. The commission has not requested
a budget for this work because, as we debated at length in the previous
debate, it is an independent body that takes its own decisions about
its workload and spending within its own overall
budget<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T17:57:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

friend Lord Mackay of Clashfern raised an important legal matter, and
he was supported in doing so by my noble friend Lord Lester. He said
that caste is already potentially a subset of race and that perhaps the
current existence of the separate power on caste in the Equality
Act 2006 detracts from that. It goes without saying that my
noble and learned friend knows far more about the law than I could ever
begin to know myself, and whenever he intervenes to make a point, I
consider it carefully and with great seriousness. However, we are not
aware of any case law directly on this point, although I note that my
noble friend Lord Lester seemed to suggest that some exists. What I
would like to suggest is that, when the commission undertakes its
study, this is an area on which it might properly reflect as part of

the limited evidence of caste prejudice already available, we believe
that there is much to be gained through a programme of education, and
that is something that we can and will get on with immediately. Those
who suffer this prejudice have strong support from all sides of this

make clear that the people who suffer from this prejudice also have
support from Ministers who are currently in government; most
particularly, my honourable friend Helen Grant and my noble friend Lady

this educational programme and will most definitely take quite
seriously the results of the work that the commission has said that it

than here. That is true, and this issue needs to be seen against that
wider background. None the less, I myself gave a very clear example of
employment discrimination in this country, and we can provide the

Minister suggested that many of the cases mentioned in that study would
not be covered by legislation. That is indeed true. However, a number
clearly would, and that is surely the key point. At the moment, people
have no legal address, and it is absolutely fundamental to all aspects
of the law in this country that people have such address where they
feel that they are being discriminated against. While I in no way doubt
the sincerity of the Minister and the Government on this issue, there
is a clear division of opinion in this House about the necessity of a
clear law at this stage. I therefore wish to test the opinion of the

Lester of Herne Hill:</Member></B> My Lords, I was unable to take part
in the debate on this issue on 14 January in Committee because of
ill-health. I am grateful to those who spoke at that time. We are
dealing here with a procedure invented in 1974, one that has worked
very well and is designed to help people without legal aid to know
whether they have a good case for discrimination. This procedure
concerns not only ethnic minorities, religious minorities, women, the
disabled and the elderly, but everybody protected by the Equality Act
2010.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030425000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0002.htm#13030425000003">The
repeal of the statutory procedure that enables would-be claimants to
use a standard form to find out whether they have a good case would
greatly diminish and impair the ability of potential claimants to have
effective access to justice in pursuing claims of alleged unlawful
discrimination. It would be regressive and undermine the practical
benefits of the Equality Act 
<?notus-xml column=1320?>for women and girls, ethnic and religious minorities, the disabled, the
elderly, and gay and lesbian men and women. I therefore hope that the
Minister will be able to accept this amendment so that the procedure
may be
retained.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030425000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0002.htm#13030425000004">The
questionnaire procedure was introduced into the Sex Discrimination Act
1975 and the Race Relations Act 1976 when I was special adviser to Home
Secretary Roy Jenkins. The White Paper, <I>Racial Discrimination</I>,

that:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13030425000045" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0002.htm#13030425000045">“Help
will be given to a person who considers that he may have been
discriminated against unlawfully to decide whether to institute
proceedings and, if he does so, to formulate and present his case in
the most effective manner … In addition to helping the aggrieved
person to ascertain the nature of the respondent’s case at an
early stage by means of a simple, inexpensive procedure, this provision
will also enable complaints which are groundless or based on
misunderstandings to be resolved without recourse to legal
proceedings”.</hs_quote><hs_para UID="13030425000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0002.htm#13030425000005">The
position with discrimination law is that the burden of proof remains,
as it has always done, on the claimant to make out a prima
facie case before the burden shifts to the employer or
service provider. The Explanatory Notes to Section 136 of the Equality
Act 2010 explain
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13030425000049" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0002.htm#13030425000049">“the
burden of proving his or her case starts with the claimant. Once the
claimant has established sufficient facts, which in the absence of any
other explanation point to a breach having occurred, the burden shifts
to the respondent to show that he or she did not breach the provisions

Act”.</hs_quotefo><hs_parafo UID="13030425000006" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0002.htm#13030425000006">That

outcome of a case will ... usually depend on the inferences which it is
proper to draw from the primary facts. These inferences can include, in
appropriate cases, any inferences that it is just and equitable to draw

provisions”.</hs_quote><hs_para UID="13030425000008" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0002.htm#13030425000008">Abolishing
the questionnaire procedure would deprive the tribunal or court of the
power to draw such inferences because of the failure by the employer or
other respondent to answer the questions or because they did so in an
equivocal and shifty way. That would be unfair and unjust. The Minister
accepted in Grand Committee that the questionnaire form is
“simple and straightforward” but she cited fears
expressed by the Opposition in 1975 that the procedure might be abused.
That was before the forms were published and used and there is no
evidence of which I am aware that the procedure has been abused or
indeed criticised by any court, tribunal, legal practitioner or
academic during the 35 years it has operated. I invite my noble friend
the Minister to indicate whether she agrees, or has even a scintilla of
evidence—as opposed to assertion—that any court,
tribunal, legal practitioner or academic during the past 35 years has
ever suggested that the procedure is abusive. In Grand Committee the
Minister referred to the procedure as not being replicated in other
areas of employment law. That is because there 
<?notus-xml column=1321?>are special difficulties in proving discrimination cases, as the courts
have repeatedly
said.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030425000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0002.htm#13030425000009">The
procedure has proved to be of real practical benefit for potential
claimants and respondents and was extended by successive Governments
and Parliaments to the other forms of unlawful discrimination in the
employment, education, goods and services, and public service provision
fields. It applies to alleged discrimination because of religion or
belief, sexual orientation, disability, and age, and in relation to
equal pay without sex discrimination. It was included in Section 138 of
the 2010 Act without controversy or any opposition in either House. It
does not require the complainant to use the forms prescribed by the
Minister, so there is no micromanagement
here.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030425000010" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0002.htm#13030425000010">Complaints
of alleged discrimination—whether direct or indirect—are,
as I have said, very hard to prove and most of the relevant information
is in the possession of the respondent rather than the claimant. For
example, in a direct discrimination case the claimant has to choose a
comparator to prove less favourable treatment on a ground forbidden by
the Act. The burden of proof is on the complainant. Only the respondent
is in possession of the relevant facts about whether the comparison is
appropriate and whether the facts show less favourable treatment, and,
if so, the reason for this. Similarly, in an indirect discrimination
case, the claimant has to prove disproportionate adverse impact on
forbidden grounds. Again, only the respondent has the facts, including
statistical or other material and whether there is an objective
justification for the discriminatory barrier.</hs_para>

the potential respondent is encouraged to disclose the essential facts
at an early stage to help the potential claimant to know whether to
proceed and also to encourage conciliation and settlements by
encouraging the respondent to take the matter seriously pre-litigation.
If the procedure were abused, the employer or service provider could
refuse to reply and the tribunal would uphold their position because of
the abusive approach of the
claimant.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030425000012" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0002.htm#13030425000012">These
considerations were not brought out in the Government’s
consultation paper, which stated that the Government had seen no
evidence that the question and answer procedure reduces litigation. As
a result of the consultation, however, evidence did come to light,
notably from the Equality and Human Rights Commission, about the
practical utility of the procedure. The commission’s position
paper was published in August 2012. Its evidence is particularly
important. Parliament has made the commission responsible for
monitoring the effectiveness of the legislation and the likely effect
of a proposed change of law. That is what Parliament has decided. The
commission is able to draw on 35 years of experience by the equality
agencies it has
replaced.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030425000013" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0002.htm#13030425000013">The
commission has explained that the procedure has led to cases being
resolved or not being pursued and that repealing Section 138 would
limit the evidence on which a claimant can rely in proving their case.
The commission has found the procedure useful in assessing the strength
of a case and has made decisions not to assist a case under Section 28
based on the response to questionnaires. By making it harder for the
claimant to seek an effective remedy for discrimination there is 
<?notus-xml column=1322?>an increased risk of a legal challenge to the repeal of Section 138. The
commission also rightly points out that claimants will still have the
right to pose questions pre-claim but that it is preferable to do so on
the basis of the questionnaire.</hs_para>

cannot agree. With the existing questionnaires, the tribunal or court
can draw a negative inference against an employer who fails to respond
to the questionnaire. That is an important incentive for employers,
trade unions and services providers to respond. Without that incentive
the help given under the Equality Act and its predecessor Acts is taken
away and the claimant falls back on the disclosure powers of the courts
and tribunals. These are extensive and disclosure orders are far more
time consuming than filling out the existing
questionnaires.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13030425000016" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0002.htm#13030425000016">In
its excellent briefing, the Equality and Diversity Forum expressed
concern about the proposal to abolish the questionnaire procedure
because it saves money by deterring ill-founded litigation, enables the
early resolution of disputes, clarifies the issues in contention and
facilitates access to justice. Some 83% of consultees oppose the repeal
of this provision. Indeed—your Lordships may think this is a
killer point—the president and the regional employment judges of
the employment tribunals have described it as a retrograde step. There
is no credible evidence that I know of that the procedure is a burden
on business. I agree and I beg to

underlying theme. I feel that it is to allow employers to hire and fire
without any fear, weakening employees’ rights and reducing the
support and representation available to victims of discrimination in
the workplace, while making the EHRC weaker. It transfers many of its
resources and functions to the GEO, where the Government will have
greater control. The Government have cut the previous grants programme 
<?notus-xml column=1323?>and diminished the helpline. They are converting the EHRC into some form
of strategic think-tank, which is unrelated to the reality and everyday
struggle of disadvantaged and disaffected communities across the
country. It is among those groups that we find many of the less
powerful victims of unlawful discrimination. In addition, there are
closures of advice and law centres, with legal aid being denied and
costs now being associated with employment tribunal cases. That is the
severe context in which we have to look at the attempt to withdraw the
questionnaire procedure.</hs_para>

largely on the basis, as argued by the Government, that it is a burden
on employers to have to respond to questions being asked by employees
about their treatment. Employees have to get that information to
determine whether they have a basis on which to go forward with a case
of unlawful discrimination. Without that information, they literally
have no basis for doing so. The basis of my support for this amendment
is my experience of working with and against employers who want to get
rid of their employees. Many employers clearly support the reform put
forward here—getting rid of the questionnaire—because
they do not want to be accountable for their actions or to respond to
questionnaires in which they have to provide explanations for their
actions. They regard these questionnaires, as the government side have
argued in taking this forward, as a nuisance.</hs_para>

some of the questions being asked challenging. That is not simply
because they are seen and interpreted as a fishing exercise but because
unless those questions are asked, employees who have a feeling that
they have been discriminated against or an awareness that they have
been treated unfairly, and probably unlawfully, are unable to carry
forward their grievance. They cannot get redress without assistance,
which I have already mentioned is vanishing, and certainly without the
information that they need. Some of the questions asked, which may
bring forward information or are sometimes not answered, are exactly
what is required to help employees understand the nature of the
discrimination they have suffered or understand the explanation for why
they have been treated in certain ways that render it impossible for
them to succeed in a case before a tribunal.</hs_para>

Lester, pointed out, 83% of those who responded to the consultation
opposed the repeal of the questionnaires. We have had submitted to us
the EHRC’s position which recognises the usefulness and
importance of retaining questionnaires. Indeed, we have had a
submission from the Discrimination Law Association, which provided
examples of the usefulness of the questionnaires in helping both
employees and employers. Practitioners right across the country have
contributed to that. I hope that the Minister will recognise that the
case has not been made, with evidence, of how questionnaires are a
burden for employers, other than that they see them as a nuisance and
an irritant. In fact, in the name of justice, equality and fairness,
and to enable the existing legislation to be undertaken and enforced
effectively, as it has to be, the usefulness of the questionnaires
should be retained for that purpose.</hs_para>

two very detailed contributions that have just been made to this

abolition of the questionnaire procedure. I cannot understand why the
Government are proceeding down this path. As has already been
indicated, the questionnaire procedure saves money by deterring ill
founded litigation. Most of the consultees, including the British
Chambers of Commerce, were opposed to it while surveys have shown that
none of the businesses questioned raised concerns about the
questionnaire procedure. Quite honestly, there is no evidence at all
that the questionnaire procedure is a burden on business. As far as the
trade union movement is concerned, the TUC is totally opposed to the
abolition of the questionnaire. I hope that the Government, having
listened to the two previous noble Lords, will agree that this is not
the path to go down and will not proceed with the
abolition.</hs_para>

this amendment from the noble Lord, Lord Lester. He spoke with great
passion and authority about this issue at Second Reading and has done
so again to explain why this amendment is so important. In terms of
practical equalities on an everyday basis, this is probably the most
important amendment we are going to discuss today because it is about
how ordinary people can start to challenge whether they have been
discriminated against.</hs_para>

Lester, and my noble friend Lady Turner have just said, there is no
evidence that this procedure is being used as a fishing exercise. Case
law makes clear that businesses and other respondents are not required
to answer questions which are disproportionate and that a poor response
would not automatically lead to a finding of discrimination. Indeed,
the Government’s impact assessment fails to provide any
empirical support for removing this so-called regulatory burden on
businesses. The questionnaire procedure facilitates access to justice.
It helps both parties to assess where a claim lies and enables them to
reach an early settlement where appropriate. It is therefore crucial
that the Government should not repeal Section 138 of the Equality Act
2010.</hs_para>

Stowell of Beeston:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to all noble
Lords for their contributions today on this matter. I start by
repeating what I said in Committee on this measure: our proposal does
not impact on the substantive rights of those who believe that they
have encountered discrimination. It does not deny people access to
justice or reduce the remedies available to those who have experienced
discrimination. It simply replaces an out-of-date system with a simpler
and fairer approach for all. Let me be clear: we want a process that
commands confidence from all the parties likely to be involved in
discrimination cases.</hs_para>

the nature of the statutory mechanism around Section 138 of the Act,
and the particular combination of features—an unlimited 
<?notus-xml column=1325?>scope for request of detail concerning a possible
complaint, a short deadline for response and the
tribunal’s power to draw pejorative inference from
the response or lack of it—which employers and
businesses feel really back them into a corner. This process
started off, as my noble friend Lord Lester said, over 40 years ago
with the intention of a straightforward question and answer procedure.
In 1975, the then Minister described it as a way of enabling the
complainant to obtain simple, basic information on which to decide
whether to start a case. Noble Lords might compare that sentiment to
actual, although, of course, anonymised, examples of the sort of
questions that are nowadays put to employers. Here are a couple:
“Please specify the number of employees who have requested,
applied for or been invited to transfer to another department within
the 18 month calendar period prior to” whatever date;
“Please explain how many of those transferred had raised
grievances whether formal or informal, prior to their
transfer.”</hs_para>

supplementary questions runs to 40, 50 or even 100, all of which
employers, including small employers, often feel required to answer
within eight weeks or face a tribunal case where they are already
handicapped by the inferences which the tribunal may draw under the
statute. It is, therefore, not surprising that many businesses feel
that the balance has shifted too far in favour of the claimant. The
repeal that we propose will address this and, together with the
non-statutory arrangements that we are working on, will make for a
fairer and simpler process, as I said before, for all
involved.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13030425000029" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0002.htm#13030425000029">My

challenged again today by my noble friend Lord Lester and
the noble Baronesses, Lady Turner of Camden and Lady
Thornton. I find that a bit surprising because I thought
that the letter I sent to the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton,
on 8 February provided the evidence for that statement.
Indeed, I noted in that letter the alienation of employers
and other companies from the view expressed frequently in debates on
this clause that the obtaining information process benefits business as
well as individuals by weeding out unmeritorious claims.
In support of this, I refer to one particular response which
sums up the employer view: “The information we send in response
is rarely if ever used subsequently in the case, but does require us to
undertake a considerable amount of work obtaining and collating the
requested information.” It is a matter of concern that what is
seen in Parliament as a major benefit of the procedure—its
usefulness, on  
<?notus-xml column=1326?>occasion, to both parties as a prevention mechanism—is in reality
simply not shared, or even recognised, by respondents to the

emphasise that we are not trying to do away with the concept of
pre-claim disclosure. We do indeed note the claim of those arguing in
favour of retaining these provisions that pre-claim disclosure can on
occasion be helpful to all concerned. That brings me to what we propose
to put in place of Section 138 of the Equality Act. I underline what I
said in Committee about the value we see in encouraging a pre-claim
dialogue and exchange of information. Our early conciliation provisions
in the Bill are intended to achieve just that and will provide the
right sort of platform to help establish the basic facts to determine
if discrimination has occurred. However, even if parties do not in the
end agree to conciliation taking place, a conversation with ACAS will
give them a better

clarification, although I am listening very carefully. Is it

will return to what I was saying. If parties do not in the end agree to
conciliation taking place, a conversation with ACAS will give them a
better understanding of the issue and of the tribunal process. The
individual will then still be able to seek information from the
employer or service provider, before making any decision on whether to
take their claim to the tribunal. Individuals will still be free to
seek information from an employer or service provider about alleged
discriminatory conduct without the statutory process. Information can
be sought informally, in writing or orally.</hs_para>

take into account a refusal to 
<?notus-xml column=1327?>answer questions or their provision of answers that look evasive when
deciding whether a case of discrimination has been made out. The fact
that there is no statutory process does not remove the risk to an

it only removes the unnecessary and prescriptive process around
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030425000038" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0002.htm#13030425000038">In
conclusion I remind noble Lords of what I said in Committee, that we
are now in a different climate to 40 years ago when this legislation

others who have taken part in the debate. I wish that there had been
some assurance that I could rely upon, because I very much hoped that
it would not be necessary to test the opinion of the House. However, as
the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, said, this is probably—in
fact it is—the most important amendment that the House is
considering, because it seeks to help the vulnerable, who are more than
half the population. If you add together women, elderly people, the
disabled, black people, brown people, religious minorities, and the gay
and lesbian community, it comes to more than half the population.
Therefore, to take away a simple procedure that has worked well in the
estimation of all the judges and experts whom I have ever
known—and I can claim a bit of expertise, since I have been
arguing cases in this area for about 30 years, God help me, and perhaps
I have a little more practical experience than some others who are
advising the Government—will make it very hard to bring a

write a letter that will lead to any kind of result probably means
going to a solicitor or a trade union representative, if you are lucky

Thornton:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 76 concerns equality impact
assessments and would reinstate statutory requirements to undertake
them as part of the public sector equality duty. An equality impact
assessment involves assessing the likely or actual effects of policies
or services on people in respect of disability, gender and racial
equality. While equality impact assessments are not legally required,
they have been widely adopted as an effective and efficient means for
public authorities to undertake proper consideration of equal
opportunities. They are described by the authorities that use them
as,</hs_para>

case law suggests that these assessments provide robust evidence
documenting how decisions were reached. Indeed, case law has confirmed
that to have due regard to equality, a public authority needs to gather
sufficient information about the impact on equality, give such
information proper consideration at a formative stage of
decision-making and consider whether any negative impact can be
eliminated, mitigated or justified. Authorities are also advised to
have some kind of audit trail to show that the actions they took comply
with the duty. Therefore, while it is true that the courts have never
held that there is a requirement to complete a written equality impact
assessment or that having an equality impact assessment itself is
sufficient to show compliance with a duty—especially if it has
been completed with a purely tick-box or form-filling
mentality—the main components of a good quality, substantive
equality impact assessment process are what the courts have held to be
necessary in order to have due regard to
equality<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T19:05:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

ensure public authorities’ compliance with their duty to have
the Prime Minister and other government Ministers simply dismissing
equality impact assessments as wasteful, bureaucratic and unnecessary
exercises. Rather than calling time on equality impact assessments, as
the Prime Minister did at the CBI conference in November 2012, we
believe that these vital assessments should be enshrined in
legislation. We therefore call for an additional amendment to be made
to the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill that would require public
authorities to assess, consult, publish and monitor the likely impact
of proposed
policies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T19:06:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

important when, days after the announcement of a review of the public
sector equality duty by the Secretary of State, Maria Miller, the Prime
Minister announced that public sector organisations will no longer be
required to undertake equality impact assessments as a means of

duty. Instead, these important assessments have been dismissed as

government announcements about equality law being burdensome red tape,

<?notus-xml column=1332?>of these assessments. Indeed, I was reflecting that it would be nice if

will the Government do with that information? Are we going to find
ourselves at the end of the summer in a situation in which the
Government completely stop looking at the impact of any of their
policies, spending commitments and decisions on factors such as age or
gender, or on any of the different groups such as LGBT people covered

Hussein-Ece:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, support this amendment, to
which I have added my name, as it seems to me there is an awful lot of
misinformation regarding the benefits of having an equality impact
assessment as part of the public sector equality duty. The noble
Baroness has just mentioned tick-box exercises and bureaucracy, and
described how this provision can be seen as a burden. However, it is an
important tool and has been successfully used to assess the impact of
public services and of government policy on vulnerable
people<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T19:12:10"></hs_TimeCode>. For many
decades this was not the case. I cite my experience of working in a
health authority before the public sector equality duty came 
<?notus-xml column=1333?>into force, when it was very much up to the relevant health authority to
assess whether different sections of the community or different groups
received the same level of service, whether they could access that
service and, indeed, whether the service was even appropriate. The
public sector equality duty has gone some way to ensuring that
vulnerable people, who are not always able to articulate the fact that
they are not accessing a service or not benefiting from public
services, are catered for and is an important way of ensuring that
services are tailored to the local community. As I say, it has achieved
some
success<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T19:13:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030432000011" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0002.htm#13030432000011">I
am not going to defend in your Lordships’ House in every aspect
of the way that this provision has been implemented. Of course, there
is always room for improvement and greater accountability, and the
amendment tries to address that. However, we must ensure that equality
and the right of access to services is open to all, regardless of who
they are or their background. Concerns have been raised about the way
in which the steering group that has been mentioned has been
established to review this issue. There does not seem to be a lot of
transparency in the way that the review will conducted. There is also a
lot of concern about the independence of the group given that everybody
on it seems to be from a political party. I know that there is somebody
from the Liberal Democrats on it but I have had no contact with that
person. I would like to know how the group will take evidence and
evaluate whether equality impact assessments should be changed or,
indeed, removed. I, too, would like more information about this
steering group which has been charged with this very important
task<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T19:14:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030432000012" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0002.htm#13030432000012">As
I say, the duty encourages proactive action to close equality gaps in
health provision for different ethnic and other groups, and to ensure
that services meet the needs of those who use them. It provides an
important evidence base to support provision that is effective and
efficient and ensures that services provide value for money, so it has
served an important purpose. I hope that the Minister will accommodate
some sections of this amendment and will look at equality impact
assessments as a way of assisting the provision of services as opposed
to being detrimental to them. I declare an interest as a commissioner
of the Equality and Human Rights Commission when it instigated a review
of the Treasury’s compliance with the duty as regards the 2010
spending review. The public sector equality duty can make a huge
difference if applied purposefully, and was seen by people in the
Treasury and, indeed, by people in government as a helpful thing to do.
Aspects of that spending review, such as its impact on women and
minority groups, might not have been considered, so the duty was seen
as a positive and helpful measure. I hope that the Minister will say
how she thinks we may continue on a positive note by rolling this

bureaucratic 
<?notus-xml column=1334?>form-filling and ticking-off. Most of us who run businesses would not

consider that these issues should perfectly properly be dealt with in
law—a law which I am happy to say looks as if it will be more

should not present people with a detailed arrangement such
as appears in this amendment, which I am afraid very often becomes a
substitute for action. People may say, “I have done my
assessment and therefore I don’t have to think”. What we
really need is for people to think creatively about how best to do
these things. It is very much better not to lay down a recipe of the
kind proposed in the amendment, which slightly reminds me of
the nannying schemes which have these provisions less popular than they
ought to be. I am afraid that many people do not think of equality as a
progressive and positive thing but rather as merely another drudgery
which is laid on them. We do not want that; we want a society where
equality is included as a natural way of looking at how you run a
business, a local authority or a public authority. We do not want
someone to feel that he or she has done their bit of homework, has
ticked the boxes the right way and can now forget about it.
I am afraid that the “I can now forget about it” syndrome
cannot be legislated against but is very often the result of an

you are to achieve equality in the workplace—equality in terms

good many years ago when I was the national women’s secretary of
the Transport and General Workers’ Union. I was on a mission to
include within the rulebook of the union requirements for each of our
administrative areas to provide positive action programmes for women,
and for sanctions to be introduced into the rulebook against those
senior officials of the union who might be found guilty of harassment
or bad behaviour towards women. “Attacked” is not the
right word, but the response of more senior people in the union than
me—men—verged on that. They said to me: “We
don’t need a change in the rulebook, what we need is a change of
culture”. I said: “Of course we do, I absolutely agree
that we need a change of culture, but while we are working on the
change of culture we will have a change in the rulebook so that outwith
those rules you will not

I get into that, let me say from the start that this Government have a
strong commitment to establishing a strong, modern, fair Britain which
is built on two key principles: equal treatment and equal opportunity
for all. The equality duty was designed to ensure that the needs of
people are taken into account when public bodies develop, change,
implement or review a new policy or

amendment was discussed in Committee and, as has been explained by the
noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, seeks to impose a number of processes on
public bodies in addition to the central requirement to have due regard
to the three main aims of the equality duty when exercising their
functions. Some of the requirements it seeks to impose are already an
integral 
<?notus-xml column=1337?>part of the process of complying with the public sector equality duty.
Having due regard to the equality duty when exercising their public
functions is the legal duty on all public bodies. Let me be clear; that
has not changed, nor has the requirement to be able to
demonstrate that it has happened. For example, the proposal for public
bodies to assess and monitor the likely impact of their proposed and
actual policies is already required, while the requirement to publish
the results of such assessments is caught by the requirement in the
specific duties to publish information to demonstrate compliance with
the duty. These requirements include considering the need to eliminate
unlawful discrimination, advance equality of opportunity, and foster
good relations between people with different characteristics. Public
bodies are also required to publish information at least annually to
show how they have done this, and to set at least every four years
equality objectives that will promote these aims. There is therefore
already a thorough requirement on public bodies to have due regard to
the public sector equality

speech to the CBI last year, to which the noble Baroness, Lady
Thornton, and my noble friend Lady Hussein-Ece referred, the Prime
Minister was calling time only on the equality impact assessment

decision-making itself. Indeed, I referred in Committee to
“reverse-engineering” where it was clear that departments
had sometimes not considered equality as they made a decision, but used
the form at the end of the decision-making progress to justify that
decision. My noble friend Lord Deben in Committee referred to an
example of a local authority taking matters too far to the other
extreme and, perversely, being proud that it had done so because, for
the local authority, it had demonstrated its commitment. I am grateful
to my noble friend for his comments today and for expressing eloquently
and powerfully, as he always does, why greater prescription on the
equality impact assessment would have a detrimental effect on the way
that we expect bodies to carry out this duty, and the ultimate outcome

Prosser:</Member></B> Before speaking to this amendment, I should like
to clarify for your Lordships any question of a possible conflict of
interest. I was until 3 December last year the deputy chair of the
Equality and Human Rights Commission. At that point, I had served two
three-year terms and my appointment terminated. I therefore no longer
have a direct interest in the commission but I do of course retain a
general interest in both the commission and its
work<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T19:40:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

at hand, perhaps I may express to noble Lords my overall view of the
value of this part of the debate on Clause 57 and why this group of
amendments is so important to the future of the commission and to
equalities in our country more generally. The ability of citizens to
feel and believe that they have an equal chance in life and,
importantly, to feel and believe that their Government think they
should have an equal chance is key and central to the development of a
harmonious and comfortable society.
At<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T19:41:39"></hs_TimeCode> this

such as these require Governments to be strong and forthright in making
clear their support for tolerance and fairness, and to speak loudly of
the value of legislation and government machinery which helps people to
enjoy equal rights and to access recourse to justice when those rights
are violated. Comments from government which continually link
equalities legislation with red tape, bureaucracy and burdens undermine
the confidence of citizens and allow for the growth of intolerance and
unfair behaviour. The purpose of this group of amendments is to enable
the Government to be seen to recognise that the Equality and Human
Rights Commission is a valuable, serious and important tool in
delivering and regulating equality legislation in this country. It
would put the commission on the same footing, for example, as the
National Audit Office, the Electoral Commission and the Parliamentary
and Health Service
Ombudsman<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T19:42:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

commission’s accountability to Parliament has been endorsed by
the United Nations International Co-ordinating Committee chair. In a
letter to the then Minister for Equalities, Theresa May, the ICC chair,
Dr Mousa Borayzat, suggests that the Government should use the
opportunity of this Bill to strengthen the provisions of the Equality
Act 2006 in areas related to the commission’s
independence.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030438000005" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0002.htm#13030438000005">Parliamentary
scrutiny of the appointment of the commission chair has already taken
place. The noble Baroness, Lady O’Neill, appointed in November
of last year, appeared before the Joint Committee on Human Rights. That
extra interest and study of the recommended candidate not only adds to
the status of the appointment but involves and includes Parliament in
the process. Greater knowledge and greater transparency ensue.
Amendment 77 calls for this process to be extended to the appointment
of commissioners—again, increasing knowledge and
transparency—and I look forward to the Minister’s
response on that point.</hs_para>

78 and 79 seek to rectify the current unsatisfactory position whereby
the commission’s annual report and accounts and the strategic
plan are presented to whichever Secretary of State happens to have the
current responsibility for equalities generally. Since its inception,
the commission has reported to four different Secretaries of State,
each of whom has had equalities added to their already busy portfolio
of responsibilities. Changes to the responsibilities of those
Secretaries of State have meant that the commission has been shuffled
around Whitehall depending on where the Secretary of State came from.
It is a very unsatisfactory state of affairs. Given that the rights and
responsibilities contained within the equalities agenda touch every
single adult in the land, is it not more sensible and more appropriate
for Parliament to oversee and question these important reports and
plans?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030438000007" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0002.htm#13030438000007">Finally,
I turn to Amendment 80, which calls for the commission’s budget
to be approved by Parliament. Two dangers arise from leaving the
situation as it is. First, the current practice is for a budget
allocation to be drawn up and allocated to the Government Equalities
Office. This money then gets separated out with a share going to the
EHRC. This hardly helps to instil any sense that the commission can
maintain a healthy independence from government. Secondly, and most
seriously, the EHRC is internationally recognised as the national human
rights institution for England and Wales. Crucially, financial health
and independence are central to our being able to maintain that
international recognition.</hs_para>

2012, the UN General Assembly adopted the Belgrade principles. These
relate to the relationship between NHRIs and national parliaments, and
they include several mechanisms for closer relations between
parliaments and national human rights institutions. For example,
parliaments should develop a legal framework for the NHRI which secures
its independence and its direct accountability to parliament. The
principles also suggest that parliaments should invite members of NHRIs
to debate their strategic plan and/or their annual programme of
activities in relation to their annual budget. These amendments would
enable government to state clearly that arrangements in this country
most certainly comply with the Belgrade
principles.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030438000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0002.htm#13030438000009">None
of these amendments should concern the Government’s desire to go
easy on regulation or so-called red tape. They are all designed to help

equal opportunities for all. I beg to

as a commissioner of the Equality and Human Rights Commission until
last December. I am all too well aware that the commission is very keen
to advance its relationship with Parliament and to have the ability to
work across government departments. As has been said, the current
arrangement has acted as a hindrance and has not oiled the wheels, so
to speak, to enable the commission to work more effectively with other
government departments—something that it should be doing. It has
the responsibility to work with all departments across government,
given its wide-ranging remit. The current arrangement of going through
the Government Equalities Office has limited this to an extent. I see
the commission’s responsibility for assessing how the Government
comply with, for example, domestic and international equality rights
obligations as a positive development and a strengthening of its
relationship with Parliament.</hs_para>

said that setting the budget is so important that it needs to be done
in a more timely, transparent and effective way. I was at the
budget-setting process last year. I remember being at a board meeting
in February when the commissioners still had no idea what their budget
would be from 1 April. That is not satisfactory or acceptable, and it
needs to be addressed. Taking these amendments on board would go some
way to addressing this and making sure that the commission becomes more
transparent and accountable and is allowed to function. We talk about a
red tape challenge, but it goes both ways. There has been a lot of red
tape attached to this commission from its inception. It has almost been
bound and gagged at birth and has not been allowed to function
properly. This is a way of releasing it to an extent, while keeping
some important checks and balances in
place.</hs_para>

Thornton:</Member></B> My Lords, I agree completely with the noble
Baroness, Lady Hussein-Ece. I have written down “micromanagement
by the Government Equalities Office is a bit of a red tape challenge
that the Government could probably do well to look at”, so our
thoughts were heading in the same direction. I see this group of
amendments as continuing the positive discussion that we had in Grand
Committee, where the Minister started to explain where the Government
were going and what the direction of travel was. I see this group of
amendments as part of that process and discussion, and I congratulate
my noble friend Lady Prosser on her introduction.</hs_para>

addressing here is how the EHRC can deliver its statutory
responsibility to assess how the Government comply with their domestic
and international equality and human rights obligations, how it can
best do that and how it can be independent in doing so. It seems to us
that parliamentary accountability would provide the commission with
that appropriate independence from Government to fulfil its role
impartially. I hope that the Minister will accept something that I said
in Grand Committee: this is not a means of stopping the Government
setting the overall policy direction on equality matters. Everybody
accepts that that is the Government’s job. However, it 
<?notus-xml column=1343?>means that our Commission for Equality and Human Rights, apart from
anything else, has the necessary independence to from time to time be
critical of the Government and hold them properly to
account.</hs_para>

Stowell of Beeston:</Member></B> My Lords, as I said in response to the
first debate this afternoon, the Government want a strong, independent
Equality and Human Rights Commission that promotes and protects
equality and human rights. We want it to be recognised and respected as
the national expert in these areas as well as a strategic enforcer of
the law. Clearly, we also value its “A” status and want
it to retain it. We are committed to strengthening its accountability
to Parliament and, in responding to this debate, I hope I can
demonstrate what progress we are
making.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030438000017" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0002.htm#13030438000017">I
start with the appointments. As already acknowledged by the noble
Baroness, Lady Prosser, and others who have contributed to the debate,
the appointment of the new chair of the commission, the noble Baroness,
Lady O’Neill, was for the first time subject to pre-appointment
scrutiny by the Joint Committee on Human Rights. That is a move that
the Government welcome. In January, we appointed six new commissioners
and, with the appointment of the new chair, we believe that the new
board marks the start of a new era for the commission steering it in a
new strategic direction. We want to see the commission go from strength
to strength. We are open to discussing with the Joint Committee on
Human Rights how it can be involved in future appointments.</hs_para>

Committee, the Joint Committee on Human Rights has been in touch with
my honourable friend the Minister for Women and Equalities, Helen
Grant, who is the Minister responsible for the commission. The JCHR has
set out its plans to work with the commission to strengthen the
commission’s accountability to, and co-operation with,
Parliament and, in particular, with the JCHR itself. I am aware that
the JCHR seeks to work with the EHRC to develop a protocol of
collaborative working strategies to improve accountability. I certainly
echo the sentiment expressed in my honourable friend Helen
Grant’s reply to the letter from the chair of the committee. We
welcome the non-legislative approach taken by the JCHR, and following
this exchange of correspondence, which was circulated to noble Lords
before today’s debate, I understand that at the request of the
chair of the Joint Committee on Human Rights a meeting will take place
soon. To reiterate: there is ongoing dialogue between the commission
and the JCHR to the effect that the noble Baroness, Lady Prosser, has
argued for in her amendment.</hs_para>

that the commission’s annual report and accounts are already
laid before Parliament, as well as its strategic plan and its reports
on progress. With respect to the commission’s budget, since
Committee, and as I referred to earlier today, we have published the
outcome of the comprehensive budget review. This review, conducted in
partnership with the commission, sets out the agreed level of funding
adequate for the commission to fulfil its functions. As the noble
Baroness, Lady O’Neill, said, the review agrees a budget that
will allow the commission to,</hs_para>

noble friend Lord Lester mentioned in Committee, the
commission’s founding legislation includes an obligation for
Ministers to make sure that it receives reasonably sufficient funding
to fulfil its functions. That will continue. As such, we do not believe
that it is necessary for Parliament to set directly the
commission’s budget.</hs_parafo>

public bodies are set up in a similar way to the Equality and Human
Rights Commission, and that is because it is not practical as
a general rule for Parliament to provide the level of
day-to-day support often required. To agree a budget with an
organisation requires quite a lot of ongoing detailed discussion to
reach an agreed amount. That is not something which usually
lends itself to the work of a Select Committee. My noble
friend Lord Deben, who has a good deal of experience with
this, made that argument during Committee. It is
worth pointing out that, unlike most other such bodies,
there is no power for Ministers to compel the commission to do
anything, so in terms of the process by which it
agrees its budget, it does not set a budget to ensure it fulfils
something that it does not want to do.</hs_para>

framework document, officials are working with the
commission to put in place a new, improved framework by the end of this
month. While I cannot go into the detail as this work is ongoing, I can
assure noble Lords that officials are working to ensure the
commission’s independence is not compromised by the need for it
to be accountable. The noble Baroness, Lady Prosser, and others
referred to the ICC’s view of the commission’s
accountability to Parliament. It is quite right that in 2010 the ICC,
as part of its special review, suggested that it might be sensible for
the Government to consider increasing the level of the
commission’s accountability to Parliament. Our view is that this
is being achieved through the steps we are taking, some of which I have
just outlined. I should also make clear that the commission was
accredited as an “A”-rated institution without any change
in its reporting arrangements. My point is that its “A”
status was conferred on it as it is currently constituted, so it
already exists in the way that it is constructed. I am aware that the
commission will be considered at the next meeting of the ICC’s
sub-committee on accreditation in May. As I stated in Committee, we
have a constructive dialogue with the chair of the ICC and this
will continue.</hs_para>

the commission is accountable to the Secretary of State for Culture,
Media and Sport in her capacity as the Minister for Women and

standard arrangement for non-departmental public bodies. The rules
governing the relationship between the Government and the commission
are the same as those for the majority of non-departmental public
bodies. As I said just a moment ago, like most other such bodies,
Ministers have no power to compel the commission to do anything.

Joint Committee on Human Rights regarding further involvement in the
appointment of commissioners, for example. The discussion around the
development of protocol will be extremely helpful. On the budget, I of

Clark of Windermere:</Member></B> My Lords, it is a privilege to lead
this debate on the Government’s proposals for the commemoration
of World War I. It is a war which came to epitomise carnage and human
sacrifice. Many in this House will have had grandparents and
occasionally parents who participated in that conflict. My own
grandfather left the pits of County Durham to mine under the German
lines. I remember a photograph on the mantelpiece of my other
grandfather handling horses with the border

response to the war and to patriotism. Even as late as the 1950s when I
worked in Cumbria, there were still many who had fought in World War I.
The interesting thing was that very few of them ever spoke about it.
About 20 years later, when I was doing some research into the early
years of the Labour movement in Britain, I met a great many other
individuals who had taken the opposite point of view. Many had been
conscientious objectors who opposed the war—not usually on
religious grounds but on political grounds. Their opposition was not
upheld by the tribunals and most of them ended up in prison. Indeed,
they were very strange jailbirds. However, one thing was clear: both
sides respected the other over the years and both groups of individuals
were very brave. One must accept
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030438000030" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0002.htm#13030438000030">I found
preparing for this debate quite difficult. I am not a pacifist. For
five years, I was the principal spokesman for my party as the Shadow
Secretary for Defence. I was a member of the political wing of NATO for
nearly 20 years and I had the pleasure of leading the British
delegation for more than five years. However, I must admit that in
studying World War I, at times I have found it very difficult to
justify. World War I was divisive then and it is now, in both its
justification and especially, probably, in its conduct. The latter
continues to divide our society, which has been one of the challenges
for the Government and Dr Murrison MP as he tried to outline
a plan of approach. I think that basically he has got it
right.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13030438000031" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0002.htm#13030438000031">The
phrase, “lions led by donkeys”, so aptly used by another
former Member of the other House, Alan Clarke, still resonates today.
The stories of hampers from Fortnum &amp; Mason and the approximately
200 British generals driving their Rolls Royces behind the lines really
did not go down well when those soldiers returned to the land fit for
heroes.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13030438000032" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0002.htm#13030438000032">In a
sense, it was not only the beginning of the war that was divisive but
the aftermath as well. I believe that every one of us in this House
will agree on one thing; namely, the bravery, courage and valour of the
men who suffered the horror and deprivations of that war. Life in the
trenches was hell. With that we can all agree. I think that that is a
rallying point for us tonight. One realises that more than 1.2 million
allied servicemen lost their lives and double that number of Germans
lost their lives in that conflict. Overall, 10 million

War I was a turning point not only for us here in Britain, but for the
whole of Europe. Initially, volunteers flocked to fight for king and
country. That slogan began to lose its appeal fairly quickly and
conscription had to be introduced. What began as a war between three
conflicting empires headed by three monarchs—three

began as patriotic fervour ended by laying the groundwork for democracy

are most grateful to the noble Lord for giving us the chance to debate
this matter and for the thoughtful way in which he approached the
subject himself. He reminded us that grandparents or even fathers
fought in this war. As a private soldier, my own father did so as a
very young man. When I was thinking about that, it suddenly struck me
for the first time that had he not come through unscathed, at least in
body, I should not be here at all. That may be a matter on which there
is a division of opinion, but it is a sobering thought that so many
lost their lives in that war, as has been said so eloquently this
evening<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T20:15:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030443000002" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0002.htm#13030443000002">In
the short time that remains to me, I want to stress the role of women,
which was touched on by the noble Lord, Lord Clark. First, many young
women lost their young husbands and probably for ever after remained
widows, perhaps bringing up small children. We saw this in the Second
World War as well of course, but in the First World War there was no
War Widows’ Association, of which I am proud to be president, to
take care of them. It was a very difficult road for them not only
emotionally but in practical terms. We need to remember
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T20:16:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030443000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0002.htm#13030443000003">We
should also remember the immense contribution made by women in the
workplace when so many young men were taken off to fight and the women
filled in the gaps, even in the munitions factories. It was probably
that contribution that contributed very much to their emancipation in
1918, although of course there was still a certain caution as I believe
they could not vote until the vote the age of 30. It was 10 years later
before they could vote at the general age of 21, but at least it was a
start<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T20:16:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030443000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0002.htm#13030443000004">We
need also to remember those women who never even had the chance to be
married or to have children because of this great dearth of young men
who were sadly killed in the very prime of their lives. That must have
been a very great tragedy for all those women—a kind of unseen
tragedy—and we ought to remember them. It is my hope that, when
the Minister answers tonight, he will indicate that this role of women
in its various forms will permeate all the commemorations which will
take place whether nationally or locally. I do not want to see this as
an add-on or afterthought. I want it to be right in the midst of it. I
shall conclude on that
note.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13030443000126" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0002.htm#13030443000126"><I><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T20:17:35"></hs_TimeCode></I>8.17

interest in these World War 1 commemorations arises for two reasons.
The first is personal. Both speakers have said this already and I am
sure more will do so. My maternal grandfather, Alexander Rhind, 
<?notus-xml column=1349?>served with the 6th Gordons in France and Flanders. He won the Military
Medal for Gallantry. I still have that medal and I am very proud to
keep
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T20:18:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

pursuing the interests of a certain football club with which I have
connections. I have raised this previously in a Question. Almost the
whole of the first team of Heart of Midlothian Football Club joined up
and served in McCrae’s Battalion in 1914-18. Sadly many of them
did not return. Those of us connected with the club are particularly
anxious that there should be a mention of this and an involvement in
the commemorations of the club, the fans and everyone else.
As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T20:19:22"></hs_TimeCode> a result, I
have been in touch with many of the public and private people involved
in the commemorations—and there are many groups already. I have
encountered two problems that I wish to raise. The first is the lack of
co-ordination at both a United Kingdom and a Scotland level. In
Edinburgh the Lord Provost is bringing together all those involved so
there is co-ordination there. However, it is important that there is
greater co-ordination to help build up momentum at both a Scottish and
a United Kingdom level, so that people know what others are doing and
work together in a more effective way. With respect, I do not think
this is happening at the
moment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T20:20:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030443000008" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0002.htm#13030443000008">Secondly,
we also need some greater imagination and I think this is lacking at
present. As my noble friend Lord Clark of Windermere said, we have the
military, the museums and galleries, and the schools
involved—the traditional interests—and they are planning
the usual kind of activities. This is very welcome, very worthy, but it
is not enough<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T20:20:28"></hs_TimeCode>.
This country which marvelled at the brilliant spectacle of the Olympics
can and must do better. We must involve all aspects of our life. The
theatre can put on great performances; music can be composed specially;
the arts should be involved. All sorts of sporting activities can take
place. After all, at Christmas there a truce and a football match took
place. We should take these things, work on them and make it much more
exciting. Millions gave their lives for us in 1914-18 so we need a

emancipation. They also joined trade unions. In 1914 there were only
357,000 female members; in 1918 there were over a million. Despite
this, women’s wages remained unequal. Today, 100 years after the
First World War and 40 years after the Equal Pay Act, women working in
the UK are still paid on average about 15% less per annum than men.

events planned for four years from 2014 will concentrate on remembering
the dreadful loss of life that took place in the First World War, but
if those sacrifices are to mean anything, they have to be put into an
historical context and they have to raise questions which are relevant
to the citizens of a democracy in this, the uncertain 21st century. The
most important question of all is: when is it right and just to go to
war? I know from making history programmes myself that the great
stories of history remain just that, great stories, unless they raise
questions which can connect with a modern audience. Our Armed Forces
are still engaged in Afghanistan and there is the political temptation
to become involved in other wars, albeit for the highest moral reasons.

country and its
leaders.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030443000017" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0002.htm#13030443000017">For
this legacy to have a really lasting resonance, we need to bring fresh
eyes and thoughts to the First World War as a great catalyst for
change. I would like to see historians shine a light on to hitherto
unexplored areas of change during that tumultuous era. After all, it
was the first time that we saw total economic mobilisation, with its
huge industrial and social consequences. Likewise, it would be good to
look at the role of religion in the various arenas of the First World
War because it is still not well understood. 
<?notus-xml column=1351?>In the Middle East, we saw Islam, Judaism and Christianity
come in conflict, a legacy that we still live with today. And maybe we
should even investigate the states of emergency declared by Governments

All the veterans of the First World War have died and by 2018 the
70th anniversary of VE Day will have passed. There will be
only a few veterans of the Second World War left. We will always need
to remember the great sacrifices made by so many brave men and women in
the First World War and in all wars. However, I would like to ask this
of the Minister. Could 11 November also be a day of national
reconciliation and self-awareness? Perhaps we could even give it an

Cope of Berkeley:</Member></B> My Lords, when noble Lords go
home they should look at their local war memorial. War memorials are
our inheritance from those who first resolved that, “We will
remember them”. Most are getting close to their centenary now.
They belong to us all, and therefore in a way often seem to belong to
no one. I am a trustee of the War Memorials Trust. The trust helps to
conserve such memorials of every kind in the UK. Jointly with English
Heritage, we have just launched warmemorialsonline.org.uk which enables
the public—including noble Lords, if I may say so—to
register their local memorials and to tell us about their
condition.</hs_para>

It was not, as it sometimes seems, just Britain v Germany full stop, as
it were. My father first served on the Western Front at Passchendaele
and elsewhere, partly with colonial troops from the West Indies. After
recovering from a wound, he was sent to join Allenby’s force in
Palestine, which had a large Anzac element fighting alongside the Arabs
against the Turks. En route there his troopship was torpedoed and sunk
in the Mediterranean by a German submarine, and he and others were
rescued by one of the escorting destroyers from the Japanese 
<?notus-xml column=1352?>navy. It is for such reasons that it was called World War 1, and we
should commemorate it in its entirety. However, in my view the real
disaster was the Versailles Peace Conference. One commentator at the

that we had just agreed the peace to end all

up something that the noble Viscount, Lord Colville, said, I

experiences and literature of the First World War are, and the impact
that the war has had on our own history, lives and memories, and on

an extraordinary time and war. I hope that we will be able to listen
again to those voices of the war, in literature and music; to think

reconciliation and remembrance. These principles lead me to suggest
that Mons should be a location for major commemorative events in 2014

which we should maintain our local communities’ memory of the

authorities should have an identified officer with responsibility for
overseeing all war memorials in their area, if they do not already have
one. They should all be asked to identify ways of ensuring the
restoration of First World War memorials, where this is desirable,
given that the centenary of those memorials will take place over a
decade or so, from 2019. Public subscription, sponsorship and match
funding, perhaps from the Heritage Lottery Fund—and, perhaps,
using young apprenticeship schemes in restoration
techniques—could all be encouraged.</hs_para>

football actually happened. I am keen to see a reconstruction of the

Armentières, with football matches being played—perhaps
by youth teams from the areas represented in each of the trenches in

to commemorate and to encourage reconciliation. I hope that the

Lord, Lord Clark of Windermere. The enormity and horror of the First
World War came home to me in a very personal way when my mother died in

few suggestions as to our commemoration. At the very beginning of the
year, it 
<?notus-xml column=1357?>is terribly important that we focus attention on the horrors that came
after. August is a difficult time to have a national commemoration,
although we should set aside the Sunday nearest 4 August. However, so
that our children can be engaged in their schools it would perhaps be
sensible to have something on 28 June because in a sense
that day, the day of the shooting of the Archduke in Sarajevo, was the
event that triggered that appalling conflict. We need to engage the
attention and imagination of our young people throughout these four
years.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13030443000050" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0002.htm#13030443000050">The
noble Lord, Lord Davies of Coity, and I both introduced Bills—I
in the other place and he in this place—which would have set
aside Remembrance Sunday as a very special Sunday, on a par with Easter
Day and Christmas, with all the shops closed. The bells might ring but
not the cash tills. I suggest that during the four years of
commemoration, we should do that with Remembrance Day. Then, when we
come to 1918, we should set aside 11 November as a day of national
reflection. Everything should close commercially and we should be able
to focus upon what happened then and what has happened in the 100 years
since. We should give thanks to those who lost or gave their lives and
to those who were mutilated and whose lives were destroyed, even though
they might have physically lived on.</hs_para>

national attention on this, I would like there to be a competition
involving all schoolchildren, on the theme “Lest we
forget”. There would be essays, poetry and works of art, and the
best of them would be collected into a volume that could then be given
to all our schoolchildren. These four years are, as so many have said,
four years not of celebration but of commemoration. It is crucial that
we do not lose an opportunity to focus on the horror of war and the
beauty of peace. I trust that we will be able to do
that.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-04?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_04_PT_1/6D7ACCA820412D6F32A1DCF4DE2D2AC13EEB05E9" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 4 March 2013">Monday,

Maxton:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lord
Clark—and I call him my noble friend quite literally—for
introducing the debate and for making a speech that was balanced,
thoughtful and powerful. I come from a slightly different tradition
from those who have spoken so far. My family did not fight in the First
World War. In fact, my family opposed the First World War. My uncle, of
course, was Jimmy Maxton and he went to prison in Edinburgh—the
Calton Jail—for urging munitions workers to strike in order to
stop the supply of munitions to the front and therefore trying to stop
the war. My own father went to jail because he applied to be a
conscientious objector. His appeal was turned down and he was
conscripted under the 1916 Act. He was taken to Stirling Castle where
he was ordered to put the uniform on. He refused to do so. He was court
martialled and spent a whole year in Wormwood Scrubs as a
result.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13030443000054" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0002.htm#13030443000054">I
come not only from a family that opposed the war but also from a city,
Glasgow, although I may not sound as if I come from Glasgow, where to
some extent—not a majority by any means—a revolt against
the war was political and became part and parcel of the city’s
experience. First of all there was a political side: the Jimmy Maxtons.
We must remember that 
<?notus-xml column=1358?>Keir Hardie, who was the founding father of the party on this side,
opposed the war. One of the great iconic pictures for me is of Keir
Hardie, leading an anti-war demonstration in August 1914, speaking in
Trafalgar Square. Our first Prime Minister, Ramsay MacDonald, too
opposed the war.</hs_para>

increasing trade union activity in Glasgow against the war, led by
people such as David Kirkwood and William Gallacher. David Kirkwood
finished up as Lord Kirkwood of Bearsden—I gather the
grandfather-in-law of the noble Lord, Lord
Vallance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T20:52:10"></hs_TimeCode>. He did
not go to jail. He suffered an even worse fate. He was deported from
Glasgow to Edinburgh. It is difficult to imagine a worse fate than
that. Therefore, I represent a different tradition and I hope that when
we commemorate the war that tradition will be part and parcel of it.
Perhaps I may suggest to the noble Viscount, Lord Colville, that he may
want to look at doing programmes on that tradition. In terms of the
women, there was the rent strike in Glasgow.</hs_para>

one imagine a Minister during the First World War standing up and

in the 21st century, avoiding new “foreigner” scapegoats

Remarque’s novel is the story of a lost generation, of a modern
and mechanised war. It is about terror—either waiting for death
or trying desperately to avoid it, even if it means killing a complete
stranger to avoid it. It is a depiction of the terror of heavy
shelling, of losing a leg, of crawling blinded into No Man’s
Land, and of being gassed. It is about the stench, the filth, the mud,
the vermin and the blood and bone of all-out war. I just hope that the
2014 commemoration will ultimately be a hymn of praise for that
war’s poor bloody infantry.</hs_para>

Flather:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Clark of
Windermere, for giving me this opportunity to say a few personal words
about 1914. When I was Mayor of Windsor, I had to lay a wreath on
Remembrance Sunday. On that occasion, I was asked by a councillor,
“Does Remembrance Sunday mean anything to you?”. That is
my point: there are still educated people in this country who do not
realise how much we Indians did in the First World
War<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T21:02:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030443000070" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0003.htm#13030443000070">It
was a horrible shock to me because my father was a student in Ireland
at that time; he was at King’s Inns. Gandhiji said that Indian
students could help the war effort, but should not kill. So he joined
up—he volunteered—as a stretcher-bearer, and there I was
being asked if Remembrance Sunday meant anything to me. It was a
heart-rending moment to think that all those sacrifices and all those
people who had come here had got lost in the mists of
time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T21:02:41"></hs_TimeCode>. Nobody had

is also a good time to remember that Britain did not have a standing
army when the war started. It was the British Expeditionary Force that
went to France and it was a standing army of 150,000 from India that
came over in ships to help in France. They came in clothing that was
suitable for warm climates, not for the November climate in France.
Indians had a very hard time in the First World War. They had a hard
time with the food; they had a hard time with clothing and they had a
hard time with the climate, but they were still, as has already been
said, 1.5 million volunteers. We must always remember that they were
volunteers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T21:03:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

best—without success—to get something about the Indian
efforts in the two world wars into the curriculum. I hope that next
year, with the help of your Lordships, we will have that in the

are here; it is because of the time that so many of their ancestors
spent in the two world 
<?notus-xml column=1361?>wars. I hope that something important will happen and that we will get
some general acknowledgment—not just acknowledgment from those
who know, but acknowledgment from those who do not know and do not wish
to know—that yes, the Indians were there and fought bravely. My
father, who was a student, was a stretcher bearer, which is a horrible
job because you are always under fire. We need to remember everyone.

Bates:</Member></B> My Lords, my desire to contribute to this debate
arose originally from a wish to ensure that we focused entirely on the
brutality and evil of warfare, particularly that of the First World
War. In historical terms, it may be judged a war of choice, but the
appalling nature of the vindictive Treaty of Versailles settlement gave
rise to a much greater war, which became one of necessity. However,
that point has already been made eloquently by the noble Lord, Lord
Clark, who introduced this debate so powerfully. I associate myself
very much with the contributions of the noble Viscount, Lord Colville,
and the noble Lords, Lord Tyler and Lord Jones, who talked about the
evil of warfare. That point is illustrated by the 16 million who died
in the First World War, 1 million of whom came from this country, and
one of whom was my
great-grandfather.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030443000075" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0003.htm#13030443000075">Eighteen
months ago, I walked the full length of the Western Front and a little
further and was shocked by the little Portland stone headstones set up
by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. I ended up in Tyne Cot, the
largest cemetery. The scale of the cemetery was designed by its
architects to shock as it reflected the scale of the losses suffered,
and it did so. On the wall were inscribed the words of a not
inconsequential person: that is, King George V, with which I will
close. He said, in opening the

member of the Government’s advisory board on the World War 1

<?notus-xml column=1362?>initiatives is absolutely right. I am happy to pay my tribute to the
Prime Minister’s special representative, Dr Andy Murrison, for
the trouble he has taken to include as many organisations and
individuals as possible in the plans to commemorate the centenary. I

Worcester, each year we commemorate the bravery of the Second Battalion
of the Worcestershire Regiment which held the line at the battle of
Gheluvelt on 31 October 1914 as part of the first battle of
Ypres. It is not surprising that the events which the mayor is
organising for the centenary as a whole are extensive. They will
particularly involve young people, special exhibitions, displays of
memorabilia, events at museums, tours, self-guided trails, work with
schools, interpretation and restoration of war memorials. I was very
pleased to hear the contribution by the noble Lord, Lord
Cope, who has done so much work on drawing to our attention the

absolutely right that we should mark the centenary of the war, does the
Minister agree that it is also imperative that we get the tone and
language right? We should not, for example, allow the events to be
commandeered to become a continuation of the jubilee and Olympic
celebrations. This is about something much darker. The emphasis should
be on understanding and reflecting on the lessons from the
war.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030443000094" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0003.htm#13030443000094">Secondly,
the most interesting stories are the intensely human ones—from
the ferocious political arguments among our leaders and within the
political parties to the wave of fervent patriotism that led a
generation of young people to volunteer; and to the misjudgments of the
military leaders that lead to the ultimate carnage. Does the Minister
therefore agree that we need to find a way to shine a light on those
human judgments and failings without taking anything away from the
bravery and sacrifice of the million or more Britons who died on the
battlefields, as well as those international soldiers who fought
bravely alongside them. I also share my noble friend Lord
Maxton’s plea that the honourable and equally brave role of
conscientious objectors should be acknowledged in that
regard.</hs_para>

Minister agree that we should pay particular respect to the artists and
war poets who, for the first time in history, really shaped our
understanding of war and the way that it is remembered, and the horror
that is involved? Finally, how do the Government intend to pick up the
points made by a number of colleagues around the Chamber on the
contribution of women to the war effort, which, as we have heard, laid
the way to universal suffrage and helped to shape our modern
democracy?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13030443000096" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-0003.htm#13030443000096">These,
among many issues raised today, are why we welcome the emphasis on
creating an educational legacy to enable young people to study and
visit the battlefields and consider the impact on their local
communities. For many, it will be a new and shocking story from which a
shared experience and understanding will grow. Fresh thinking,
imagination and a debate on the nature of patriotism will all have a
role in this regard. I was also interested in the proposal of the 
<?notus-xml column=1365?>noble Viscount, Lord Colville, for a debate on when it is ever right to
go to war. I should like such a debate to take place also as part of
the commemoration.</hs_para>

protect them. My noble friend Lord Shipley spoke about the
responsibility of war memorials. A number of grant schemes are
available to support their maintenance and conservation and they must

not forget that this was a war involving over 30 countries across the
world, and the enormous contribution made by Commonwealth countries. I
assure the noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, of our eternal gratitude. The
nearly 230,000 deaths among military personnel from countries now

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, the Government have been clear that the
attempted manipulation of the London interbank offered rate is
completely unacceptable and has no place in the UK’s financial
services industry. That is why we moved quickly after the initial
revelations emerged to ask Martin Wheatley, the chief
executive-designate of the new Financial Conduct Authority, to consider
what immediate reforms could be made. The Wheatley review, which was
published in September, provides a 10-point plan to reform LIBOR,
including recommendations to both government and market participants.
The Government welcomed and endorsed the Wheatley review’s
recommendations, and have asked all institutions to which they are
addressed to implement them without
delay.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303044000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-gc0001.htm#1303044000004">The
Government believe that the banks and the British Bankers’
Association have to take responsibility for their failings and act on
Mr Wheatley’s recommendations, including the removal and
replacement of the BBA as operational LIBOR administrator. HM Treasury
and the BBA have been working together and have made significant
progress in laying the foundations for this unprecedented process. The
noble Baroness, Lady Hogg, is now leading an independent committee that
will recommend an appropriate successor. This builds on the legislative
changes that we have already made. Following the Wheatley review, we
introduced the following amendments to the Financial Services Act,
which are relevant to today’s debate, to enable benchmark
activities to be brought within the scope of statutory regulation under
FiSMA, and to create a new, distinct criminal offence for making false
or misleading submissions in connection with the determination of
benchmarks.</hs_para>

underpin these changes, which we are debating today, were laid before

first statutory instrument amends the Financial Services and Markets
Act 2000 (Regulated Activities) Order, to denote that submitting to and
administering a benchmark are both regulated activities. The draft
order specifies LIBOR as the relevant benchmark. The regulation of
these activities will enhance and strengthen the FCA’s ability
to make rules on benchmark-setting, as well as its ability to supervise
directly and take regulatory action against those involved in
benchmark-setting processes. It will also implement a key
recommendation of the Wheatley review. Under this order, the banks that
submit to LIBOR and the successor to the BBA will be regulated by the

a benchmark. Similarly, if the administrator of the benchmark happens

punished, if appropriate, by the civil and criminal law. The Serious
Fraud Office has launched a criminal investigation into allegations of
LIBOR manipulation under the Fraud Act. However, the Government believe
that the FCA should also have the powers to investigate and prosecute
this type of conduct in relation to benchmarks in the future. Although

Eatwell:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for introducing
these orders. I will take them in reverse order, so to speak, since the
major issue of the amendments relating to LIBOR and its subsequent
management is the most weighty, and we can take some of the later
amendments perhaps more quickly and dispose of

as the noble Lord says, the consequential amendments refer primarily to
the specification of which parts of the FSA rulebook are to be divided
between the PRA and the FCA. This seems rather minor but has very
significant consequences, because you are taking what was, we hope, an
internally consistent document and ripping it apart. The question is
therefore whether the consistency that existed in the previous document
will be retained in the subsequent two documents. It would be helpful
if the noble Lord could elaborate a little on that, particularly in the
light of the recent arguments being made by Mr Haldane of the Bank of
England, who has argued most strongly that the excessive number of
pages of regulation should be significantly reduced in order to reduce
complexity. If Mr Haldane’s rule is to be followed, will we end
up, when these rulebooks are divided following these measures, with
more pages or
fewer<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T15:41:10"></hs_TimeCode>? A
particular element puzzled me in this particular order. In respect of
Article 13, which amends the Corporation Tax Act 2009, can the Minister
explain how transforming “Insurance Prudential
Sourcebook” into “Prudential Sourcebook for
Insurers” has any substance
whatever?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303044000018" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-gc0001.htm#1303044000018">Uncertificated
securities is a very important area and there has been huge growth in
electronic exchanges and uncertificated insurances of this type. The
order refers at many points to the notion of excessive regulation by
the managers or operators of electronic transfer systems. Can the noble
Lord elaborate on who is to define “excessive” and,
indeed, how it is to be specified? If there is to be some clarity in
this law, it would help if the notions of “excessive” and
“disproportionate”, which are used at several points
throughout the order, were clearly
defined<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T15:42:35"></hs_TimeCode>. There
was one other puzzle, rather like the puzzle I have about the Insurance
Prudential Sourcebook, on which the Minister could perhaps help me. In
the redefinition of responsibility from the Treasury to the Bank of
England, it is clear that “Treasury” is a collective noun
while “Bank of England” is singular. Why is that? Is it
because the Bank of England is a singular person, namely the governor,
whereas the Treasury has responsibility shared out more
widely<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T15:43:11"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

the matters before us today, the orders referring to misleading
statements and impressions, which essential collect a number of areas
which will be responsible if other benchmarks should be developed

responsibilities associated with misleading statements and impressions.
In the noble Lord’s description of the creation of those lists,
he referred to the possibility of further benchmarks being included
within the procedures defined within the Act. He told us that these
were now being considered internationally, and that we await
international rulings on these matters. It seems that there is a stark
contrast between the very prompt action that was taken following the
Wheatley report in respect of LIBOR and the effective kicking into
touch of all the other areas which are of equivalent importance. Can
the Minister assure us that major benchmarks used within the City of
London are not today being manipulated? Can he assure us that the
delays in international consideration of these matters will not result
in some of the same activities as we have seen with respect to

the FCA managing the determination of LIBOR before a particular agent
is appointed, or is it to refer to when some form of agent is
appointed? I was rather puzzled by this section of the order. The

not? If it was manipulated, and if there was a change in LIBOR, there
are consequential impacts on millions of contracts, with a potential
impact of losses which, if taken across the variety of contracts, may
be substantial. Given that firms have been fined, particularly by the

to act together as a coherent unit? The fear that Mr Haldane and others

general question on the participation of banks in the LIBOR-setting

participate in the process. At the moment, many seem in effect to get a
free ride by allowing others to be the participants in the rate-setting
process. They then use the rate across the many instruments and
transactions that they sign up to, but because they did not participate
themselves, they were in many ways getting a free ride, not exposing
their internal positions to public view in the way that the
participants were and making it much more difficult for other banks to
compete against them when some were being transparent and others were
not<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T15:50:19"></hs_TimeCode>. I wonder

heart of my questions for the Minister are the sanctions of themselves.
We all strongly support the new offence of making false or misleading
statements and false or misleading impressions in the submission of
benchmark information in the setting of a rate such as LIBOR. One of
the underlying concerns has been the way in which the regulator
approaches such violations, which is to come down increasingly hard on
the individuals who have been clearly and directly involved in that
false submission but not to look upwards to those who create the
culture and environment in which that behaviour takes place. Tracey
McDermott has said on several occasions that the appropriate way to
enforce is to find the problem and then follow the trail and to stop
questioning at the point where the trail goes cold. That obviously
creates for senior management an advantage in wilful ignorance and
makes it beneficial for them not to know in any detail what is
happening in their organisation, certainly for there to be no trail
that would be easy for a regulator to follow. Many of us have come to
the conclusion that the regulator needs to have a way to look through
that to make senior members of a company accountable for behaviour that
is happening on their watch and which they do not know about through
negligence, in a sense, rather than through deliberate deceit on the
part of those carrying out the wrongful behaviour. Can the Minister
make any comments about that?</hs_para>

that the regulator has sanctions that are strong

you reduce the number of pages, that puts more of a requirement on us

regulation, and then the regulated respond with more complex
instruments to evade the regulations that have just been introduced.

in consultation with the FCA. The noble Baroness asked whether the new
legislation would enable and encourage the regulator to follow the

misbehaving but goes up the supply chain. The key thing is that, for
the first time, the regulator will be able to look at this at all in a
systematic way. It has now got the powers to do so and I think that

by these two instruments were announced as part of the
Chancellor’s Autumn Statement on 5 December last year. I should
confirm from the start that the basis of indexation that has been used
to calculate the changes covered by these two instruments is the same
as that used for the 2012-13 tax year. In the Budget in March 2011, we
announced that, from the 2012-13 tax year, the basis for indexation of
most NICs rates limits and thresholds would be the consumer prices
index instead of the retail prices index rate of inflation. This is
because the Government believe that the CPI is the most appropriate
measure of the general level of prices.</hs_para>

tax year. The class 1 lower earnings limit will be increased from
£107 to £109 per week from 6 April 2013. The lower
earnings limit is the level of earnings at which contributory benefit
entitlement is secured. However, NICs do not need to be paid by
the employee until earnings reach the primary
threshold. The class 1 primary threshold will be increased to
£149 per week from 6 April 2013. The secondary threshold is the
point at which employers start to pay class 1 NICs. In line with the
commitment in the Budget in 2011, this is being
increased by RPI to £148 per week.</hs_para>

£32,010. This means that the point at which the higher rate tax
kicks in will be reduced to £41,450 in 2013-14. As I mentioned,
the upper earnings limit is not subject to CPI indexation. In order to

that I noticed that in the noble Lord’s introduction, although
he made the traditional argument for CPI over RPI, he mentioned
particular rates with respect to RPI. Those are clearly elements which
are grandfathered within the social security structure. Are those RPI
upratings to be maintained over the medium term, or is this a
transitional arrangement? I have lost that in the complexity. That is

and more broadly, can the Minister address the issue of
entitlements? Both measures refer to securing
entitlements, and that is particularly true with respect 
<?notus-xml column=262?>to the order on contributions. The whole notion of an entitlement is
that one has some predictive expectation of returns, but
we know today that there is no such predictive
entitlement to returns. Governments—I do not say just this
Government—change the pension rules, upratings with respect to
pensions and the pension age. So the entitlement that individuals are
acquiring by making those contributions is simply in the hands of this
and any future Administration.</hs_para>

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for his comments.
On the first point, perhaps I should have said that the RPI, as opposed
to the CPI, is used in respect of the secondary threshold and the upper
earnings and upper profit limits. Do the Government intend to maintain
that in the medium term or to phase it out? We have said that the RPI
increase will be for this Parliament, so we have no immediate intention
to phase it
out<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T16:14:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1303044000053" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-gc0001.htm#1303044000053">On
entitlements under national insurance legislation and the fact that the
Government change the rules, the problem here, I suspect, is that, as
the noble Lord said, the link between paying into national insurance
and what one gets by way of benefits from the system is very weak. We
have gone a long way from the Lloyd George principle, when it was all
very straightforward. Because the situation is much less clear than it
was when the system was established, it will be quite difficult for the
Government either to link national insurance payments more closely to
entitlements or to merge income tax and national insurance into a
single payment, which I know that my party and others and the
Government have considered. We have ended up with a complicated system
which succeeds in generating, broadly speaking, the amount of money
required to fund the welfare state. I cannot see in the near future,
and certainly not in this Parliament, a fundamental rethink about how
we do
that.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="1303044000102" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130304-gc0001.htm#1303044000102">Motion

Commission noted that it could be flexible with respect to the cap of
5% on the contribution of first generation biofuels towards the 10%
renewable energy target for transport and in relation to the
recognition of the different greenhouse gas impacts of biodiesel and
bioethanol. I agreed that a single approach was not helpful as the
evidence indicated that bioethanol and biodiesel have very different
ILUC implications and suggested that basing the proposal instead on the
ILUC factors of biofuels would be a more appropriate way of tackling
the problem and would allow investment to continue in more sustainable
bioethanol. A number of member states supported this position. Most
member states considered that the 5% cap on industry was too
restrictive and damaging to investor confidence.</hs_para>

opened the policy debate on the future of the internal energy market

capacity markets. Member states responded by stating their support for
the principle of the single market. I emphasised the UK’s strong
support for the single market, including the network codes which will
enhance cross-border exchange of power. I pointed out that security of
supply is also a vital consideration which is why the UK planned to
implement a capacity market to ensure continuity  of supply
while we modernised our power sector and

report on 17 October 2012. Today we are setting out the
Government’s response to the MAC’s recommendations. In

recommendation that the minimum should generally be set at the 25th
percentile of wages in that occupation. We are introducing alternative
rates for new entrants. These will be set at the 10th percentile of
wages in each occupation. After three years the new entrant, usually
these will be those aged 25 or under, will have to be paid at the

distributed more fairly across the country. Local authorities told us
