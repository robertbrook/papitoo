is absolutely right to emphasise the importance of ensuring that

Perhaps the most telling remarks about the lack of ambition in schools
in east Durham were uttered by Lord Adonis. Having visited a school
there, he said that a teacher had told him, “In the past
children turned right to work in the shipyards or left to work in the
coal mines. Now they might as well walk on into the sea.” That
spirit of defeatism reported by the noble Lord is exactly what we need
to attack. Instead of attacking the Government, the hon. Gentleman

papers in primary schools allowing children at the end of key stage
2—the end of their primary curriculum—to aspire to do
even better by reaching a level 6, which is a higher level of
achievement than was previously available to them, while the changes we
hope to make to GCSEs will, I hope, drive a higher level of attainment
as well. Furthermore, we have said to all state schools that they have
an opportunity to visit for free a Russell group university on behalf
of their students in order to aspire to do better. There is much more
that we can do, however, and I look forward to working with the hon.

all routes of permanency for children who go into the care system.
There is no inbuilt hierarchy, although we know that adoption is a very
successful route for many—we think more—children. Through
the Children and Families Bill, we are trying to improve the
educational attainment of children in care by introducing a statutory
duty for local authorities to appoint a virtual school head, whose
remit is specifically to try to improve the educational attainment of
children in the care of local authorities so that the
outcomes are better and they have the prospect of a fulfilling

just said. Let us make it clear that we will allow more flexibility in
ratios only for high-quality providers where high-quality staff are
being hired. The aim, as advocated by the shadow Secretary of State, is
to move to systems such as those of Sweden and Denmark, which have
high-quality providers, high-quality staff and more flexibility and
professional judgment operated at a local level. Everyone, from Andreas

people to come forward to adopt, because we have a huge shortfall, and
that is a national crisis that we need to address. That is exactly what
we are doing through our Children and Families Bill reforms, which will
help to drive up the interest and confidence of the many people who
want to adopt and enable them to do so. One of the reasons we need to
do that is that more children require adoption as their best route into
permanency. We need to ensure that the people who come forward have the
requisite skills and capability to provide a loving home. I am sure
that as we move into Committee and hear evidence tomorrow on the
adoption reforms we will enjoy discussing this issue further.</hs_Para>

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T15:36:46"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend for his statement. I say at the start that the Government have
been absolutely right to restrict aid to non-lethal support when
assisting anti-Government forces in the civil war. Until recently, a
strict arms embargo has been preventing the flow of weapons from the
European Union to Syria, but at a recent EU summit the Foreign
Secretary appeared 
<?notus-xml column=674?>to press for that embargo to be at least relaxed.
Yesterday, he appeared to suggest that the British Government might at
some stage be prepared actively to arm the
rebels<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T15:37:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1303049000201" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/debtext/130304-0001.htm#1303049000201">I
appreciate the statement that my right hon. Friend the Minister has
made today, but I suggest to him that there can be little doubt that,
although there has not been a change in Government policy—there
cannot be without EU approval—there has been a change in
Government thinking. That prompts a number of
questions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T15:37:52"></hs_TimeCode>. Why
the change in approach and thinking? It is quite clear from
yesterday’s statement that the Foreign Secretary believes that a
step up in support by way of exporting arms is on the agenda. Let us
not forget that, only in January, the Government were strongly
advocating non-lethal support for opposition forces.</hs_Para>

discussions has the Foreign Secretary had with fellow Security Council
members<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T15:38:24"></hs_TimeCode>? I
suggest to my right hon. Friend the Minister that any increase in our
support by way of arms can only escalate the violence on the ground in
the short term, and with it the suffering of the people. Both sides
have been accused by human rights groups of committing atrocities, and
that is important to
remember<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T15:38:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1303049000203" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/debtext/130304-0001.htm#1303049000203">What
calculation have the Government made? Is the thinking that a sharp
escalation will somehow bring this torrid affair to an end, and that
the only way to quicken the end is to arm the rebels? Moreover, there
are credible reports that extremists are fighting alongside the rebels.
Will the Minister update the House on that matter, and what guarantees
can he give that if we were to export arms to rebels, they would not
fall into the hands of terrorists? It is difficult to ensure on the
ground that that does not
happen.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1303049000204" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/debtext/130304-0001.htm#1303049000204">I
advise caution. The Foreign Secretary appeared to be contemplating
stepping up support for one side in the civil war, but both sides have
been committing atrocities. We may be supplying the terrorists of the
future and shipping arms does not reduce tensions. Such a policy would
also bring us closer to intervention. When we supplied arms to Iraq
during the Iraq-Iran war, a lot of people died but in the end neither
side became our friend. Interventions rarely go to plan and I hope the
Government will think carefully before pushing for a change to this
policy with regard to neighbours and

the death toll in Syria approaches 70,000 people; human rights groups

Richard Shepherd</B> (Aldridge-Brownhills) (Con):</Member> I believe
that the Bill, being a constitutional Bill, is of enormous importance
to the well-being of our society. The concepts contained in it touch on
the very intimacy of our concepts of liberty and due process. I
therefore object to the guillotine motion on the basis that it is a 
<?notus-xml column=684?>truncation of the most primary and fundamental charge that this House
has: namely, to give all due consideration to Bills that touch on our
constitutional rights, our freedoms and our liberty. The Bill seeks to
do something very profound indeed: to deny open justice on the basis
that we will get better justice by making it covert or secret. It would
place a British citizen in the position of not knowing why they might
have lost a claim in the courts, and their lawyer will not be able to
tell them why either. Surely this House should be given the time it
requires to consider the Bill, which is on a constitutional matter of
the gravest importance, and examine fully the contentions contained
therein<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T16:06:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="1303049000521" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/debtext/130304-0001.htm#1303049000521">4.6

Peter Bone</B> (Wellingborough) (Con):</Member> Following that
excellent speech from
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T16:06:48"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Sir Richard Shepherd), I would like
to add my support to his argument. The Government seem routinely to
table programme motions of the sort they opposed when in opposition.
They really do not need a programme motion. We are not exactly pressed
for business at the moment. It seems to me that on the
constitutional matter we are discussing, which is extremely important,
and there are deep arguments about it on both sides, we should have
unrestricted time to scrutinise
it.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="1303049000522" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/debtext/130304-0001.htm#1303049000522">4.7

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home
Department (James Brokenshire):</Member></B> I wish to make it clear
that the programme motion before the House respects the fact that the
Bill’s original programming indicated that there would be two
days for Report and remaining stages. That is what we have put before
the House today. Indeed, the programme motion seeks to reflect the
issues and concerns expressed in Committee by prioritising matters to
ensure that all issues that need to be debated are discussed fully.
Therefore, for the reasons that have been alluded to, to allow debate
to take place and not to lose time, I urge the House to accept the
programme motion so that we can move on to the debate at hand, which is
about underlining that the Bill will deliver more justice, not
less.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1303049000270" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/debtext/130304-0001.htm#1303049000270"><I>Question

because CMPs are alien to our tradition of open and fair justice, where
justice is not only done, but is seen to be done. Any proceedings held
in secret are a major departure from that. Given the exceptional and
aberrant nature of CMPs, their use should be clearly constrained. That
has been our position and remains so now: consistent and clear,
balanced and proportionate.

grass-roots party voted to ditch part 2 in its entirety, but a Liberal
Democrat Minister, the noble Lord Wallace of Tankerness, steered it
through its Lords stages and resisted any changes or improvements.
Liberal Democrat Back-Bench peers, to their credit, supported the
amendments made to the Bill. More than 80% of the Liberal Democrat
peers in the House of Lords voted with us to amend the Bill to
incorporate the concerns of the Joint Committee on Human Rights and the
independent reviewer of terrorism legislation. In Committee,

that in Committee the Minister unpicked the Lords changes to the Bill,

appropriate checks and balances on the use of CMPs. We do not
underestimate the difficulties in reconciling the issues of justice and
security as contained in the Bill’s title, but this is difficult
and not impossible. By putting appropriate measures in place, we
believe that the use of CMPs could be made proportionate to the scale
of the problem they are intended to address. As has been said, our
position is backed by the Joint Committee on Human Rights, whose most
recent report systematically goes through the changes made in Committee
by the Government and is consistent with the Government’s

Kenneth Clarke:</Member></B> I must have misheard the right hon.
Gentleman. He seems to think his amendment widens the discretion of the
judge. It actually narrows 
<?notus-xml column=692?>it. The Bill as it stands says that the judge may hold a closed session
after the three conditions are satisfied, which are mainly the fair and
effective administration of justice. We have now reached the situation
where critics are so nervous about what the judge may do that they want
to lay down additional tests that the judge must put to himself before
he makes a judgment one way or another. Lord Woolf, the former Lord
Chief Justice, this morning made it clear that the judge now has
complete discretion to decide what to do, and it is the critics who are
so worried that there might be closed material proceedings that they
are trying to put in extra tests to try to put the judge off. As the
right hon. Gentleman’s amendments narrow the judge’s
discretion, he might at least put his case the right way round. As the
Bill stands, the judge has a pretty unfettered
discretion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T16:26:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1303049000341" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/debtext/130304-0002.htm#1303049000341"><B><Member ContinuationText="Sadiq Khan" PimsId="4801" UID="1303049000762" xid="899" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/debtext/130304-0002.htm#1303049000762">Sadiq

cannot be right on all four occasions. Let me tell him what the House
of Lords did, pursuant to the report of the Joint Committee on Human

in making sure that there was no damage to our national security as a
consequence of material being disclosed. In Committee the right hon.

he referred to just does not apply when one is dealing with closed
material procedures because there is a perfectly good

the administration of justice is better served by at least the judge

al-Rawi case: that a judge has at his—I am afraid it mostly is
“his”—disposal are a number of tools to deal with
issues that are sensitive and would create problems for national
security. If an application for public interest immunity is made and
the certificate is signed by a Minister, the judge will go through a
number 
<?notus-xml column=693?>of loops. He will consider on an application ex parte whether, for
example, it is possible to have a fair hearing using anonymity. He will
decide whether it is possible to have a fair hearing with
confidentiality rings. Imperfect as it is, it is one of the ways in
which he will reach a conclusion after balancing the public interest in
holding an open and fair administration of justice and the public
interest and harm to our national security from disclosure. He does
that anyway.</hs_Para>

Wiley balance is a tried and tested legal mechanism by which courts can
balance these competing interests, and there is considerable case law
history to back that up. It was supported by the House of Lords, as I
said, including by Lord Phillips, the former president of the 
<?notus-xml column=694?>Supreme Court. The Government’s changes remove from
the Bill all reference to open justice. The fear is that by not taking
open justice into account, the likelihood of a CMP taking
places will increase to more than the exceptional that the Government
have talked about. As I have said, the Government also tabled amendment
55 in Committee, which replaced “open” with
“effective”. It is our view, shared by the JCHR and the
special advocates, that this is a retrograde step. As I said, the
Supreme Court in Al-Rawi confirmed that both natural justice and open
justice are important but separate fundamental principles, hence our
amendment seeks to reintroduce to the Bill the Wiley test of fair and
open
justice.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1303049000355" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/debtext/130304-0002.htm#1303049000355"><Member ContinuationText="Mr George Howarth" PimsId="1031" UID="1303049000771" xid="290" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/debtext/130304-0002.htm#1303049000771"><B>Mr

many years, and there is a rich history of precedent. The Minister
plucks from the air “fair and effective”, but that was
plucked from the air at the eleventh hour, at the last minute that an
amendment could be tabled in Committee. What we, the Joint Committee,
the special advocates and the House of Lords are saying is that if
there is to be a gateway test before the decision about whether a
hearing should be open or under a CMP, or about which material within a
CMP should be open or closed, the judge should carry out a balancing
exercise. He should weigh the public 
<?notus-xml column=695?>interest in having an open and fair hearing against the harm done by the
revealing of information that would breach national security. That is
the test that judges use now and what the Supreme Court judges in

this Bill would give them.</hs_Para>

critics of this Bill—I do not think that they are Members of

out millions of pounds in order to not extend the principle of closed

services and their lawyers believe would enable them to defend the
action and refute the allegations. At the moment, because we cannot
hear such evidence in closed proceedings and because it cannot be heard
in open court, it is not heard at all. We just offer no defence and pay
out. If we have this procedure, it will make the services more

security. A case cannot be contemplated for closed proceedings until

a CMP a judge will hear all the material, which can amount to thousands
of documents. During that time, when the special advocate is
challenging and going through the case, the court is obliged to keep
the CMP under review. Again, we have given the judge the power to
revoke the CMP at any time. Indeed, the court has a duty to revoke a
CMP following the pre-disclosure exercise if it feels that the CMP is
no longer in the interests of the fair and effective administration of
justice. As Lord Woolf has said, the changes the Government have made
put the judge in complete control of whether a CMP can be granted and
whether it will continue or be revoked—I could add more but I
will not because I have started to give way again. The judge also
decides how much of the case will go into open proceedings, how much of
a gist can be given to the defendants, and how much can go into open
proceedings as long as certain documents are redacted. Of course, the
judge will have been informed by evidence and heard it challenged, and
will then continue to the rest of the proceedings.</hs_Para>

unnecessary because I think a British judge would want to hold open
proceedings. People will have difficulty persuading a British judge
that it is sensible to go to closed proceedings. The idea that we need
a whole lot of amendments that put fresh conditions on the judge, fresh
questions for them to ask, and fresh, expensive and long processes to
go through, is just an attempt to thwart CMPs. The Bill contains every

what I read in the press. That kind of exclusion could be claimed on
the ground of damage to international relations, if the Government of
some third-party state would be upset if certain evidence were to be

that would not be quite good enough for their purposes, so they have
altered it by adding the words “fair” and

national security would be at risk and that that would be relevant to
the issues, and that such a measure would be necessary for the fair
administration of justice, someone might then decide that they
preferred open justice and that the evidence should be given in public
anyway. That is a complete non sequitur, in a way. It would be slightly
absurd to do that. It would be like saying to the judge, “If you
agreed with the Green party and were against the policies in the Bill

need to consider whether you would prefer open justice, after those

Friend’s expertise in this area, I must say that one of the
things that most troubles me, as the Minister enthusiastically in

irritation of being unable to defend claims, but the considerable
damage done to the reputation of our security services because they are
unable to defend themselves. The House always insists 
<?notus-xml column=707?>on being persuaded that the security forces abide
by human rights and do not go in for malpractice or unlawful
rendition and so on, but their inability to defend themselves against
allegations that they have done so is undoubtedly used by our enemies

it—as are our allies and those with whom we

of power that prompted our allies’ concerns following the Binyam

us that special advocates will be appointed whenever the Government
apply for sensitive national security material to be excluded from a

administration of justice against the likely degree of harm to the
interests of national security when deciding which material should be
heard in closed session and which in open session. My
Committee’s report explains why express provision for judicial
balancing of interests needs to take place within a CMP. It is
essential to ensure that the judges have the discretion they require to
ensure that the Bill does not create
unfairness.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1303049000475" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/debtext/130304-0002.htm#1303049000475">Finally,
on the question of gisting, I support the shadow Justice
Secretary’s amendment, which, once again, would give effect to
my Committee’s recommendation that this crucial safeguard be
included in the legislation. On Second Reading, I said that the House
needs to listen to the expert views of the special advocates and act on
their recommendation that the Bill must include what has become known
as a gisting requirement: a requirement that the party excluded from
the courtroom must be given a summary of the closed material that is
sufficient to enable him to give effective instructions to his lawyers
and the special advocate who represents him in his absence. The special
advocates have forcefully repeated that view in their most recent
submission to my Committee. The courts have held that such a
requirement is necessary in order for the legislation to be compatible
with the right to a fair hearing, and the House should make it
absolutely clear that that is what it intends, by writing this
safeguard into the Bill.</hs_Para>

House of Lords rescued matters, adding another provision requiring the
judge to consider whether a PII “could have been made”.
That meant that the court would be required to see whether a fair trial
would be possible using PII, and so it would be up to the judge, not
the Secretary of State, to decide whether PII should apply. We need to
be mindful—this point has not been raised today—that the
Executive, in general, and Secretaries of State, in particular, advised
by officials, have interests of their own to serve. Foolishly, the
Government scrapped that sensible House of Lords provision in Committee

a Secretary of State at least to consider a PII.</hs_Para>

for a CMP the judge must be “satisfied” that the
Secretary of State has “considered” making a CMP
application. How, in a secret area, consideration by the Secretary of
State would really be demonstrated is still unclear. Earlier the
Minister said that we do not know exactly what effect this new process
will have. No doubt officials will be able to provide suitable
documentation to the Secretary of State in order for him to make that
judgment, but I am not yet convinced that he will not be able to
consider that in the bath as well. In other words, the discretion and

already held three incompatible positions: first, that the Secretary of

and I say that as the Minister with responsibility for
counter-terrorism who took the controversial legislation on control
orders through the House. We debated them until 5 am in one of our very
rare all-night sittings, which was for me evidence of how strongly

are in this position for two reasons. First, legitimate concerns have
been expressed by our intelligence liaison partners, particularly in
the United States of America, about the breach of the control principle
for intelligence, which has put sources, techniques and capabilities at
risk. That is the issue of national security, which is very much about
the assets that are at risk. I am delighted that the Norwich Pharmacal
provisions have gone through with agreement on both sides, which has
been extremely positive, but concerns nevertheless remain about the
possibility of information being disclosed in open court proceedings
that could damage our intelligence relationships. That is the first
reason why we are debating this
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030437000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/debtext/130304-0002.htm#13030437000021">The
second reason is that we have seen an increasing number of claims of
unlawful detention and allegations of mistreatment or torture by the
security services against people who have been held in a range of
different circumstances. Those allegations amount to more than 20
outstanding cases and the number is likely to increase if there is a
jurisdiction within which such claims can be ventilated freely. The
position has been that many of those claims have had to be settled
because the evidence necessary to prove the case either way impinges on
national security. That is why we have seen payments made to some
claimants without having the opportunity to decide whether their claims
were well founded as the evidence has not been put into a judicial
setting.</hs_Para>

have been conducting operations in a way that falls outside our

heart of the reputation of our intelligence services. People will
always say, “Well, you are settling that case because something
in it was well founded. That is why you are prepared to pay £2
million, £3 million or £4 million to avoid litigation in
our courts.” I want that information; I want to know what
happened. Equally, if these claims are unfounded and unfair allegations
are being brought against our security services, I want them to be able

circumstances in which the gisting goes right to the heart of national

threats; past agencies, the David Shaylers, the Richard Tomlinsons,
leaking their information, even Ministers—I remember that Ted
Rowlands once in the House gave away some Crown jewels—and most
ironically of all, Washington. Given the genesis of the Bill, some of
the biggest leaks relate to our biggest ally, whether it is Pentagon
papers four years ago or, only 
<?notus-xml column=717?>two months ago, what sounds from the British
papers to be the putting at risk of the life of an Anglo-Saudi
agent whom it used in one of its operations and then talked about
afterwards. Nobody, certainly not I, would challenge the right of the

Davis:</Member></B> Yes, 1997; for only a decade or two. A generation
of special advocates have taken a strong stance on this, and they have
taken a different stance from everybody else because they have
experienced both sorts of procedure. Nearly all of them have personally
understood the closed material procedure and the PII procedure,
and most of them know both procedures inside out. One of the things
they argue—a point made by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T17:55:13"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Chichester (Mr Tyrie) in his brilliant
speech, every word of which I agreed with—is that PII has been
misrepresented. Any special advocate will say that PII is a much more
complex, judge-created, judge-evolved process than is being
represented. Of course there can be simple blocking; of course, in
addition, there can be redaction; of course there can be circles of
confidentiality; of course there can be in-camera hearings. The
Minister without
Portfolio<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T17:55:44"></hs_TimeCode> rather
dismissively said that this is the system that gave us arms to Iraq.
Even in that process, which involved at least one ex-Minister and one
Minister in the House today, early on in the development of PII, we saw
one category of certificate refused, one category accepted and one
category heavily redacted. That gave the court enough information to
make Alan Clark face the interrogation in which he came out with those
famous words “economical with the actualité”,
which collapsed the case because the prosecution recommended an
acquittal on the basis of the
evidence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T17:56:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030437000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/debtext/130304-0002.htm#13030437000048"><B><Member ContinuationText="Yasmin Qureshi" PimsId="5523" UID="13030437000255" xid="1016" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/debtext/130304-0002.htm#13030437000255">Yasmin

PII, because people do not like excluding all the evidence, there is a
perfectly legitimate argument about how much we can gist and how much
can be redacted, and then it can be put into the open court. But
everything that does not get there is entirely left out; it is not
available to claimant, judge, lawyers or anybody else. In a CMP,
exactly the same thing can be done, because the judge will be required
to consider how much we can gist, how much we can redact, and what can
be shared with the defendant. The only difference is that in a CMP, the
evidence, including, as my right hon. Friend said, some things that
might be absolutely key to the case that cannot unfortunately be
disclosed, can be considered by the judge. PII shuts out all that which
is not possible to gist. With a CMP, there can be all the gisting and
redaction that one wants, but all the evidence is

of that need not continue to be held under closed procedures but can be
held in open court, the judge, if so persuaded, is perfectly free to do
so. The special advocates themselves, unlike their clients, can put

outline of the weakness of closed material procedures came from Lord
Justice Kerr, who effectively said—I am now desperately
paraphrasing—that unchallenged evidence can be
“misleading”, which was the word he used. That came up
any number of times during the Lords debate from a number of lawyers.
Helena Kennedy, for example, cited a case in which a tape recording of
a conversation that appeared to incriminate a defendant was played in
court. When the defendant heard it, he said, “I’m sorry,
but I left after about five minutes.” People listened carefully
and could hear the door opening and closing as he went. So a piece of
evidence that appeared to be incredibly incriminating became not
incriminating at all. David Anderson put a similar point to the Lords
Committee when he was giving
evidence.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030437000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/debtext/130304-0002.htm#13030437000056">The

note what the special advocates have said, because we are all reluctant
to see such a system operate, although it has to because it is better
than any alternative. In the intervening period, that system has worked
for the Special Immigration Appeals Commission, and worked reasonably
well. The senior judges who preside at these proceedings, in SIAC, have
shown themselves to be robustly independent. Of 37 substantive cases

Member for Haltemprice and Howden (Mr Davis). During the nine years for
which I was responsible for the various agencies, I quite frequently
had to make applications to a court for a PII. Even in respect of
marginal evidence, PIIs are hugely time-consuming. It is not like
dealing with a letter to a Member of Parliament on an issue that one
knows backwards where one can virtually top and tail it in one’s
sleep. One has to read every single piece of evidence that one is
certifying ought to be—in one’s own view, although it is
a matter for the court—excluded on grounds of national security,
or whatever the grounds may be. I accept the burden of what

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T18:13:44"></hs_TimeCode>right
hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden and the hon. Member

court’s judgment in al-Rawi—that when the court receives
an application for PII it is able not only to accept or reject it but
to take a middle way—a third way, as it were—of gisting,
confidentiality rings, and so on.</hs_Para>

the profound difference in this regard is that ultimately, if the
respondent party, which in civil cases is inevitably the
Government—it is completely different in criminal cases, but
this is not about criminal cases—do not like the decision that
the court has come to, they have to decide not to contest the case at
all. That is why there is a lacuna in the current arrangements, and
that is the mother and father of this Bill. That does not apply in
respect of CMPs, where the Government will not be able to use PIIs to
exclude evidence as they can now, because the judge will say,
“Hang on a second. Why are you applying to exclude evidence
which is absolutely central to the case? You need to put it in, and I
will decide, thank you very much, whether it should be kept completely
secret or there ought to be some kind of gisting or summary of that
evidence.” The right that accords to the state in respect of PII
does not accord to it in respect of
CMPs.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13030437000230" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/debtext/130304-0002.htm#13030437000230">6.15

have taken on a life of their own, with some people having suddenly

all the PIIs that I dealt with, as others in this House have had to,
with a great burden on me and while looking at the evidence. Like
anybody else, I did not just do what I was asked to do. Rule No. 1 to
anybody in a ministerial position who wishes to survive is every day
never to do that which they are asked to do but to make their own
decisions. That is what I did, and I am still here. At the heart of
PIIs is the application by the relevant Secretary 
<?notus-xml column=723?>of State to exclude evidence. The paradox is that the more sensitive and
secret the evidence, and the more crucial it is to a case, the more
likely a judge is to exclude it altogether rather than allow it to be

which intelligence depends. These individuals are developed by our
intelligence and security agencies and they place themselves at
considerable risk. In essence, they provide information to the United

agency—that they are not supposed to provide. Sometimes they
betray their own Government or country. They are, by definition, giving
away confidences and they do so for a variety of motives:
some<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T18:22:46"></hs_TimeCode> say that
they are doing it for the highest of motives, which are that they
fundamentally disagree with the system in which they are operating;

criminal act and want some form of escape; and some are somewhere in

money.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030437000093" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/debtext/130304-0002.htm#13030437000093">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T18:23:02"></hs_TimeCode>
every case, that information would simply dry up if the identity of
that individual, or information leading to their identification, was
compromised. That is the fundamental dilemma, and there is no way out
of it unless we want to abandon our intelligence and security agencies.
Let us remind ourselves—this is not scare- mongering; it
happens to be true—that, had we abandoned those agencies, scores
of serious atrocities would have killed our constituents and many
others. If we had explained how we had ended up in such a situation by
saying that information had to be provided in its entirety in open

would be a realistic and sensible option and, if not, for the court to
move on and look at other things. The Minister has said that that would
be reasonable, so I do not think that there is much between him and
those of us who take the position of the Joint Committee. I hope that
we can reach agreement on that, even if it does not happen tonight,

We do not want a statutory provision that requires people to go through
immense procedures to eliminate every other way of dealing with a case.
Unfortunately, there are later Opposition amendments that would have
that effect. It is very late in the day. In conversational terms, we
are all agreed that closed proceedings are a last resort. We want
closed 
<?notus-xml column=727?>proceedings only when national safety is in danger and where there is no
other sensible way of trying the case. I will go away and consider the
matter, but we are rather late in the proceedings. Of course, the rules
of the court still have to be made and it may be possible to address
the matter there. In practice, there is not much between us, because
judges and lawyers will not want to go into closed proceedings other
than as a last resort. What we do not want is to introduce a process
that involves months of time and vast sums of money, the intention of
which is really to stop anybody taking on a closed procedure at

Gentleman’s alternative would be in a criminal case for which
the evidence needed to convict somebody could not be gathered. If one
cannot gain that evidence, one cannot proceed. It is important that
that applies when people are being deprived of their liberty. I made
the same argument when we were getting rid of control orders. One must
try to provide the evidence that is needed to convict people. Failing
that, I do not like the idea that people are simply held for many
years, with very little freedom. I believe that control orders had
23-hour curfews. That is an extreme infringement of liberty. I know
that we are not discussing criminal issues principally, but there are
many cases in the criminal system in which the police are sure that
somebody is guilty, but they cannot find evidence that may be used in
court. None of us would want to see such cases proceed and the same
should apply to any other serious deprivation of
liberty<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T18:38:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030437000124" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/debtext/130304-0002.htm#13030437000124">I

new clause being read a Second time, but the decision was reversed
immediately afterwards by the Chairman’s casting vote. I hope
that we will change the provisions either so that we do not have these
proceedings, which would be my ideal, or we at least move them closer
to the proposals of the JCHR. I accept that we should not keep every
word of what the Joint Committee suggested and that tweaks could be
made. I hope that the Minister will consider that at the point at which

prevent that from ever happening again, not how to remove the
safeguards that allow us to hold the state and its agencies to account.

taken a similar line and passed a motion that condemns secret courts as
posing a significant threat to public security and accountability. Such
widespread opposition stems not just from principles, because there is
a complete lack of evidence to back up the proposals in part 2 of the
Bill. The Bill is about security yet the Government do not claim that
closed material procedures would do anything to promote national
security. Indeed, they accept that the existing process of public
interest immunity already provides effective safeguards for that
process.</hs_Para>

new clause to limit the circumstances in which closed material

resort and the best option by far remains to scrap part 2 of the Bill.
The amendments that have been tabled by the House of Lords only
slightly modify the process by which a secret court is imposed on a
case. Even if closed material procedures are considered a last resort
after public interest immunity is exhausted, simply having such a

use.</hs_Para>

Members will be aware that the Government are seeking to undo many of
the changes made by the House of Lords, claiming to have listened to
widespread and grave concerns about the Bill. They effectively want to
reinsert the original test for triggering closed material procedures,
thereby scrapping the requirement that such procedures are a last
resort once a judge has decided that a fair determination of
proceedings is not possible any other way.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T18:52:08"></hs_TimeCode>That removes the
only real bar on secret courts becoming routine in civil cases, and
negates the move to introduce judicial discretion. In common with the
Government’s recent amendments that require the Secretary of
State to report annually to Parliament on closed material procedures
and keep their use under independent review, such measures are frankly
just tweaks that leave intact the core of the Bill. Secret courts will
still be available across the civil justice system, and will 
<?notus-xml column=734?>still be fundamentally unfair. The only way to safeguard
Britain’s system of fair justice is by removing from the Bill

conclusion let me say a few words about new clause 2. Although I judge
that the House is not with me on amendments 1 to 7, new clause
2—which will be taken as part of the same group—looks at
how we can try to restrict the number of cases where CMPs are used.
Proposed subsection (1) concerns circumstances in which the liberty of
the individual is at stake. Ministers have confirmed recently to the
Bill Committee that CMPs could be used in habeas corpus cases where an
individual seeks to challenge their detention by the state.
Although such cases may not be common, the current Bill would leave us
in a position whereby an individual losing their habeas corpus claim
could, as a result of a CMP, remain imprisoned without knowing the
reasons why. Subsection (1) of new clause 2 seeks to rule out such a
possibility by ensuring that a CMP will not be available</hs_Para>

(2)(a) of new clause 2 aims to ensure that a CMP cannot be used by the
Government to cover up some of the most serious international
crimes—for example where genocide or torture are at issue. That
is fairly straightforward, as there is clear public interest in those
proceedings taking place in as open and even-handed way as possible,
and the use of a CMP would be entirely at odds with that aim.</hs_Para>

subsection (2)(b) aims to ensure that material will not be withheld in

Opposition’s amendment. It concerns the so-called Wiley
balancing act, in which a judgment must be made on whether national
security is more important than the administration of justice. Of
course that is relevant for PII, because that is the absolute choice
that has to be made in those circumstances, but the whole point of
closed material procedures—unlike PII—is that the
evidence will be available to the judge. The administration of justice
cannot but be helped if the judge has access to all the relevant
information. So the Wiley balancing act is simply not relevant in such 
<?notus-xml column=738?>cases.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T19:06:09"></hs_TimeCode> judge must
be satisfied that there is a risk to national security, and he will
have the last word on that. At that point, a closed material procedure
will be granted, and that is the least bad option. We do not argue that
CMPs are a good option, that they are desirable or that they are ideal.
They are far from that, but they are better than the alternatives and,
sometimes in this imperfect world, this is the only responsible way to
behave.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-04?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_04_PT_1/CFA30489B7E1237478D0198B77E7E800B62E0A1A" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="4 March 2013">Monday

and learned Member for Kensington (Sir Malcolm Rifkind). I am sure that
it was music to the Minister’s ears to hear a speech from his

are two fundamental arguments in favour of the direction that the
Government are taking. The first is the need to deal with the present
inability of the security and intelligence agencies to defend
themselves against civil claims. That point has been debated over the
past few hours.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T19:07:09"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mr Straw) did the House a great
service by reminding us that we are talking not about bits of paper,
but about human sources of intelligence. We are talking about human
beings, and the agencies have a fundamental responsibility to protect
the lives of those people. Even in the course of protecting their own
interests, they can do nothing to undermine the safety and security of
those people. Those are vital obligations to human beings, not to
scraps of paper with information written on them.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T19:07:38"></hs_TimeCode>The idea that
any serious judge would grant closed material proceedings in relation
to intelligence that might prove embarrassing or slightly awkward for
an agency is preposterous. This is all about highly sensitive
intelligence, about sources and about methods.</hs_Para>

second element that makes the legislation imperative is the need to
make the agencies themselves more accountable. I do not want to see a
PII one-way street that allows an agency to hide material completely or
to settle out of court. If intelligence exists that there has been
wrongdoing in the agencies, I want that evidence to be considered by
the judge and to be weighed in the balance when conclusions are
reached.</hs_Para>

on the debates on these matters, I believe that it should be possible
to close the gap between the Front Benches on the ability of the judge
to choose the appropriate route to take. I think I heard the Minister
say earlier that, even at this late stage, he was prepared to go away
and give further consideration to that issue. If there are further
opportunities to do so, I hope that he and
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T19:08:47"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Tooting (Sadiq Khan) will reach consensus on this
point. The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T19:08:58"></hs_TimeCode>
Minister has come some way towards that by tabling amendment 47, and
that is helpful. The court must now be satisfied that the Secretary of
State has considered whether to make an application for PII, and that
goes some way in the right direction. I encourage him and my right hon.
Friend to try to close what remains of the gap between them.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T19:09:13"></hs_TimeCode>As far as I am

the Wiley test and the substantive difference that clearly still exists
between the two Front Benches, I urge further and fresh consideration,
if that is possible. I am not a lawyer, as may be evident to anyone who
has ever heard me speak on these matters, but if the decision is
whether the material should be in or out, then a test of open justice
is a fair test, and that is the test that applies in PII. However, if
the decision is about closed material proceedings, then, frankly, that
is a decision about whether the material is fully in or not fully in.
If a judge can see it but others cannot, and if the merits of a
particular piece of intelligence can be weighed by the judge, clearly
that is a more difficult and complex judgment. It therefore does not
surprise me, as a non-lawyer, to know that a different test from the
Wiley test may need to be applied.</hs_Para>

they start with the claim that he is being investigated for wrongdoing
in Iraq. As he has never been investigated in any shape or form, that
is a lie before we even get into the specific allegations. But let us
suppose just for a moment that somebody was to turn those allegations
into a court case. The circumstances of the operation concerned in the
allegations involve some extremely secret material—where the
tip-offs came from, modus operandi and so on. Now, it is quite 
<?notus-xml column=742?>possible that this man, who has been decorated for gallantry and
leadership twice and badly wounded—indeed, he had another

right. I used the phrase “modus operandi”. This brave
officer led our special forces operation for so long in Iraq and did so
well at a time when, frankly, other parts of our military operation
were failing—the verdict of history is that sadly they did
largely fail. The hon. Gentleman is right that this is not only about
sources, but about modus operandi, but there is now a further wrinkle.
Because the Government have committed to much more of what is generally
called “upstream intervention”—putting small
numbers of people into areas where they are not in charge or running
the show, but simply mentoring, the dodgiest end of which will
inevitably go to special forces—this is not only about our modus
operandi, but about whether our relationships with host countries,
which in almost every case will, I believe, do better in a

the conditions that apply in the determination of whether closed

public, the plaintiff can cross-examine the defendant on that evidence,

evidence against him. It is not good enough that some judge, however

will refer briefly to new clauses 7 and 8, which stand in my name. They
are based on the evidence that Dr Lawrence McNamara provided to
the Committee when it considered this legislation. We discovered in
this whole process that the media have played a fundamental role in
exposing what has been happening in relation to the security services.
We should recognise that role in statute. New clause 7 is therefore
based on an amendment proposed in the Lords and recommended by Lawrence
McNamara. It basically states that the media, as the eyes and ears of
the general public, should be informed of these cases so that they can
intervene if necessary and become involved in proceedings. They would
be notified, but they would then also be able to seek a stay or sist of
the civil proceedings and be party to at least some element of the
debate on whether a closed procedure is necessary.

Ministers responded to that proposal elsewhere, they argued that it
would not be suitable in civil damages cases. That was the only
argument put up for not involving the media as a party in proceedings.
In fact, these are not just normal civil proceedings; they are based on
national interests and national security. That is why there needs to be
some process to allow full engagement of the media and enable them to
become involved and intervene in the proceedings.</hs_Para>

clause 8 also relates to Lawrence McNamara’s recommendations and
a proposal considered in the Lords. Currently the Bill does not provide
for the possibility of closed judgments being made open later. The
reason they should be made open at a later stage, some would argue, is
so that the courts and the process can be held to account publicly. The
proceedings could be reported and then a view could be taken on whether
it was correct that they went into secret court procedures. The
argument is a recognition that there should be some procedure for
opening closed judgments long after the secrecy is no longer necessary.
The Government acknowledged on Report in the Lords that review of
closed judgments is important, but they never came forward with the
amendments necessary to enable that. That is why I tabled new clause
8.</hs_Para>

comments of those Members who have, with great passion and sincerity,
opposed the whole policy of the Bill; who think that closed procedures 
<?notus-xml column=748?>should not be permitted and are simply incompatible with our standards
of justice; and who plainly wish things to stay as they are. They
include the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T19:46:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Members for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas) and for Hayes and
Harlington (John McDonnell), and even
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T19:46:06"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Cambridge (Dr Huppert) got very near to that at one point, rather
to my
alarm.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030440000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/debtext/130304-0003.htm#13030440000079">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T19:41:00"></hs_TimeCode>
share the exasperation expressed by many Members who are more
supportive of the Bill that much of the opposition to it is based on
the idea that the present law does not call for amendment and that what
happens now is satisfactory. Three or four Members expressed the
exasperation I sometimes feel in these debates, because a growing
number of people who seem to be more liberal than me, at least on this
point, think that PII certificates are the ideal way of handling these
cases. Most of the people who have tried to argue that point with me
outside the Chamber, I am quite sure, would not have defended the PII
certificate system 12 months ago and instead would have attacked
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030440000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/debtext/130304-0003.htm#13030440000080">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T19:41:00"></hs_TimeCode>
we—the Bill’s defenders—have repeatedly pointed
out, the whole point of PII is to exclude from anybody’s use in
a case the evidence that is sensitive. Of course, one can gist and
redact such as one can, but what one leaves out is anything that
obviously threatens national security, which is the very information
that everyone says ought to be heard. I do not accept all those
allegations. I would like the civil courts to be able to decide some
more of those allegations.
To<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T19:41:00"></hs_TimeCode> those who,
like the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T19:47:46"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Member for Brighton, Pavilion, are convinced that our security services
have been torturing and mistreating people and that we are trying to
suppress all kinds of outrageous allegations, I can only say that if we
stay with the law as it is, none of that will ever appear in a court
before a judge.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13030440000081" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/debtext/130304-0003.htm#13030440000081">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T19:41:00"></hs_TimeCode>
problem at the moment is that where a Government wish to bring forward
their records and witnesses to try to answer these claims, there is no
closed material procedure in civil proceedings to enable them to do so.
We used to think that the court did that out of its own volition, but I
am afraid that there have been rulings making it quite clear that that
is for Parliament to decide. I will not repeat what people said a few
moments ago. The absolutism of the people on the ultra-liberal wing is
quite extraordinary. They are demanding silence. They are demanding no
judgment from a judge. They wish things to stay as they are. I ask them
to reflect on the deeply unsatisfactory nature of that. It is not true
that there are other countries where one can do
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030440000082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/debtext/130304-0003.htm#13030440000082">I
do not think—I am open to correction—that there is any
jurisdiction in the world in which someone is trying to create a
procedure whereby one can bring in highly sensitive evidence of this
kind in a civil claim against the Government. Somebody calmly said that
the Americans allow that. I can assure them that the Americans are
extremely alarmed about the fact that we are giving those powers to our
judges and wish to be reassured that national security will be
protected. As has been said, they are already reducing their
co-operation with us, and they will reduce it further if they think
that we are opening some kind of sieve in their information. Where they
issue a certificate of state security it is not challengeable. People
are bringing actions in our courts claiming that we are sometimes
complicit with what they say American agencies have done because they
cannot bring those actions in America. They come here 
<?notus-xml column=749?>under Norwich Pharmacal trying to get documents from us to support
action in other countries because they think we have the only courts in
the world where they might be able to get hold of American intelligence
material—and to do so for other people. So in supporting our
approach in principle, the Government, the Labour party and the Liberal
Democrats are demonstrating how committed we all are to the rule of
law, human rights and the wish to be accountable to our courts. We
think that we can contrive a process that does secure national security
and does respect the interests of our allies while allowing a judge to
consider all the relevant evidence and give a judgment.</hs_Para>

next point will be the final one I make on this, because I realise that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T19:50:40"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Tooting (Sadiq Khan) has to wind up the debate. I still hope
that we get the widest possible all-party support on this important
constitutional matter, and I think that the Liberals are with us.
Nobody in this House has given views that are contrary to the interests
of justice or anything of that kind, but we are almost quibbling about
rather important amendments; we are talking about how we can best frame
our response to the Joint Committee on Human Rights and so on without
actually compromising the process and making it unworkable.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13030440000084" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/debtext/130304-0003.htm#13030440000084">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T19:51:45"></hs_TimeCode>
had the formidable support of the Ministers in the former Government
who were responsible for these matters at various times and in various
ways: the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T19:51:33"></hs_TimeCode> right
hon. Members for Blackburn (Mr Straw),
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T19:51:39"></hs_TimeCode>for Salford and
Eccles (Hazel Blears),
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T19:51:34"></hs_TimeCode>for Wythenshawe
and Sale East (Paul Goggins)
and<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T19:51:44"></hs_TimeCode> for Knowsley
(Mr Howarth). I think that the latter was right in saying that
I am probably the most liberal of the five of us on most issues that
come before this House. I spent my time opposing the right hon. Members
when I was in opposition and they still have not persuaded me that 90
days’ detention without charge was remotely
justifiable—we sat up all night arguing about that. The fact is
that we are moving to resolve a serious problem, and the Labour party
should give careful consideration to whether they press these
measures.</hs_Para>

am asked by Labour Members and by others whether there is any further
that we can go. I have already described the number of amendments that
we have made, and the huge discretion and control that we have now
given to the judge. I have indicated that we will have a look at the
rules of court. I cannot be persuaded that putting “as a last
resort” in the Bill is not risky. The Wiley balancing test as it
is on the amendment paper is not the Wiley balancing test but a
stronger version of that test, and it has been argued about
interminably. It is totally unsuitable for a closed proceeding; it is
designed as a stiff test when one is proposing to take all the evidence
out of consideration altogether.</hs_Para>

urge restraint on the Opposition, who claim to wish to be in government
one day—needless to say, I regard that proposition with dread.
If they take some of these objections to bizarre lengths when there is
complete agreement on principle between us, I can say only that were
they to succeed, they would regret it. I also think that, for the
reputation of our security services, for the reputation of our justice
system and for the confidence of our allies, it would be very helpful
if we had the support of the bulk of the three major parties. I have 
<?notus-xml column=750?>tried to explain why people of utmost sincerity who take the more purist
view are actually living in a dream world. We will do better in holding
our agents to account by having this

just remind the Minister that when the Green Paper was published, many
on both sides of the House thought that it was perfectly adequate. When
the draft Bill was first published, some on both sides of the House
thought that it was adequate. We did not think that, and we pushed for
improvements. When the Bill was published, before it went to the House
of Lords last June, many on both sides of the House, including the
Minister, thought that that was perfect and in need of no amendment.
The Bill has been changed on three or four occasions in a number of
areas, not least by the changes made in the House of Lords.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T19:52:24"></hs_TimeCode> other place
sought to put into the Bill some of the recommendations made by
the Joint Committee on Human Rights. Not all of its recommendations
were put into amendments standing in the names of Cross Benchers,
including Lord Pannick, but some were—the ones thought to be
important in order to secure the checks and balances
required in this
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T19:55:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030440000090" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/debtext/130304-0003.htm#13030440000090">I
remind the Minister that Labour Front Benchers have on no occasion
sought to remove part 2 from the Bill. He will know, as he has been in
this game far, far longer than I have, that we could well have won
votes in the House of Lords to remove part 2, but we appreciate the
important challenge the Government face. As the Chair of the
Intelligence and Security Committee and colleagues on both sides of the
House have put it, “How do we get the balance with our wish to
make sure that our citizens are as safe as possible, bearing in mind
the huge heroic work that our security services do, relying on
intelligence from other countries?” The Opposition accept the
control principle and always have done, and we will debate that after
the votes at 8 pm. Nobody who has spoken today in favour of our
amendments has tried to caricature the people against them as not being
concerned about civil liberties and human rights. To be fair, those
against our amendments have not tried to caricature our position as
being against, or not understanding the importance of, national
security.</hs_Para>

that he will be supporting our amendments at 8 pm. I pray in aid the
fact that it is not just Opposition Members wishing to press these
amendments, as I will shortly. The Joint Committee on Human Rights, in
its most recent report last week, confirmed that it was unhappy with
the shredding of the Lords amendments in Committee. The special
advocates also agree with our amendments, as 
<?notus-xml column=751?>does the House of Lords. The independent reviewer of terrorism

of the challenges we face, but I have not said that. I deliberately

exception—a point made by a number of colleagues on the

is where he must be careful. A number of Members on both sides of the

CMPs are far preferable, and they have asked why a judge would not opt
for a CMP. We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T19:58:39"></hs_TimeCode>

the often lengthy nature of litigation, we believe that the frequency
set out in the amendments allows for regular but meaningful reporting

consequence is that there is likely to be little to report on a basis
more regular than once a year. Annual reports will not, however, be the
only way in which facts relating to cases involving CMPs will be made
public during the reporting period. The Government have made an
amendment in the Lords to ensure that when an application is made under
clause 6(1), that must be reported to the other parties in the
proceedings. There are already mechanisms through which the courts
publish their open
judgments.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030440001184" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/debtext/130304-0003.htm#13030440001184">The
reports will focus on court procedures, as CMPs are a procedural option
for the courts and not related to the use of Executive powers. The new

reports such as the number of CMP applications and who they are made
by; how many CMPs are granted and how many revoked; and how many
judgments, both open and closed, are published with respect to the
determination of section 6 proceedings. That would include judgments
made on the substantive trial and regarding the outcome of the
application for a CMP declaration. The new clauses would also cover
proceedings 
<?notus-xml column=762?>deemed to be section 6 proceedings, such as the application process for
a declaration and the review of Norwich Pharmacal

addition to an annual reporting requirement, the Government
seek to introduce a provision for a comprehensive review after
five years. In line with other legislation, such as the Terrorism
Prevention and Investigation Measures Act 2011, it requires the
appointment of a reviewer and does not specify the remit of the review
except to indicate that it covers the operation of closed
material proceedings. That type of review of CMPs would be different
from other reviews, in that it would not concern the operation of the
Secretary of State’s powers but rather the operation of court
processes. That means that the reviewer will have to take care not to

come to it when I address the amendments tabled by the Opposition. At
this early stage, I should say that in essence it is a question of the
assurance provided to external partners as well as the operation of the
courts themselves. I hear the point that the right hon. Gentleman
makes, but I hope he accepts that the proposal for an annual review or,
in effect, an annual sunset clause in the first instance and then an
annual renewal thereafter, does not leave a great deal of time for
litigation, which is likely to span several years because of its nature
and complexity. I am sure that we will hear more from the Opposition
about why they have sought to advance this time period over anything
else. There is a principle at stake as regards the assurance that we
are seeking to provide through this mechanism. We have gone for the
option of five-yearly reporting, with a proper examination of the
operation of the Bill, to enable Parliament to be properly informed. It
will then be for Parliament to consider what further steps may or may
not be appropriate at that point.</hs_Para>

20 cases would fall within the scope of these proceedings, and the
regulatory impact assessment

annual reporting of the forthcoming CMP applications and judgments so
that Parliament is regularly updated. We will get a better sense of the

Brokenshire:</Member></B> A five-yearly review with, in essence, each
Parliament having the opportunity to examine the operation of CMPs is
appropriate. As my hon. Friend will know from our previous debates on,
for example, the Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures Act,
my view has been that that time period or cycle gives sufficient time
to enable a proper consideration of the operation of the process. The
right period is five years—in essence, once a Parliament so that
each Parliament can consider what may or may not be appropriate at that
point.</hs_Para>

clause 4 provides that the new CMP provisions would expire only a year
after Royal Assent unless a statutory instrument extending the
provisions for a further year was laid before Parliament and approved
by resolution of each House. The Government believe that the new clause
would largely negate the benefit of the provisions in part 2 and that
it is disproportionate. The negative impact of what would amount in the
first year to a sunset clause could be very serious. As I have said, we
know that litigation can be lengthy, lasting a number of months and
usually more than a year, while document-heavy cases can last for
several years. Creating the possibility that CMPs would cease to be
available halfway through the progression of a case where the judge had
already decided that a CMP was in the interests of the fair and
effective administration of justice in the proceedings would, in our
view, undermine the judge’s

think that the House is in basic agreement that CMPs should be
available as a tool to the judge and that the judge should have
discretion on whether to use one or not. In exercising that discretion,
the judge will consider whether or not he agrees with the Secretary of
State’s assessment of damage to national security and 
<?notus-xml column=764?>how the case should be fairly run. Even once a judge has decided that a
CMP should form part of the procedures in the case, each piece of
material will be assessed to decide whether it should go into the CMP,
be withheld entirely or be redacted, summarised or disclosed. The judge
can also decide at any point to revoke a CMP and, indeed, must consider
doing so after the disclosure exercise if he feels it is no longer in
the interests of the fair and effective administration of justice in
the case<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T20:46:01"></hs_TimeCode>.

understand the origin of the new clause. In essence, it is about the
provision for annual renewal of control orders under the Prevention of
Terrorism Act 2005, which the Terrorism Prevention and Investigation
Measures Act repealed and replaced. The 2005 Act was passed under a
greatly accelerated parliamentary timetable, with only limited
opportunity for debate. By contrast, the Green Paper provided a full
consultation and it is fair to say that the Bill has been through
parliamentary scrutiny in the other place and this House. It is also
worth underlining that the Bill’s provisions relate to the
procedures of the court, rather than the exercise of controls by the
Executive. I note that in the preceding debate

had an extensive debate on this issue in Committee. In fact, we spent
the whole of the last afternoon’s sitting on 7 February
deliberating review, reporting and what is colloquially called sunset,
but which, now that the Minister has corrected us, should be called
renewal, which sounds much better. Two days before that, we debated the
equivalent of new clause 9, which has been tabled by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T20:53:55"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

things happened in the debate on review, one of which the Minister has
alluded to, that did not happen at any other time during the Committee
proceedings. 
<?notus-xml column=766?>The first is that the Minister agreed to go away and look at something
that we raised and come back with further proposals. The second is that
we won a vote.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T20:54:20"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

may have voted—the vote was 9:9. The Chair, as is the
convention, voted for the clause to be read a second time, but sadly,
two or three seconds later, voted that it not be added to the Bill.

have been some technical changes to the new clause that we presented in

new clause 9, I put it to the Government in Committee that if they
wanted to rely on CMPs, they should document them properly so that they
had an evidence base for when they wanted to use them in the future.

Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington has referred to the
contribution that Dr McNamara has made to our deliberations at all

and proceedings related to terrorism matters, and his briefings have
been extremely helpful, particularly on these provisions. He says about
new clause

does not appear to be any systematically compiled evidence of the scale
of the use of secret evidence in the areas where it is currently used.
There does not appear to be any publicly accessible formal or informal
recording of the total overall use of CMP, or the total use within the
different contexts identified by the Government. Nor is there any
indication that such evidence exists out of the public eye…Where
records have been requested the Executive has been largely unable or
unwilling to provide records. Parliamentary questions in the Commons
and the Lords have revealed a paucity of information is available to
the current use of CMPs…As it stands, the Bill sets a very, very
low threshold of openness for judgments under Clauses 6 and 7.
Moreover, there is presently no central recording of how often CMPs are
used in any courts, nor any centrally recorded information about
them.”</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13030440001215" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/debtext/130304-0003.htm#13030440001215">He
says that unless there is systematic recording, there is no practical
mechanism by which the use of CMPs can be monitored. That is quite an
indictment of the current position, and I can only repeat what I said
in Committee and hope that it is more persuasive on the Floor of the
House. The Minister should consider the matter for his own good, and
the Government should take that point on board even if they are not
prepared to support new clause 9

new clause 5, the Minister said that he would consider the issue of
reporting and come back to the House, and he has done so. The new
clauses on reporting that we pushed for in Committee, and those that
the Liberal Democrats pushed for on a slightly different basis, were
designed to emulate the situation in comparable legislation. That was
why we specified a three-monthly review period. The Minister has come
back to us with an annual review period, which seems somewhat
parsimonious, if I may say so.</hs_Para>

Minister should take the point that this is controversial
legislation—I would make that point even more clearly in
relation to new clause 4—and touches 
<?notus-xml column=767?>on new ground. It contains many definitions that we are coming across
for the first time, so it seems entirely appropriate that there should
be more regular reviews. Perhaps we should be grateful for what we get,
however, and at least the provision is for recurring 12-monthly
reporting. So be it, and we do not intend to oppose new clause 5. We
did not press our new clauses to Divisions in Committee but instead
waited to see what the Minister would come up with. We are somewhat
disappointed, but it is something, and the Government have at least
listened.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030440001218" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/debtext/130304-0003.htm#13030440001218">New
clause 6 does not do the job of new clause 4. It seems designed to act
as a review for this part of the Bill, but it is wholly inadequate.

that. Given the extremely serious implications of this Bill, at a
minimum there should be an annual sunset clause. The JCHR called for
the Act to lapse every year unless parliament decides to renew it. That

for Chichester (Mr Tyrie), it attacks and deals with fundamental issues
of fair and open justice. It is also, I am afraid to say,
confused—perhaps deliberately so—and has had a very

part of the Bill. Views have been expressed either way on it, and I
respect the views of lawyers from the senior judiciary and the Supreme
Court, as well as of human rights lawyers and special advocates. We are
not short of legal opinion on this matter, and it is not of one mind.
Overwhelmingly, however, it takes the view that this is territory into

Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for
Old Bexley and Sidcup (James Brokenshire) does not agree with my view
that this is a confused piece of legislation. I am not going to repeat
the vaudeville act that I so enjoyed doing in Committee, in which I
pointed out the four different positions that the Liberal Democrats had
held on the Bill, some of them simultaneously, or the four occasions on
which the Minister without Portfolio had announced that he had seen the
light and decided that he was previously wrong to be so terribly
authoritarian and that he now had a package of measures that would
ensure full judicial discretion and that CMPs were de facto, if not
expressly in the Bill, to be used as a last resort. I think we have all
seen through those posturings, which were adopted primarily for
political purposes.</hs_Para>

Yes, we have the six markers that were put down in the House of Lords,
and I accept that two of those—the least
far-reaching—have been accepted by the Government. The move from
“must” to “may” opens the door to judicial
discretion; there is agreement on that. There has been some peculiar
dithering about equality of arms, which is a strange term to use in
this context as it refers simply to the ability for both parties to
apply to get into a CMP; it will have nothing to do with equality of
arms once the CMP has been invoked. That proposal was put in, taken out
and put in again by the Government. I am not making a point about that;
it is in there now and the Government are supporting our amendments on

rejection of the Wiley balance in the CMP, a matter that I believe we

introduction at a very late stage, both in Committee and on Report, of
substantial changes to the Bill does not make for good legislation. At
the very least, our new clause would make the provision subject to a
process of annual review. The idea of a review after five years that

are three issues before us—reporting, renewal and
review—but I will touch only on renewal and review. I have been
arguing for some kind of renewal or sunset clause from the moment I
first grasped the implications of the Bill. In the opinion of very many
people, including, most notably, the special advocates, who are the
only people with extensive experience both of CMPs and PII, CMPs will
not make Britain more just, and neither, in my view, will they make
Britain more secure. I will be supporting new clause 4, as proposed by
the JCHR and tabled by the Opposition Front-Bench team, to introduce a
renewal clause, and I will be doing so, above all, because of something
the Minister without Portfolio said early on in his speech. He said
that the Government did not know what effect the new process would
have. That is the clearest indication of something that needs very
careful and periodic renewal and review.</hs_Para>

recognise the force of some of the arguments against annual renewal put
by the Minister this evening—his thought had occurred to me
before he uttered it —particularly in respect of this type of
legislation, where there would be so much litigation. Without having
thought through all the arguments as carefully as some others, I have a
preference for renewal once a Parliament, but the Government have not
offered a renewal clause at all. That is a mistake and I hope that they
will reconsider.</hs_Para>

Government are offering a review, but even that is defective. For a
review to be credible, it must be independent, and be seen to be
independent, of the Executive, but clearly that will not be the case
with this review. Under new clause 6(1), the Secretary of State acting
alone will appoint the reviewer. In another context, this is exactly
the problem that the Treasury Select Committee faced when the
Chancellor created the Office for Budget Responsibility to make
forecasts for him. The Chancellor wanted those forecasts to be seen to
be independently prepared, but the Treasury Committee pointed out to
him that if he, acting alone, appointed the chairman of the OBR, nobody
would believe in its
independence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T21:18:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030440001248" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/debtext/130304-0003.htm#13030440001248">After
discussions with the Committee, the Chancellor decided that the
chairman of the OBR should be appointed jointly by him and the

the Lords, and their lordships, when examining new clause 6, to make
similar provision for the appointment of the reviewer of CMPs. In my
view, the reviewer should be appointed only by agreement between the

think that it is in the interests of the Government to adopt this
route, because it would bolster public confidence that the review and
the reviewer were truly independent of the Government. My personal view
is that five-yearly renewals, informed by a five-yearly review clause,
should be satisfactory or at least adequate, but that is certainly the
minimum that is required. What the Government have offered so far,
which is just some reporting plus a five-yearly review, is clearly not
enough. If they do not indicate that they are prepared to move this
evening, I will vote against them. However, I hope very much that their

McDonnell:</Member></B> I tabled new clause 9, which, as has been said,
was debated in Committee. I congratulate Lawrence McNamara on his
work—on the advice that he gave the House overall, and the
evidence that he gave to the Joint Committee on Human Rights. He made a
simple point. As we have seen tonight, this is an extremely contentious
piece of legislation concerning a contentious procedure, and it
therefore warrants close monitoring. The best way of enabling that to
happen is to establish a database at the earliest opportunity in order
to ensure that the necessary information is
recorded.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030440001259" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/debtext/130304-0004.htm#13030440001259">Lawrence
McNamara made a fairly straightforward recommendation to the Committee.
He suggested a template-form statement specifying the duration of open
hearings and closed hearings, the number of witnesses heard in closed
proceedings and the nature of those witnesses, the length of a closed
judgment, and whether national security was an issue in the
proceedings. The information whose collection is requested is not
exactly highly controversial. The reason for requiring it is that it
would inform the proposed review, and inform the wider media and the
general public about the activities that were being undertaken as a
result of the Bill. I am perplexed about why the Government did not
simply 
<?notus-xml column=773?>accept that recommendation. Surely they would want to collect the
information as well, in order to monitor their own
legislation.</hs_Para>

clause 5. At least the Government are doing something about reporting.
However, the report that they propose would be undertaken after 12
months of operation. I think that people need an ongoing database to
which they can refer regularly, and which can be used when necessary to
inform debates in the House and among the general public. The database
would also feed into the review itself. It would enable a proper
discussion to be held about whether the legislation was being
implemented effectively, and about the scale of its
implementation.</hs_Para>

arguments that we have heard tonight is that the CMPs will be used in
only a small number of cases—15, according to the impact
assessment, but that figure appeared to have been plucked out of the

the uncertainty about the import and breadth of the use of the
legislation, there is obviously a need for an ongoing database to
monitor the position, and that is all that the amendment does. For the

regard to the review, I wholeheartedly support the proposal for Joint

important and that, because the legislation is contentious, it is
important that the person who reviews it has the full support of the

regard to expiry and renewal, I remind Members that when the Prevention
of Terrorism Act 2005 was introduced, we secured an annual debate and
renewal. I cannot remember it being argued at the time that that was
because the legislation did not have sufficient scrutiny in its early
days. I know that it was introduced as emergency legislation, but
subsequently there was fairly intense debate about whether it needed to
be amended at different stages. The annual renewal was intended to give
us an opportunity to see whether it was working effectively and to
estimate the consequences for human rights, a critical debate that a
number of us have engaged in year in, year out. It did not mean that
there were any major amendments as such; it meant that Members of this
House, and through them the general public, could satisfy themselves as
to whether the legislation was operating in accordance with the
original intentions. That is what an expiry and renewal clause would
enable us to do. Again, I cannot for the life of me see that as
contentious; it is simply another democratic fall-back or long-stop
mechanism to ensure that we are fully consulted and that we are

the Minister. In Committee he resisted many of my amendments, which was
frustrating, but he did agree to take away my new clauses 1 and 2,
which related to reporting and reviewing, and reflect on them. He has
been true to his word, and new clauses 5 and 6 are the result. There
are a couple of slight differences in the time scales, but, as I
indicated in Committee, my aim was to try to achieve regular reporting
and review, rather than being fixated on the exact number of months,
and clearly, reports that happen so quickly that there is not enough
time to get information in are not necessarily better. I am happy to
settle for the annual report and pleased to see
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030440001266" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/debtext/130304-0004.htm#13030440001266"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T21:27:55"></hs_TimeCode>I
am also happy to see the five-yearly review, but I have a slight issue
with it and would be grateful for clarification from the Minister.
During a brief exchange earlier in the debate, he talked about the
five-yearly approach being appropriate, and I think he said
“once a Parliament”. As I read it, the wording of the
clause indicates that the review would be done after five years and
never again, so there is a difference between the two proposals. I hope
that he will reflect on which it is intended to
be.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030440001267" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/debtext/130304-0004.htm#13030440001267">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T21:24:45"></hs_TimeCode>

who are deeply uncomfortable with the whole concept might find that it
does not work in the way we had anticipated, in which case we might not
need regular reviews, but there might be things we need to consider, in
which case we would like to see five-yearly reviews. I think it is
important that each Parliament can reflect and conclude, for example,
that this has gradually grown, that there are more and more cases, or
fewer and fewer cases, or that something else has changed. I hope that
the Minister will look at that. I am pleased that there will be the

supporting such a renewal, but if it continues to be a stumbling block,
will they consider five-yearly renewal? I had a similar discussion
about that on the same terms with the Minister in respect of the
Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures Bill. In that case, he
and the Home Secretary decided on a five-yearly renewal and perhaps he
will make the same incredibly wise decision in this case, as it was

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T21:31:49"></hs_TimeCode>In addressing
the new clauses, the Minister said it was important to maintain
confidence in our legal system—not only for us to do so, but for
our many thousands of constituents to do so. That is why it is so
important constantly to review the impact of closed material
proceedings. The Minister gave a figure of 15 or more cases
going through this process, which is not an inconsequential number.
Since entering this place, I have seen changes to our legal system that
have worried me, such as the introduction of double jeopardy, and the
fact that we now seem happy to imprison people for 20 years and when we
discover that they did not commit the crime for which they were
imprisoned we do not think that they should have much compensation, if
any. We are now going down the route of secret courts, so reviewing the
impact and consequences of secret proceedings is enormously important,
because many thousands of my constituents and many millions of people
across the length and breadth of this country are made very nervous by
this change, coming on top of other changes. What happens in other EU
countries that have proceedings similar to closed material proceedings?
What happens in other liberal western democracies?</hs_Para>

conclude my comments by saying that over the weekend a number of
Conservative colleagues whom I respect and admire immensely were

would support that, but I smile when I find that on the Monday we are
talking about bringing in secret courts, as the two things do not make
comfortable bedfellows. Thank you very much for allowing me a brief

new clauses. I note that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T21:34:22"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Hammersmith (Mr Slaughter) described the legislation 
<?notus-xml column=776?>as complex, controversial and important and asked whether I would accept
his analysis. I agree that it is complex, inasmuch as we are dealing
with the need for closed material proceedings and the nature of
sensitive material. It is controversial and it is clearly very
important, as it relates to the assurances we are seeking to give to
overseas partners and, obviously, to the nature of justice itself,
which was very much a feature of the preceding debate. In the context
of his description, I certainly recognise the need for an assurance to
this House and to the public about how the powers and provisions in the
Bill will be used in practice, as well as on the points that have been
made about that.</hs_Para>

essence, that question was at the heart of our debate in Committee

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T21:35:51"></hs_TimeCode>many ways,

the Member for Chichester (Mr Tyrie).
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T21:36:09"></hs_TimeCode>We have given an

shall focus on a number of points raised during the debate and
characterise some of the themes that emerged. The first is the question
of whether there should be a formal renewal process. The Opposition
have sought to interpose an annual renewal through new clause 4, but
even if we accept the principle, that is simply too short a time period
for the reasons given by many right hon. and hon. Members. The House
would not be able to assess the effectiveness and operation of the
provisions, given that we are talking about cases that are likely to
run for an extended period of time.</hs_Para>

we considered the timing and effectiveness of a renewal provision,
going back as far as the Terrorism Prevention and Investigation
Measures Act 2011, we looked back at what happened under control
orders, which is perhaps the closest parallel to an annual renewal
debate on which we can draw. I recall the annual debates on control
orders and I am sure that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T21:37:59"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Hammersmith will agree that some of them were sub-optimal, to say
the least. In many respects, they
became—<I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I> They were not,
perhaps, the kind of fully formed debate that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T21:38:19"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Hammersmith is seeking through new clause 4, because, in essence,
they became a cursory discussion at the time for the annual renewal of
the provision. The debates were often short, were not necessarily well
attended and did not necessarily apply the level of scrutiny that he is
looking for. It is difficult to see, if he is talking about a renewal
12 months after Royal Assent, what information would be available to
inform consideration properly of whether the legislation was effective.
If we put aside the detail of the principle, there is a clear
issue with the
timing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T21:39:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

saying that the poor quality of debate in this House is a good reason
for not having annual renewal is his best point. Will he deal with a
point on which I do not think he agrees with me? New provisions have
been introduced to the Bill, in Committee, where they at least received
some debate, and today. Amendment 46, in particular, seems to allow
material that is irrelevant to the proceedings to trigger a CMP, which
is a massive change that has 
<?notus-xml column=777?>not been debated at all because we have not had time to do so. Is that
not a reason for allowing renewal after a short

Brokenshire:</Member></B> I hesitate to tread on amendments in the
previous group, but ultimately it is for this House to determine the
appropriate way to examine legislation. With other legislation, it
might simply be the process of review through Government activity or
Select Committee activity, but in certain cases, because of the
sensitivity, import or nature of the legislation, there might be some
form of additional statutory provision. We have certainly touched on
areas of legislation where that has had some application. For example,
some sort of mechanism or review for reporting back to the House how
the legislation has been used applied to previous terrorism legislation
and the Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures
Act 2011. Because of the sensitive nature of the issues in this case,
the Government have accepted that the normal scenario whereby Select
Committees or other bodies are part of the general rolling assessment
of legislation is not sufficient for this particular Bill. That is why
we have sought to introduce the new clauses this

Brokenshire:</Member></B> I would say that the provisions we
have sought to introduce on the appointment of a reviewer are
similar to, and in line with, other legislation such as the
Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures Act,
whereby the Secretary of State appoints the independent reviewer of
terrorism legislation. The individual holding that office may well be
the appropriate person to conduct this type of review or it may be
someone else so that David Anderson or whoever is the holder of the
office at that time is not overburdened, which could dilute the
effectiveness of the independent reviewer’s analysis of the
legislation. I hope that the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Human
Rights would accept that the evidence and information provided by the
independent reviewer has been instructive and relevant to that
Committee’s consideration of the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T21:43:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030440001282" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/debtext/130304-0004.htm#13030440001282">I
highlight the fact that the independent reviewer has provided quite an
important perspective, looking at terrorism legislation as he does,
which has added value not just to the Joint Committee’s review
but to the debates we have had here. I note that David Anderson has
been prayed in aid this afternoon and also in debates in the other
place. We certainly recognise the value that at independent reviewer
can have. I know from my discussions with other Ministers in other
parts of Europe and elsewhere that the role of our independent reviewer
is recognised for the importance and added value it brings in the
analysis of legislation that touches on some sensitive
issues.</hs_Para>

Friend’s question. Parallels are difficult to draw in this
respect. I can think of one European jurisdiction that is seeking to
examine the appointment of an independent reviewer of its own terrorism
legislation. We are unusual in having an individual who does such work.
People are reflecting on the input from David Anderson, the current
reviewer, and his predecessor, Lord Carlile, shining a light and having
access to sensitive materials better to inform the debate on sensitive

genuinely difficult to draw parallels with the type of court processes
and the review structure that we have in this country, and to say that
another country deals with the issue by having an x year review or some
sort of renewal system or independent reviewer. It is hard to make such

hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) spoke about the
provision of information and the need for a database. On closed
proceedings and closed judgments, there is a database which is held and
managed by the Home Office and will be updated three times a year in
relation to closed judgments, to ensure that special advocates are able
to look at summaries of legal principles in particularly sensitive
judgments. Those will be added on a less routine basis to reduce the
risk of the summary being linked to a particular case, because of the
sensitivity of some of the details. It is intended that summaries of
all future closed judgments will be entered into the database to inform
debates and discussions and the work of the special
advocates<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T21:48:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-03-04?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2013_03_04_PT_1/7F29DEED5C30FE2861BF01DEB3CC4D1F43E10A47" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="4 March 2013">Monday

debate has been on the principle of whether there should be an annual
sunset or renewal—whatever language we choose—or whether
the system should be on a five-year basis, which I know that others
have suggested as an alternative, although that option is not
before the House tonight. The choice that the House has is whether to
accept the Government’s new clauses on the provision of
information and the review, 
<?notus-xml column=779?>which I hope it will, recognising that this is an addition that seeks to
improve the Bill and the scrutiny and analysis that it

if we were to introduce some form of renewal, we would have to face up
to the message that that gives to some of our external partners on the
control principle and the sharing of intelligence, given that one of
the principles behind the changes being introduced is to give assurance
to our external partners, recognising the point that David Anderson and
others have made that, in essence, our relationship with a number of
external partners has been affected by some cases. If we were to
provide an annual renewal, it would materially impact on that. Equally,
if we were to provide a further formal five-year renewal in the Bill,
our judgment is that that would not provide the assurance to our
external partners that is anticipated for our intelligence
relationships<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T21:50:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030440001291" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/debtext/130304-0004.htm#13030440001291"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Tyrie" PimsId="4371" UID="13030440003534" xid="613" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/debtext/130304-0004.htm#13030440003534">Mr
Tyrie:</Member></B> I am a little concerned that I am listening to a
suggestion that the legislation is somehow for the benefit of our
closest allies the United States. It should be pointed out that the
United States does not rewrite its law to take account of the fact that
we send some of our intelligence material to it. Indeed, it is often
argued that it is a good deal more leaky than we are. A former head of
the CIA counter-terrorism centre recently remarked that he supposed
that British intelligence must be very unhappy because it is often
exasperated, quite reasonably, with its American friends, who are far
more leak prone than it is. Nor has it sought to change its system of
law to take account of our requests. Is that not one of my hon.

Brokenshire:</Member></B> My hon. Friend says that it is a weak
argument, but I disagree. An important part of the Bill is to ensure
that justice is achieved in those cases where otherwise evidence would
be excluded. Also, through the Norwich Pharmacal provisions, assurance
is given that the control principle will be adhered to. That important
provision needs to be considered as part of this segment of the Bill
and when considering five-year renewal or otherwise. In essence, once
we get towards the end of the five-year period, the assurance will not
be there. People will be considering what the situation would be, and
the issues around the control principle and the assurance that we seek
to give to external partners are relevant factors for consideration in
this

the security and intelligence agencies and other Government activities

work, it may come across information relevant to this issue and it
would be open to the committee to report on those matters to Parliament

the House will need to determine whether the Government’s new
clauses are sufficient. We believe that they are; they allow for a
reviewer to look at the legislation in five years’ time.
Following the report that the reviewer provides, it is open to the
House to re-legislate if it considers that change is needed. Equally,
we judge that the legislation on the provision of information gives
assurance within an appropriate period on how the Bill will be
used.</hs_Para>

Barclay</B> (North East Cambridgeshire) (Con):</Member> In the wake of
the Francis report and the news that 14 more trusts are under
investigation due to unnecessary deaths, it is clear that our current
system of health care regulation has failed. More importantly, it means
that the NHS has failed its patients, and that the Care Quality
Commission is clearly not fit for purpose. I have seen documents that
suggest that 25 hospitals with abnormally high mortality rates were
highlighted to the then Secretary of State, the right hon. Member for
Leigh (Andy Burnham)
in<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T22:30:21"></hs_TimeCode> March 2010.
Seven of the 14 trusts now under investigation were on that
list. He referred them at the time to the CQC, which confirmed it
had:</hs_Para>
<hs_brev UID="1303053000095" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/debtext/130304-0004.htm#1303053000095">“no current

of them, however, have had significantly high mortality rates for more
than a decade. Sir David Nicholson tried to paint Mid Staffordshire as
a singular case. Minutes of meetings imply that the concerns of
patients’ families were dismissed as simply lobbying. Perhaps
more worryingly, it appears there has been not just incompetence, but a
culture of cover-up in the NHS.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="1303053000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/debtext/130304-0004.htm#1303053000033">Let<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T22:31:16"></hs_TimeCode>
me give just one example. Professor Sir Brian Jarman, a world-respected
authority on mortality data, has raised with me allegations of trusts
fixing their mortality figures. In essence, trusts relabelled deaths as
palliative care after the definition was widened in 2007.
Hospitals’ standard mortality rates would fall, as palliative
care deaths were considered normal and not down to poor care. Experts
suggest that a figure of approximately 4% of deaths should be
classified in this way, yet at the Medway NHS Foundation Trust, one of
the trusts now under investigation, it jumped to 37%, which suggests
that in one month hospitals had been transformed into
hospices.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1303053000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/debtext/130304-0004.htm#1303053000034">The
paper reclassification improved hospitals’ mortality score by
approximately a third, yet nothing had actually changed on the wards.
In other words, they were fiddling the figures and, as a result, were
masking poor care. The same tactic was used by Mid Staffordshire to
obscure what was really going on, and the number of deaths classified
even now as palliative care across England is still higher than
expected, and higher than in comparable international countries. That
needs to be looked at urgently. Until that happens, we cannot be
confident that the 14 trusts currently under investigation—seven
of which, we were told in 2010, were not a concern—are all that
we need to worry
about<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T22:33:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1303053000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/debtext/130304-0004.htm#1303053000035">Perhaps
more distressing is that management consultants profited from masking
the real causes of those deaths. The CHKS advisory group visited

Dickson—not a doctor, but a journalist—and he is now the

surprisingly, following the Francis report, there has been a flurry of
activity to explain what new systems will be put in place, but as an
ex-regulator I know that such changes, while introduced in good faith,
are likely to be flawed. If we are to ensure patient safety, we need a
culture change. The ultimate regulator is a well-informed patient. The
ultimate inspectors are whistleblowers on the ground. We need quality
transparent data for patients to be able to make real, informed choices
about where to be treated and how to hold the NHS to
account<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-04T22:35:44"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
remarkable that a report last week found that two thirds of doctors and
nurses at some hospitals would not recommend their own hospital to
their family and friends. What does that say about the regulation of
those hospitals? It is common knowledge among NHS insiders that certain
doctors are good and certain doctors and surgeons should be avoided.

ask the Minister to reflect on the following point. We now have the
safest heart surgery in Europe, partly because we have data

who exposed high death rates for child heart surgery. That information,

publication of those figures has clearly driven up standards, yet the
impetus for change was not the Department of Health or the Royal

matters is not only ensuring that data are transparent for patient
groups, but the quality of assessments, where we have seen a failure?
Hospitals with obviously high mortality rates were deemed acceptable by
assessors even before the fiddling of figures. Is that not partly
because people not qualified to know the ins and outs of what goes on
in, say, the operating theatre are going round, ticking the boxes and
saying, “That’s all fine”, when in fact it is not?
With the expert eye of another experienced clinician in the same field
doing the assessment, very different outcomes would arise. It is
because they have that knowledge and expertise that organisations such

have a unique vantage point on what is happening with patient safety,
but for too long we have hypocritically lauded their contribution
publicly while silencing or gagging them in practice. The Commission
for Health Improvement found problems at Mid Staffordshire back in
2002, a peer review of critically ill children by the strategic health
authority criticised Mid Staffordshire in 2003 and 2006, and
whistleblowers at Mid Staffordshire raised concerns as far back as
2005, yet the warning signs were not acted on. Many members of staff
simply chose to close ranks. There appeared to be a bullying culture
which discouraged people from coming forward, and those who did were
threatened. One nurse at Mid Staffordshire summed up the position by
saying:</hs_Para>

isolated case. It is almost beyond parody, but the Care Quality
Commission, the body to which whistleblowers might turn, itself used
gagging clauses. It disgracefully smeared Kay Sheldon, a member of its
board. When she had the courage to speak out, it was suggested that she
had mental health problems. That is the culture. As my hon. Friend the
Member for Bristol North West (Charlotte Leslie) pointed out during
Prime Minister’s Question Time last Wednesday, three US reports
commissioned to mark the 60th anniversary of the NHS in 2008 which
identified problems appear to have been buried. One of those reports,
to Ara Darzi, referred to a “shame and blame” culture,

of the Department of Health. Why were those reports

guidance which says that the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998

individuals are held to account. The Prime Minister has said that
sunlight is the best disinfectant, and that applies on our hospital
wards. It is best for us to have well-informed patients and staff who
are able to voice their concerns. It is clear from what happened at Mid
Staffordshire, at the 14 hospitals that are under investigation, and at
the 25 that were drawn to the attention of the Secretary of State that
concerns about those hospitals—along with the many other

failings highlighted in the Francis report, we need to be grown up

hon. Friend the Member for North East Cambridgeshire made the key point
that a real culture change was required, and that that is about having
transparency and openness in the NHS. He is right to highlight those
points. If we want transparency and openness, we need to look at some
of the steps that have already been taken. We know that the Public
Interest Disclosure Act 1998, which in theory gives protection 
<?notus-xml column=798?>to whistleblowers and people who want to speak out, has not been
effective. Legislative approaches have not been enough to ensure that
people feel free to speak out. Legislation has so far not been

we have seen two things in the past six months that will make a real
difference, the first of which is the contractual duty of candour,
which will be introduced in the NHS for hospital trusts. It will mean
that there is support for openness and transparency as part of the NHS

Poulter:</Member></B> I say to my hon. Friend that the Department of
Health has, like everyone who works for it, made it clear that gagging
clauses are not and have never been acceptable in the NHS. There is a
distinction to make between confidentiality clauses, which might be
part of any financial settlement with anyone who works in either the
commercial sector or the public sector, and a gagging clause. It is the
duty of any front-line professional, according to and as part of their
registration with the General Medical Council or the Nursing and
Midwifery Council, to speak out when there are issues of concern. That
is a part of good professionalism. That is what being a good
professional is about. It is about someone saying that they recognise
that there has been unacceptably poor care in a hospital or a care
setting and that they have a duty, because they are a registered doctor
or nurse, to speak out to highlight where problems have occurred. The
point is that at Mid Staffordshire there was clearly a failure of that
professionalism not only on the front line but at every level. Gagging
clauses have never been considered by the Department of Health,
certainly under the current Government, to be an acceptable part of the
NHS. That was made very clear in a recent letter written by my right

hon. Friend the Member for North East Cambridgeshire also raised a very
important point about open and transparent data on surgical outcomes.
It was Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, the current NHS medical director, who
put together the purple book of cardiac surgery, which has made a huge
difference through greater transparency of outcomes in that speciality.
That was in reply to the findings of the Bristol heart surgery inquiry,
and it is regrettable that we have not seen similar advances in
openness and sharing of data in other specialities in the NHS. That is
not necessarily because the data do not exist, because they often do.
In some specialities, such as urogynaecology, national databases are
being put together to consider the long-term data on certain
operations, which, to some extent, will give data on individual
surgeons.</hs_Para>

the NHS, we often have a plethora of data and a lot of audit
information that is collected at a local level, and we must ensure that
those data are used in a better way in future. A lot of work can be
done to add transparency and to share audit data in different trusts so
that they are openly comparable to build a national picture of certain
types of care and how we can improve 
<?notus-xml column=800?>patient care. That was a good point that was well made, and I know that
Sir Bruce Keogh is continuing and will continue to develop that work in
his role on the NHS Commissioning Board. I had a very encouraging
meeting recently with a number of senior surgeons who recognise the
importance of such work in their specialities. I am sure that the NHS
will continue to develop it at a greater pace in the future, not least
because of what we have heard from the Mid Staffs inquiry.</hs_Para>

Lewis:</Member></B> While the Department for Communities and Local
Government does not officially assess local authorities on recycling,
it believes they should all be making steps to improve their recycling
rates, and make recycling services more convenient for residents. It
maintains, however, that this should not be done to the detriment of
residual waste collection services. In nearly all cases, the 90
successful bids to the Department's £250 million Weekly
Collection Support Scheme announced in November 2012 proposed
delivering enhanced recycling services, making it easier for residents
to recycle. As these bids sought to retain or reinstate weekly
collections of residual waste, the scheme demonstrates that you don't
have to have a fortnightly collection to deliver high quality recycling
services. Furthermore, 41 of the successful bids propose offering
genuine rewards (such as shopping vouchers or loyalty points) for
recycling. The Department supports such incentive
schemes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030439000149" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/text/130304w0001.htm#13030439000149">The

decrease in the number of businesses served with civil penalties from
2010 can be explained as follows: employers’ increased awareness
of the regime together with improved guidance on the UK Border Agency
website; providing clear advice on how to conduct document checks to
verify a person’s right to work, has contributed to an increase
in employer compliance. The agency’s work in summer 2012 under
Operation Mayapple targeted enforcement activity on overstayers,
including students whose leave had been curtailed. This activity drives
up compliance across the board. Robust debt recovery processes have
also been implemented with employers becoming increasingly aware that
where penalties are not paid, debt recovery enforcement action will
commence against
them.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13030439000033" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/text/130304w0001.htm#13030439000033">Immigration</hs_8Question><Question><hs_Para UID="13030439000208" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/text/130304w0001.htm#13030439000208"><B><Member PimsId="5543" UID="13030439000499" xid="1042" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/text/130304w0001.htm#13030439000499">Duncan

projects will be made jointly by the Department for Environment, Food

Sport (DCMS) when they have completed the assessment and approval
process. The development of projects by applicants requires that they
have appropriate levels of capability and capacity to deliver
sustainable projects and it is therefore necessary to make a rigorous
assessment of each project. To date, three projects have been given
pre-contract approval and a fourth is due to be announced shortly.
Further announcements will be made when projects have demonstrated that
they meet the fund's criteria.</hs_Para>

summer in two areas to confirm our assumptions about the effectiveness,
humaneness and safety of controlled shooting. An independent panel of
experts will oversee and evaluate the pilots before reporting back to
Government. Ministers will then decide whether the policy should be
rolled out more widely, to up to ten new areas per year, starting in
2014.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13030442000007" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/text/130304w0002.htm#13030442000007">British

Waterways Charity Project was undertaken shortly after the functions,
assets and liabilities of British Waterways in England and Wales had
been transferred to the Canal &amp; River Trust (CRT). The assessment
did not identify any particular successes or failures which would have
direct relevance to the work to set up a new body to manage the Public

Heath:</Member></B> The information is not held in the format
requested. Economic assessments were carried out on an epidemiological
assessment completed in early 2012, looking at the potential spread of
Schmallenberg virus (SBV) in GB, the impact and risk across different
regions of the country. As the true impact was not known at that time,
we used estimates based on other similar viruses and the UK livestock
distribution.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030442000163" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/text/130304w0002.htm#13030442000163">This
demonstrated that for infection in counties south of the midlands,
which were determined to be at high or medium risk of SBV spread in
2011-12, if losses occurred on 5% of cattle and sheep farms and in 10%
of the herd or flock, the cost to sheep farmers would be approximately
£1 million, and for cattle farmers approximately
£2.5 million. This is less than the economic impact
of other common industry managed livestock disease such as mastitis in
dairy cows, and foot rot in sheep. Widening the assessment to include
counties deemed to be at low risk of infection in 2011, increased costs
to farmers by about a
third.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030442000164" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/text/130304w0002.htm#13030442000164">Another
scenario tested was 20% of all cattle and sheep farms in the
high and medium risk areas being affected. This increased
costs to sheep farmers to approximately £4 million, and to
cattle farmers to approximately £10
million.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13030442000165" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/text/130304w0002.htm#13030442000165">Since

our own UK farms on the impact and spread. These confirm actual impact
to overall be lower than our estimates (although of

are now looking at reviewing the economic impact to take these into

excluded from school, should receive an education on par with their
mainstream peers to enable them to access the same opportunities. The
Government has already begun introducing a number of ambitious reforms,

publishing new guidance, giving providers access to the benefits of
Academy status, and freeing schools from the bureaucracy that often
gets in the way of improving pupil outcomes.</hs_Para>

on the autistic spectrum should have their needs assessed individually
so that the support they need can be arranged for them in an
appropriate setting, whether that is in a mainstream or special school.
The Department funds the Autism Education Trust to provide training and
develop training materials to help mainstream schools meet these
children’s needs. The Department will be letting a contract to
provide specialist support in autism provision from April. The Autism
Education Trust has put in a bid which proposes to extend their
existing training programme beyond 2013, and also to expand coverage
more widely throughout England and to cover early years and further
education.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1303054000085" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/text/130304w0003.htm#1303054000085">Under
the current SEN code of practice, pupils with SEN but without
statements will be identified as being on either ‘School
Action’ and ‘School Action Plus’. The Government
proposes to replace these categories with a new single early years- and
school-based SEN category. The aim will be to encourage schools first
to adapt their core teaching to the range of needs their pupils have,
including those on the autistic spectrum. However the code will also
set out within this category the importance of identifying and meeting
specific needs in order to support pupils to progress and the
legislative duty on schools to use their best endeavours to secure

a place at any state funded school. The CAF can seek personal details

woman is seen on her own prior to a termination of pregnancy but we
know that the two main independent sector providers, the British
Pregnancy Advisory Service and Marie Stopes International, both have
policies and protocols in place that state that a woman must always be
seen on her own to establish that she is consenting to the termination
of her own free will. In addition, this provides the opportunity to
discuss any other relevant issues without a partner or family member
present. Officials from the Department have visited a number of
services that provide termination of pregnancy and the national health
service hospitals which have been visited have similar policies in

European Commission have put in a request for the revision of EN 1860-1
and EN 1860-2, the two standards relating to barbecues and barbecue
fuel packaging, to have safety warnings in prominent positions on the
barbecues themselves as well as on the packaging of the fuels and in
accompanying instructions. The General Product Safety Regulations 2005
(GPSR) state only safe products can be placed onto the market, and
recognise certain technical standards as carrying a presumption of
conformity with the general safety requirement, meaning that products
that comply with them are deemed to be safe. Local authority trading
standards services are able under the GPSR to remove products they feel
do not meet the basic safety requirements, which can include the lack
of appropriate safety
warnings.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="1303058000007" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130304/text/130304w0004.htm#1303058000007">Companies:
