to be pressing ahead much more urgently? Could the Minister say when
the next tranche of marine conservation zones will be announced and how
many there will be? Is it not the case, if further evidence is
required, that existing marine conservation zones demonstrate
remarkable replenishment of fishing stock? Does that not give
longer-term security to commercial fisheries? Could we not have an

sizeable proportion of the 58 are included in the 31 that are currently
out for consultation. As regards the others, there are questions over
data certainty and cost to which my noble friend Lord Eden referred
earlier. We will have new scientific evidence to use along with
responses to our consultation when making our final decisions on which
sites should be designated this year. Further evidence will continue to
become available thereafter and will be considered when making
decisions on future tranches of marine conservation zones to complete

Knight of Weymouth:</Member></B> My Lords, the aim of the marine Act
was, as the noble Lord, Lord Eden, said, to establish an ecologically
coherent network of sustainable conservation zones. The
Government’s current suggestion of just 31 falls way
short of achieving that aim and ignores the Government’s own
science. The environmental and social gains of
protecting our marine environment are obvious, but has the
Minister seen the analysis showing an economic
gain of £10 billion in Scotland alone through this sort of
protection? Instead of trading insults with Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall
in the <I>Guardian</I>, should not Richard Benyon, the Minister in the
noble Lord’s department, build on what the previous Government
established and, as the noble Lord, Lord Eden, has asked, give us a

about orphan drugs and indeed ultra-orphan drugs as they are

very rare conditions. It is likely that we will need to put special
arrangements in place for the pricing of those drugs. Overall, however,
I agree with the noble Baroness that the cancer drugs fund has been
immensely helpful. So far, since October 2010, the funding has helped

De Mauley:</Member></B> My Lords, in answer to the noble Lord’s
first question about whether there is any other valid form of
protection for seeds, neonicotinoids are, as I understand it, the prime
seed dressing. Yes, that is the case. However, there are other
treatments such as pyrethroids, which can be applied after the crop has
been planted, although there is increasing evidence that the pests we
are talking about are becoming resistant to pyrethroids. That is a
concern. In answer to his other question about taking the advice of the

extra

that it is quite finely balanced. That is why we are doing extra
fieldwork. As to whether there is an effect on the honey harvest, it is

question, this is not about the availability of honey; it is about
pollinators. If these chemicals are damaging bees, they are damaging
other pollinators at the same time. Is the noble Lord aware of the five
principal problems that appear to be arising from the use of these
chemicals: fatally late swarming activity, large numbers of virgin
queens not returning to the colony after mating, failure of mated
queens to continue to lay fertilised eggs, a high proportion of queens
producing only unfertilised “male” eggs, and abnormal

De Mauley:</Member></B> First, I categorically agree with the noble
Lord that we need to talk about all pollinators. Bees are an important
pollinator, but there are several other important ones. As regards his
other question, those are assertions that have come out of eminently
acceptable laboratory trials. Our proposal is that what is needed, and
what is lacking, is evidence of what actually happens in the
field<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T15:33:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

what is the Minister aiming to achieve to protect wild bees, such as
the bumble bee that pollinates tomatoes and the long-tongued bees

the security of the 17th century term “heir of the
body”, the governing definition for the right to succession, as
it might be constructively tested in the courts in modern conditions:
namely, the emerging legislation for same-sex marriage and the
techniques of surrogate childbirth. On the first, it will clearly be
lawful for a monarch or an existing heir of the body to enter into a
same-sex marriage when that Act becomes law. After all, one hesitates
to imagine the circumstances in which either Clause 3(3) of this Bill
were used to frustrate an intended same-sex marriage —a novel
interference with rights, as others have pointed out—thereby
denying that person succession to the Throne, or indeed where there was
no intervention and the marriage was accepted in some of the realms and
not others.</hs_para>

I do want to pursue the issue that follows inevitably from the
possibility of a lawful same-sex marriage. From that, and indeed from

follows the question of whether a child could be argued, in the
17th-century language, to be an heir of the body. I pointed out in

the Queen, carried by the Queen and born of the body of the Queen in a
lawful same-sex marriage. We all agree that that is the common law. I
simply ask whether the common law is proof against any claim to a right
that might be entertained in future, either in the European Court of
Human Rights or anywhere else. It need not arise directly in the case

I am not qualified to go. He further argues, however, by citing to me
the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2005, that an heir of a
Queen’s body alone could not succeed. I raised this in Committee

clearly removal of any doubt as to whether the Crown is encompassed in
that 2005 Act would simply solve the matter. It would debar an heir of

Elton:</Member></B> My Lords, my amendment has been grouped so that the
first and last stand together. My noble friend has fully explained the
circumstances that make the amendment necessary. He has traced the 
<?notus-xml column=270?>identification of the monarch from the Act of
Settlement through various other Acts to the present. The question is
whether that is a continuous and incontestable line or whether there is
doubt thrown upon it. He has demonstrated that there is doubt—a
point that I picked up in Committee. Doubt is thrown on it by the Human
Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008. We have discussed that in
Committee but there are rather more noble Lords here than
there were on that day, so it is worth repeating that Section 48(7) of
the HFEA 2008 recites what is not to be altered or touched by what is
in that Act.</hs_para>

two things caught out are titles and other honours. To the lay mind,
that does not embrace the possession of the Crown, which is the subject
of this Bill, and therefore does not seem to offer any of the
protection that my noble and learned friend the Lord Advocate says that
it offers. I cannot see the principle by which it could. The principle
will apply to the 1987 Act—that is in the same letter from the
Lord Advocate referred to by my noble friend. Another letter refers to
“us”—being the Government—and the Lord
Advocate says that the, “lesser includes the greater”. I
think that was the phrase. If that is right, my noble and learned
friend should know that that brings instantly to my mind an image of a
bar, other than the one to which he was called, and a quart being
poured into a pint pot with an awful mess on the taproom floor. The
greater surely includes the lesser, rather than the other way round.
However, that is irrelevant because that referred to another Act, and
he did not advance that argument in the case of this

simple point is that the Act that the Government say purports to
provide protection for the succession of the Crown does not do so. It
specifically mentions other objects. Incidentally, my noble and learned

ovulated. They therefore found a surrogate mother and had the egg from
the wife, which was fertilised by the husband, implanted in
the surrogate mother. In this case, the surrogate mother gave birth to
twins. My constituents brought the twins back to have them registered,
and the registrar of births, deaths and marriages said, “Sorry,
although you may be the genetic parents of these children, you are
going to have to adopt them”. They said, “Don’t be
so stupid—we are the genetic parents. Why should we have to
adopt our own children?”. This was an anomaly that I took up and
caused that Bill to be changed with the help of my right honourable
friend Kenneth Clarke, who was the Home Secretary at the time. The
change meant that in a case such as that, if an application were made
to the High Court, a judge could deem that parents of children who were
the genetic offspring of those parents were full parents by an order of
the judge in the High Court. That, as far as I understand it, is still
the

Minister, thinking of my noble friend’s amendment, is: what
would happen in a case like that, where the offspring of both parents

it be necessary for the royal parents to apply to the High Court?
Surrogacy is becoming much more common and it is not impossible that
this could happen in the future. In this sort of circumstance, when the
child of a royal marriage was created in this way, would it be
necessary to apply to the High Court for that child to be deemed, in
the words of the amendment, the “offspring of both
parties”? It is rather important that this should be clarified

Hayter of Kentish Town:</Member></B> My Lords, this is an interesting
discussion but, as the House will know, the Bill has three purposes,
all of which are about changing the succession to the Crown. One is to
allow women to inherit if they are the eldest; the second is to allow
people not to have to forgo their place in respect of the Throne if
they were to marry a Catholic; and the third is to allow people to
maintain their position should they marry, in certain circumstances,
without the monarch’s permission. Those are the three changes
to the laws of succession. It seems to us that
nothing in the Bill alters the current position
that only a natural-born 
<?notus-xml column=272?>child of a husband and wife can succeed to the Throne. Interesting

many other things which have come to be challenged in the European

Lexden:</Member></B> My Lords, we are deeply indebted to the noble
Lord, Lord Berkeley, for raising this important matter again. A
valuable discussion took place in Committee, drawing attention to the
fact that the Duchy and its properties tend to flourish most
conspicuously when they have a Duke in charge of them. They have been
particularly blessed and fortunate in this regard since the 1950s with
the current Duke, the Prince of Wales, at the helm. Incidentally, this
was also true under the previous Prince of Wales and Duke of Cornwall,
who later and briefly became Edward VIII. The tenants of his Kennington
estates were the envy of those who rented their homes from London
County
Council.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031351000114" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130313-0001.htm#13031351000114">Our
discussion in Committee also established that the experience gained by
the heir to the Throne in administering the Duchy estates is invaluable
in equipping him for his wider duties. So why not for
“him” read “or her”? The noble Lord, Lord
Berkeley, has consulted experts, as he told us, about the
Duchy’s founding charter laid in Parliament in 1337. It is clear
from what he has told us today that the charter has not remained
inviolate over the centuries. Should Parliament not be invited to
change the charter again, to incorporate the principle of gender
equality, which is one of the founding principles of this Bill? The

associate myself with those wishes of full recovery to Her Majesty. I
also thank the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, for raising the issue, which
gave rise to a very good debate in Committee. I certainly valued the
input from those who contributed, as I have today, on what is a very
important issue with a great historic heritage. The noble Lord referred
to the founding charter of 1337 and offered to pass me a
copy. I was not sure whether he was going to pass me a copy in Latin or
the translation. My higher in Latin from 40-odd years ago is probably
so rusty that the translation would be
better.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031351000120" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130313-0001.htm#13031351000120">As I
sought to explain in Committee, the Dukedom of Cornwall can pass only
to the eldest son and heir of the monarch. I will come back to the
points made about the exceptions to that. Therefore, when Her Majesty
was Heir Presumptive as Princess Elizabeth, she did not hold the title
of Duke of Cornwall, and we believe that the position would be the same
now if there were a female heir, because of the terms of the charter.
It is important to bear in mind that, because of limitation to the
eldest son and heir of the monarch, the title
cannot pass to a younger brother. The two exceptions raised by the
noble Lord, Lord Berkeley—that of Henry VIII, Prince Henry when
his brother, Prince Arthur, died and of Charles I, then Prince Charles,
when his elder brother, Prince Henry, I think, died—were
interesting. The noble Lord made it clear that exceptional steps were
taken. That almost proves the point that it was not an automatic
transfer of the dukedom. In the
case<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T16:19:14"></hs_TimeCode> of Charles

of Wales has undoubtedly had with regard to his involvement in the
duchy. I shall reiterate something that I said in Committee: although
the title cannot pass to a female heir, there is nothing to stop her
being actively involved in the running of the duchy or, should the
reigning monarch so wish, chairing the Prince’s Council. If that
was what the monarch wished, that would be entirely possible and would

automatically conferred on the heir apparent on his mother or father

bestowed upon him some six years after the accession of our present
Queen. The noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, said—my noble friend
disagreed with the disparaging way it was put—the Crown is the
source of all honour and dignity, and I agree with him. It would be a
matter for the sovereign, but if the Crown is the source of all honour
and dignity and the sovereign chose to establish a Princess of Wales,
it would be a matter for the sovereign. However, I do not think it is
very helpful to speculate on what might happen at a future

to all noble Lords who have taken part in this short debate. It seems
to me that there is a precedent for Parliament or the courts to change

Parliament or the Government—because the sovereign and the

circumstances—can make this change if they so wish, so the whole

repeat that am not opposed to the provision on female succession. I am
not opposed at all to allowing the heir to the Throne to marry a Roman

Catholic Church that requires that the children of a union of a mixed
marriage are brought up as Roman Catholics. There are many cases where
that does not happen. I myself married a Roman Catholic. She in fact
came over to the Church of England at a later date, but we had decided
that we were going to bring our children up as Anglicans. It was
obviously easier if she became an Anglican. At our wedding, I was not

discussed in some detail, including the work of a special commission on
that subject. I also declare an interest as a patron of the Association

the risk of a little canonical history, I must draw your
Lordships’ attention to three documents and practice. In the old
rules of the Roman Catholic Church on this subject, in the
shape of the Code of Canon Law<I> </I>of 1917, the position was rigid
and, I would say, harsh. This is no longer the case. The present code
of 1983 speaks of “permission”, not
“dispensation”. The old code also required the
non-Catholic party in a marriage to promise that the children would be
brought up as Roman Catholics. No such promise is required today. The
Roman Catholic partner is asked to declare that they will do all in
their power to ensure that any children are brought up as Roman
Catholics, yet no sanction is applied to the canon, whereas the old
code made the bishop’s dispensation for a mixed marriage
dependent on the bishop’s moral certainty about the Catholic
upbringing of the children. This is not the case
now<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T16:36:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031351000142" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130313-0001.htm#13031351000142">I
will also touch briefly on practice in a more pragmatic way.
Permissions for mixed marriages have been given even where it was
foreseen that the promise could not be fulfilled in whole or in part.
In making these points, I rely not only on my own past discussions of
these questions over many years with officials, bishops, theologians
and canonists of the Roman Catholic Church but on the authoritative
interpretation of present Roman Catholic canon law offered in a
magisterial commentary of no less that 1,952 pages published in 2000 by
the Canon Law Society of America. It is the standard textbook in the
English-speaking

on the question of the upbringing of children in these circumstances,
the Roman Catholic canon lawyers quote the official Vatican ecumenical
directory of 1993, which clearly indicates that the promise may not be
expected to be completely fulfilled, or fulfilled at all, in every
case. It states that a Roman 
<?notus-xml column=282?>Catholic partner can ecumenically fulfil their
obligations as a faithful Catholic, short of insisting on the Roman
Catholic formation of the children, because the unity of the marriage
is more important. The Vatican document, quoted by the canon lawyers,

decision not to use the Bill to remove the disqualification on a
Catholic becoming the sovereign. However, I and others believe that the
question should be revisited at some stage in the not too distant
future, because it is discriminatory and unnecessary. While I
understand the arguments put by the noble Baroness, Lady Flather, that
the Catholic Church needs further reformation in places, they do not
justify a discriminatory provision. I say that even in the context of
the established church, for the reasons so eloquently advanced by the

quite apart from the principle, my noble friend’s amendment,

present position is that marriage to a Catholic imposes a
disqualification on an heir succeeding to the Crown. That is clear and
simple. Clause 2 removes that disqualification entirely. Marriage to a
Catholic does not disqualify anyone from succeeding to the Crown. An
heir or a monarch can marry a Catholic without losing his right to the
succession or to the Crown. That is clear and simple, again. But my
noble friend’s amendment would import a proviso into
that clear and simple proposal. There would be no

determined that such a requirement, if indeed it were established, was
being maintained? Who would decide whether that requirement was being
maintained? When, at what point in time, would the requirement need to
be maintained, and when would it cease to be maintained? Furthermore,
what exactly is meant by being brought up as an Anglican? By what
process would a disqualification be imposed on someone in line of

Crickhowell:</Member></B> My Lords, I sat through the debate
in Committee and listened to the previous effort of my noble friend
Lord Cormack, which was fairly effectively demolished by my noble
friend Lord Deben. I am puzzled by the amendment that he has now
produced because its argument was effectively dealt with by my noble
friend Lord Deben when the previous amendment was tabled. Unless my
memory is wrong, the Act of Settlement and the Bill of Rights say
nothing about upbringing; they merely say that the sovereign has to be
Protestant<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T16:50:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031351000152" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130313-0001.htm#13031351000152">As
my noble friend Lord Deben and others have pointed out, you could be
brought up as a Muslim or indeed in any other faith, but there is
nothing to say that you will stick by that decision. As you grow older,
you may take your own decision as to what your faith is or whether you
have any faith at all. However, if you become the sovereign you have to
be a Protestant; 
<?notus-xml column=284?>that, surely, is the law. I therefore cannot see that the amendment put
forward by my noble friend and all the interesting and complicated
points raised by the right reverend Prelate are relevant to this Bill,

doubt the individual concerned would consider very carefully his or her
attitude to religion and what his faith was before taking a final

Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend
Lord Cormack for introducing this amendment and allowing the House a
further opportunity to discuss what, from our debates at Second Reading
and in Committee, is quite clearly a very sensitive subject and one
that quite properly has engaged the interest and concern of a number of
Members of your Lordships’ House. Like the noble Baroness, Lady
Hayter, I particularly thank the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of
Guildford for giving us the benefit of his rich experience and giving
us an understanding of how these matters are approached by the Roman
Catholic Church. It has helped to inform our
debate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T16:56:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

position, my noble friend Lord Cormack seeks to give guidance to any
royal couple who find themselves in a mixed Protestant/Catholic
marriage as to the expectation that a child be brought up as a
Protestant if they are one day to accede to the Throne. Perhaps the
first thing I should make clear—indeed, my noble friend Lord
Crickhowell summed it up very well—is that the relevant
legislation simply requires the sovereign to be a Protestant and in
communion with the Church of England. There is no statutory provision
that the heirs should be brought up as Anglicans. The important point
is that the sovereign be a Protestant. Therefore they could be brought
up as a Methodist or, like my noble friend Lord Kilclooney, as a
Presbyterian. That is the position. The Act of Settlement also requires
the sovereign to be in communion with the Church of England. There is
no statutory provision with regard to being an
Anglican<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T16:57:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Flather, if it is reassurance she is
seeking, and indeed the noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, that there is
nothing in this Bill that changes the position that the sovereign must
be a Protestant. Given that requirement, the expectation is also clear
that should royal parents in a mixed marriage wish for their child one
day to accede to the Throne then they must be Protestants. I am sure
that it is a matter that a couple will consider very carefully indeed.
As was clear from what the right reverend Prelate said, couples
throughout the land in mixed marriages have these considerations. As
the representatives of the Bishops’ Conference of the Roman
Catholic Church said to me when I met them, the overriding concern is
the indissolubility of marriage and unity of the partnership and, as
the right reverend Prelate said, the importance of praying with the
family for the grace of Christian unity as the Lord wills
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T16:58:39"></hs_TimeCode>. That is the
background. It is a choice. It is a position that royal parents know
they must

Marks very eloquently and very concisely highlighted the serious
practical difficulties that could arise if my noble friend’s
amendment was to be incorporated into the Bill. Who would determine
whether the upbringing continued to be Anglican? It is important to
note the consequences of my noble friend’s amendment. As
drafted, it would not only be the child’s prospects of
succession that were affected if they were not being brought up as an
Anglican; it would also mean that the parent who was in the line of
succession to the Throne would have to drop out if the maintenance of
the upbringing was not continued. As the noble Lord, Lord Fellowes,
indicated, that would 
<?notus-xml column=287?>affect the succession to the Throne as someone would have to cease to be
in the line of succession and that would engage the other 15 realms.

matter.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13031351000329" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130313-0001.htm#13031351000329">I
note that this amendment would apply to children born of mixed

bar that applies to Catholics only and to no other faith. I believe it
would be unsatisfactory on the one hand to repeal a piece of
discriminatory legislation only to replace it with a new stricture that
would apply only to those entering into mixed Catholic/Protestant
marriages. Indeed, at Second Reading my noble friend Lady Falkner of
Margravine highlighted something that exists today—that is,

has been reached with the other Commonwealth countries. This question
may arise in relation to later amendments, but the preamble to the
Statute of Westminster Act 1931 gives an expectation that in matters of
succession to the Crown there will 
<?notus-xml column=288?>be the engagement of the other realms of which the
Queen is head of state. It is not a matter of binding law but it is
certainly an expectation and one that we have considered to be very

taken part in this short but fairly vigorous and interesting debate. I
am particularly grateful for the support of the noble Lords, Lord
Fellowes and Lord Kilclooney, and others. In response to the noble
Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant, it is of course possible to be both an

for the speech of my noble and learned friend the Minister and I shall
bear in mind everything that he said. However, whatever is in this
Bill, it remains in effect, in his words, discriminatory because there
is an insistence that the heir to the Throne cannot be a Roman
Catholic. I personally accept that and support it, as will have been
apparent from my earlier remarks, but you cannot have it both ways.
With this amendment, I was merely seeking to remove an element of
ambiguity. I am particularly grateful for the excellent exposition of
the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Guildford, but he, too, ended
his speech by saying that he would welcome the removal of ambiguity. He
hoped that either in the Bill or in some other manner—perhaps in
an exchange of letters or whatever—there could be some form of
wording that would make it less ambiguous than it is at the moment. I
am grateful to him for that because that is an extremely important
point.</hs_para>

pledged his support, also said that he would reluctantly go into the
Lobby. I will not make him reluctant tonight because I do not propose
to press the amendment to a Division. There is still scope for further
discussion. I was delighted to hear from my noble and learned friend
that Third Reading will not come until after the Easter Recess. That
gives all of us with an interest in this and other matters relating to

It has been decided that gender should be no impediment as far as the
first born is concerned. It has been decided that marriage to a Roman
Catholic, subject to the sovereign’s permission, can go ahead.
It has also been reiterated by my noble and learned friend that anyone
succeeding to the Crown cannot be a Roman Catholic. Although he
introduced—as did my noble friend Lord Marks of
Henley-on-Thames—references to other 
<?notus-xml column=289?>religions, that is not what we are concerned with in this Bill. We are
concerned with what is explicitly in the Bill. I still believe that it
would be helpful if we had some form of safeguard either in the Bill
itself or in an exchange of published letters with the Roman Catholic
hierarchy, but we can all reflect on that over the coming
weeks. With that, I beg leave to withdraw the
amendment.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="13031365000243" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130313-0001.htm#13031365000243">Amendment

Lang of Monkton:</Member></B> My Lords, in moving the amendment I
return to a matter that troubled me both at Second Reading and in
Committee, namely the provision in Clause 3 to replace the Royal
Marriages Act 1772 with a new requirement that only the first six
persons in the line of succession to the Throne will require the
monarch’s consent to their marriages. In my view that number is
too small, and my amendment would increase it to
12<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T17:08:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the clause will apply is much wider than before. Until now only
Catholic marriages were specifically barred. Henceforth, consent can be
withheld in respect of any religion, or for any other reason that the
monarch, in consultation with his or her Ministers, thinks fit. That is
the first major, and largely unadvertised, change that the clause
makes. The seeking of consent itself is sensible in principle for a
host of reasons, but it is the partial relaxation of the bar on
Catholics that makes it necessary. To allow those in the line of
succession to the Throne to marry Catholics while at the same time
leaving in place an absolute ban on Catholics from occupying the Throne
sets a collision course that sooner or later could cause trouble for
the
monarchy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T17:08:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031365000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130313-0001.htm#13031365000009">Clause
3, by implication, acknowledges that and seeks to provide some
protection. However, my contention is that it does not provide enough.
I am trying to resist the temptation to delve back again into history
again, having overindulged in Committee, but the more one considers
this Bill and the 1772 Act, the more one realises what a minefield the
Government are in danger of straying into. If the list of six now
proposed had existed for the seven sons of George III, they would all
have been members at some stage, but not all at once. Prince Augustus
Frederick, sixth son of George III, and periodically sixth in line to
the Throne, would have been in and out of the club three times in his
life; yet he still managed to marry twice, both times without consent
and both times during what would have been a period of membership of
the six; and both marriages were declared void in terms of the 1772
Act. However, he did stay in the line of
succession<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T17:09:57"></hs_TimeCode>. Two
other princes contracted marriages that were also voided by the Act.
Three more princes stayed unmarried until middle
age<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T17:10:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

me that the 1772 Act had a few unintended consequences, and it was not
very effective on the marriage front. But it did serve a useful
purpose, because although the royal dukes forfeited their unapproved
marriages, they did not forfeit their places in the succession. Despite
everything, that helped to maintain stability. The Bill before us does
the direct opposite. It turns that around so that unapproved marriages
will be allowed to remain in place—however unwise—but the
right to the succession is lost. That loss is a substantial
constitutional change, with potentially more unintended consequences,
especially when linked to the relaxation on royal
marriages<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T17:10:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

marriage; now it is the loss of the right to ascend the Throne. These
are constitutional changes of import. I do not believe that King George

this debate until now but was so moved by the oratory of my noble
friend Lord Lang when he first put this prospect forward that I really
thought it was important to back his amendment. There is no doubt but
that it is an extremely modest amendment. I come from a position of
serious disquiet, knowing that the person who is really pushing this
Bill through Parliament is the Deputy Prime Minister. That adds a whole
dimension of worry that the thing has been cobbled together in a rather
hasty way. The whole idea of six members of the Royal Family being in
this bracket is a number that came to him in the middle of the night
and he thought, “Let’s just stuff it in”. I do not
think that any serious thought has been given to this at all. I share
many of my noble friend’s concerns that we live in a very
dangerous age and that awful things could happen to six members of the
Royal Family. Then, of course, we would all look incredibly stupid and
six would be a number that was obviously much too
small.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031365000025" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130313-0001.htm#13031365000025">This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T17:20:37"></hs_TimeCode>

all the Commonwealth Governments if we change it. I refer to the noble
Lord, Lord Fellowes, as my noble friend, although he sits on the Cross
Benches. If you have shared a flat with somebody, you cannot really
think of him as anything other than your noble friend. I hope that that
is not a concern but I do think that this is a very modest and very

reasons and, in that, seven marriages were removed from the list. They

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T17:33:25"></hs_TimeCode> Lords, I
support this amendment very strongly. Briefly, my points follow closely
those of my noble friend Lord True. By extending from six to 12, the
measure would reinforce the sense of family and the obligations that go
with it. These are especially important where the Royal Family is
concerned. In giving approval for the marriages of his or her blood
relatives, the monarch can surely expect to bind them more closely to
the Crown and the public duties that it imposes. For that purpose, it
is surely appropriate to have 12 blood relatives in this category,
rather than
six.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031365000048" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130313-0001.htm#13031365000048">Bagehot,

Perhaps more importantly, one asks: what is the downside of 12? If
those who are ranked seven to 12 do not rate their chances of
succession, or if perhaps they do not want to succeed, their remedy is
perfectly simple: they do not ask Her Majesty for consent and the
statute automatically then disqualifies them. It is only Her Majesty
who might suffer the problem of having to consent—if consent is

Committee, when this was discussed at greater length and there was an
amendment to reduce the number—I think to four, or even to
zero—so it was not as clear-cut then that the number should be
increased. Indeed, the number six is not the full number of people who
will necessarily always have to seek permission, because they have to
seek permission at the point at which they marry. It could well include
far more people. Someone who may not be heir to the Throne within the
first six at any one point could be in that position by the time that
they want to marry. It applies at the time of their marriage, so more
people may well have to seek
permission.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031365000053" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130313-0001.htm#13031365000053">As
we said when this was discussed at greater length in Committee, with

certainly do not think that it is sensible to involve an unnecessarily

although one noble Lord suggested that. We do not know what sort of

it is part of the agreement that has been discussed with all the other

the number now when it has been discussed at great length. I am sure
that it is in no way the intention behind the amendment that it should
be wrecking or delaying. However, I fear that changing the number from
six would have that effect. I am sure that we would not want to risk
the other really important parts of the Bill, the two bits that the

Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> My Lords, again, I thank my noble
friends Lord Lang, Lord Hamilton and Lord True, who have signed the
amendment. My noble friend Lord Lang raised this issue at Second
Reading and again in Committee and on each occasion stimulated a very
good debate. It is clear that a balance needs to be struck somewhere
between mitigating a remote but potentially catastrophic event, on the
one hand, and the risk of impinging unnecessarily, as the noble
Baroness, Lady Hayter, said, on the lives of those who are more distant
from the Throne.</hs_para>

Lang said that there were two differences in what was being proposed
from what was there before. I think he said that, before, consent under
the Royal Marriages Act 1772 related to religion and marriage to a
Catholic. In fact, it went much wider than that. As my noble friend
Lord True said, it was George III’s concerns about his siblings
that prompted it. It was not
actually<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T17:39:45"></hs_TimeCode> to do
with religion because the provision on religion was such that if you
married a Catholic, you lost your place in the line of succession. I
suspect that you also still had to get consent, being one of the
descendants of George II, otherwise your marriage, albeit one that took
you out of the line of succession, would have been void. Nothing is
changing there. It is not related solely to
religion.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031365000058" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130313-0001.htm#13031365000058">My
noble friend also said that the other change is that rather than the
marriage being void, as is the case under the 1772
legislation, the person and their descendants from that unconsented-to
marriage lose their place in the line of succession. Hitherto, failure
to get consent did not cause the individual concerned to lose their
place in the line of succession, as the examples given by my noble
friend indicated, but their children did not have any place in the line
of succession because by definition the marriage was void. Therefore,
the children could not take up any place in the line of succession.
Being the children of a void marriage, they would not be
legitimate.</hs_para>

place first to reduce the very large number of people who are today the
descendants of George II. In response to the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of
Swynnerton, I just do not know how many consents Her Majesty has given
during the 61 years of her reign. If my memory serves me correctly, I
think I said in Committee that no one seems to have any record of
consent having been refused. I would not like to suggest that
information about how many consents have been given might be available.
The fact is that as each generation comes to bear another generation,
the number of descendants of King George II increases. Indeed, it may
well be that some of them do not know that they are descendants of
George II and may be contracting marriages which are void. That is one
of the principal reasons why we wish to change this, so that the
consequence of failure to get consent or of consent being refused is
not that one’s marriage is void, which has considerable
consequences for the couple concerned and their family, but rather that
the person loses their place in the line of
succession.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031365000060" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130313-0001.htm#13031365000060">As
the House will be aware, I indicated that we believe that the six steps
provide sufficient proximity to the Throne. The noble Baroness, Lady
Hayter, made an important point about consent at marriage: people who
at the time of the consent for their marriage were in the first six may
subsequently no longer be within the first six in line to the Throne,
so the number at any one time who have had to receive consent will
almost certainly be greater than six. If one looks at the 240 years of
history since the Royal Marriages Act 1772 was passed, the
person furthest away from the Throne at the time of marriage who
subsequently ascended the Throne was William IV, who was third in line
to the Throne, so the position as it stands provides twice as many
steps away from the Throne than have ever been necessary in more than
200 years.</hs_para>

account. I, for one, am still not at all convinced by the argument from

we need to provide a balance between militating against a potentially
catastrophic event and the risk of unnecessarily impinging upon the
lives of those who are more distant from the Throne. While it is
reasonable for different rules to apply to the Royal Family, a
requirement to obtain consent to marry is a real restriction on people
and as such a very strong argument should be made to extend it. I have
heard various people say why six is not acceptable. However, I have
heard no reason for 12, with the possible exception that it is the
number of apostles or the number of former pennies in a shilling. It is
also said that it is the number of jurors on a jury, but of course in

and he makes that point well. It is, indeed, as I and the noble
Baroness indicated, an additional requirement and impinges on the lives
of individuals. The Bill is trying to seek that balance. It is not a
question to which there is one, and only one, right answer. As the
noble Lord, Lord Deben, said, it is a matter of judgment. While my
right honourable friend the Deputy Prime Minister would no doubt love
to take credit for everything that has been put into the Bill—he
has ministerial responsibility for constitutional matters and this
legislation—I pay tribute to my right honourable friend the
Prime Minister who, like his predecessor, sought to get agreement with
the other realms and was party to the announcement of the agreement
that was made at Perth. The noble Baroness, Lady Hayter, rightly says
that this was not part of the Perth agreement, but it was flagged up at
the Heads of Government conference in Perth that we would be seeking
changes to the Royal Marriages Act 1772. That was followed by Prime
Ministerial correspondence, on which agreement was reached on the
number
six<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T17:47:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031365000065" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130313-0001.htm#13031365000065">My
noble friend Lord Lang referred to a letter to the noble Lord, Lord
Trefgarne, in which I said that procedural matters would not require
the consent of all the other realms. Indeed, there are procedural 
<?notus-xml column=300?>issues in Clause 3 as to how, for example, the consent has been obtained
and signified. However, substantive matters on the succession to the
Crown—to which I referred in the debate on the previous
amendment and which get into the spirit of the preamble to the Statute
of Westminster Act 1931—would require the agreement of the other
realms. This impinges on the succession to the Crown. Indeed, the New
Zealand legislation, of which I have a copy somewhere here,

earlier amendment moved by my noble friend Lord True. The Government
believe that marriage as stated in Clause 3 of the Succession to the
Crown Bill means marriage as defined by the jurisdiction in which it
takes place. If we take this away from the issue of same sex—to
take away from, as my noble friend Lord True said in moving his
amendment, the controversy that might surround that—different
jurisdictions very often have different rules on marriage. As a simple
example, the age for marriage without parental consent was different
from that in England. If it was a legitimate marriage in the law of

saying. It depends on the jurisdiction of the place where the marriage
is contracted. I believe I am right in saying that under the law of
Canada, same-sex marriage is legitimate. If, therefore, hypothetically
there was a same-sex marriage by someone perhaps well down the line of
succession to the throne in Canada as of today, and that was lawful
under the law of Canada, that would be a marriage. It hat is not a
question of Canadian Ministers giving consent, which might be different
because the law in the United Kingdom is different. There might even be
different laws in the near future between Scotland and England,
depending on the timing of legislation. It is not a question of

is a matter of judgment. I say that quite frankly to the noble Lord,
Lord Deben. The Government believe that six is the appropriate number.
That is what history suggests is necessary. No more than three have
been required in the last 240 years, and there is some added leeway. As
I said, with any legal restriction, 
<?notus-xml column=301?>if we impose a legal restriction we should limit it as far as
possible. While I fully recognise the strength of the arguments that
have been put forward, I have not heard sufficiently strong arguments

necessary to take account of the historical number of places to get to
the throne, and double it up for that matter. I know how strongly my

It would require agreement among the other 15 realms. I will explain
this in detail when we come to a later amendment. I am not introducing
a parliamentary procedure. As I have indicated, New Zealand is, and it
already has a Bill before its Parliament with the number six in it. It

to get across were that that Act was concerned with breaking marriages
but saving the line of succession. The present Bill is the other way
around. It would let the marriages go ahead but would throw in the bar
to succession. That is an important injection of uncertainty that could
lead to certain unintended consequences, which is why I am so keen to

to the age at marriage, which is an improvement on my noble and learned

have had to ask for consent to marry. I could, however, refer to the
example of the Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale, Prince Ernest
Augustus, who was sixth in line to the throne when he married in 1815,
rather than my noble and learned friend’s example of someone who
was third in line. He ended up as King of Hanover in 1837 because, of

the way, I can assure the House emphatically that the Duchess of

<?notus-xml column=305?>lip-reading. It is one of the few things at which I can claim to be an
expert, so I ask noble Lords not to mock me. I have watched the
five-second clip of the incident many times. The Duchess never had her
tongue out of the roof of her mouth. That enabled her to say the
“d” very emphatically. From there she could have gone
either to an “au” sound for “daughter”, a
“u” for “duke”—but she would not use
twee language and say, “I will give it to my
duke”—or to an “o” sound to say that she
would give it to her dog. She brought herself up on the spot because
she realised how hurtful that would be to the kindly donor of the
little dog. She had to change direction, and in order to avoid one
brick she stubbed her toe on another. Unless the Deputy Prime Minister

I said, I have three major concerns. The first is the one that I began
with: namely, that we are putting the Crown in an impossible position.
We expect to receive a delegation of the prerogative of consent, which
I do not believe the Crown is entitled to delegate to us. Secondly,
because of those factors, we should look very closely at the issues of
entrenchment and the laws that are being changed. We have heard that
one Parliament cannot bind another, but this occurs frequently and in
this case it is emphatically there. The third factor is that without
any doubt the Bill, in particular Clause 4, virtually wipes out the Act
of Settlement with Scotland and renders unnecessary a referendum. If
this Bill were passed, Scotland would float off towards the

matter of entrenchment is something that we need to think about very
hard. When my noble friend Lord Marks and I had our dialogue in the
debate at Second Reading, we were misleading each other and were both
under a very big misapprehension. We were talking about alterations to
the declaration of rights. In the half hour the Minister was kind
enough to give me last week to discuss this, he and his team made the
same mistake. The declaration of rights is not the issue here; it is
the Bill of Rights. We are confusing them because of the interregnum.
There was no monarch at the time. Therefore, there was no way that
there could be a Bill leading to an Act, as happens at the moment.
There was a declaration of the complaints of the citizens of this
country, which was answered by a Bill that eventually became an Act.
The Bill of Rights that was presented to William and Mary repeated word
for word the declaration of rights. However, it ended at the word
“accordingly”, whereupon Joe Browne, the Clerk of the
Parliaments, signed his name. A space was left for William to sign, but
in fact he signed a separate piece of vellum that was stitched into the
Bill. This was perhaps the first instance in England of a political
stitch-up<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T18:08:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031365000092" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130313-0002.htm#13031365000092">The

the entrenched law of the land, which we are now proposing
significantly to change. The legal bounds of the Crown’s
authority of governance are breached if the Crown’s
constitutional limitation is exceeded. This defines the point at which
a constitutionally limited monarchy has a duty arising from the
commands of the law and constitution to refuse assent to a measure. If
a measure is demonstrated to require removal of the constitutional law
defining the duty to enforce, it is a breach of that duty, and
constitutionally must be disallowed. We in this House can have no
authority to pass a measure that collides headlong with the existing
rules of our constitution. The limitations of the Crown would need to

Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend
for setting out his concerns. I was grateful to him for taking the time
to elaborate on the rationale for his concerns at a meeting to which he
referred, which we had last week. As I understand it, he has two
particular concerns. The first relates to the coronation oath, which
the sovereign is required to make to maintain the established
Protestant religion. He is concerned that there might in this Bill be
something inconsistent with the coronation oath that Her Majesty swore.
I disagree and I make it clear that we are not amending the provisions
of the Bill of Rights or the Act of Settlement, which say that the
sovereign has to be a Protestant. That was debated under an earlier
amendment. One could conceivably argue that as a result of the Bill
more people might come out of the line of succession, because one of
their parents was a Catholic and the parents intended to bring up the
child as a Catholic, but that is simply not the same thing. Given that
the prohibition on the sovereign being a Catholic remains, there is no
conflict between the Bill and the coronation and accession declaration
oaths. Therefore, I believe that my noble friend’s opening
premise is
wrong.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031375000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130313-0002.htm#13031375000003">I also
disagree with his assertion that the Bill is inconsistent with the oath
that the sovereign has to swear with regard to maintaining Presbyterian
church government in Scotland. I declare an interest as an elder of the
Church of Scotland. As a young student during Her Majesty’s
Silver Jubilee Year in 1977, I sat in the gallery of the General
Assembly when Her Majesty opened it and reaffirmed her coronation oath
with regard to the Church of Scotland. Again, nothing in this Bill in
any way conflicts with the oath that Her Majesty took on her accession,
which she has subsequently reaffirmed.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13031375000004" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130313-0002.htm#13031375000004">My noble friend also
made reference to Scotland, and his amendments very much relate to the
position of Scotland. He seemed to imply that the Bill would somehow
lead to the break-up of the union. In our view there is nothing in this
Bill that conflicts with requirements set out in the Act of Union.
Given that my noble friend’s amendments focus on the territorial
extent of the Bill, it would be helpful to consider that matter as
well. The Crown’s of England and Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland are united by the various Acts of Union. Any changes that the
United Kingdom Parliament makes to the laws of succession will apply
automatically across our United Kingdom. The succession to the Crown is
a reserved matter, as is clearly stated in the Scotland Act 1998, and
the Scottish Parliament would have no competence to pass a resolution
in relation to succession. At least, it would have no legal effect, as
proposed in my noble friend’s amendment. However, the devolved
Administrations were provided with drafts of the Bill ahead of
introduction. Similarly, the Bill applies not only to the UK but to the
Crown dependencies and overseas territories by necessary implication,
following the precedent set by other Acts concerning the sovereign.
Again, Crown dependencies and overseas territories were also
consulted.</hs_para>

for that response. The first of my two amendments is, I agree, improper
because it anticipates a resolution that the Scottish Government cannot

Trefgarne:</Member></B> My Lords, I am concerned—I think that
there was reference to this in the letter that my noble and learned
friend very kindly wrote to me the other day—about the
possibility of different parts of the Bill coming into force at
different times in different parts of the Commonwealth. For example, it
seems possible for one nation to agree that the eldest child of the
sovereign became its head of state and for another nation not to agree,
or at least to delay agreeing—and therefore it might be the
second child of the sovereign who became its head of state. That seems
to be a confusion and complication that we would not wish to see. My
amendment proposes that we should wait until all the nations that want
to agree have agreed, so we avoid that difficulty. My amendment
proposes that the Act will come into force when all the relevant
Commonwealth Parliaments have given their consent to all its
provisions. The word “relevant” relates, of course, to
the fact that some Commonwealth nations do not have our Queen as their
head of state. Therefore, their consent is
irrelevant<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T18:19:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

important point about the simultaneous implementation of these
provisions in all the realms of which Her Majesty is Queen—and
clearly for the right reason, as he gives it. It would not be helpful,
nor would it be the policy intent of any of the realms that have agreed
to this, that there should be divergence between different realms as to
the head of state. Indeed, it is the intention that the effect will be
given once all the realms have done what is necessary before the Bill
is brought into force, as indicated in response to Amendment 5. I noted
the interest that the House has taken as to how changes will be given
effect in the different Commonwealth realms, and I have given an

the established constitutional position of all the members of the

New Zealand Government have co-ordinated this discussion, which

introduction of this Bill and their assurance that, based on the Bill

parliamentary consent was required. Others have been clear that no
further steps are necessary and that the changes will be brought about
by the changes effected by the United Kingdom Government. In our view,
it is in accord with the principle of the Statute of Westminster that
it should be for each realm to decide what, if anything, is necessary
or desirable to give effect to the agreement. Thus, although the
preamble refers to the assent of the Parliaments of the dominions, we
do not believe that it is for the United Kingdom to insist that
parliamentary approval is obtained. I can confirm that in the case of
some realms a referendum is necessary before changes to their
constitution are made. However, we are not aware that any realm intends

Amendments 1 to 9, 11, 14 and 16 all together resolve what has been the
most hotly debated topic of this Bill: whether the adjudicator should
have the power to fine written on to the face of the Bill. As the
Government have said throughout, and as the BIS Select Committee has
also acknowledged, this is an issue that is finely balanced. However,
at Second Reading in another place there was an overwhelming consensus
that fines were necessary. This echoed sentiments expressed in your
Lordships’ House. Accordingly, the Government have listened to
the clearly expressed voice of Parliament and have tabled amendments to
give the adjudicator the power to fine from the
outset.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031365000123" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130313-0002.htm#13031365000123">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T18:28:43"></hs_TimeCode>
would like to make clear that I expect fines to be used as a
last resort, only for the most egregious or repeated offences. However,
the very fact that the adjudicator has the power to impose them will
send a strong message to retailers that compliance with the code is not
optional. I am confident that these changes will mean that the
adjudicator is able to ensure fair play in the food supply
chain and keep the industry growing.</hs_para>

will also benefit the farming industry. While many farmers are unlikely
to be direct suppliers to retailers, and thus formally out of scope of
the groceries supply code of practice, they will still benefit from
increased trust and transparency in the supply chain. 
<?notus-xml column=313?>It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T18:29:50"></hs_TimeCode>
is important to note that the adjudicator’s functions will not
be a panacea for all the difficulties of the farming industry. She
cannot set prices or address pay and conditions, but improved
relationships between direct suppliers and retailers will have
beneficial effects along the entire supply
chain.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031365000125" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130313-0002.htm#13031365000125">There
have been suggestions that the power to impose fines from the outset
would make Britain a less attractive place to do business. I would
respond by saying that, other than retailers, almost all business
groups, including the Federation of Small Businesses, the Food and
Drink Federation and the National Farmers’ Union, support this
amendment. I would further say that for retailers who comply with the
code, an existing legal obligation, there will be absolutely no
additional burden, as fines could only ever be imposed for a breach of
the code. Retailers will also have a full right of appeal on the merits
against the imposition of a fine or its

aspect of these amendments is that they set out the process for
specifying the maximum penalty. This is clearly a critical part of the
power and I consider that it is important that the basis of
determination of the maximum penalty be set out in legislation. Equally
however, simply to insert a maximum into the Bill without consultation
with stakeholders would not be appropriate, and most people would agree
that we would not wish to delay the Bill to allow that consultation to
be carried out. It is our intention that the adjudicator will set out
in her guidance the criteria that she intends to adopt in deciding the
amount of any financial penalty.</hs_para>

guidance will be published in draft form shortly after commencement for
a 12-week consultation period. This will allow stakeholders to express
their views regarding the maximum level of the fine and will allow the
adjudicator to reflect those views in her final recommendation to the
Secretary of State. It would be more appropriate for the adjudicator to
take the lead in recommending the maximum penalty based on the evidence
from the consultation, subject of course to the Secretary of State
making the final decision and to parliamentary
oversight.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031365000128" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130313-0002.htm#13031365000128">It
is therefore essential that consultation be carried out on this matter.
Stakeholders, both retailers and suppliers, deserve to have an input
into this process. Accordingly, the government Commons
Amendments 6 to 9 to Clause 12 require the adjudicator,
alongside the initial consultation on guidance, also to consult
on what the maximum penalty should be or how the maximum
penalty should be calculated and then, via Commons Amendment 5 to
Clause 9, to make a recommendation to the Secretary of State. The
Secretary of State will then be required to establish this maximum by
order. This will ensure that fines can be imposed as soon
as possible.</hs_para>

your Lordships that in Committee in another place the Minister, my
honourable friend Jo Swinson, gave a personal commitment that, barring
extreme matters outside the control of the
Government, the order establishing the amount of
the maximum fine or how that amount will be
determined would be laid within three months of the
adjudicator’s recommendation to the Secretary of
State.</hs_para>

also draw your Lordships’ attention to the fact that Commons
Amendment 11 to Clause 15 allows the Secretary of State to alter by
order the maximum penalty or how the maximum penalty is to be
calculated as a result of the findings of a triennial review. To
clarify, the wording relating to the maximum penalty or how the maximum
penalty is to be determined is used because we envisage that the
Secretary of State could set a maximum either as a specific
amount—X pounds, which would apply as the same fixed maximum for
each retailer—or by reference to a formula, such as X% of a
retailer’s groceries turnover, or the value of relevant supply
agreements. This approach is set out in paragraph 92 of the Explanatory
Notes.</hs_para>

I turn to Amendment 14A on the marshalled list, the new government
amendment to Commons Amendment 14. Amendment 14A has been tabled in
response to a recommendation from your Lordships’
Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee in their 16th report
of this Session. It recommends that the order with which the Secretary
of State will set the maximum level of the fine, or the basis upon
which it should be determined, should be subject to an affirmative
parliamentary resolution rather than through the negative procedure as
currently stated in the Bill.</hs_para>

safeguards on the use of the power; it can be exercised only
after a recommendation from the adjudicator who must first consult
about it. The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee
recognised that this would usefully serve to inform the Secretary of
State’s exercise of the power. However, the committee has
advised that because the upper limit of the penalty is not
in the Bill the power to fix the limits should be subject to a
significant level of parliamentary scrutiny. Amendment 14A will
therefore ensure that the order will be subject to the affirmative
resolution procedure, thereby ensuring that Parliament will be able to
scrutinise and positively approve the order. I beg to

am speaking as the only member of Her Majesty’s opposition.
There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T18:35:18"></hs_TimeCode> is always
cause for pausing to think about legislation per se, but when all three
Front Benches agree, we can be pretty certain that they have not really
thought the matter through—there is no need to and it goes on to
automatic pilot. You can also be pretty certain that there
will be one or two unintended consequences. My starting position would
be, despite my noble friend’s clear and completely
comprehensible explanation—the only sign of grace in it being
the affirmative procedure—that there are already far too many
circumstances in which state functionaries can raise administrative
fines. In this case, the groceries code is working. There are 10
supermarkets in hot competition with each other, and they report on
complaints and how they have been dealt with. So far, there has been no
problem with the speed and accuracy with which these arguments have
been settled.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=315?><hs_para UID="13031379000003" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130313-0002.htm#13031379000003">However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T18:36:42"></hs_TimeCode>,
that is not why we have these fines. It is because it is said that what
is going on now is only the tip of the iceberg due to a climate of
fear, which means that many other things go on that do not get attended
to, and we therefore need a third party to create a triangular
relationship—the adjudicator, who now needs the power to fine.
My problem with that is that I very much doubt whether the climate of
fear, if it exists, will disappear. If it does, and fines are imposed,
one has to question whether it is sensible to put in a state-funded and
mediated procedure involving 10 highly competitive
supermarkets and their suppliers. When we get into that argument,
everyone says, “We understand. We are talking not about
Nestlé or Kellogg but the small and medium-sized suppliers. We
are also”—this is where we come to the heart of the
matter—“talking about the dairy industry”. I fully
accept that that industry has significant problems. This is not the
time to analyse them but I hope that we would have the opportunity to
discuss this issue in much greater depth in this House at an early
date. I hope that my noble friend on the Front Bench will promote the
suggestion that we discuss the dairy industry in some depth and
detail<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T18:38:31"></hs_TimeCode>. The
supermarkets want to sell as much milk, cheese and other products
containing milk as they can. That is their interest. It is not in their
gift to solve the dairy industry’s problems. It is wrong for us,
as a Parliament, to put it about to a certain extent that if you have a
grocery code adjudicator it will be a cure-all for some of the
undoubted problems that exist, not least in the dairy
industry.</hs_para>

view is that because the code works pretty well, the investigations
that come outside the present practices under the code and arrive with
the adjudicator will prove to be intractable or unnecessary. I am
pleased that I am not looking for the adjudicator to be busy. It is a
misapprehension to think that a lot of the things going on out there
will give the adjudicator the opportunity for fruitful investigation
and fining. I am pleased that the order that is to come is to be
affirmative. I guess from what my noble friend said that it should be
with us for debate in about nine months. I hope that we debate it
seriously<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T18:40:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Myners:</Member></B> My Lords, I support the Bill and the amendments
the Minister has presented today. However, I am left pondering that if
we have a situation here where we are concerned about a customer
abusing a supplier, should we also not be alert to the issue in banking
where we have suppliers potentially abusing customers? Should there not
be a similar mechanism in place in which customers of banks, and I
think here particularly of small businesses, have the right to appeal
to an independent adjudicator about the treatment they are receiving
from the banks? It is right that we should be concerned about a
situation of customer abuse but the potential for supplier abuse in the
banking industry, which is even more concentrated than the supermarket
industry, is clearly
higher<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T18:41:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Knight of Weymouth:</Member></B> My Lords, my noble friend Lord Myners
made a similar very interesting point at Second Reading. It was
interesting then and it is interesting now, but it is not a point I am
going to dwell on and he will understand that. I am very sorry to
disappoint the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, that as the lead for Her
Majesty’s Opposition I am not opposing more on this Bill but the
Government have found the right way of doing things. They have taken a
policy that was developed by the previous Labour Government and have
bought it forward in legislation. As the Bill has gone through
Parliament, they have listened to voices, including from Her
Majesty’s Opposition, pressing for the adjudicator to have teeth
from day one with the right to fine. I am delighted that they have
given concessions. Even before the introduction in the House of Lords,
following the BIS Select Committee and pressure from my own party, they
removed the restriction on third parties, such as the National Farmers
Union, from submitting evidence. Then we had a concession from the
Government on powers to fine. We had argued that right from the
outset.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13031379000009" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130313-0002.htm#13031379000009">I am
absolutely delighted and I pay tribute to the Minister, Jo Swinson, and
her colleagues, including the Minister, for listening to the arguments
made in both Houses. I also pay tribute to my colleagues Ian Murray and
Huw Irranca-Davies in the other place for the work they did on this
Bill and take this opportunity to thank the noble Baroness, Lady
Wilcox, for listening to our arguments on accountability when we were
debating this Bill in the Lords. She most graciously conceded the
points so that there will now be an annual report before Parliament. A
final concession with an amendment in the Marshalled List today will
see a move from a negative to an affirmative procedure
around the level of fines. That, too, is extremely welcome.</hs_para>

Government’s approach. I would like to see that repeated in many
other ways across legislation. We are looking forward to the
Queen’s Speech. Perhaps in that we can look forward to the
Government having listened to Labour policy and brought it forward in
legislation, and then listening to the Labour Party and changing things
as they go through. We have not got everything we wanted—we
believe that the code needs to remain a live document. The noble
Viscount, Lord Eccles, made a good point about the possible abuse of
power in the supply chain by Nestlé,
Kellogg and other intermediaries. We have concerns about that.
Commercial pressure and bullying in the supply chain that
can drive down food standards and health and safety remain a concern,
even with the code and this adjudicator. Recent scandals
around horse meat, pressures from the horticulture
industry to abolish the Agricultural Wages Board
and ease immigration rules to drive down the cost of wages
to meet the demands of supermarkets are all evidence that this is an
extremely competitive industry where competition can at
times lead to abusive behaviour.</hs_para>

Earl of Sandwich:</Member></B> Having played a very small part in the
early stages of the Bill, I want to congratulation the Government on
listening. I am not in agreement with the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles.
He knows that. I have listened to many NGOs in the farming community
and I think he underestimates the feeling out there. It is important
that the adjudicator is able to hear from anyone now. It is important
that they can initiate investigations based on their own assessment as
to whether there has been a breach, and it is also important they have
a full set of tools to be able to change retailers’ behaviour.
Retailers can be fined and required to take out a newspaper
advertisement saying they breached the code. The GCA can provide
clarification on how to interpret the code and can recommend changes in
its scope. That is roughly the gist of it. I concur with the noble
Lord, Lord Knight, that the Commons amendments have been just what was
wanted<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T18:46:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

give the adjudicator the power to impose fines from the
outset has always been, as I have said, a finely balanced policy
decision. The BIS Select Committee acknowledged this in its 2011
report. We continue to believe that the sanction of requiring a
retailer to publish information—the so-called name and
shame—will be a powerful one and will suffice in the
great majority of breaches. However, the Government have listened
carefully to the arguments made in your Lordships’ House, at
Second Reading in another place and by third parties that the ability
to fine from the outset would help to give the adjudicator more
teeth.</hs_para>

here, as he has at previous stages in the passage of the Bill. I hope

noble friend talked a bit about the suggestion that there is a climate
of fear. Currently, complaints must be made to the supermarket involved
and, given the purported climate of fear to which he refers and
which has been indentified among suppliers, this
could indeed limit complaints. Very few suppliers would be 
<?notus-xml column=318?>willing to challenge a retailer on which they are likely to be highly
financially dependent. An independent adjudicator to whom suppliers can
complain confidentially is therefore essential to enforcing the
code.</hs_para>

asked about how it could help farmers. The adjudicator has a very
tightly defined remit. She will enforce the Groceries Supply Code of
Practice based strictly on the Competition Commission’s findings
that retailers were transferring excessive risk to their direct
suppliers. She will therefore not be able to set prices for produce.
Similarly, issues arising between farmers and processors will be out of
scope. She can only consider interactions between retailers and their
direct suppliers. It is important to note that most farmers are not
direct suppliers to retailers. Most farm produce tends to be sold to
wholesalers, processors or other intermediaries. However, we are
confident that by reducing the pressure on direct suppliers the
adjudicator will allow them to make longer-term decisions and to
increase innovation and investment, which will benefit the entire
supply chain including farmers.</hs_para>

also naturally concerned about the prices paid by shoppers when they go
to supermarkets, and he said that he would not wish to see the
adjudicator’s work leading to increased costs for hard-pressed
consumers. I reassure him that the retailers themselves, when giving
evidence to the BIS Select Committee, said that the cost of compliance
with the code had not led them to raise the prices paid by consumers.
Ultimately, this is a pro-consumer measure. The Competition
Commission’s 2008 report clearly identified that the supermarket
practices that the adjudicator will confront could have a detrimental
effect on consumers if left
unchecked<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T18:51:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

duty on the part of the adjudicator. Under the existing provisions of
the Enterprise Act, it would then be for the OFT to decide whether to
advise the Competition Commission that a variation of the code was
appropriate by reason of a change of circumstances. However, these

while since this House debated the issue of HIV/AIDS, so let us first
remind ourselves of the scale of the problem. While in the developed
world, where HIV is now a chronic condition, not a death sentence, we
sometimes become blasé about the subject, in much of the world
HIV and AIDS remains a catastrophe. In three decades, AIDS has claimed
30 million souls. Last year, 1.8 million died. More than 34
million people are living with HIV and many of them will
perish. Although new infections have declined by 21% in the past
decade, still 7,400 people are infected each
day.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031379000034" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130313-0002.htm#13031379000034">HIV and
AIDS remains a global health catastrophe—the worst pandemic in
modern history. The good news is the enormous advance in treatment.
Today, there is no reason why anyone receiving it should live any
shorter a life than someone without HIV. Crucially, we also have the
tools radically to slow new infections through education and prevention
measures. However, that ability to prevent the spread of HIV is being
seriously compromised. The Global Commission on HIV and the Law
concluded that,</hs_para>

the heart of international efforts to deal with this pandemic is a
crisis of human rights law, not medicine. There is now overwhelming
evidence of the link between criminalisation of homosexuality and the
rate of HIV

does criminalisation matter? What is the link between bad law and this
public health disaster? The UN Development Programme’s Global
Commission on HIV concluded that criminalisation of homosexuality
“both causes and boosts” the rate of HIV among
men who have sex with men, or MSM. Evidence is
incontrovertible. In Caribbean countries where homosexuality is
criminalised, almost one in four MSM are infected with HIV. In the
absence of such laws, the prevalence is one in 15—a shocking
disparity. A report in <I>The Lancet</I> in 2012 reaffirmed:</hs_para>

stigma and marginalisation. Where this exists, homosexual behaviour is
driven underground. Those at risk do not want to talk about their
sexuality, receive information about prevention or, crucially, get
tested, for to do so may mean prosecution and severe punishment. That
has a terrible impact on homosexual behaviour. As <I>The Lancet</I>
report I just mentioned concluded, where it is impossible for gay men
to found lasting, loving relationships because the law
prohibits it, they adopt non-monogamous, anonymous, unsafe sexual
practices that fuel infection. There is nothing to warn them not to do
so. It is after all almost impossible to mount HIV prevention campaigns
where homosexuality is outlawed. A study in 2010 commissioned by the
UNDP focusing on Asia and the Pacific found that such laws are
regularly used by police to prohibit HIV prevention activities,
confiscate condoms and censor educational material on HIV. Yet as
studies in Cameroon, Senegal and Kenya have found, there is
a strong correlation between the lack of these programmes and the
likelihood of MSM having unprotected sex, simply out of ignorance of
the basic facts.</hs_para>

21 years in prison, the Medical Research Institute had its HIV work
disrupted after church leaders claimed that it was providing
“counselling services to criminals”. There are similar
horror stories from Uganda, Cameroon and Singapore, where health
providers, who are key to preventing the spread of HIV, refuse to do so
because of the threat of dreadful criminal

issue is not one that impacts just on gay men. HIV does not respect
sexual orientation and statute in a neat and tidy manner. Because of
these laws, many homosexuals inevitably maintain
heterosexual relationships alongside a relationship with a man. The
result is that innocent wives and children, often blissfully unaware of
the fate that awaits them, also die as a result of criminalisation. So
let us be very clear: criminalisation of homosexuality kills. It kills
gay men. It kills women and children, and it kills them
needlessly in their tens of thousands, with no end to this in sight. It
begets a grotesque waste of human life on an unimaginable scale. Of
course, criminalisation is an issue of fundamental human
rights—one that I, as a gay man, feel profoundly. But it is
also, overwhelmingly, an issue of public health. In the name of saving
lives, it has to end.</hs_para>

Commonwealth countries stand in the dock. As we heard last October in a
debate led by my noble friend Lord Lexden, their record on
criminalising homosexual behaviour is shameful: 42 out of 54
Commonwealth countries criminalise same-sex relations. Punishments
range from life in Sierra Leone to 20 years in prison, with flogging,
in Malaysia. The record of the Commonwealth on HIV and AIDS is a pitch
perfect underlining of my argument. While the Commonwealth represents
30% of the world’s population, it contains more than 60% of
people living with HIV globally. That is a damning
statistic. We will 
<?notus-xml column=323?>never be able to tackle the global AIDS epidemic until

point was rightly recognised by the Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group,
which in 2011 concluded that decriminalisation had been successful in
reducing cases of HIV infection and recommended that steps be taken to
procure repeal of these laws. But, in the interest of saving human
lives, words need to be met with action. Let me suggest some. There are
some things that this House can do. Our committees can play a vital
role by providing oversight of Commonwealth institutions and
scrutinising progress made by the UK in delivering its LGBT rights
strategy. There are things that the Church of England, which has great
sway in the Commonwealth, can do by condemning criminalisation
specifically because of the way it squanders human life. I am delighted
to see the right reverend Prelate here this evening.</hs_para>

done a great deal and I applaud the work of DfID and the leadership of
the Prime Minister. I also recognise the enormous personal commitment
of my noble friend Lady Northover, but there is more. The UK needs
actively to support legal reform across the Commonwealth—an
issue that should also be a high priority for CHOGM later this year. I
ask my noble friend for an assurance that we will press to make this
happen. I hope that the Government might also make decriminalisation

DfID.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031379000042" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130313-0002.htm#13031379000042">The

these institutions, which could play a vital role here. I also hope

time, could make the difference between life and death for many who are
alive now but sick or at risk, and many yet to be born. This is one of
those occasions and I am sure that we will rise to

Gould of Potternewton:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord,
Lord Black, for introducing such an important debate. As he says, it is
the sort of issue that

of the British Empire legacy to Commonwealth states 150 years ago was
our then legal system, which we passed on and which regrettably
included the old colonial draconian laws on homosexuality. These laws
were not repealed when the former colonies won their independence, and
they continued to ban gay sex between consenting adults. A consequence
has been that the Commonwealth countries make up 30% of the
world’s population but 60% of the level of HIV. It is
interesting that the countries that were colonised by France under the
Napoleonic code, which does not concern itself with homosexuality, do
not have anti-gay laws or high levels of HIV. In the Commonwealth
countries, however, laws are myriad, and with them come violence,
murder, fear, stigma, rejection, impunity, the criminalisation of
identity and persecutions. As the noble Lord, Lord Black, says, of the
Commonwealth countries, 42 still criminalise same-sex relationships for
men, women or both, with dire penalties. I find it unbelievable that
the situation is getting no better. In fact, in some countries, it is
getting
worse<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T19:08:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031379000046" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130313-0002.htm#13031379000046">If
I may, I shall repeat some of the horror stories because the more often
they are told the more people might listen. In Uganda, the
anti-homosexuality Bill is repeatedly brought forward to impose the
death penalty for men living with HIV. In Zambia, the maximum penalty
has been increased from 10 years to 15 years in prison. Penalties in
Trinidad and Tobago include 25 years in jail, and there is
legislation to ban the entry into the country of known homosexuals. In
Malaysia, the penalty is 20 years and flogging. In Malawi, there are
prison terms of up to 14 years hard labour. And there is life
imprisonment in Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Bangladesh, and Pakistan, which
also imposes imprisonment for private same-sex
intimacy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031379000047" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130313-0002.htm#13031379000047">These
so-called civilised countries defend these criminal sanctions as an
authentic expression of indigenous national culture and tradition: that
they are breaches of public morality, public health issues and sexual
normality. But those conditions do not apply to the 12
Commonwealth countries that currently do not criminalise same-sex acts.
It is encouraging that some of those countries also have laws that
protect LGBT people from hate crimes and prohibit discrimination
against them. Botswana, for instance, amended its Employment Act in
2010 to prohibit discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation.
There is no question that legal penalties for homosexuality encourage
public persecution. In Jamaica, gay men are so hideously and violently
socially persecuted that many countries now accept gay asylum seekers
from Jamaica into their own
countries.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031379000048" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130313-0002.htm#13031379000048">Again,
in Uganda, tabloid newspapers have conducted witch hunts naming gay men
and encouraging violence against them. In both those countries, the
result was gay men being killed. All this shows that obstructive
legislation contributes to the inability of HIV sufferers to claim
their rights and increases the level of HIV stigma and discrimination.

At the same time, the Commonwealth Secretariat—again, as the

not the only people who suffer because of their sexuality. Illegality
is also likely to be extended to transgender people and sex workers,
who are similarly marginalised, hard to reach and often subject to
legal sanctions. For instance, the high prevalence of HIV in Africa is
driven by cultural, religious and political unwillingness to accept
LGBT people, so the prejudice, harassment and isolation means lack of
access to HIV prevention, including the availability of

is a particular problem for transgender women because their identity as
women is not recognised in many Commonwealth countries. Denial of their
gender identity in law exacerbates the discrimination and

targets of violent hate crimes, are denied healthcare and education and
struggle to find employment, so they are forced into sex work, all of
which increases their HIV

same theme as the noble Lord, Lord Black. How should the UK exert its
influence? What should we be doing? The UK should actively support
legal reform that decriminalised consensual sex between adults of the

orientation and gender identity. We should be calling for targets on
law reform and equality in the post-2015 development framework as a
means to ensuring access to health and other services for LGBT people

providing a more critical oversight of the Commonwealth institutions

the spread of HIV and AIDS in the LGBT community has devastated lives
around the world, this evening I would like to focus on Zambia, which

prevention can be effective, but also the ways in which it can fail.
Zambia is one of the nations hit hardest by the HIV and AIDS epidemics

average life expectancy has dropped to a mere 49
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-03-13T19:19:11"></hs_TimeCode>. Although
hit hard by this disease, the Zambians rallied to become one of the
most willing African nations to confront the epidemics by the start of
the millennium. In 2004, President Mwanawasa declared HIV and AIDS a
national emergency, promising to provide antiretroviral drugs to 10,000
people by the end of the year. Not only did the President meet this
goal, but he exceeded it, and promised to provide the drugs for an
additional 10,000 people by the end of 2005. Former President Kaunda,
who in the 1980s attempted to cover up the magnitude of the AIDS
epidemic, is now one of Zambia’s foremost AIDS activists. In
2008, UNAIDS reported that the epidemic in the region was
stabilising.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031379000060" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130313-0002.htm#13031379000060">Political

years in prison. Cultural attitudes express widespread disapproval of
homosexuality. In a 2008 survey by the Pew Research Center, the number
of respondents who indicated that they felt homosexuality was morally

through the Government. However, the policies remain unchanged and,
sadly, so does the state of the virus. Although Zambia continues to
receive millions of pounds in international aid, the prevalence of the
virus has not dropped significantly since it stabilised in 2008. If
through this debate your Lordships’ House continues to take the
view, which I hope our Government will continue to take, that one of
our foremost priorities in the world is to stop the spread of HIV and

Lords may remember that it was almost 50 years ago now, in
1967, that the then Archbishop of Canterbury, Michael Ramsey, spoke in
this House to support the decriminalisation of homosexuality in this
country. We sometimes underestimate how brave a stance that was from
him at that time. By doing so, he made the distinction in British law
between a moral and a criminal matter. One of the problems today is
that no such distinction has been made in many parts of the
Commonwealth and, as a result of criminalisation, people continue to
suffer terrible abuse—sometimes death—and the scourge of
HIV/AIDS continues unchecked. Indeed, as the noble Baroness, Lady

increase in stigmatisation, discrimination and criminalisation, which

churches in general, and the Anglican communion in particular, are

value and indeed treasure our links with particular dioceses around the
Anglican communion. In my case, over the past dozen years or more, that

concealing their identity, that is wrong. If criminalisation leads to
many living in fear, that is wrong. If criminalisation leads to the
prospect of persecution, arrest, detention and death, that is wrong. If
criminalisation means that LGBT people dare not turn to the state when

noble friend reminded us in his powerful speech, this House has debated
HIV/AIDS from time to time, most recently on the initiative of our
noble friend Lord Fowler, whose continuing interest and commitment took
him recently to Uganda. It is a matter of great regret that
he cannot be with us this evening. Last October I opened a debate, to
which kind reference has already been made, on the criminalisation of
homosexuality, which, shockingly, remains widespread in the developing

debate brings those two grave issues together. They are by common
consent among the most important challenges confronting the world
today. My noble friend Lord Black has shown conclusively that the
spread of HIV/AIDS and the retention of harsh criminal punishments for
homosexual conduct are inextricably linked. As my noble friend reminded
us, after a detailed inquiry the UN Development
Programme’s Global Commission on HIV and the Law found that
criminalisation of homosexuality “both causes and boosts”
HIV among men who engage in sexual activity with other men.</hs_para>

records of most Commonwealth countries—which in so many respects
are our closest associates and most valuable friends—testify
with particular bleakness to the malign link between criminalisation
and HIV/AIDS. Sadly, the majority of Commonwealth countries defy
international human rights obligations by treating homosexuals as
criminals; as a result, those countries suffer disproportionately from
the incidence of HIV. The Commonwealth contains some 30% of the

this House and of our country. During the past 20 years the situation
for lesbian, gay and bisexual people in Britain has changed
significantly. I am also proud that much of that progress was made

and AIDS epidemic. No longer a death sentence, HIV is now a long-term
chronic condition. Britain can rightly claim to be a beacon to the

against HIV and AIDS. However, domestic progress is not enough. If we

beyond our borders.

led and should continue to lead the EU and the wider international
community in ensuring that the rights of LGBTI people are recognised

as we have heard in all the examples cited in the debate, progress in
our country is not reflected in many parts of the world. Same-sex
sexual conduct between consenting adults continues to be criminalised
in more than 80 jurisdictions in the world, and 42 of the 54 countries
of the Commonwealth of Nations criminalise same-sex relations for men,
women or both. A lot of these laws, as we have heard, are a
hangover from British colonial rule. While they remain on the statute
book, they have a continuing impact of fear, stigma, rejection,
violence and, far too often, murder.</hs_para>

systematic persecution and criminalisation of identity can also
decimate efforts to halt the spread of HIV. It often results in gay
people not being able to access the healthcare, education and
employment that they need, preventing access to HIV testing and
treatment. A global online survey of 5,000 men who have sex with men
found that only 36% were able easily to access treatment and that less
than a third had easy access to HIV education

we have heard, men who have sex with men have a significantly
heightened risk of HIV infection. They are 19 times more likely to be
infected with HIV than other adult men. Criminalisation of homosexual
activities both causes and boosts those numbers. As we heard from the
noble Lord, Lord Black, UNAIDS reports that in the Caribbean countries
where homosexuality is criminalised, almost one in four men who have
sex with men is infected with HIV. In the absence of such 
<?notus-xml column=334?>criminal laws, the prevalence is only 1 in 15 among men who have sex
with men. As my noble friend Lady Gould said, Commonwealth countries
comprise more than 60% of people living with HIV globally, despite
representing about 30% of the world’s population. As we have
heard, a recent meeting of the Commonwealth Foreign Affairs Ministers
adopted a recommendation proposed by the Eminent Persons Group within
the Commonwealth to tackle laws that undermine effective responses to
HIV. As the right reverend Prelate said, the signing of the new

whether the vague terms of the charter against discrimination based on

those local gay rights movements can emerge. May I ask the Minister

Northover:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, thank my noble friend Lord
Black for introducing so effectively this important debate on the
stigma and discrimination facing gay men and women in Commonwealth
countries, and the additional stigma of HIV/AIDS. My noble friend Lord
Black makes clear that the criminalisation of homosexuality in 42
Commonwealth countries can indeed lead to death, possibly not only of
the person in question but of partners and children. We are reminded,
both by him and the noble Baroness, Lady Gould, and others that the
laws that criminalise are a colonial legacy. We heard a powerful
account from my noble friend Lady Brinton about the situation in
Zambia, where homosexuality is criminalised and where families and
communities take severe measures to “cure” homosexuals of
their apparent illness.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13031379000099" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130313-0002.htm#13031379000099">Homosexuality is
criminalised and homosexuals suffer terrible discrimination. Those with
HIV also suffer discrimination. As my noble friend Lord Lexden said, we
have here two grave issues—and they can be literally grave. It
is appalling that HIV-related stigma and discrimination in the family,
community and workplace is still so widespread around the world and in
the Commonwealth. Unless stigma and discrimination are addressed, as
the noble Baroness, Lady Gould, and others said, we will not meet our
global commitment to halt and reverse the spread of HIV. The noble
Lord, Lord Collins, outlined the particular risk in the Caribbean and
elsewhere. Our response cannot neglect these populations who are most
marginalised and today I hope to highlight areas where the UK
Government will do
more.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031379000100" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130313-0002.htm#13031379000100">Legal
barriers create a climate of fear that prevents people accessing the
prevention, treatment and care they need. In many countries, including
many Commonwealth countries, rather than providing protection, as we
have heard, the law—and the law of the street—dehumanise
sex workers, men who have sex with men, people who use drugs,
transgender people, prisoners and migrants. This drives these key
populations underground and hinders their access to information and
services, which in turn promotes risky behaviour that makes them even
more vulnerable to HIV infection and fuels the epidemic
further.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13031379000101" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130313-0002.htm#13031379000101">In
defiance of international human rights standards, 78 countries, half of
them in the Commonwealth, make same-sex sexual activity a criminal
offence, as we have heard. When we have specific concerns about a
government's failure to protect its citizens’ rights—for
example, through the persecution of lesbian, gay, bisexual 
<?notus-xml column=336?>and transgender people—we raise these directly at the highest
levels of the Government concerned. My noble friend Lord Black asked
whether the UK Government will make decriminalisation a stated policy
commitment for the FCO and DfID. The UK’s LGBT action plan
includes an international commitment to advocate changing
discriminatory practices and laws that criminalise homosexuality and
same-sex behaviour, and to work with international institutions to
oppose the introduction of new anti-homosexual legislation. We work
with our embassies and high commissions and through
international organisations, including the UN, the Council of Europe
and the Commonwealth, to promote tolerance and non-discrimination and
to address discriminatory laws, in particular those that criminalise
homosexuality.</hs_para>

and its networks as a potentially valuable partner in protecting and
promoting human rights globally. However, the rights of homosexual men
and women remain a very difficult and controversial issue in the
Commonwealth. Like the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Newcastle
and others, I am delighted with the positive outcomes from
the Commonwealth Foreign Affairs Ministers’ meeting in New York
last September, including agreement on the outstanding recommendations
of the Eminent Persons Group, now reflected in the Commonwealth charter
signed by Her Majesty the Queen on Monday on Commonwealth Day. This
sets out the Commonwealth’s core values and aspirations,
including that discriminatory laws that impede access to HIV treatment
should be addressed. Protecting human rights is a core value of this
unique organisation and endorsement of the charter reiterates its
commitment to opposing all forms of discrimination on any
grounds.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13031379000103" url="/pa/ld201213/ldhansrd/text/130313-0002.htm#13031379000103">I

is worth emphasising those, because I urge noble Lords to take heart
from these words. They are the words that citizens can use to hold
their Governments to account; and for countries to hold other countries
to account. As my noble friend Lord Lexden will know, international
human rights may seem to make slow progress historically, but it is
often through these statements that gradually things move
forward.</hs_parafo>

Black asked why the Commonwealth Secretariat has not included LGBT
rights, legal reform or HIV in its new strategy. The draft Commonwealth
Secretariat’s strategic plan is quite high-level and does not go
into much detail about proposed activities. It foresees a role in
health, human rights and justice, which are all relevant here. We will
continue to work with the secretariat and the foundation to see what
more they could do in this important area. To address a question from
the noble Lord, Lord Watson, we in the UK do not ourselves set the
agenda for the CHOGM, but we will continue to raise these issues in
Commonwealth fora. It is extremely important that countries have signed
up to the language that I have just cited.</hs_para>

hardly need to draw noble Lords’ attention to the fact that
policies, programmes and resources for HIV for key populations are
grossly inadequate, despite the growing infection rates in the groups
that we have talked about. For example, in 2009, only 18% of countries
had established HIV prevention goals for reaching men who have sex with

why, in the Government’s position paper on HIV in the developing

committed to build on our track record as a voice for a public health

noble Baroness, Lady Gould—to the key populations affected by
HIV that respects human rights and addresses stigma and discrimination.

could draw on many examples to demonstrate DfID’s support, which
echoes the approach that we have taken in the Department of Health
within the United Kingdom. I shall mention three. The Global Network of
People Living with HIV has been conducting policy research in South
Africa on the criminalisation of LGBT. The Global Forum for Men who
Have Sex with Men is engaging in international policy dialogue to
promote laws, regulations and policies that improve HIV prevention
programmes for men who have sex with men. I hope that my noble friend
Lord Black and others will be pleased that, last July, my right
honourable friend the Minister of State for International Development,
Alan Duncan, announced new resources for the Robert Carr fund to
support global and regional networks to improve HIV responses reaching
key populations, and this new funding is being disbursed.</hs_para>

Black asked whether the UK Government will consider introducing a
specific funding mechanism for LGBT organisations working for legal or
social reform in those countries. The UK funds a number of programmes
in that area. For example, 
<?notus-xml column=338?>21% of the networks that the Robert Carr fund, to which I just referred,
is supporting involve work for legal or social reform in those
countries, so that is being addressed. My noble friend Lady Brinton

through social media. She is surely right about that; there are a

very pleased that NGOs feel that it is a world reference and that the

remains a strong and reliable supporter of the global fund. I am
writing to my noble friend Lord Fowler with an update on the situation

something of a difficult time, but the United Kingdom is on track to

is clearly critical in all our support for local civil
society organisations to empower those most at risk from HIV, so that
they understand and can advocate for their rights, and to
challenge HIV-related discrimination and criminalisation. Without
grass-roots support to tackle legal barriers that hamper the HIV
response, and without the ability to hold Governments to account,
change will not be sustained. People living with or directly affected
by HIV understand their needs better than anyone. Involving those
communities is not just their right; it is essential to an effective
