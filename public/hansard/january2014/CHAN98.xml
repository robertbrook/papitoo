naturally nervous whenever there is a change of management or
leadership in any school and so they should be—they care about
their children. The evidence points to the fact that when primary and
secondary schools have been converted to academies, they have made
significant improvements. One of the most controversial academy
conversions happened in Haringey when Downhills school was taken over
by the Harris chain. That met furious opposition from the unions and
some Labour MPs, but children in that school are now flourishing at

know that I answered the question that he has just asked first time
round. I pointed out that the advice from officials was to open the

Science academy and to back Al-Madinah school. In all three examples,
we took the advice of officials, but let me make it clear that it is
entirely appropriate for Ministers to overrule officials at any given
point. Officials advise and Ministers decide. But in these three cases,
we took the advice of officials and appropriate safeguards were in
place. One of the problems that Opposition Front Benchers have is that
they support free schools in the abstract, but when it comes to the

languages at GCSE, and we expect that to feed through to A-level. From

Poland, which have improved their programme for international student
assessment— PISA—scores, all students do a core of
academic subjects, including languages, sciences, history and

Some of our teachers recently went to Shanghai to see how maths is
taught there, and they found that Shanghai is three years ahead of
England in this regard. One thing they noticed was that the chunking
method is not used in Shanghai—long division is used instead.
When those teachers brought that back to England, pupils said,
“This method is great. Why aren’t we doing this? This
long division is much easier than the confusing strategies we have been
taught.” So I can say that when we introduce the standard
assessment tests with the new national curriculum, chunking will not be
rewarded in method marks—long division

December saw a number of rain bands crossing the country in quick
succession, accompanied by strong winds. Their cumulative effect meant
that, by the start of Christmas week, the ground was saturated and
river levels were high. On 23 and 24 December, there was widespread
rainfall across the entire country—there was more than 100 mm on
Dartmoor, 90 mm in Cumbria, and 70 mm in parts of the

band of rain was accompanied by gusts of up to 90 mph in southern
coastal areas. The strong onshore winds and large waves, combined with
high spring tides, led to a surge that brought coastal flooding to
parts of the south and west coasts. Further bands of rain moved across
the country over the subsequent week and into the new year. The latest
rainfall is still working its way down some of the slower-responding
rivers, such as the Thames, and more rain is expected this week. There

Paterson:</Member></B> I will tell the hon. Lady; the chronology is
very simple. I met her former colleague, the noble Lord Smith, at a
tremendous flood scheme in Nottingham, where £45 million had
been spent, protecting about 12,000 properties. What was really
revealing was not only the 8:1 gain on the properties protected, as she
mentioned, but the huge gain in land on the far side of the river that
had been blighted for decades. So there is no stronger enthusiast in
this House for flood detection schemes than me. I agree with Lord Smith
that if we had a programme of projects that we could press on with
rapidly, I would do my best to get money from my colleagues in central
Government. <I>[Interruption.] </I>All those Opposition Members
chuntering have to get back to some pretty basic figures. When we came
into office in 2010, this country was borrowing over £300,000 a
minute, and we had to take some pretty difficult decisions. In the
light of that and the dire economic circumstances, reductions in
revenue inevitably had to be made. Following my meetings with the noble
Lord Smith, we got an extra £120 million for capital and have
consolidated that into an extended scheme that will see 165,000
properties protected up to 2015. What is absolutely
unprecedented is our clear programme of a further £2.3 billion
up to 2021 to protect a further 300,000 properties. For all the blather
from the Opposition, the simple question for the hon. Lady is
whether she will nod now and say that the Labour party will go along
with our proposal to spend £2.3 billion on capital up until
2021. Mr Speaker and colleagues, it is very

Gentleman’s comments, but I honestly have to disagree. I have
been to see people from the Environment Agency on the ground. Last week
I was in Addington, where they were manning the control centre. Only
this morning, I was near Maidenhead looking at the Jubilee river, in
absolute pouring rain. Those guys have been working all over Christmas
and their morale was absolutely tremendous. They are, quite rightly,
really proud of what they have done. They have worked their guts out
under very difficult conditions, and they have delivered. We estimate
that approximately 1 million households are protected through the work
of the Environment Agency and all those working in local councils. I am
always struck by the real spirit among people in the Environment Agency
and their determination to deliver, whatever the conditions. That also
goes back to what happened at the beginning of January, when they were
working overnight filling breaches on the east coast.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T16:29:17"></hs_TimeCode> have the

a long time, and I do not like disagreeing with him, but on this

the Member for Garston and Halewood (Maria Eagle) and others, figures
from the 2010 spending review show clearly that central Government
spending on flood defences has reduced in real terms—in some
cases by up to 20%—compared with, as shown in official
documents, the increase of 75% in flood defence spending between 1997
and 2010. The Government have tried to shift the responsibility for
investment and financial risk to individuals and communities. In the
light of the devastation to individuals, families and communities as a
result of the most recent flood, and given that, according to the Prime
Minister, politics is about decision making, does the Secretary of
State regret any decisions he has made during this
time?</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-06?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_06_PT_1/09BBA5D90FAF802F53D6B4035A9D348E573C7E5F" __version__="1.8"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="6 January 2014">Monday

what we want to examine. We need to get the system sorted out so that
it is much more homogeneous and uniform, but let us get it in

the Secretary of State said in his statement, the performance of some
utilities and local authorities left room for improvement. Where those
few councils and utilities have performed badly, almost by definition
it will have been because of bad decisions made, usually, by highly
paid chief executives. Will the Secretary of State host a meeting,
together with other Government Departments, and invite the 10
worst-performing and the 10 best-performing utilities and local

as a matter of course that there were statements on such matters, and
generally speaking—if memory serves me correctly—that has
continued to be so, with one or two exceptions. Those exceptions have
sometimes been a cause of some concern to right hon. and hon. Members,
and we no longer have the debate in advance of the European Council
because the Government judge—which they are perfectly entitled
to do—that that should come out of the allocation of time for
the Backbench Business Committee. It seems a pity if there is no
statement after a European Council meeting, but there are various means
by which Members can try to pose questions on such matters orally, and
get answers, and each case must be considered on its merits. The hon.

inadvertently to mislead the House. He said that the figures I quoted
in my question to him a few moments ago were wrong, but they were
provided by a previous Minister in that Department, the hon. Member for
Newbury (Richard Benyon), in answer to a parliamentary question on
9 September 2013. Either the Secretary of State was wrong to
say what he said, or the written parliamentary answer given by the hon.

they would or should do. I think that in a reasonable world—and
I think the Welsh Government are very reasonable people—they
would be highly unlikely to turn the off taps, but they might be able
to reverse what I described earlier as a patent injustice. What might
the Welsh Government do with legislative competence up to the border?

As I said, the agreement with Severn Trent predates privatisation, and
the amount of money that changes hands is, I think, nominal. I have to
confess that I do not know precisely how much it is, but my hon. Friend
the Member for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (Jonathan Edwards) has
referred in the past to a very 
<?notus-xml column=54?>small amount of money changing hands, which has only a
marginal effect on what Welsh Water is able to achieve. I would also
point out that what it achieves by being a not-for-distributive-profits
organisation is enormously greater than any money it might get from
Severn Trent.</hs_Para>

could well be a growth business in Wales as in England. From what he
says, it seems to me that any water abstracted from Dwr Cymru’s

water. If it wanted to do so, Dwr Cymru could charge quite a high price
for what is a very valuable resource.</hs_Para>

Williams:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman makes a fine point. That
would be the case if, say, Northumbrian Water sells to Yorkshire Water:
there are different prices in different parts of the country, depending
on the economics of the transport of water. The moot point about water
is that it is in some ways a transport business rather than a water
supply business, because water is extremely heavy and difficult to move
about. It would be a matter of negotiation. As I pointed out, however,
Welsh Water does not have control of some of the more significant water
resources in Wales—the water sources in mid-Wales. Incidentally,
I do not want to stray from the water industry, Madam Deputy Speaker,
but fracking might take place in south Wales and possibly not in
north-west Wales—the part I represent. Someone has to say that,

New clause 2 and amendment 12 have been tabled in my name and those of

clause 2 specifically considers the possibility of allowing a retail
exit. It would empower the Secretary of State to make provision
by regulation for the transfer of an undertaker’s assets and
liabilities associated with its non-household retail business into a
separate company. Regulations would be made in the normal way by
statutory instrument and would make provision for any transfer to be
subject to the approval of the Secretary of State and such safeguards

clause 2 and amendment 12 would simply recognise that impact and allow
companies to function in what would be considered a normal competitive
market. An<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T17:24:16"></hs_TimeCode> exit

for the Bill to include an exit route.</hs_Para>

hear of many entrants, but obviously, until the law is in place, it is

suggest that if existing companies are unable to compete with new
entrants who want to come in for very good reasons and lose customers
as a result, it makes sense to allow an exit strategy. I personally
feel that we heard no compelling evidence during the pre-legislative
scrutiny of the draft Bill and during our consideration of the water
White Paper to suggest that the reform should not include a retail exit
strategy. That is why we feel honour bound to come forward for the sake
the Bill’s
completeness<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T17:23:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010614000073" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0002.htm#14010614000073">New
clause 2 would give all undertakers the power but not the obligation to
transfer their non-household retail business to a different company. It
would give the Secretary of State the power to make any such transfer
subject to approval and any necessary safeguards to ensure an orderly
exit from the market. I hope that the House will be able to support the
proposals because much of the Bill is silent on these matters and we
want to use the new clause and amendment to give it more
teeth<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T17:24:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

several arguments in favour of allowing such a retail exit. For
example, an exit clause is needed to allow the market to function
normally and competitively. Additionally, a company should be able to
organise its business in the way it considers best in the interests of
its customers and shareholders. An exit clause would facilitate new
entrants, especially larger ones, into the water and sewerage retail
market because they would not need to win one contract at a time.
Without new clause 2, I understand that economies of scale would work
against new entrants and either prevent them from entering the market
or, at the very least, reduce the benefits that they could provide to
new customers due to higher costs of entry. I hope that my hon. Friend
the Minister agrees that the proposal is helpful and that he
will be minded to accept it. It would not be in the interest of
companies or their customers to force companies to stay in a market in
which they have few or no
customers<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T17:25:40"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T17:25:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010614000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0002.htm#14010614000075">The
general thrust of the new clause goes to the heart of this group of
amendments dealing with the regime of the water industry. We
should learn from what has happened in Scotland. I understand that
DEFRA has stated that it intends to create a market in which access is
regulated—in other words, with the rules of entry clearly set
out and adhered to by all market participants. The reverse side of the
coin is that if the rules of entry are to be set out, the House would,
I am sure, want rules of orderly exit to be set out. I am not saying
that exit would happen in many cases, but it is important that such
rules are on the statute

our pre-legislative scrutiny, we said that as much detail as possible
should be set out in the Bill so that the House could consider it. It
is wrong—I part company from my hon. Friend the Minister in
this respect —to leave too much to regulations, given
that many of us with a great interest in this subject will not be
selected to serve on the Delegated Legislation Committees that consider
them. As the Bill does not provide for retail exit, the strategy is too
open. It could be argued that the Government’s approach is based
on the premise that parties in the retail market should be left to
negotiate among themselves about matters such as service and price, but
that could be set out in the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T17:27:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010614000077" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0002.htm#14010614000077">Considerations
of price, service levels and the ability to respond to difficulties go
to the heart of why is it important to have a competitive market in
England, as has been achieved in Scotland. There must be a way of
policing a situation in which incumbents are simply slow in responding
to requests for information or services from new entrants. It is
important not only to facilitate the path for new entrants, but to
allow for an exit strategy and to bring about a competitive market. The
Bill is completing its remaining stages in the House today, but little
is known about upstream competition. The Government are asking that we
take an awful lot on trust, but it would be better if the Bill provided
for a definite exit strategy, which is why I commend new clause 2 and
amendment 12 to the House.</hs_Para>

should produce a report that examines some of the key issues affecting
the water supply industry and the consumer. I am talking here about the
cost of water to the consumer, the number of disconnections that took
place during privatisation—although that is no longer allowed
under the Ofwat regulations—the purity of water
supplies, the leakages, the levels of investment, the profits and the
dividends paid to shareholders, management remuneration, the levels of
taxation, particularly taxation avoidance, by the water companies and
also their adherence to employment, human rights and environmental
practices across the world. I say that because the water industry is
second only to the energy industry in ripping off the British public.
Since privatisation, the water companies have stolen from the average
consumer of water in this country. The Government need to expose that
in a comprehensive assessment, which this House can debate, before we
consider the future structure of the water industry.</hs_Para>

me go through some statistics showing what has happened since
privatisation. Since 1989, real water bills have risen 50%. Since 2005,
there has been a 35% nominal increase and a 7% real increase in bills.
Since 2010, bills have gone up by more than 12.5%. At the same time,
individual family incomes have gone down by 5%. It is interesting to
see where the money has gone. Most of it has gone into paying
interest charges on water company debts or dividends to
their owners and shareholders. Interestingly, most of those owners and
shareholders are now overseas.</hs_Para>

performance of the companies has not really matched the rise in
payments. I looked at, for example, the issue of leakages. A great deal
has been said about the investment in the infrastructure of the water
industry since privatisation. I represent a constituency that is served
by Thames Water, which continues to lose up to a third of its water in
leakages every year.

Thatcher Government’s original privatisation—well, it was
not the stated intention. Privatisation was meant to reduce prices,
increase investment and make the industry more accountable to the wider

accountable through shareholding, because most of the companies that
now own British water are owned by overseas shareholders. It does not
make it any more efficient for the consumer, because prices have gone

Watch has produced an excellent report on some of those issues. It
reports that six UK water companies took high-interest loans from their

as it paid 11% on just over £1 billion of loans it had taken
from its owner, the Cheung Kong group, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate

world’s ninth-richest person—we are making him so. This

when their next water bills come through the door; they will be
extremely angry. I urge that we look sensibly at the not-for-profit
model that is operating in Wales, because on that basis people can at

for Skipton and Ripon, despite paying out hundreds of millions of
pounds to investors, Yorkshire Water has paid next to nothing in
corporation tax over the past few years. I am not singling out
Yorkshire Water in particular—it is clear that its behaviour is
no better or worse than that of any of its competitors. The problem
lies with the culture of water companies themselves. They have behaved
in an unacceptable manner towards their customers for too many years.
It is clear that they have come to regard customers as nothing more
than cash cows, and many have paid little or no attention to customer
complaints. That is why we believe it is in the interests of
hard-pressed customers that the industry be subjected to greater
scrutiny<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T17:51:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010614000116" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0002.htm#14010614000116">New
clause 11 in particular shines a light on the opaque world of the
companies’ financial and business practices. This is not an
unreasonable or overly bureaucratic requirement. For many years, water
companies voluntarily produced reports such as those that the new
clause would require of them; yet, strangely, in recent years they seem
to have got out of the habit of providing that information to
customers, the regulator and the
Department<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T17:51:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010614000117" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0002.htm#14010614000117">It
is also worth noting, before the Minister replies, that Ofwat’s
Scottish counterpart, the Water Industry Commission for Scotland,
requires Scottish Water to 
<?notus-xml column=64?>produce the relevant information on an annual basis. Therefore, we
believe that this is not an onerous or bureaucratic

clause 12 would require Ofwat to pay far more attention to the problem
of affordability of bills. I am conscious that we will have a wider
debate about affordability when we discuss the second group of
amendments, but Ofwat’s current interpretation of its role as an
economic regulator is far too narrow. Both household and business
customers feel that they are an afterthought, and the new clause makes
it clear that Ofwat must have due regard to the cost of bills when
setting the prices in future review

me be clear: we want to see a successful retail market. The Bill sets a
framework for new entrant retailers to enter the market on an equal
footing with the retailers of the incumbent water companies. Our
opposition to a provision about retail exit has nothing to do with
supporting the position of incumbent water companies; we expect Ofwat

how entrants to the market in Scotland have had to win business unless
an existing licensee surrenders its licence or has it withdrawn. In

commentators have painted a picture of an incumbent water company being
left without any customers, because all of them are lost to their
customers once our retail reforms are in place. We feel that that is a
very unlikely scenario, given that non-household customers represent
only some 10% of the total retail market, and that 90% of

is quite an assertion to say that 100% of an incumbent’s

non-household customers in Scotland have put their water services out
to tender, but most customers have elected to stay with Business
Stream. We understand that only about 5% to 10% of customers have
switched since 2008. The customers who stayed with Business Stream have
benefited from improved services, without having to switch, by
renegotiating their terms. We might expect a more active market in

economic case for exits seem to be based on incumbents losing all their

market opening.

February 2012, said that a worst-case scenario would be incumbents
losing 25% of their non-household customers in the short to medium

a named customer service contact, and some have been offered improved
metering services. The idea 
<?notus-xml column=68?>of incumbents sitting around while customers disappear is therefore, in
our view, an unlikely scenario.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T18:05:58"></hs_TimeCode> addition,

customers may choose to stick with the incumbent supplier because the
incumbent supplier will improve its services to them as a result of the

customers. Forcing or even allowing retail exit ignores such points.
Where customers choose to switch, we anticipate a growth market in
which innovation and competition lead to benefits, both environmentally
and in customers’ bills.
Allowing<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T18:06:47"></hs_TimeCode> partial

potential for it as provided for in new clause 2, destabilising

Industry Act 1999 removed the power of any water company to disconnect
homes because of the non-payment of bills. That prohibits the
disconnection of the water supply to homes, schools and hospitals. The

reassurance that water supplies are safe and that drinking water
quality is acceptable to consumers. In England and Wales, 99.96% of
drinking water supplies meet national and European standards. The tiny
proportion that are failing to meet that
standard—0.04%—are predominantly private supplies, rather
than supplies from incumbent water companies. Since the mid-1990s under

hon. Friend the Member for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (Jonathan
Edwards) made a point about legislative competencies and borders. In
Northern Ireland the matter is not considered problematic, because the
national or state boundaries are followed; nor is it considered
problematic for legislative competencies to cross the border in the
case of Wales. Legislative competency seems to become a problem only
when proposed by Plaid Cymru. Of course, it is also proposed by the
Labour Welsh Government, but they are not here to make that point. That
does not seem particularly fair

Flood and Water Management Act 2010. I remind the House that the cost
of bad debt to each household in England is approximately £15

to take, it is incumbent on the Government to consider every

9 would make the consequential change to the current clause 80, to

the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee report on the draft
Bill, we reiterated our previous recommendations that the Department
should implement without delay the existing provisions of the Flood and
Water Management Act 2010 on bad debt, to which I have referred. In our
view, it is unacceptable for honest customers to be forced to subsidise
those who can pay but refuse to pay their water bills. To answer my
right hon. Friend’s question, the specific provision is
section 45 of the 2010 Act, which introduces new section
144C to the Water Industry Act 1991. That is what we propose 
<?notus-xml column=77?>in new clause 3, which would require landlords to arrange for
information on their tenants to be provided to water
companies.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010617000358" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0002.htm#14010617000358">Instead
of implementing the existing bad debt provisions, the Government
currently rely on a voluntary approach, whereby landlords share
information on tenants on an online database set up by the water
companies. Before I go further on the voluntary approach, it might be
helpful to ask my hon. Friend the Minister this question: what is to
prevent a customer who happens to be a tenant from marking on their
electricity bill the fact that they have no problem with it being made
known to the electricity company and the Department for Work and
Pensions, whichever works best, that they are in receipt of benefits?

myself in good company this evening. The report recommended that DEFRA

hon. Friend the Minister must recognise the urgency. This year, it will
be four years since the Flood and Water Management Act 2010. The legal
basis exists. New clause 3 and amendment 9 would give the Secretary of
State the power to make the regulations on the disclosure of benefits
information relating to tenants to water and sewerage companies in
connection with the bad debt provisions in the Act. The benefits
information should include all information held by the Department for
Work and Pensions on benefit
entitlements.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010617000365" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0002.htm#14010617000365">All
the Secretary of State needs to do is introduce appropriate safeguards
in regulations to protect data. As I have indicated to the Minister,
there could be a box on the bill for the customer to tick to indicate
that they are willing to have information shared with the
water or sewerage company. The Committee has previously
recommended a simple tick-box on a customer’s bill consenting to
such information disclosure. I urge him to tell the House what has
changed since he endorsed such a provision in the previous
Parliament—he was a member of the Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs Committee in the last Parliament, and was so until recently in
this
Parliament.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010617000366" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0002.htm#14010617000366">The
Committee believes that the proposal is a helpful suggestion to the
Government in closing a loophole and preventing an omission
from the Bill. The legislation is in place. The new clause would enable
companies to determine which customers cannot pay and those who
will not do so. There is a clear distinction between the two. Those who
can pay but will not pay are costing £15 per household. The
provision would allow water companies to target information about the
charitable funds and social tariffs they operate on the most vulnerable
customers—those who simply cannot afford to pay,
perhaps even for a temporary period—and allow them to make
arrangements for which they are
eligible.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010617000367" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0002.htm#14010617000367">There

what he so eloquently supported when he was a member of the Select

would like to speak to the new clauses that stand in my name. As I said
earlier, much attention has been paid to households that faced a
difficult Christmas and new year because of the climatic conditions
that battered the United Kingdom. Much less, however, has been written
on households that faced a stressful period because of the economic
conditions that have battered the United Kingdom, not just in the past
three weeks but in the past three years. Hundreds of thousands of
households did not enjoy the Christmas that all of us here in the House
of Commons did, in warm and secure homes with plenty to eat and with
presents given and received. Too many families were left unable to
enjoy the Christmas joys that we take for granted.</hs_Para>

cost of living crisis cannot be dismissed as a soundbite, as many
Government Members try to do. The cases of hardship regularly brought
to the attention of Members of Parliament cannot simply be batted away.
At a time when household incomes are continuously being squeezed, it is
not acceptable to Opposition Members for most water companies to
continue to do so little to help their struggling customers.</hs_Para>

and electricity counterparts, but there is no disputing their
cumulative impact. Citizens Advice reported to MPs in November that it
had received almost as many inquiries from people worried about their
water bills as they had about the other two utilities. DEFRA’s
own statistics state that some 2.5 million households now find
themselves in what the Department itself defines as water poverty,
while in the past year water companies reported pre-tax profits of
£1.9 billion and paid out, in dividends, a staggering
£1.8 billion to their shareholders.</hs_Para>

might have expected the water companies to rush forward with schemes to
assist their hardest-pressed customers, Mr Deputy Speaker. After all,
the previous Labour Government put in place legislation to allow each
company to introduce a tailor-made scheme for its own region. The water
companies told the then Government and Parliament that that was all
that was needed: a voluntary system of social tariffs that each and
every water company would then set and implement quickly. Four years
later, what progress has been made? So far, only three water companies
have got around to implementing social tariffs, helping a grand total
of 25,000 households across the country. Even by the end 
<?notus-xml column=80?>of the price review period, more than a third of water companies will
still have not bothered to lift a finger and introduce such a scheme.
When the water companies gave evidence to the Bill Committee, did they
acknowledge that they had let down their customers and Parliament? Did
they acknowledge that the rate of progress was not good enough? Did
they say sorry, even once? Of course not. They blamed everyone but
themselves: they blamed the regulator, they blamed the Government and
they blamed the
customers<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T18:54:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010617000378" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0002.htm#14010617000378">What
has been the response of the Secretary of State, and his Minister with
responsibility for water, to the crisis facing households? The
Secretary of State sent a letter to the companies in October begging
them not to raise prices further. It was not, we note, an instruction
or a warning that if they did not take heed, the Government would step
in. It was not even a rebuke; it was just a weak letter. That is why
the Opposition have tabled four new clauses that will each help
hard-pressed households. Taken together, they would make a tangible
difference to those struggling with the cost of living crisis. With
your permission, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will briefly take each new clause

on bad debt, I will build on the excellent remarks by the Chair of the
Select Committee. Ofwat estimates that on average bad debt adds
£15 to every customer’s annual bill. Note, of course,
that that is just the average amount; in some cases, it is
significantly more than that. As the hon. Lady said, water companies
are, rightly, not allowed to cut off those who cannot afford to pay
their bills, but they are allowed to pass the cost of non-payment on to
their other customers. In effect, the sector already has
cross-subsidisation.</hs_Para>

There are, of course, water companies that underperform and their debt
is much higher than average, but the corollary is that other water
companies perform considerably better. Does the hon. Gentleman not

water companies such as Yorkshire Water, which serves the constituency

pay. That is unfair on decent customers who meet their obligations and
we believe the time has come for more robust action to be taken. Some
80% of those who do not pay are in rented accommodation. One of the
challenges facing water companies is tracking down those who refuse to
pay because they move homes far more often than the average person. The
only way to track them down effectively is to require landlords to
provide water companies with a list of tenants. Individuals moving
property would not then disappear from the system and evade paying

member of the Committee when we had this discussion, so for his benefit
I will say that it is quite simple. As the water companies have
said, they would be supplied with names and addresses. The onus would
then be on them to carry out the necessary activity to match up the
appropriate individual, and there would be no significant burden on the
landlord, the local authority or social housing provider. The burden
for that work would fall on the water company. He will recall from our
time in Committee that I was not always the water industry’s

the Opposition are united, so again I come back to this question of why

and his knowledge, but we are clear that, as they themselves accept, it
is the water companies who would have to do the legwork; no additional
burden would be placed on the landlord, as it would be for the
water companies to contact householders, and obviously they would have
a list of new tenants. I will use the example of the electoral roll:
candidates, parliamentarians and political parties receive a list of
those who are new on the register, and we then contact them to welcome
them to the area. When the name of somebody who disappears from one
property appears at a different property, it would not be beyond the
wit of a water company to work out who they were. In Committee,
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T19:01:23"></hs_TimeCode>the
Government’s key objection seemed to be that it would place an
unfair burden on landlords, so we are keen to stress that, as the
Minister will recall from his time on the Select Committee, it would
place an additional burden not on the landlord, but on the water
companies. The companies themselves want this power. To reiterate, we
are absolutely clear that those who can pay should pay, so why the

ask DEFRA to do something, its knee-jerk response is to think of
spurious reasons why it should not or cannot do it. Our new clause

the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T19:03:58"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Newbury (Richard Benyon) pointed out, that is because some, such as
Yorkshire Water, have worked with customers and debt advice groups,
such as Citizens Advice, to put in place measures to help customers
genuinely struggling to access payment packages and programmes, but
unfortunately that is not the case across the country. Too many water
companies have come to the unsurprising conclusion that, because they
can pass the cost of bad debt on to their other customers, they need
not bother to do anything about it themselves.</hs_Para>

we have tabled new clause 10. We want to give Ofwat and water companies
a clear and unambiguous signal that hard-pressed customers should no
longer be treated as a cash cow by companies that cannot be
bothered to meet their own responsibilities. Where the regulator and
the Department are satisfied that water companies are not doing enough
to pursue bad debtors, the cost should no longer be passed on to other
customers<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T19:05:05"></hs_TimeCode>. Taken

third new clause—new clause 8—would help to ensure that
customers know about the help for which they are eligible. In 1999, the
last Labour Government introduced WaterSure to help low-income metered
households with high essential water use. WaterSure caps the bills of
metered households in receipt of a qualifying benefit or tax credit at
the average bill for that water company’s operating area. It
applies to households with three or more children under the age of 19
living at home or where someone in the household 
<?notus-xml column=83?>has a medical condition that necessitates high water use. It is
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T19:06:00"></hs_TimeCode>an important
measure that at the time received cross-party support and which,
according to the latest figures that the Minister gave us in Committee,
has helped 70,500 households in England—I think a similar scheme
has helped approximately 20,000 households in Wales. Although that is
welcome, we believe that that level is unacceptable. Given that, as the
Consumer Council for Water has said, only one third of eligible
households are in receipt of the benefit to which they are entitled,
the Government have been guilty of complacency.</hs_Para>

the benefit of Members who have not had a chance to look at the
amendment paper, we are proposing that information about the
eligibility criteria and how to apply should be included in all water
bills. He believes that all water companies already provide this
information, but unfortunately for him the reality does not match his
statement. Not only do his own figures show that the current approach
is not working, but our own anecdotal research shows that customers are
not even aware that WaterSure exists. We want to make it clear to water
companies that they must do much more to promote the scheme, and we
want Ofwat and the Government to hold them to account if they do not. I
hope he has reflected not only on the evidence we presented in
Committee, but on his own figures and the evidence from the CCW, and

our fourth new clause—new clause 7—deals with the central
problem of the failure of the voluntary approach to social tariffs. As
we have set out, too few water companies are helping too few customers
through social tariffs, and it is clear that left to their own devices
many water companies, by their own admission, will never introduce such
schemes. That is why we are proposing a national affordability scheme
to end the postcode lottery and ensure national standards for
eligibility. We would expect schemes to be funded by the excess profits
of the water companies, not by other water bill payers. As I have said,
last year these companies made an eye-watering £1.9 billion in
pre-tax profits and paid out £1.8 billion to investors. The
idea, for example, that Yorkshire Water, which paid out £240
million, cannot afford to provide support through social tariffs is

Mark Spencer</B> (Sherwood) (Con):</Member> I want to
make some brief comments that were too long for an intervention,
particularly about new clause 3, tabled by my hon. Friend
the Member for Thirsk and Malton (Miss McIntosh). I sincerely hope
that, in summing up, the Minister will reflect on today’s
debate, which has shown recognition across the House that consumers and
our constituents are finding it very difficult to pay their household
bills because of pressure on the household budget. It is worth saying
that the Government recognise that challenge and are doing their best
to assist, not least by turning 
<?notus-xml column=84?>around the failing economy that they inherited. Needless to say, a
section of society will find it very challenging to pay their utility
bills, and the Government have an obligation to try to assist and
support them.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14010619000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0003.htm#14010619000006">There is
another group of people who are unwilling to pay, as a result of a
frankly malicious intent to avoid paying the bill that is due to be
paid. It is vital that the water companies have the power to decide
which cases fit into which categories. Those who are clearly unable to
pay should be able to receive assistance, support and sympathy from the
water companies. New clause 3 goes some way towards assisting the water
companies to identify people within the benefit and welfare support
system, who may be in need of extra assistance.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14010619000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0003.htm#14010619000007">I am somewhat
sympathetic to new clause 8, too, which was tabled by the hon. Member
for Dunfermline and West Fife (Thomas Docherty) and is designed to
ensure that water companies put the neediest customers on “the
lowest possible tariff”. Those who find themselves under
pressure in the most challenging of circumstances are often those least
able to identify from their bills which is the correct tariff for them
to be on and least able to challenge the water companies to put them on
a better tariff, allowing them to afford to pay their household bills.
I hope that the Minister will give further consideration to that, if he
is minded to do
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010619000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0003.htm#14010619000008">Finally,
I support those who have said it is difficult to understand why the
Department for Work and Pensions or the Department for Environment,
Food and Rural Affairs are unable or unwilling to supply the necessary
data to the water companies. I hope that when the Minister sums up, he
will be able to shed some light on those
thoughts.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010619000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0003.htm#14010619000009"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Redwood" PimsId="329" UID="14010619000718" xid="496" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0003.htm#14010619000718">Mr
Redwood:</Member></B> I hope that the Government will look at the issue
of unpaid bills. Colleagues of all parties are right to draw attention
to the problem—one of the many sources of excess cost in the
water industry, which it would be good to reduce or eliminate. It is
undoubtedly the case that we pay dearly for our main utility provision
in this country, and I fear that the main reason why water bills are
high and will stay high is that there is no competition. It is a great
pity that this Bill will not introduce proper competition into water as
into other areas, as it would make a lot of difference. The amendments
are designed to deal with the situation of having regional monopolies
that are in many cases unresponsive and have high cost structures. Then
there is the particular problem of customers deciding—quite
wilfully, when some of them are perfectly capable of paying—not
to pay their bills. Clearly, more needs to be done on that.</hs_Para>

good in all the amendments before us this evening, but I am not
persuaded that they take the trick. It might be helpful to know who the
tenant was, but if the tenant cannot be traced to where they have gone,
it will impossible to get them to pay. It might be useful to know
something more about the benefits and financial circumstances of
individuals, although there are issues of privacy and the handling of
data that could cause difficulties, but that then fails to enable us to
come down hard enough on the people who can afford to pay, which is the
real
issue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010619000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0003.htm#14010619000011"><B><Member ContinuationText="Thomas Docherty" PimsId="5686" UID="14010619000719" xid="1052" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0003.htm#14010619000719">Thomas
Docherty:</Member></B> Given that it is the water industry itself that
is pressing for this power relating to landlord information and given
that it is prepared to bear the 
<?notus-xml column=85?>burden of tracking people down, does the right hon. Gentleman not accept
that such a scheme is clearly
workable?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010619000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0003.htm#14010619000012"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Redwood" PimsId="329" UID="14010619000720" xid="496" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0003.htm#14010619000720">Mr
Redwood:</Member></B> It may or may not be. I do not have a very high
opinion of the success of the water industry in these areas, and it may
not be the best judge, but I accept that this is one of the best points
in the hon. Gentleman’s case, and I look forward to hearing the
Minister’s reply to it.</hs_Para>

amendments and new clauses are all well intentioned and, if passed,
they might not make the situation worse and in some cases might even
make it a little better. I hope, however, that the Minister, working
with the water industry, can come up with something better because
there is a serious issue here. A lot of money is owed to the water
industry that people could afford to pay, but the matter is not being
pressed.</hs_Para>

very good reasons, nobody here wants to change the rule about cutting
people off because water is so essential. That weakens the

Minister is going to advise us to reject the amendments, I hope he will
provide a scheme of his own because of the serious money at risk here
and because it is not fair on all the other people who pay their water
bills, many of them without a lot of resources themselves but who feel
that they should pay. There is a cross-subsidisation going on to the
benefit of people who often have more money but simply will not
pay.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010619000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0003.htm#14010619000015"><B><Member ContinuationText="Dan Rogerson" PimsId="4840" UID="14010619000721" xid="825" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0003.htm#14010619000721">Dan

assist. What I said comes entirely from my recollection of his
introduction of the measure in Committee and if it is faulty, it is
certainly not on account of any information briefed to me by others. I
am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for highlighting the issue of excess
profits. However, this does not address the point that we have a
regulated system under which the profits are allowed for under the
price review process. I appreciate that he was not a Member when his
party was most recently in government, but it was quite happy 
<?notus-xml column=86?>to move forward with the pricing process. What he is saying now is that
he has no confidence in the regulator—in other words, that the
regulator would set a level of profit that it thinks reasonable for the
price review period, but that this would now somehow be unpicked as
being in excess in some cases in order to fund the scheme. I am happy
to give way again, in case he wants to correct
this.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010619000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0003.htm#14010619000019"><B><Member ContinuationText="Thomas Docherty" PimsId="5686" UID="14010619000724" xid="1052" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0003.htm#14010619000724">Thomas
Docherty:</Member></B> I am grateful, but on this occasion it is
perhaps the Minister who should have paid more attention to my remarks
a few moments ago. I clearly said that the last Government gave the
water companies time to introduce the voluntary schemes, but that they
have now failed to honour their commitment, so the Government should
step in and do what the companies failed to do
themselves.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010619000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0003.htm#14010619000020"><B><Member ContinuationText="Dan Rogerson" PimsId="4840" UID="14010619000725" xid="825" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0003.htm#14010619000725">Dan
Rogerson:</Member></B> I understand the hon. Gentleman’s views
on social tariffs, which he feels have not been introduced in a speedy
enough fashion. My point was rather about the issue of excess profits.
I said that the hon. Gentleman was seeking to introduce a concept that
is perhaps a subjective rather than an objective assessment of the
profits made by water companies. The whole point of the price review
process and price review period, however, is that a regulated process
takes account of the need to attract investment and thus the need to
make a reasonable return in profit.</hs_Para>

Williams:</Member></B> My understanding is that the water companies
made larger profits because the period of very low interest rates
benefited them to a great extent. However, basing an entire policy on

be a very good idea.</hs_Para>

me move next to new clause 8, also tabled by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T19:19:47"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Gentleman. It would place a legal requirement on water companies to
include information in their bills about the WaterSure scheme, but, as
I have said—I provided information to this effect to the
Committee—all water companies already do so voluntarily. He made
a point based on anecdotal evidence. I would be happy to see that
evidence and I am sure that he will want to share it with us, but I
think we should base our policy making on the evidence provided to us
and the Consumer Council for Water has been quite clear that companies
provide such information to customers.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14010619000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0003.htm#14010619000024"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T19:20:22"></hs_TimeCode>In
addition, new clause 8 would place requirements on water companies to
provide information about tariff structures and the lowest available
tariff, a point picked up on by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T19:20:29"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T19:20:29"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood (Mr Spencer). The proposals simply
fail to reflect the realities of the water sector as opposed, for
example, to the energy sector. Water companies do not have complex 
<?notus-xml column=87?>tariff structures. The sole choice for the majority of household
customers is whether to pay according to the amount of water
they use through a metered tariff, which is particularly prevalent in
areas such as my own, or according to the rateable value of their home
through an unmetered tariff. The cheapest option for each household
will therefore depend on the location of the property and the amount of
water used by the
household<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T19:21:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010619000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0003.htm#14010619000025">Many
smaller households with low water use can benefit from a meter. Water
companies are required to fit a water meter free of charge on request
and they also advise customers on whether they might benefit
financially from the installation of a water meter. A further point to
bear in mind about the operation of WaterSure is that it caps the bills
of eligible customers at the average of the metered and unmetered bill
for the area. That could, in effect, put the bills of some eligible
customers up and it is therefore not surprising that they have chosen
not to apply for WaterSure.</hs_Para>

is no evidence, in my view, that further regulation is required in this
area. As I have noted, all companies already include details of
WaterSure in their household bills and they also all provide details of
the support available to any customer struggling to pay their bill.
Legislation to require the companies to do something that they are
already doing voluntarily would be
redundant<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T19:22:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010619000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0003.htm#14010619000027">The
Consumer Council for Water works closely with the companies on the
format of their bills. Its expert advice, as we discussed in Committee,
is that one of the biggest risks in using water bills as a
means of communication with customers is information overload. I do
not, therefore, consider the new clause to be

me turn next to new clause 9, also tabled by the hon. Gentleman. We
discussed an identical clause that he tabled in Committee. Section 45
of the Flood and Water Management Act 2010 already enables Ministers to
introduce secondary legislation that would require landlords to provide
water companies with personal details about their tenants or become
liable for paying the bill. That was a point that the Chairman of the
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee was keen to emphasise,
given her involvement with the passage of that Act.</hs_Para>

extensive consultation with the industry and with landlords’
organisations the Government took the decision that a voluntary
approach would be more suitable. During consultation, landlords argued
that the additional regulatory burden would be disproportionate as they
are not the source of the problem we are trying to tackle. At the same
time, the evidence provided by the water sector to support the case for
additional regulation was not sufficient to make the case for
additional regulation of millions of small and
micro-businesses<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T19:23:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010619000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0003.htm#14010619000030">The
Government simply do not believe that more regulation is always the
answer. As we discussed in Committee, good practice in tackling bad
debt is not applied consistently across the water sector.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T19:23:28"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Gentleman quite rightly took great pains to point that out. The
significant variation in performance between companies tells us that
the focus should be on driving better standards across the sector

do not propose to bring forward the bad debt regulations on landlords
is that we do not wish to endorse the argument that performance on bad
debt is not within the control of water companies. We think there is
more that the companies can do to collect their debts and we want them
to focus on that rather than look to the Government to solve the
problem for
them<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T19:23:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010619000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0003.htm#14010619000032">Of
course, the real drivers of company performance are the incentives and
penalties set by the regulator so I am pleased to be able to report
that Ofwat has changed its approach to bad debt in the methodology it
is using for the 2014 price review. The new approach will enable it
more effectively to bear down on the costs of bad debt. It is doing so
by insisting that the companies demonstrate that any increase in bad
debt is genuinely beyond their control and that they have taken all
available steps to control it. Unless they can prove that that is the
case they will not be allowed to include it in customer charges. We are
already seeing our focus on the industry’s taking responsibility
for tackling bad debt bear fruit. As I mentioned in Committee, the
industry is working with landlords’ organisations to establish a
new voluntary scheme that will enable landlords to provide information

me turn now, as the hon. Gentleman uncannily predicts, to new clause
10, which he has tabled in his efforts to make some changes to the

The new clause will provide a new power for Ministers and
Ofwat to disallow companies from recovering the cost of unpaid bills
from their paying customers. The hon. Gentleman 
<?notus-xml column=89?>has argued that there is no incentive for companies
to collect bad debt. During our previous discussions, I made it clear
that Ofwat has the power to decide which costs may be recovered through
the price review. Ofwat is already using the price review process to
bear down on the costs of bad debt and requiring companies to
demonstrate high performance in debt collection and to show that any
increase in bad debt is beyond their control before they are allowed to
include it in customer charges. The price review will challenge poor
performers to raise their game.</hs_Para>

new clause proposes a power for a future Secretary of State to
intervene in the setting and recovery of charges. That is exactly the
kind of political interference that concerns the investors who are
critical to the water industry. I have stated before that the stability
of the regulatory regime is vital to keeping the cost of borrowing low.
An increase in that cost will have the direct result of putting up
customers’ bills and I am firmly of the view that it is for the
regulator and not the Government to make detailed decisions about
charges. New<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T19:27:45"></hs_TimeCode>

on to the objective of targeting social tariffs, new clause 3 would
focus support on a very specific subsection of water customers: those
who both receive benefits and live in rented accommodation. The problem
with that approach is that it would target help at many people who do
not need it and exclude many who do need it. It is important that we do
not over-simplify. Benefit recipients are a very diverse group of

risk of water affordability problems do not receive means-tested
benefits. Additionally, when universal credit is fully rolled out, it
will replace all the existing wide-range of income-related social
security benefits and tax credits. Many of its recipients will be in
work and have reasonable earnings. So receipt of universal credit alone
is not a suitable indicator of possible eligibility for access to a
social tariff<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T19:30:44"></hs_TimeCode>.

I explain why the amendments and new clauses are important, I should
point out that we have seen three types of flooding in the past three
or four months. The most recent examples have been of coastal flooding,
but the Yorkshire and East Anglia coasts suffered tidal surges before
Christmas to devastating effect; more than 80 houses were evacuated at
Filey in my constituency and a number more in Whitby. However, we have
become more accustomed to surface water and river flooding, and surface
water flooding has been on the increase, and has become more of a
problem, since 2007.</hs_Para>

want to hear from the Minister why SUDS have been delayed. The latest
we heard was that there was an implementation date of April 2014.
People have been trying to convince me that Brawby in my constituency
suffered in 2013 not from flooding but due to surface water running off
from fields and roads into the combined sewerage pipe, which then
spilled water from the sewerage system back on to the road. In that
case, the water did not go into anyone’s house, but at
Castlegate in Malton when exactly the same thing happened—water
ran off the road into the combined sewers—water then entered a
house.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010619000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0003.htm#14010619000087">The
missing link is an audit of existing SUDS and an examination of future
SUDS when major developments and roads are built. However, from my
experience, and given what we heard during the statement on the floods,
there is a further problem to deal with. If water runs off a highway,
it is the responsibility of the county council, the unitary council or
the Highways Agency itself. However, if that water then runs into the
combined pipes, it suddenly becomes the water company’s problem,
although what has happened is not its fault. I hope that that
unacceptable situation can be addressed through the measures that I and
other members of the EFRA Committee have tabled, or through amendment
1, which was tabled by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T19:42:58"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Sherwood. If fields are saturated, as is the case at
present—it was the situation in my constituency between
September 
<?notus-xml column=95?>2012 and March 2013—highways authorities must
take responsibility and create a SUD to take the excess water. I accept
that such a process would involve cost, but I applaud the
Government’s approach on partnership funding, so we could look
to public sector partners, or be more imaginative by looking for
private sector partners, such as local businesses that might be
interesting in investing. However, we cannot allow a situation to
continue in which surface water running off a road becomes the
responsibility of a water company and thus forces it to take preventive
measures, given that the highways authority—whichever one it
might be—should accept
responsibility<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T19:44:14"></hs_TimeCode>
for
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010619000088" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0003.htm#14010619000088">The
EFRA Committee’s report following our pre-legislative scrutiny
of the draft Bill highlighted concern about the delayed implementation
of the provisions on sustainable drainage systems in the Flood and
Water Management Act 2010—it is now four years since that Act
was passed. The Committee also criticised a lack of urgency on
improving the management of surface water in its report on the water
White Paper, so I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will be able to
clarify what has been happening and why the process seems to be so
complicated. As the Committee has not been convinced that the
Department’s work to improve the management of surface water has
involved the urgency that constituents throughout the country would
expect, new clause 4 would require the Government to implement the
relevant provisions of the 2010 Act within a month of the Bill being

key provisions to be implemented relate to ending the automatic right
to connect to public sewers in England and Wales. In addition,
developers of substantial property developments should be required to
construct sustainable drainage systems before carrying out any new
construction work. When houses are built on a field in Filey that takes
surface water, that water will be displaced to existing developments,
or more likely to the school, which required a multi-million pound
refit following the 2007 floods. Water will find its
way<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T19:46:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010619000090" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0003.htm#14010619000090">We
also want the Environment Agency, highways authorities, British
Waterways, internal drainage boards and water and sewerage companies to
be statutory consultees when the new SUDS authority makes a
determination on an application for connection. The reason for that is
simple: why should a water company be asked to connect what are often
outdated Victorian pipes to a major development of 300 houses, for
example, when that is simply not possible? It is necessary
that action is taken prior to planning permission being
granted so that developers can make the necessary arrangements and save
a great deal of grief down the
line<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T19:47:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010619000091" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0003.htm#14010619000091">Surface
water flooding is a major contributory factor to the damage caused to
homes and businesses. It is a relatively new threat, especially when
surface water runs off fields and roads and then floods public sewers.
Extreme weather involving sporadic and intense rainfall—whether
that is due to climate change or because of another reason—has
caused surface water flooding, and it is difficult accurately to
predict where such flooding will occur. In 2009, the Environment Agency
estimated that of the 2.4 million properties then at risk of flooding 
<?notus-xml column=96?>from rivers or the sea, some 1 million were also at risk of
surface water flooding. In addition, 2.8 million
properties are at risk of surface water flooding alone. If a house is
built on land that is prone to flooding, it is highly unlikely to be
eligible for insurance. However, in the case of Filey, an existing
bungalow or the school can suffer due to displaced
water—secondary flooding, almost—and then find that its
insurance premium and excess increase. Does the Minister think that
that is fair? I do not think that it is, so we need to bring forward
SUDS as a matter of urgency and end the automatic right to
connect<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T19:48:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010619000092" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0003.htm#14010619000092">Amendments
2 and 3, which would amend clause 21, are important so that highways
authorities have the power to construct, maintain and operate
sustainable drainage systems to reduce the volume of surface water
entering public sewers. If sewage water backs up into people’s

reform aims to encourage upstream competition. I am talking about the
input of raw or treated water into a water company’s network or
the removal of waste water or sewage for treatment. Clause 1 unbundles
all the existing licensing structures so that new entrants can sell raw
or treated water into an incumbent’s network. It also looks at
the wholesale authorisation to input water into a part of the system.
The Environment Agency’s statistics show that on average,
between 2002 and 2011, only 45% of the annual total of water licensed
for abstraction in England and Wales was actually abstracted.
Therefore, if all of this unused but already licensed water was
abstracted, there could be a significant deterioration of the
environment. We hope that when the Government look at abstraction and
upstream reform, they will bear these thoughts in
mind<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T19:56:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010619000106" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0003.htm#14010619000106">One

familiar with the work of his Department in the Natural Environment

will conclude my remarks by looking at flood insurance. Amendments 5,
6, 7 and 8 seek to amend clauses 51 and 53. The Select Committee took a
lot of evidence in relation to Flood Re and the potential for
reinsurance companies. Given how deeply wedded the Government are to
Flood Re, I hope that they have not closed the door completely on
reinsurance. In summing up this debate, perhaps the Minister will
inform us how the state aid application to the EU Commission in
Brussels is going to enable Flood Re to come into effect according to

do not have the definition to hand, but I am sure that the Federation
of Small Businesses will have a definition. I think it is generally
deemed to be a business that has fewer than 50 employees, though many
small businesses employ five or fewer or are often a single employee.
The example I cited was that of a small dental practice with two or
three dentists. The knock-on effect on an independently run,
stand-alone dental practice of fitting, for the second time, a new
dental chair and computer equipment goes beyond what would normally be
expected. The knock-on effect on the insurance premium and excess for
that dental practice was considerable and, possibly,
unaffordable.</hs_Para>

concern among the farming community that farms may be excluded whereas
the farm house may be included. I commend my hon. Friend’s
knowledge, because she worked in the insurance industry for a time. We
need to know whether farms and people working from their own homes are
going to be included, and what the position will be for small
businesses, because this could put them out of business in some of the
areas that we have seen flooded over the past two years in repeat
flooding incidents.

Re proposals in the Bill. Any business based in a property that is
primarily a residential one, and on which the occupier therefore pays
council tax, would fall within the Flood Re scheme. Any business based
in premises used primarily for business will not be covered. It is
extremely important that we understand these issues. For the first time
that I can remember, under the Flood Re scheme, once it is up and
running, the Government will be added as an insurer of last resort if
in the three years before the fund has built up we suffer an

the Public Bill Committee, the ABI stated that Flood Re is not the
solution for small businesses and that there is not a sufficient
evidence basis for providing insurance cover for small businesses. The
Federation of Small Businesses is concerned that small businesses that
have affordability problems will not be covered, other than in respect
of the insurance premiums or excess that they might seek to defray.
Although they do not pay council tax, they do pay business rates and
therefore could be rated in a similar way to household customers under
Flood Re. There remain a lot of known unknowns with Flood Re as to why
a council band rate has been chosen and which particular band rate has
been opted for, but that is a separate debate.

and, in particular, how the taxpayer would be protected. As I have
mentioned, the Government will, for the first time, be the insurer of
last resort. In later years, after the fund has built up, I do not
believe that that will be a problem, but we are seeking the
Minister’s reassurance about what the implications will be in
respect of the first three years. In Committee, the Minister confirmed
that there is no Government liability for Flood Re and that the
Government have made it clear that Flood Re is not guaranteed above the
one-in-200-year level, so he might just like to revisit that and
clarify the point.</hs_Para>

amendment 8 would put the Government’s commitment in the Bill
and create certainty for all concerned as to who will assume the
additional liability. A one-in-200-year loss scenario would be the
total value of claims from households reinsured through Flood Re that,
during the course of a year, actuaries would not expect to be exceeded
in 99.5% of years. Expressed in a different way, that would mean that
the actuaries would be 99.5% confident that the limit would not be
exceeded in any one year. It is important to note that that is not the
same as a one-in-200-year flood event; the ABI has estimated that this
would mean flooding six times worse than that experienced in 2007.
Obviously, neither the Minister nor the insurance industry will yet be
able to say what the cost of the recent floods has been, but I hope
that he will see fit to lend his support to our amendments, and I
commend them to the

agree. I particularly share her concern about drainage and surface
water, and I agree with the points she made earlier about the need to
ensure that highways authorities also have statutory duties, so that we
can deal with this issue in a joined-up way. The debate on this group
of provisions is important because we have had pre-legislative scrutiny
by the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee of the draft Water
Bill and subsequent debate in that Committee. When the Minister
addresses the various comments that have been made, we will see the
extent to which the Government are listening to what Parliament is
saying about the amendments. There may not necessarily be agreement on
all of them; I am talking about the amendments that seek genuinely to
try to improve matters on the whole issue of water. We have an
opportunity to put in place legislation that is fit for purpose, so I
hope that improvements will be made.</hs_Para>

that prevention is much better than an end-of-pipe solution mean that
we should be dealing at this stage with the procedures that need
to be put in place to prevent contamination of water as a

a financial competence check is carried out only in specific
circumstances, and competence is not the same as securing a form of

put in place funding or insurance for dealing with an accident; it only

that there is a plan in place for the low-probability but high-risk

it altogether. It is for that reason that we need to look seriously at

figure is even greater—more than 70%—in the southern

peer-reviewed evidence to suggest that that is something we should be
prepared for. For example, a study in the USA last year
examined stray gas concentrations in 141 drinking water wells near
Marcellus shale gas extraction sites in Pennsylvania. It detected

would argue that our regulatory regime is much more stringent than that

occurring. Although it is true that the existing regulatory regime, if
properly implemented and enforced, should mitigate most risk, that does
not detract from the need for the new clause. Even if liability can be

abandoned coal mines had polluted more than 400 km of rivers. Treatment
schemes and remedial works undertaken by the Coal Authority have helped
to protect the environment and people, but at a cost of tens of
millions of pounds a year to the taxpayer, not the polluter. It is

is also concerning evidence that regulation is not being adequately

be hydraulically fractured to date, the Environment Agency did not
issue the environmental permits that were required. At the same time,
the agency has committed to a dramatic reduction in the time it takes
to issue permits. Streamlining regulation and issuing permits in this
way is all well and good in some circumstances, but as we are dealing
with a new technology in the UK with unknown risks, we should not be

of the solution, of course, is better information about and greater

leaflets to areas particularly badly affected. Of course, we can do
better, but the reality in my constituency and up and down the
country—this is verified by DEFRA figures—is
that, as current misconnections are dealt with, others are adding to
the problem and it is getting worse, not better. I could cite instances

of the reason for the problem is that, although water companies can
disconnect from the connected drains, they cannot redirect them into
correct sewers; only local authorities have the power to do that. If,
for any reason, the householder or business does not carry out the
works, the local authority has powers to do so and to bill that
individual or organisation for the
costs<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T20:30:16"></hs_TimeCode>. New

Indeed, in the Greater London area—I suspect the situation is

Ealing—has a 90% record on sorting out these problems and the
majority of local authorities achieve greater than 50% of corrections
within a reasonable time frame. My own local authority achieved 64%. I
am not, therefore, having a go at local government, but one London

intrinsically involved in the tortuous and detailed negotiations with
the industry to try to come up with something from zero when the
coalition Government came into office. We had urgent and overdue
discussions about what would replace the statement of principles. All
hon. Members would agree that it is absolutely right that this needs to
be scrutinised by the House, with ongoing scrutiny of how it works. I
hope that the Minister will agree that flexibility should be built into
it to enable it to be changed as circumstances change in years
ahead.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010619000154" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0003.htm#14010619000154">However,

constituents, who suffered some of the worst flooding in the south of
England in 2007 and have continued to face flooding in certain areas
since, I beg the House not to unpick the detailed negotiations that
have resulted in the Flood Re proposal before the House. For example,
if we started to introduce a wide range of businesses into the scheme,
that would completely change the complex mathematical—probably
algorithmic—calculations that will make it viable.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T20:35:32"></hs_TimeCode> want as many
properties to be included as possible, but if we start to say that we
want it to include band H houses, different types of businesses, and
houses built after a certain date, hon. Members have to understand that
that would come at a cost. The cost might be that the industry walks
away and that we have nothing, with constituents who live in risk of
flooding facing the really terrifying prospect, when we have the kind
of weather we are currently experiencing, of not being able to get
insurance. The affordability factor that we have managed to build in
would be gone, so I just urge the House to have a little caution
when—rightly—scrutinising this Bill, which I really

I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T20:37:08"></hs_TimeCode> have been
accused of obsessing about over-abstraction, and I have been
obsessed about it since long before I entered the House. More than 20
years ago, I set up an environmental body relating to a small river in
my constituency, the River Pang, which is a chalk stream. It was one of
the National River Authority’s ALF—alleviation of low
flow—schemes. We managed to stop over-abstraction by a water
company at the top of the aquifer and to restore the river. It is
currently in desperate need of further restoration, as are others in my
area, particularly the River
Kennet<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T20:37:06"></hs_TimeCode>. It seems
strange to talk about over-abstraction when many of our rivers are
overflowing at this time, but it is nevertheless a very serious issue.
The River Kennet is a site of special scientific interest, and has
overlaying European and national designations. It is an example of a
river for which we have to find a better
solution.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010619000156" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0003.htm#14010619000156">When<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T20:38:02"></hs_TimeCode>
I was in the Minister’s role, I would dearly have loved to bring
meaningful abstraction reform before Parliament, but it would have been
wrong to do so. As has already been said, we have been dealing with a
regulatory system that dates back to the 1960s, when people did not
mention the words “climate change” and we did not have
the levels of population and demand that we now face, particularly in
the south and east of England.
When<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T20:38:24"></hs_TimeCode> the
consultation and all the work being done by the Department and the
Environment Agency is over, I know that we will have about 30,000
abstractions that affect the livelihoods of our constituents and the
ability of their businesses to perform and that have a huge impact on
our environment. I hope that the House agrees that we must get the
system right, and that we legislate in haste and repent—in
opposition—at leisure. I hope that we get this right, and that
the reassurance the Minister will be able to give us will set my mind,

have said that the problem is complex. Organisations such as the WWF
have been a fantastic help to the Government and hon. Members in our
thinking about how we should deal with over-abstraction. I regret that
the abstraction incentive mechanism originally hinted at in the water
White Paper has been diminished in relation to its ability to address
abstraction where it will cause real problems to the environment. I
hope that it comes forward in the future as a very useful tool that
values water differently where it is scarce and where it is
plentiful.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010619000158" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0003.htm#14010619000158">There<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T20:39:55"></hs_TimeCode>

it in the five yearly price review is a major one that will make a big

it might be an elegant way forward. However, I think that it would face
problems. There would be problems in getting the 
<?notus-xml column=108?>legislation through Parliament. It undoubtedly uses Henry VIII clauses
and would give a dramatic power to the Committee Corridor, as opposed
to the whole House. That would concern many Members of this House and
would certainly concern Members in another place, where they do not
like Henry VIII clauses. I hope that the Minister will address that in

then looked at how such secondary legislation would implement the
abstraction reforms that we want to see and that will result from the

level that satisfied my concerns and the concerns of the many
organisations that are worried about over-abstraction now and in the
future, that would be fine. However, the use of secondary legislation
is a limiting factor.

my time as a Minister, I did not get my head around what an abstraction

my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T20:42:09"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Thirsk and Malton, and my concerns about whether such
legislation would deliver what we want it to deliver. The second
assurance is perhaps an impossible one for him to give, but I will ask
him to give it anyway. I hope that he will give an assurance that the
Government are as determined as they were when they put together the
water White Paper—a document that was roundly welcomed by
Members in all parts of the House, the industry, NGOs and every
stakeholder I can think of—that abstraction reform will be
followed up by his party and mine, and hopefully by other parties, and
that it will race through the House in the early years of the next
Parliament so that we can see meaningful abstraction reform that
addresses the problems that blight so many rivers. This is not just an
environmental problem; more fundamentally to many of our constituents,
it is an economic one. Not only do we rely on rivers and aquifers for
aesthetic reasons and leisure activities; they are fundamental to our
economy. That is why it is so important that we get abstraction reform
right. I hope that the Minister will give us those assurances this

clear 
<?notus-xml column=110?>that, as she said, this is not a debate about the merits and demerits of

I understand exactly where she is coming

that time is incredibly short I will bring my remarks to a conclusion,

in the weeks ahead. A number of issues in this group of

and my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Steve McCabe)
is right to say that we must consider Flood Re in some detail. With the
greatest respect, the Opposition will not simply go along with the
Government because they have come to a deal and say that that is good
enough; we need more detail from Ministers. We look forward to the Bill
making progress but we will, as I have suggested, press some amendments
to a vote.</hs_Para>

Affairs Committee, the
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T15:54:02"></hs_TimeCode>hon. Member for
Thirsk and Malton (Miss McIntosh), has been a strong advocate of and
campaigner for sustainable drainage over many years, and the Government
are pressing ahead and implementing the requirement to secure approval
for sustainable drainage systems for new developments under schedule 3
to the Flood and Water Management Act 2010. Regrettably, it is looking
increasingly unlikely that we will be in a position to ensure that the
scheme comes into force this April, which was our preferred date for
implementation as stated previously. I accept that that will be a great
disappointment for the hon. Lady and other hon. Members, but I remain
committed to introducing the legislation at the earliest opportunity. I
plan to lay the relevant affirmative regulations by April, to underline
the Government’s commitment to addressing flood risk.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14010619000174" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0003.htm#14010619000174">I share the
hon. Lady’s frustration that the process has been so protracted,
but we are working with developers and local government to develop the
processes, standards and guidance that are an integral part of a new
SUDS approvals and adoption regime, rather than just imposing them.
That takes time, but it is time well spent if the end result is an
approach that is fair to all parties and successful from the outset
because local government and developers are fully prepared to take on
their respective new responsibilities.</hs_Para>

2 and 3 address flooding on highways or that caused by the run-off from
highways. The causes of flooding can be complex and it is difficult to
make a general statement about them. There are already legislative
powers to ensure that highway surface water drainage does not pollute
or flood, and section 100 of the Highways Act 1980 enables the local
highway authority to take action related to the drainage of
highways—for example, it can construct drains or erect barriers
on the highway or adjoining land to divert surface water into an
existing
drain.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010619000176" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0003.htm#14010619000176">The
majority of new road drainage systems are not connected to the public
sewerage system. Typically, they discharge under designated conditions,
either to a watercourse or a storage pond with controlled exits
to a watercourse, or alternatively soak into the ground in a
designed manner. A decision to connect new highway 
<?notus-xml column=111?>surface water to a combined or foul public sewer can be made only
subject to an agreement with the receiving water authority. There is no
automatic right to connect new highway drainage to the public sewerage
system. We recognise, however, that in some cases local flooding may be
exacerbated by drainage from existing highways, and as I have said, the
2010 Act places a duty on lead local flood authorities to develop a
local flood risk management strategy for their area. I hope hon.
Members will be reassured by that.</hs_Para>

to address the points raised by the Chair of the Environment, Food and
Rural Affairs Committee about flood insurance, and amendments 5, 6 and
7, which relate to small businesses. Flood Re has been specifically
designed to recreate the current cross-subsidy in the domestic home
insurance market. There is little evidence that the same type of
cross-subsidy applies in the commercial insurance market, and the
majority of business insurance policies are already priced to risk. A
recent English business survey of more than 9,000 businesses in England
found that fewer than 1% of businesses had experienced difficulty
getting property insurance in the last year due to the risk of
flooding, and that no businesses had been refused insurance cover due
to such a
risk.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010619000178" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0003.htm#14010619000178">As
outlined by the Association of British Insurers in its evidence
session, businesses tend not to face the systematic issues that
householders experience. We must also remember that Flood Re is funded
through a levy on all household insurance policies. We have
deliberately set that at £10.50, which the ABI estimates is the
same as the current cross-subsidy. Widening Flood Re to include small
businesses would significantly increase costs. We do not want someone
living in a council tax band A property, for example, to subsidise the
cost of insuring a private company that potentially earns up to
£1 million a year. I am also mindful of the need to comply with
state aid rules. Government intervention to support business would be
carefully scrutinised and at greater risk of rejection—I know
the hon. Lady is familiar with that issue.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14010619000179" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0003.htm#14010619000179">On flood
insurance and amendment 8, which was tabled by the same group of hon.
Members, we are clear that we are talking about a one-in-200-year
annual loss, not a one-in-200-year flood event. If Flood Re is legally
responsible for claims above a one-in-200-year level, the cost of the
liability could be prohibitive. Likewise, if the Government took on a
liability beyond a one-in-200-year level, we could expose the taxpayer
to extremely large and unpredictable costs. In such a catastrophic
situation, many more homes than would be insured by Flood Re are likely
to be affected. That is why the memorandum of understanding says that
the Government of the day would work with Flood Re and representatives
of the insurance industry to decide how any available resources should
be distributed to Flood Re customers if flooding exceeds such a
level.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010619000180" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0003.htm#14010619000180">Government

Audit Committee—we discussed them in Committee—the
Government remain convinced that the existing provisions would be
helpful enough in terms of the checks on companies’ financial
probity and their technical ability. 
<?notus-xml column=112?>However, she rightly raised issues that could be
addressed following Lord Krebs’s intervention in his letter. I

agreement in the House that we want progress. Action is taking place
under the existing regime—the Environment Agency has changed 77
licences since 2008, returning around 75 billion litres of water per
year—but we need to go much further. That is why we are
consulting. The process is under way and will lead to legislation,
hopefully with the support of all parties, to reform that complicated
system. However, we need to do that properly. I do not believe it is

unfortunately, it is widely recognised that the future holds more

in which water is available to all at an affordable price, but not at
the expense of the environment. It will ensure that there is choice and
flexibility for customers and that bills are kept affordable, that
there is more innovation in the water industry, and that there are
opportunities for new businesses so that the industry continues to
attract crucial investment. The Bill will not only protect and improve

visited the south-west flooding incident room last week, and I would
like to thank all those who are still working hard on the ground to
support people following such distressing events. Hon. Members know
that our preferred approach on flood insurance is to create an
industry-led flood reinsurance scheme. Flood Re will carefully target
benefits towards low-income households, who are the people most in need
of support during the managed transition to risk-reflective prices. In
developing the scheme, we have been mindful of the costs of the levy,
which will be spread across all those holding household policies. We
believe that our proposals get the balance right, and it also right
that we should take powers on a fall-back obligation to ensure that
there is certainty for householders.</hs_Para>

want to ensure affordable flood insurance, we also want to make sure
that water bills continue to be affordable for everyone, and that has
been a recurring theme of the debate on this Bill. We want those who
are struggling to pay to get help. All water and sewerage companies
have developed packages to help customers with affordability problems,
and they include customer assistance funds, support tariffs, debt
advice and water efficiency measures. Most water companies are taking
action to put social tariffs in place in 2015. The most important thing
we can do is make sure that everyone’s bills are kept
affordable. Let us not forget that this is a sector subject to
price-cap regulation, which means that Ofwat scrutinises and challenges
the business plan of all water companies to secure a fair deal for
customers. By taking account of lower financing costs, Ofwat estimates
that the next price review could significantly reduce pressure on bills
from 2015 by between £120 million to £750 million a year.
This Bill will contribute to the affordability of bills for all.
Measures will exert a downward pressure on bills by encouraging greater
competition to keep bills as low as
possible<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T21:30:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010625000632" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0004.htm#14010625000632">Greater

unsustainable abstraction now by varying and removing abstraction
licences, but over the longer term we are committed to making the

There is a real gulf between the rhetoric of the Government and the

perceived as interfering in a market that they believe is working well.

next price review period from 2015, we see that there are still
companies that do not intend to set a social tariff and that those that
do are proposing to assist a relatively small number of
customers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010625000643" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0004.htm#14010625000643">Given
that Ofwat estimates that 2.6 million
households—11%—currently spend more than 5% of their
income on water, it is clear that only a tiny fraction of those
struggling are being helped. It is also clear that many customers do
not know about even the help that is available. Only a third of
eligible households access WaterSure, which was introduced by Labour to
help households that have a high level of water use due to a medical
condition or because they have three or more children. Yet the
Government have opposed our proposal to require water companies to
include information with bills about the help available to customers,
just as they have consistently opposed forcing water companies to
publish annual information, including on their corporate structure, and
on their levels of investment, taxation and dividends paid to
shareholders, and then enabling Ofwat take full account of that
information when determining whether to re-open price settlements and
cut
bills.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010625000644" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0004.htm#14010625000644">Finally,
our proposed reforms would have tackled bad debt, which adds £15
to the average bill, by requiring landlords to provide water companies
with details of their tenants on request. We sought to give Ofwat
powers to ban water companies that fail to act on bad debt from
transferring the cost of lost revenue from 
<?notus-xml column=138?>non-paying customers to other bill payers. By rejecting all of these
sensible measures, Ministers have wasted the perfect opportunity that
this Bill offered to tackle the impact that rising water bills are
having on stretched household budgets. Instead, the Government’s
preferred approach has been to send just one weakly worded letter to
water bosses, begging them not to hike bills next year, without even a
threat of action if they do not comply. So while the water companies
are doing very well from their monopoly position, customers in this
country will continue to pay among the highest bills in
Europe.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010625000645" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0004.htm#14010625000645">Disappointingly,
Ministers have also not been more willing to listen to concerns raised
on other aspects of the Bill during its passage through this House. The
Government’s only concession has been a grudging acceptance that
it is right to make it clearer to Ofwat that it must have a higher
regard to the environment in the way that it regulates the industry.
The Government’s compromise is to stick to their decision to
elevate “resilience” rather than
“sustainability” but to require Ofwat to</hs_Para>

the world what he was capable of. Then he was disgracefully slandered
in the press by Greek officials as a member of a gang. I have written
to Greek officials asking for an apology for this, but I am sad to say
that, six months on, it is yet to appear. Since Tyrell’s death,
the distress caused to his family by the Greek authorities has been
continuous, from the dismissive actions of the Greek coroner to the
casual return of the clothes that Tyrell was wearing the night he was
killed in the post and the continued total lack of communication with
and respect shown to a grieving family.
But<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T21:49:24"></hs_TimeCode> I am not
here tonight to call to account the Greek authorities as to why they
seem to care so little for this young man’s life. I am here to
ask: what is the appropriate role of the British authorities in such
matters<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T21:49:37"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010625000672" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0004.htm#14010625000672">I
am sure the Minister has been briefed on the family’s
concerns—from being told consistently by the consulate that it
could not find out anything about the investigation and simply
to find a lawyer, to then being given the details of lawyers who
represented the person accused of Tyrell’s killing and being
subjected to a tirade as to their innocence. The consulate staff knew
themselves that the clothes, with possible DNA evidence, were being
returned to the family, but they did not question this and simply
telephoned ahead to ensure that the family would be in when the courier
arrived. Tyrell’s mother was told that if she wanted someone to
explain the difference between a UK and a Greek pathologist report, she
should go to her own GP for
help<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T21:50:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010625000673" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0004.htm#14010625000673">But
I have not asked for this debate to talk about lessons learned in
sensitivity; I have done so primarily because I believe that without
intervention there is a 
<?notus-xml column=142?>risk that the human rights of the victim’s family are being
infringed. The Minister will know that we have been repeatedly told
that formal requests for information have been rebuffed by the Greek
authorities. Our consulate tells me that it cannot even find out
matters such as a possible date for the trial or the charges laid, even
though it claims to have registered an interest in the
case<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T21:50:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010625000674" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0004.htm#14010625000674">The
Minister will also know that, for Tyrell’s hard-working, single
mother, the cost of legal advice is prohibitively expensive. Therefore,
the only information the family have had about the case has been
through press reports of the claims of the family of the
accused<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T21:51:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010625000675" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0004.htm#14010625000675">I
draw the Minister’s attention to the obligations under European
Union law that all member states must ensure protection for the rights
of crime victims, which international law defines as including the
families of murder victims. The EU framework has been fully in force
since 2006. It requires that victims and their families are kept
involved and informed throughout criminal investigations and criminal
trials, including the provision of detailed information in a form and
language that they can understand, and for free when they cannot afford
to pay. There are also requirements of co-operation between member
states, so the UK must ensure that the family’s rights are
upheld by
Greece<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T21:51:50"></hs_TimeCode>. My first
question, therefore, is: does the Minister believe that the conduct of
the UK Government on this matter to date is in accordance with those
legal
requirements?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010625000676" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0004.htm#14010625000676">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T21:54:10"></hs_TimeCode>
Prime Minister kindly agreed to meet Tyrell’s mother in
September to try to help matters, but I am afraid to say that it was
not the breakthrough for which we had all hoped.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T21:52:24"></hs_TimeCode> know that the
Foreign Office itself is disappointed with the advice it has given. It
admits that the former team at the Ministry of Justice that managed
such matters has been disbanded, so there is no institutional memory as
to how we should address such cases.
Regretfully<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T21:52:26"></hs_TimeCode>, we
are now told—contrary to the Prime Minister’s own
personal suggestion—that Tyrell’s mother is not eligible
for legal aid as a family member of a victim of crime. Nor would she be
eligible under the Greek system; even if she was, there would be no
guarantee that the person would speak
English<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T21:52:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010625000677" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0004.htm#14010625000677">The
family were then told that there is no public funding for
representation, and so the official advice from Foreign Office
officials was that the family should approach Tyrell’s former
employer—he had a Saturday job at Next—or the
mother’s current employer, a housing association, to ask them to
fund legal advice. When I queried this, the officials simply told me
this was standard practice, so my second question to the Minister is:
will he confirm whether that standard practice is in accordance with
the EU framework that the UK has
ratified<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T21:53:17"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010625000678" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0004.htm#14010625000678">Thankfully,
in the past few weeks some progress has started to be made. Money has
now been made forthcoming from Victim Support. This limited funding,
granted in December, will cover an initial instruction for a Greek
lawyer, yet this £1,800 is the sum total of support we have
given as a nation to this grieving mother in a case where the costs
could reach
€20,000<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T21:53:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010625000679" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0004.htm#14010625000679">I
am also still waiting for a response from the Foreign Office following
its commitment to ask the ambassador to raise this matter with the
Greek authorities; to secure a meeting for the family and myself with
the Greek authority representatives here; to ask the police lead for 
<?notus-xml column=143?>an update; and to speak to the judge in Greece about
meeting the family. Those promises were made at the start of
December.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010625000680" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0004.htm#14010625000680">Sadly<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T21:55:00"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T21:55:00"></hs_TimeCode>,
this is not an unusual case. My final points refer to the protocol that
is supposed to define the treatment of families in such matters. There
is a memorandum of understanding on what should happen in dreadful
cases of a British national being murdered abroad. It was formalised
between the Foreign Office, the Association of Chief Police Officers
and the coroners of England and Wales in 2011. It specifically decrees
that where a matter involves both a British national as a victim and a
British national as a suspect, the UK police can appoint a senior
investigating officer. Indeed, under section 9 of the Offences Against
the Person Act 1861, the suspect can be prosecuted in England
and
Wales<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T21:54:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010625000681" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0004.htm#14010625000681">Despite
the fact that this case meets that test, there has been no involvement
in the investigation of this matter or movement on it by the police in
relation to bringing the case to the UK for trial, even though the
Prime Minister agreed to raise it with the Met. An SIO was finally
appointed when the Prime Minister intervened, but nothing more has
happened. The police have said that, as the Greek police have refused
their help, there is nothing they can do.
That<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T21:55:26"></hs_TimeCode> stands in
contrast to other well-known cases, such as that of Madeleine McCann,
where the Prime Minister’s intervention has rightly been crucial

progress.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010625000682" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0004.htm#14010625000682">Of
concern to me is the failure of the police to act when the defendant
conducted a public interview with the British press that was broadcast
in the UK. I alerted the Met before the broadcast of the film and asked
them to ensure that it would not affect the possibility of a trial
here. I am afraid that that did not happen. The Foreign Office has told

addition to my requests about clarification of the EU legal framework,
I have three requests for the Minister. First, I ask him to request the
Greek authorities to meet me and Tyrell’s family directly to
update them on the status of the investigation and the time scale for
the trial. That this has not happened yet—and, indeed, that no
offer to arrange it has been made, except because of my
request—is I am sure something on which the Minister will wish
to reflect: it should not take a cross MP for our representatives to
want such authorities to speak to a victim’s

will the Minister confirm that the Foreign Office will ensure that
Victim Support has the funds to be able to provide full financial
assistance to ensure Ms Matthews has legal representation in
the trial, or will he and the British Government request, as per the
memorandum of understanding, that the matter is now brought back to UK

I urge the Government to review their protocol for the management of
such cases. We cannot have a fair and just system if only those
families who can 
<?notus-xml column=144?>secure a media presence receive the intervention they need when
something terrible happens to a family member overseas. Baroness
Browning confirmed that the Home Secretary and Prime Minister
intervened in the case of Madeleine McCann because they believed her to
be alive, and their intervention included a commitment to ensure that
the police had what she termed the “necessary
funding”.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010625000687" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0004.htm#14010625000687">Tyrell<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T21:57:52"></hs_TimeCode>

rights of his family and those of other murdered British citizens. It
cannot be beyond the realm of possibility for our Government to have a
clearer and fairer protocol for the provision of appropriate support
and intervention, subject to differences in countries’ legal
systems, to ensure that families have the representation and assistance
that they need. If this involved any of our families, we would wish for
such certainty of assistance, as does Ms Matthews, who faced her first
Christmas without her son this year and who continues to grieve, still
not knowing whether she will be able to see justice done for Tyrell or

is worth saying at the outset that the case is now at the judicial
investigation stage, which means that the police have handed it to the
courts, which will now decide whether further investigation is required
or whether they have enough evidence to proceed. In Greece, that can be
a very long process, and we are doing all we can to ensure that Ms
Matthews and others have as much information as
possible<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T22:04:40"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
also worth pointing out that all the men involved in the incident and
their families are receiving consular assistance. We repeatedly advise
them, however, to speak to their lawyers about anything of a legal
nature. We met three of the families in particular at their request,
and we offered to meet Ms Matthews at any
time<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T22:05:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

for Walthamstow has been deeply concerned about the case of Tyrell
Matthews-Burton, who was tragically killed in Crete last year. I, too,
would like to take this opportunity to extend my deepest sympathies to
Tyrell’s mother, Ms
Matthews<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T22:07:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010625000704" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0004.htm#14010625000704">From
the moment we were informed of Tyrell’s death, officials have
provided extensive support to Ms Matthews. In the immediate aftermath,
consular staff in Crete spent time at the police station, hospital and
court to offer support. The hon. Lady shakes her head in disagreement,
but I am stating the chronology of what happened. It might not have
been enough, but it is what actually happened in the
aftermath<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T22:07:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010625000705" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0004.htm#14010625000705">In
London, teams were in daily contact with the families of those involved
to provide assistance and referrals to organisations such as Victim
Support. Ms Matthews was assigned a caseworker and quickly
issued with a passport, and with the support of one of the charities
that the FCO helps to fund, Missing Abroad, flights to Crete and
accommodation were arranged at no cost to the family. We have continued
to provide full support to Ms Matthews, from repatriating
Tyrell’s body to liaising with Her Majesty’s coroner
following Ms Matthews’s request to see the post mortem
report<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-06T22:08:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010625000706" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0004.htm#14010625000706">One
of the greatest challenges for victims of crime at home and abroad is
gaining access to information. Of course, in the case of crimes
committed overseas, geographic distance, language and procedure are all
added barriers. I know that a lack of information can lead to extreme
frustration, compound anxiety and result in a loss of confidence in the
judicial process of the country involved. That is entirely
understandable. We therefore do what we can to get updates as soon as
possible as well as providing guidance on local systems and procedures.
In Tyrell’s case, consular staff were on hand from the outset to
help liaise with the authorities and provide a range of important
information explaining the local police and legal systems and giving
details of local lawyers and interpreters. Consular officials at the
British 
<?notus-xml column=147?>embassy in Athens have also lobbied for information the Greek Ministries
of Foreign Affairs and of Justice, as well as the Greek police and
judiciary, and have attended some initial meetings. We stand ready to
continue to do that as the family navigates the local system, and to
attend the first day and verdict of any future trial.</hs_Para>

overseas are often different from our own, and unlike in the UK, it may
not be possible for individuals to obtain information directly.
Investigating authorities and courts may refuse to answer inquiries
from third parties, including foreign Governments or consular
officials. For those reasons, we always advise victims of crime
overseas to instruct a local lawyer who can access detailed information
on their client’s behalf, and judge whether an investigation is
conducted in line with local laws. From the outset, we and the Greek
authorities have recommended that Ms Matthews obtain legal
representation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010625000708" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/debtext/140106-0004.htm#14010625000708">I
understand, of course, that appointing a lawyer can put a huge
financial burden on a family—something to which the hon. Member
for Walthamstow alluded. However, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office
cannot fund legal representation. We are simply not resourced to offer
such funding, and in the case of Ms Matthews we have done all we can to
explore alternative legal aid options in the United Kingdom and Greece,
including offering advice on the EU compensation scheme. Following the
meeting between the hon. Lady, Ms Matthews, and my right hon. Friend
the Prime Minister, I am pleased that work to identify a lawyer and
funding from Victim Support has enabled Ms Matthews to appoint a Greek
lawyer.</hs_Para>

to address the concerns raised by the hon. Lady that the UK police
could do more, and that a senior investigating officer and family
liaison officer were not appointed at the outset. In 2012 the British
Government agreed a memorandum of understanding with the Association of
Chief Police Officers and the Coroners’ Society of England and
Wales regarding support in murder/manslaughter cases. It sets out
Government support to the next of kin, including what we can do to
ensure a proper and thorough investigation. The MOU is clear that the
UK police cannot investigate a crime overseas unless invited by a
foreign Government to do so. Even in cases where a suspect is British,
the jurisdiction of the country where the crime took place takes
precedence.</hs_Para>

get involved only exceptionally where there is a genuine operational
need, such as securing forensic samples or conducting formal inquiries
on behalf of foreign police in the UK, and that was not the case
following Tyrell’s death. It is an operational decision for the
police whether to appoint a senior investigating officer or family
liaison officer. In this case, the police initially decided to identify
an officer as the single point of contact. Following the intervention
of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Greek police assigned an
individual to liaise with the Met police and, as a result, a senior
investigating officer and family liaison officer were duly appointed.
However, as the investigation in Greece has been completed and the file
now lies with the judicial authorities, as I said at the outset of my
remarks, there is little information to be shared through that
channel.</hs_Para>

British Government cannot interfere in trials or legal processes in
other countries. We would not accept other countries doing that in the
UK, and we therefore need to respect their systems. In some
circumstances, however, we will continue to make representations to
local authorities where appropriate. That includes cases where there
are concerns that the investigation is not being carried out in line
with local procedures. We stand ready to do that in this case should
the need arise. Meanwhile, we will continue to raise the case more

May I press him on the point about the EU framework on the decision on
the rights of victims of crime, which has been fully in force since

regard to the Greek authorities’ behaviour towards the Matthews

officials give me an assurance on that specific point? Will he clarify
that the conduct of the Foreign Office in the matter—it failed

Secondly, to answer her other question, it is my understanding that the

or opposition plans to change the policy—if any party did, it
would be a significant change and one we should be aware of. We do
everything we can within the existing guidelines, but, as I have said,

Secretary of State for Health (Mr Jeremy Hunt):</Member></B> On 30
December 2013, I published a response to the recent consultation on
proposed changes to the way temporary migrants and visitors access the
NHS in England. The response sets out initial decisions and next steps,
taking account of feedback received during the consultation as well as
the results of independent research on visitor and migrant use of the
NHS that we commissioned in parallel with the consultation and which we
published on 22
October<Sup>1</Sup>.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1401067000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/wmstext/140106m0001.htm#1401067000059">The
independent research was commissioned to provide, for the first time, a
reliable estimate of visitor and migrant health care costs,
in particular the costs of provision for those who should be charged,
and for “health tourism” where visitors have an explicit
intention of obtaining extensive health care without due payment. This
research provides a compelling case for new and more robust and
consistent administrative processes and systems to be
introduced.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1401067000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/wmstext/140106m0001.htm#1401067000060">The
consultation was launched on 3 July at the same time as a linked
consultation, “Migrant Access to Health Services in the
UK” from the Home Office. Both consultations put forward the
proposal that non-EEA temporary migrants should in future contribute to
the costs of their health care. The Immigration Bill includes a
provision to introduce the immigration health surcharge on a UK-wide
basis to allow people to make this contribution with minimal
operational impact or burden on the
NHS.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1401067000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/wmstext/140106m0001.htm#1401067000061">The
consultation also sought views on whether any changes should be made to
the categories of non-residents who should be exempted from charges. A
proposal to provide more generous exemptions to ex-pats, many of whom
should be charged for treatment provided when returning on visits,
received broad support. The response proposes to confirm the principle
that exemptions should be consistent with criteria applied to UK
pensions and other state benefits, but further work is required to
confirm specific qualifying criteria and financial
impact.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1401067000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/wmstext/140106m0001.htm#1401067000062">The
open review of current exemptions generated requests for a number of
new or extended exemptions for maternity, victims of domestic and other
violence as well as victims of human trafficking and children. The
response commits my Department to give further thought to the
exemptions for victims of domestic and other violence and of human
trafficking, seeking the views of relevant agencies and advisers as
appropriate.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1401067000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/wmstext/140106m0001.htm#1401067000063">We
do not intend to establish an exemption for children or for pregnant
women. In both cases we believe there is significant risk of abuse by
visitors either seeking maternity care for themselves or care for their
children with existing serious illnesses, and may act as a draw to
illegal migrant families. We will listen to arguments about how best to
cover other vulnerable children who might otherwise be unable to access
treatment. All of these potential changes will be subject to further
final cabinet approval following further
evaluation.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1401067000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/wmstext/140106m0001.htm#1401067000064">The
consultation also proposed extending the scope of NHS services for
which charges should apply for non-exempt visitors. Charges currently
can only be 
<?notus-xml column=6?>made for most secondary care in hospitals. In primary care, we will
retain free access to GP consultations. We expect GP practices to
participate actively in the administration of the new system for
identifying and recording chargeable
patients.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1401067000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/wmstext/140106m0001.htm#1401067000065">The
response signals our commitment to charge visitors for treatment in
hospital A&amp;Es, but this will not be introduced until improved
systems can support its effective administration, including the safe
and efficient delivery of A&amp;E services, avoiding unintended
charging of legitimate residents and ensuring immediately necessary
treatment is not refused. It also confirms the
intention to extend charging to other services and treatment that are
part of primary care, including community-based health care,
prescriptions and dental services (that are already subject to charges
for many residents). Officials will work with the NHS to determine how
appropriate and cost-effective non-resident charging should be defined
and
administered.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1401067000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/wmstext/140106m0001.htm#1401067000066">Finally,
the response reinforces the need to make significant improvements in
how the NHS manages and administers the charging and recovery process.
Sir Keith Pearson, the independent NHS advisor to the visitor and
migrant NHS cost recovery programme, and the director of cost recovery
are working in partnership with external NHS experts and stakeholders
to design and roll out proportionate, cost-effective and operationally
successful
implementation.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1401067000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/wmstext/140106m0001.htm#1401067000067">All

currency. We therefore support efforts to achieve that as long as the
UK’s interests are protected. My priority at this Council was to
ensure that, just as the UK is out of the EU eurozone bailout
mechanism, so there can be no financial liability for the UK from
banking union or from any future euro area mechanism of loans or
guarantees for eurozone countries. This is reflected in the conclusions

I made it clear that when future countries join the EU we must look
again at the transitional arrangements for the free movement of
workers, and my preference to look at options such as much longer
transitional periods and new benchmarks that would need to be met. I
also made the case for returning the principle of free movement to a
more sensible basis and making it clear that it should never be a
completely unqualified right but should be what the EU first
envisaged—the free movement of workers, not of those after the
best benefit deal. This is not just the view of the UK. At the recent
meeting of 
<?notus-xml column=8?>Interior Ministers, Germany, Austria and the Netherlands all made it
clear that we need to find a better approach to tackle free movement

1. Figures are rounded to the nearest 10. 2. Data are to the
30 June 2013 which is the latest available information.  3.
Sanction applied: New sanctions rules came into force for JSA from 22
October 2012. The number of sanctions applied is the number of low,
intermediate and high-level referrals where the decision was found
against the claimant. Further information can be found here:
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jobseekers-allowane-overview-of-sanctions-rules. 
4. The decision to apply a sanction can be overturned following
reconsideration or appeal.  5. All figures may include
individuals who have had more than one sanction decision e.g. if an
individual has a sanction applied and another sanction overturned
following an appeal then they will appear twice.<I>

assessment includes a breakdown of the £4.71 million equivalent
annual net cost to business in table one. The principal cost to
business comes from tackling illegal immigration in privately rented

policy is intended to reduce the availability of accommodation for
those intending to stay illegally in the UK, and tackle the
exploitation of migrants by rogue landlords. Further detailed analysis
of the cost to business that results from the measures in the Bill

inconsistent with the principle of subsidiarity. Food and material aid

would not be additional money, but would be taken from a member state's
Structural Funds allocation. The UK would receive the minimum
allocation of €3.5 million which would be taken from its

assistance and social security. Social security benefits fall within
the scope of EU Regulation 883/2004 and EU Regulation 1408/71 on
co-ordination of social security systems. The regulations provide that
social security benefits relate to specific areas such as unemployment
and sickness. Social assistance benefits fall outside the scope of
those regulations. European Court of Justice case-law has developed the
definition of social assistance benefits. Social assistance is provided
in order to ensure a minimum means of subsistence as a result of an
assessment of personal needs and circumstances. The case law
distinguishes social security benefits on the basis that they are
linked to certain branches of social security and are granted or
refused on the basis of objective, legally defined
criteria.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="14010631000016" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/text/140106w0002.htm#14010631000016">Food

Webb:</Member></B> The Department for Work and Pensions does not pay
increases on guaranteed minimum pensions (GMPs). GMPs are occupational
pension scheme benefits 
<?notus-xml column=51?>which were accrued between 1978 and 1997. Pension
schemes are liable for any statutory indexation of GMPs, and this
liability will not change as a result of the single tier reforms. The
Department for Work and Pensions pays state pension benefits and their
indexation, including additional state pension (SERPS and S2P) and
basic state
pension.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010631000232" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/text/140106w0002.htm#14010631000232">Additional
state pension and GMPs are linked in that when a person reaches
pensionable age, the total amount of GMP is subtracted from the total
amount of additional state pension built up between 1978 and 1997, and
any net amount is paid. This subtraction of the total GMP amount is
called a ‘contracted-out deduction’, and reflects that
reduced national insurance was paid during the period of contracting
out in return for meeting legislative requirements. This calculation is
performed each year that the pension is
payable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010631000233" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/text/140106w0002.htm#14010631000233">There
is no statutory obligation on schemes to pay increases on GMPs accrued
between 1978 and 1988. However, additional state pension built up
during that period is subject to increases. When the contracted-out
deduction is subtracted from the additional state pension, the
remaining additional state pension includes an increase linked to
prices. In this way, an amount broadly equivalent to the GMP, but which
is in fact additional state pension, is subject to an increase. Schemes
are under an obligation to pay increases on GMPs accrued between 1988
and 1997, subject to a cap of
3%.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010631000234" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/text/140106w0002.htm#14010631000234">With
the introduction of single tier, the additional state pension will
close, as will the facility to contract out. For those reaching state
pension age from April 2016, we will value their national insurance
record to that point. We will compare what state pension the
single-tier rules would give them with what they have built up as at
April 2016 under the current system. The higher of these two valuations
will become the individual’s ‘foundation
amount’.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010631000235" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/text/140106w0002.htm#14010631000235">As
set out in the White Paper, the design of the transition will benefit
many people with a history of contracting out. In effect, these
individuals may be able to offset their contracted-out deduction with
further qualifying years until they reach the full amount of single
tier. This means that many individuals who have previously been
contracted-out may receive more state pension than they would have
under the current
system.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010631000236" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/text/140106w0002.htm#14010631000236">The
Department estimates that over 2 million people will reach state
pension age in the five years after the introduction of single tier, of
whom around 40% to 45% will have been contracted out of private and
public sector defined benefit schemes between 1978 and 1988. From 1988
onwards, the facility to contract out was extended to people in defined
contribution schemes. By the mid 2030s over 80% of people reaching
state pension age will have had a deduction for being contracted out
factored into their transitional calculations and many will be able to
benefit from the transition described above, as well as from the
indexation arrangements for single tier compared to the current
arrangements for additional pension and basic state
pension.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010631000237" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/text/140106w0002.htm#14010631000237">The

late 2030s. The impacts of the single tier reforms have been captured
in the impact assessment for single tier, which is
published

end-to-end assessment process, from DWP referring the case to the
assessment provider to the assessment report being returned to DWP,
should be completed within 30 working days in 97% of cases with on
average no case taking longer than 40 working days. The key requirement

delivery, including quality of assessments and the number of days to
provide advice to the Department. The contracts include a range of

However, using the service may be less than straightforward for

poverty, the Department—jointly with the Department for Energy

the success of any such body would be its independence from government.

take root in the education sector, including those under the aegis of
the Prince's Teaching Institute, and we look forward to seeing their
proposal when it is published in the new

currently. Six of the seven free schools opened in September 2013 and
therefore only have pupils in year 12. All these new free schools have
been funded on a single year to take in year 12. The London Academy of
Excellence opened in academic year 2012/13. A total of 1,210 planned
pupils are funded at the seven 16-19 free schools for 2013/14. The
details at institution level of funding, and the number of pupils
funded and enrolled are shown in the following table. All open
academies and free schools will have their budgets adjusted upwards and
downwards within the terms of their funding agreements based upon the
number of pupils recorded in their census. Where academies are funded
on the basis of their estimate of pupil numbers in the coming year, an
adjustment will be made, in accordance with their funding agreement, if
the estimate is different from the numbers on the pupil census. This
adjustment could be positive or negative and where it is negative the
funding is recovered from the academy.</hs_Para>

Timpson:</Member></B> The Government considers that a new duty on local
authorities is not necessary because the new provisions and investment,
which were listed in a previous question from the hon. Member for
Birmingham, Selly Oak (Steve McCabe), and answered on 17 December 2013,
<I>Official Report,</I> column 587W, will deliver real improvements for
adoptive families. The Department understands that such a duty on local
authorities could seem an attractive option. However, we believe a duty
could also incentivise perverse behaviour; for example, local
authorities might be more likely to under-assess support needs if they
had to then find the funding to meet these needs. Without introducing
extra bureaucracy, this would make the experience for adoptive families
worse, not better.</hs_Para>

September 2013 we announced that we would be investing £19.3
million in the creation of an Adoption Support Fund which avoids these
perverse incentives. By adding significant extra money into the system,
the Fund will help to improve access to, and the provision 
<?notus-xml column=80?>of, adoption support services. It will enable local authorities to
assess properly and consistently in the knowledge that there is enough
money available to pay for what the child needs, including more
expensive, proven packages of support. In addition, we expect that the
Fund will help to stimulate and grow the market for adoption support
providers by acting as a commissioner of services. It will also help to
incentivise investment by local authorities and from charitable and
philanthropic organisations/individuals. These benefits would not be
realised through a duty to

statutory guidance to replace 'Safeguarding Children and Safer

responsibility to ensure they have a culture of safety and that pupils

part of the reforms to the national curriculum, the Department for
Education is strengthening the requirements to teach e-safety via the
new computing programmes of study. Computing is replacing ICT as a core
national curriculum subject and will be mandatory at all key stages
from September 2014. This will see e-safety, for the first time, being
taught to primary school pupils-from age 5 to 11 in key stages 1 and
2-rather than leaving this until secondary
school.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010631001344" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/text/140106w0003.htm#14010631001344">Teachers

<?notus-xml column=84?>children and young people to increase their understanding of online

transferred into the Business Rates Retention system (from the 2013-14

Department in 2013-14 and 2014-15. In 2013-14, this money has been
allocated to local authorities via the adoption reform grant. In
2014-15, £70 million is to be allocated to local authorities via
a new special educational needs reform grant, and £50 million
via the continuation of the adoption reform grant. Both of these grants
are unringfenced. We will be giving further details shortly on how the

is scheduled to be rolled out to the majority of claimants during 2016
and 2017, will mean that the current entitlement criteria for free
school meals will no longer apply. We are currently working with the
Department for Work and Pensions to simplify free school meals criteria
under universal credit, while making sure that free lunches continue to
be available to those families on the lowest incomes. The move to
universal credit will not reduce the number of children entitled to

increase at 2%. As well as doubling small business rate relief for a
further year to March 2015, we will relax the rate relief criteria to
remove the disincentive for the smallest businesses to take on second
properties. Other measures to support high streets include tackling
aggressive and unhelpful parking policies, a review of business
improvement districts, consultations on new permitted development

radioactive materials (NORM) will depend on the scale of production,
which cannot be estimated until there is exploratory drilling and
testing. In the US disposal of NORM is regulated state by state and in
some includes reinjection of waste waters underground, a practice that
is not permitted in the UK. In the UK, we have established regulatory
processes for disposal of NORM and, as with mining or mineral
processing, the relevant environmental regulator is responsible for
assessing the risk, if any, from NORM at any particular site and
licensing or permitting activities appropriately. Water UK, who
represent the water industry and the UK Onshore Operators Group, have
recently signed a memorandum of understanding to work together to help
minimise the impact of onshore oil and gas development in the UK on the
country's water resources, this includes the expected volumes,
composition of waste water and preferred disposal routes. UK Water
Industry Research are modelling the demand for waste water services to

The figure of £21 billion is made up of costs to the national
health service in England, costs of alcohol-related crime in England
and lost productivity across the United Kingdom. The inclusion of lost
productivity in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland means that the
estimate for costs as a proportion of gross value added (GVA) in
England will be overstated, albeit only
slightly.</hs_brev><hs_brev UID="1401072001035" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/text/140106w0005.htm#1401072001035"><Sup>2</Sup>
Official estimates of gross domestic product (GDP) are not produced for
England. GVA is used in the estimation of GDP. GVA is equal to GDP less
the value of taxes on products and plus the value of subsidies on
products. GVA measures the value added by units engaged in production
and is the difference between the value of goods and services produced
(output) and the cost of raw materials and other inputs which are used
up in production (intermediate consumption).</hs_brev>

breaches the GLA's

only advise the employer to repay the money to the affected workers as
the GLA does not have the power to recover any arrears of pay on behalf

help businesses to grow. At a local level, we are simplifying business
support by supporting the development of Growth Hubs—a single

co-ordination of support provided by public and private sector
partners, creating a more streamlined and coherent offer for

Cheryl Gillan</B> (Chesham and Amersham) (Con):</Member> I have spoken
to the Leader of the House on several occasions about my concerns over
the environmental statement on HS2 that has been issued by the
Department for Transport. The fact that it is tens of thousands of
pages long is putting great strain on our environmental organisations,
because the Department has given them only eight weeks over the
Christmas period in which to respond to it. Furthermore, the memory
sticks containing those tens of thousands of pages had to be recalled
because of omissions and errors, and new ones had to be issued. Will
the Leader of the House allow a debate on the possibility of extending
the consultation period
immediately?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010621000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/corrtext/140106c0001.htm#14010621000021"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Lansley" PimsId="1419" UID="14010621000034" xid="347" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/corrtext/140106c0001.htm#14010621000034">Mr
