would leave the United Kingdom and all its institutions, including the

that the Scottish vote will be in favour of the union but, surely, all
eventualities need to be catered for. If Scotland votes for
independence, it would be inappropriate for there to be Scottish
MPs at Westminster thereafter. What precisely are
the arrangements before implementation of Scottish independence, should

original Answer, there would be a process of negotiation. Obviously,
laws passed by this Parliament set out the arrangements for elections
and it would be a matter for Parliament to change the arrangements if
it so wished. I take the first point of my noble friend’s
Question. I think I say for colleagues on all sides of the House that,
while we support the integrity of the United Kingdom, we should be
making every effort to ensure that the eventuality of a yes
vote in the independence referendum simply does not
arise<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T15:08:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012956000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0001.htm#14012956000005"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord McConnell of Glenscorrodale" PimsId="5764" UID="14012956000308" xid="2044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0001.htm#14012956000308">Lord
McConnell of Glenscorrodale (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, one issue
that those Members of Parliament might have to address in that
eventuality would be the position in relation to the currency. Does the
noble and learned Lord welcome the very thoughtful and balanced
contribution to the debate on the currency in Scotland made today by
the Governor of the Bank of England? Will he join me in urging others
who head up our great national institutions, whether in Scotland or
throughout the UK, to contribute in a similar fashion to ensure 
<?notus-xml column=1202?>that the complexities of the decisions that are required afterwards are
fully understood and that the people in Scotland have all the
information they need to make the right
decision<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T15:09:30"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012956000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0001.htm#14012956000006"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Wallace of Tankerness" PimsId="5278" UID="14012956000309" xid="1977" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0001.htm#14012956000309">Lord
Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> My Lords, as the Chancellor of the
Exchequer has previously said, the current arrangements of a full
monetary, fiscal and political union bring benefits to all parts of the
United Kingdom. I certainly have noted that the Governor of the Bank of
England today has highlighted the principal difficulties of entering
into a currency union—losing national sovereignty, the practical
risks of financial instability and having to provide fiscal support to
bail out a foreign country. That is why we have consistently said that,
in the event of independence, a currency union is highly unlikely to be
agreed so the Scottish Government need a plan B. I agree with the noble
Lord, Lord McConnell, that people who, from experience, have an
important contribution to make should make it. Indeed, this month,
<I>Better Together</I> has published a very good pamphlet which quotes
many people showing how untenable the position of the Scottish
Government is on the issue of the
currency.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012956000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0001.htm#14012956000007"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T15:09:49"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Stephen" PimsId="5941" UID="14012956000310" xid="2148" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0001.htm#14012956000310">Lord

substantial no vote in the referendum in September and that we set out
the benefits. Ahead of the debate in your Lordships’ House
tomorrow morning, I hope later this afternoon to send out to noble
Lords the 20 positive reasons—there are many more—that my
right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Scotland set out
earlier this month together with links to the 10 analysis papers
published so far in Scotland, which make a very compelling case for the

O'Neill of Bengarve (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, does the noble and
learned Lord agree that even in the event of a no vote in Scotland,
which I very much hope for, there are questions to be addressed about
our variegated devolution settlements with parts of the United Kingdom?
Does he not further agree that thought about that should take place now
rather than in a rush after an unexpected and unhoped for yes

Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> The noble Baroness makes an
important point. There are important issues about our current
constitutional arrangements in all parts of the United Kingdom. The
Government have shown by our implementation of the Calman report
proposals, through the Scotland Act 2012 and the way 
<?notus-xml column=1203?>that we are taking forward the proposals of the Silk commission in
relation to Wales that we are alert to these. But I am certain that a
no vote in September will not bring an end to these discussions. All
parties and even people without parties have an important contribution
to make to those

McFall of Alcluith (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, if there is a yes
vote, it is important to remember that the rest of the United Kingdom
will be diminished as a result; with one-fifth of our land mass, 5
million of our population and 10% of our GDP. The big picture is that
both national and international issues are involved. Therefore, the
voices of the Scottish diaspora need to be mobilised, and also the
voices of the English, the Welsh and the Northern Irish who value an
entity that is greater than the sum of its
parts<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T15:13:35"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T15:13:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012956000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0001.htm#14012956000012"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Wallace of Tankerness" PimsId="5278" UID="14012956000315" xid="1977" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0001.htm#14012956000315">Lord
Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> My Lords, I could not agree more
with the noble Lord. It is important that people not only from the
diaspora but from other parts of the United Kingdom speak up and say
how valued Scotland is as part of a family of nations, which is one of
the great success stories of modern history. Scotland is obviously
better within the United Kingdom, but the United Kingdom is also better
with Scotland in
it<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T15:13:58"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T15:14:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012956000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0001.htm#14012956000013"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Forsyth of Drumlean" PimsId="3285" UID="14012956000316" xid="1225" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0001.htm#14012956000316">Lord
Forsyth of Drumlean (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, does my noble and

to my noble friend Lord Flight’s question is symptomatic of the
fantasy politics that they are putting forward? When he asks what the
position of Scottish MPs would be in the House of Commons if they were
elected after a vote for independence, their official policy is that we

that. I am not quite sure what it says about democracy—that
people should be denied the chance to elect new Members of Parliament.
I also bear in mind that the date that they set for this referendum was

Is he aware that ChildLine reported a 69% increase in this form of

ChildLine rather than go to their school to have this matter addressed?
Is he aware that ChildLine further said that it links this specifically
to the intemperate language being used around immigration and with
Muslim children being called “bombers” and
“terrorists”? Will this be specifically taken up and

Social security sanctions claimants and cuts their benefits if they
break the rules, say on JSA, in order to change their behaviour. But
the 660,000 families affected, whose existing housing benefit is being
cut by the bedroom tax, cannot change their behaviour because there is
nowhere smaller for most of them to go. Two-thirds of them are, in any
case, disabled, and may need the extra space. Discretionary housing
payments, on which the Minister properly relies, can help only a
minority even of disabled people. Does the Minister really think it
fair to sanction existing tenants for misbehaviour when they have not
misbehaved and when they cannot change their behaviour? Are we not
punishing people who have done no wrong but who, as they face eviction,
are having wrong done to them? Is that now social security’s

Gateshead, spent roughly 69% of DHP in the first half-year and put in
an application for further DHP that we were pleased to match with
another £130,000. This meant that it could spend roughly the

contrasts with the area that the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, is very

authorities are responding to the challenge. Places such as Warrington
and Salford are converting empty office space. They are purchasing and
improving long-term empty two-bedroom homes. Derby has a home-release
scheme that provides tenants with money to move—£500 for
removal costs, for example. Many local authorities have revised their

Answer, but is he aware of the recently published Macmillan Cancer
Support report, which shows that up to as many as 10,000 cancer
patients die needlessly each year because of blatant ageism among
doctors? For example, recommendations for chemotherapy 
<?notus-xml column=1209?>diminish by as much as half if you are over 70. Since we are an ageing
population and half of all new cancer diagnoses are in people over 70,
does the Minister agree that it is of the utmost importance that we

right that a series of reports has shown that the NHS has too often
failed to provide the best possible services to older people. We cannot
save lives without tackling inequalities. The NHS has a statutory duty
to reduce health inequalities and to improve the health of those with
the poorest outcomes. A ban on age discrimination in the NHS services
was introduced in 2012, meaning that NHS services need to do everything
they can to ensure that they do not discriminate against older people.

am uninterested—I listened to every word, as I always
do—but because in the coalition Government I share attendance at
Question Time with my coalition partner, the noble Lord, Lord Newby,
which is why he was here today. That is why I was not in the House
earlier<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T15:41:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012956000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0001.htm#14012956000062">The
noble Lord asked a question about minimum intervals and, in the same
breath, referred to Committee having not yet concluded. He also
referred to Committee being scheduled for a later date than this coming
Friday. I gently remind the House of a couple of things. First, there
is a straightforward answer to all this. Matters concerning the
intervals of Bills are not considered until one has secured Committee.
This House has not concluded Committee, and matters to do with when
Report or other stages might be follow at the end of Committee. That is
the normal
procedure.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012956000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0001.htm#14012956000063">Secondly,
the noble Lord refers to different dates. I took the chance to check
what I said last week—I thought that my memory was okay, but we
like to be sure. Towards the end of Committee on Friday, I referred to
the fact that we would continue Committee on the Bill next Friday, 31
January, at 10 am. It is at col. 957 of <I>Hansard</I>. I expressed my
expectation that Committee stage would finish on that day, this Friday,
and I believe it was a realistic assumption given the rate of progress
of business last week. It is still my reasonable assumption that
Committee will conclude this Friday, and it is at that stage that
matters to do with other stages will be considered. That is the time to
do it, not

it ever was the case that she was following our precedent, she has now

clear that the normal gap between Committee and Report is 14 days.
Although this is the normal gap, it would be particularly so in the
case of a Bill with considerable constitutional implications. It seems
that even if Committee were completed this Friday—when I, sadly,
have to report to the House that I am again unable to attend, which is
why I make no apologies for making this point now—14 days could
not mean that the Committee stage was considered the following Friday,
or on the two Fridays after that because they are in the Recess. The
earliest I can see that it could be, in keeping with the normal

Anelay of St Johns:</Member></B> My Lords, my answer remains
straightforward because I like to be a straightforward kind of person.
I am giving the answer that any government Chief Whip would give at
this stage. Matters of further stages are not considered until the end
of Committee, which should conclude on Friday. I believe that that is a
reasonable expectation. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, will
give an undertaking that it is his expectation as well. The noble Lord,
Lord Grocott, refers to my praying him in aid. I do so with genuine
respect, because I respect him as a government Chief Whip. I
particularly recall that when he was government Chief Whip, he
frequently called in the other Chief Whips, the Convener and Members of
the Cross Benches, to ensure that his guidance that at least three
groups an hour should be considered in Committee was
maintained.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14012956000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0001.htm#14012956000076">I
give a straightforward answer. Nothing further should be said by a
government Chief Whip at this stage because it would be pre-empting any
decision that may be made and making assumptions about Friday that it
would be wrong to make. My expectation is that Committee will finish
and I think the House has wearied of going around the same route.
Again, there is only one answer, to which I will adhere because it is
the right answer.</hs_para>

later in life because, as we know, the harm to the health of a smoker
may not be immediate but may manifest after several years of addiction.
Ministers may also consider whether regulations may contribute to
reducing the risk of harm to those aged 18 or over, so we could also
take into account whether standardised tobacco packaging might help

shall summarise these amendments. We intend to create a new offence of
the proxy purchase of tobacco, which is buying tobacco on behalf of
someone underage. Nicotine is highly addictive and it is wrong in
principle for adults to be buying cigarettes on behalf of children. We
need to close common routes of supply to children. We know that proxy
purchasing is a common problem and we need to take clear action to
tackle it. There was considerable support for tackling proxy purchasing
when it was debated in the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing
Bill. We have also listened carefully to the views of retailers and
their representative organisations on this issue.</hs_para>

decided to table an amendment to enable us to make regulations to
prohibit the sale of electronic cigarettes to people aged under 18.
E-cigarettes deliver nicotine, a highly addictive substance, albeit in
a safer way than smoked tobacco. We know that some young people in
England are using these products and there is nothing stopping their
sale to people under 18. Some in the public health community are very
concerned that e-cigarettes could act as a gateway into smoking
tobacco, and that their use and promotion can undermine our efforts to
reshape the social norms around tobacco use. The revised European
tobacco products directive, which achieved political agreement in
December last year, covers e-cigarettes but does not include an age of
sale restriction. We therefore want to do this domestically through the

57BB concerns the proposal that it be an offence for any person who
drives a vehicle to fail to prevent smoking in the vehicle where a
child or children are present. I do this on the basis that the past 15
years have seen an impressive reduction in the amount of smoking in
this country. Indeed, since the previous Government’s 1998
<I>Smoking Kills</I> action plan, smoking rates among children, who
are, of course, the focus of this Bill, have fallen by more than half
following a period of little progress lasting 20 years. I have little
doubt that the ban on advertising was pivotal, but the fall was also
due to a series of other concerned measures which included an increase
in the age of sale, picture warnings on packs and an above-inflation
increase in tobacco duty to reduce affordability.</hs_para>

with the issue of smoking in cars. My answer to the noble Lord is that
we will deal with both issues in one debate. The House always has to
trade off having separate debates on individual amendments or pulling
them together. I, for one, think it is better that we have a wider

Hunt of Kings Heath:</Member></B> My Lords, they are two different
issues. I certainly do not propose that we legislate in relation to
people’s homes. The differences lie, first, in the scale of the
health issue. As I have already indicated, the amount of second-hand
smoke that a young person is likely to inhale in a car generally will
be very much higher than in a person’s home. Secondly, by and
large there are usually rooms in a person’s home that are not
used for smoking, so there is more of an element of choice. I accept
that this is a continuum, but I assure the noble Lord that it is not 
<?notus-xml column=1223?>my intention to propose a ban on smoking in people’s homes. There
are specific circumstances that make the banning of smoking in cars
while children are present a particular health
issue.</hs_para>

Cormack (Con):</Member></B> I am grateful to the noble Lord. Surely, my
noble friend Lord Forsyth highlighted a very important point. He talked
about small flats; there are small flats where there may be several
children and only one living room. What is the logic of the noble
Lord’s argument in that case? Personally, I do not think we
should invade private space; that is my position and I may seek to
defend it later. There is no logical difference between a single child
in a car and four children in the living room of a small
flat.</hs_para>

Hunt of Kings Heath:</Member></B> My Lords, I do not accept that.
Clearly, in relation to a child travelling in a car we are going to

private entity in which the state ought not to intervene, or whether
noble Lords consider that a child’s health becomes the paramount
concern.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14012956000113" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0001.htm#14012956000113">A

Forsyth of Drumlean:</Member></B> I do not want to prolong the noble
Lord’s speech; I am not making a debating point, but am
genuinely interested in his logic. A child in a car—which I
accept is a very confined space—will probably be in a car for a
short journey. If children are in a living room, they are there all
evening. Perhaps I should declare an interest; my late mother used to
smoke 60 cigarettes a day. That is one of the reasons why I would never
touch a cigarette. Surely, if a child is in a small living room in
which continuous smoking is going on, that seems to me, without any
evidence, to be as great a health hazard as being in a car. I am not
advocating invading private space, but where is the evidence that
supports what the noble Lord is saying—namely, that it is a much
worse hazard being in a car, probably on a short journey, than being in
a living room where smoking goes on all day?</hs_para>

the length of the average car journey, though clearly short and long
distances may be travelled during which smoking may take place. I
suspect that we can argue that until the cows come home. However, I
come back to the core argument that in a confined space, such as a car,
a child is likely to be more damaged through inhaling second-hand smoke
than they are in a person’s home. That is the reason for making

Cyril, at the conclusion of this review in March, to undertake a
similar review of the effects of second-hand smoke on children
travelling in cars? There is plenty of evidence out there but what is
now needed is the clinical evidence that shows that smoke causes
long-term damage. We know that the long-term sequelae from smoking in
adults are quite severe. If we can demonstrate that they start at a

for overseeing a significant change in government policy on the subject
of standard packaging. Like many of your Lordships, I was heartened
when I heard the then Public Health Minister, Anna Soubry, around a

public. As we have heard from the Minister, smoking-related disease

most common form of preventable death—it accounts for more
premature deaths than the next six most common causes put

Two-thirds of existing smokers report that they started before their
18th birthday, and around two in five before they were 16. The younger
the age at which they start, the greater the harm is likely to be,
because the early uptake of the habit is associated with subsequent
heavier smoking—of the sort that the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth,
experienced with his mother and her 60-a-day habit—high levels
of dependency, a lower chance of quitting and a higher chance of death

the restrictive legislation around marketing and advertising tobacco in
the UK, the industry is left with few options to promote its products.
Of these, the most important is now packaging. Packs can be used to
market and advertise, to create brand identities and to help present an
image of smoking that may indeed seem “cool” to a curious
teenager. There are many diversionary arguments advanced by the tobacco
industry and the front groups it funds so lavishly about why we should
not proceed with standardised packaging. So we hear tobacco industry
claims that the UK is being flooded with illicit tobacco and that
standard packs will make the problem worse. But the level of illicit
trade has fallen sharply since it peaked back in 2000, and the security
features on existing packs will also be present on standard ones. Both
our amendment and the Government’s would allow the Secretary of
State to specify packaging requirements that would enhance and not
reduce product security, and make smuggling and counterfeiting more
difficult.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012956000148" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0001.htm#14012956000148">However,
the tobacco industry’s real, core argument is quite simple. It
is advancing the proposition that its claimed so-called
“intellectual property rights” trump the requirements of
public health—or to put it more sharply, that its right to
design products designed to get children addicted is more important
than the children’s right to be protected from that addiction
and the health damage that it causes. I believe that the overwhelming
majority of your Lordships, and indeed Members of the other place,
reject the tobacco industry’s arguments and want to make
cigarettes as unattractive to children and young people as possible.
So, as I said at the beginning, I warmly welcome the

the beginning of these debates, some noble Lords raised questions about
the logic of including an amendment on the packaging of cigarettes in a
Bill whose stated remit is children and families. To my mind, the
relevance is unequivocal—this is the very nub of the issue,
which is why we are discussing it today. Preventing the uptake of
smoking among the young is primarily an issue of child protection. As
we have already heard today, each year around 200,000 under-16s take up
smoking. For some, it is the start of a lifetime of addiction which
will result in debilitating health conditions and, for some in turn,
premature mortality. As the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, pointed out,
many of those children will come from particularly deprived
backgrounds. We have already heard about children in care and I would
draw your Lordships’ attention to teenage mothers, who,
according to an ONS survey, are six times more likely than the average

packaging, bearing clear anti-smoking messages, is the first key step
to reducing the attractiveness of this lethal habit to children and
young people. As we have just heard from the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner,
we should be absolutely clear that tobacco packaging and branding is
not innocuous. It is undoubtedly, at the moment, targeted at the
young—the industry documents released in the USA about this were
very telling indeed, although I do not intend to repeat the details of
that. Equally critically, the weight of evidence is mounting that
standardised packaging does work to reduce the incidence of smoking. I
was very persuaded by the Department of Health’s systematic
literature review, which found that, compared to current cigarette
packs, standardised packs are less attractive to young people, improve
the effectiveness of health warnings 
<?notus-xml column=1231?>and reduce the mistaken belief that some brands are safer than others. I
eagerly look forward to the outcome of the review by Sir Cyril
Chantler, who will look at all of this in the round. I will be very
surprised if he does not come out supporting the various literature
reviews that we have already
seen.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012956000154" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0001.htm#14012956000154">Very

privilege of meeting with Nicola Roxon, the former Australian Minister
for Health who was instrumental in the implementation of standardised
packaging there. I was very impressed as she explained to us the impact
that standardised packaging was having as part of—this is
absolutely critical—a wider anti-smoking strategy in no longer
portraying smoking as cool and glamorous or cigarettes as a
“must have” accessory, but instead portraying a much less
desirable, and far more truthful,
image.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012956000155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0001.htm#14012956000155">It is
revealing that hard data are already coming from
Australia—something that I am sure Sir Cyril will want to look
at. A study in Victoria, Australia, published in the <I>British Medical
Journal</I>, concluded that when consuming cigarettes from the new
packs, smokers are 66% more likely to think their cigarettes were of
poorer quality, 70% more likely to say they found them less satisfying
and 81% more likely to have thought about quitting at least once a day.
Why is that? Because standardised packs carry powerful health messages
that expose the reality of smoking. Frankly, having seen some of the
images, it would take a very strong stomach or tightly closed eyes to
be unaffected by
them.</hs_para><hs_time UID="14012956000289" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0001.htm#14012956000289">4.45

a few words in support of Amendment 62 on smoking in cars, which my
noble friend Lord Ribeiro has already covered very eloquently. For me
the nub of the issue is that as a nation we have recognised the harm
that passive smoking can do and we have made laudable strides in
mitigating its effects, by banning smoking in public places, on public
transport and in work vehicles. There is a glaring omission: every day
children across England are exposed to dangerously high levels of smoke
when travelling in the family car. According to the British Lung
Foundation—this is a different statistic—more than
430,000 children every week will be exposed to
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012956000157" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0001.htm#14012956000157">In Grand

that this is extending the reach of the nanny state: this is private

are overriding reasons for acting now to safeguard that most precious
commodity, the health of our children. We hear lots of people,
generally from the tobacco industry, talking about the rights of
smokers, but who is speaking up for the rights of the child? Every
parent can smoke if they want to, but surely every child should have
the right to be in a safe environment, which includes when they are in

times greater than in the average smoky pub. How many parents would
knowingly want to expose their child to such a toxic atmosphere with
such adverse long-term effects on health? The answer of course is very
few. Let us never forget that there is huge public support for this

with the Labour Government. The Minister taking the legislation through

Thornton. I did not succeed on that day in getting my amendment
through. Obviously, the government Benches were not going to support
me, but I did have the support of the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, who

I am delighted to congratulate the Government on having, in a step-wise
fashion—and as a result of efforts made by many other noble

amendment to address the public health evidence that plain packaging
will make a difference to the uptake of smoking of cigarettes, in
particular by children. I am particularly delighted that the government
amendment includes not just external packaging but internal packaging.
I remember my 
<?notus-xml column=1233?>days as a young medical student, when one would rush out and buy
Sobranie Black Russians because the cigarettes were wrapped in nice
black paper with gold tips. At the same time, we would also buy a
packet of Sobranie Cocktails to impress the ladies we were taking to
dances because they came in multicoloured wrappers—so packaging

me turn to the issue of smoking in cars when children are present. I
have taken the trouble to look at all the evidence about second-hand
smoke in confined spaces. I have looked at the public health evidence
from the Surgeon General of the United States, from Australia, from New
Zealand and from Great Britain—both epidemiological and
observational studies. The findings are quite interesting: undoubtedly,
second-hand smoking is harmful. It is harmful to children—more
so because their metabolic rate is higher, so any injurious substances
that they inhale are bound to have a greater effect. It is harmful also
to adults, particularly older people who have respiratory conditions or
cardiac disease. It is harmful also to pregnant mothers who do not
smoke, among whom there is a higher rate of still-births and infant
deaths because of the epigenetic effects of the inhalation of injurious
substances during their pregnancy. It is worse if they smoke during
their pregnancy, but even if they do not, the effect of second-hand
smoke is harmful to
them<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T16:52:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012956000166" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0001.htm#14012956000166">There
is further evidence, mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord
Ribeiro<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T16:52:18"></hs_TimeCode>, that
some of the injurious substances in tobacco smoke persist on certain
surfaces for a very long time. So this issue is not just about smoking
when there are children in a car; it is also about making that car
harmful to children because injurious substances persist. That also
applies to any confined space. So the question is: what legislation
will have the greatest public health effect? Will it be legislation
that stops smoking in cars when children are present? Will it be
legislation that bans smoking completely? Of course, it will be the
latter, but that will not be possible—such legislation is too
draconian. Could it be a good educational programme that teaches people
that if you smoke in front of children, whether in a confined space or
in an open space, or if children just see you smoking, that is wrong
and
harmful<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T16:53:21"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

intervention. There is all the difference in the world between the
physical or sexual exploitation of a child and smoking. Smoking is not
an illegal activity. Some of us may wish that it were, but it is not.
It would be wholly impractical, as the noble Lord, Lord Patel, made
plain in his remarks, for us to outlaw smoking. That is a road down
which we cannot go. Therefore, to invade the private space of
individuals who are committing a perfectly legal act seems to me a step
too far. That is why we should look at other means. I have mentioned
taxation and increased insurance premiums; there are many routes down

smoking in vehicles. Apart from damaging children’s health,
smoke gets in their eyes and is very unpleasant. There are also small
babies and pregnant mothers whose unborn children need protecting. I
hope that the noble Earl can give the House some assurance that there
will be regulations that will protect these vulnerable babies and
children. I would add that people with asthma, and all chest problems,
should also be protected because this is really dangerous for their
health<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T17:05:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Benjamin (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I ask noble Lords to consider the
following points as we debate these amendments. More than 800 children
visit their doctors every day due to the serious effect of second-hand
smoke exposure, according to research published by the Royal College of
Physicians. The survey also highlights that 65% of parents who smoke
admit to doing so in the car with their children and other
people’s children present, and that 75% of smoking parents were
shocked to hear that second-hand smoke affects the health of so many
children. If they had not been asked that question they would not have
been aware of this, so they really need to be educated.</hs_para>

quite clearly that second-hand smoke is a major trigger for asthma
attacks, making the symptoms even worse. It believes that if we take
action to reduce second-hand smoke, we will be a step closer to a world
where asthma begins to be no longer a daily struggle, or where no one
dies from that condition. The children’s charity Sparks—I
declare an interest as one of its trustees—spends millions of
pounds on research to eradicate asthma among children, a condition
which is growing daily. Sparks dearly believes that if we take action
to protect children from second-hand smoke, that will be helpful to
children. So let us give careful consideration to what action we should
take to protect children from the result of second-hand smoking and act

there is also a precedent for banning smoking in vehicles. Cars are
already recognised as potentially dangerous spaces for second-hand

already been banned in all vehicles used for the purpose of work in the

constitutional innovation. Leaving aside the detail about the standard
packaging for a moment, the broad framework of the amendment defines
what the regulation is to be and says that the Secretary of State, not
Parliament down at the other end, may make those regulations. We need

myriad others that interest groups outside would lobby to have

intellectual property rights. Such rights are a key dimension to any
industry, particularly in the packaged goods world, where I had the
privilege to work for some 20 years. Those rights are something that
most of those industries have had for centuries. They distinguish
between one product and another from a competitor; importantly, they
produce a quality assurance for those who buy the product; and they
provide for the businesses to have valuable assets that they can
produce innovations from and so create competition. Those are assets to
those companies that should not lightly be cast aside. There may be
particular reasons why some of them should be confined at certain times
in certain circumstances, but personally I think that society needs to
tread very
carefully.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012956000200" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0001.htm#14012956000200">In

tell us in his summing up what the timetable is likely to be as regards
when the research would take place and how long it might take? If, when
that was completed, the outcome was positive—I recognise that
because it is research it could go either way—when would the
Government be likely to bring in the legislation? I recognise that we
are moving towards an election and I hope that the Minister would want
to get this on the statute book before he might or might not leave

Storey (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I want to speak to Amendments 57B
and 62. First, on Amendment 57B, the Government are to be
congratulated. The package that they propose—if I dare to use
the term “package”—of proxy purchase, e-cigarettes
and looking at the whole question of standardised packaging of
cigarettes and tobacco products is to be welcomed. I think it will
result in thousands of people being saved from getting respiratory and
lung diseases; it will save literally thousands of lives. I
congratulate the Minister and the Government. I want also to thank
those cross-party noble Lords who put down the original amendment,
because they initiated this debate.</hs_para>

in Committee and say again: some noble Lords have mentioned their
grandchildren. Can you imagine carrying your grandson or granddaughter
in a carry-cot, putting that child into a metal box—a
car—and allowing somebody to pump cigarette fumes into that
metal box? You would not do that at all; you would not allow that to
happen. Whatever our concerns are about personal space or civil
liberties or whatever it is, this is about the rights of a child; the
rights of a baby. A baby cannot say, “Well, actually, I
don’t mind”; a child cannot say, “Actually, I
don’t mind”. In fact, research—certainly from
talking to children—shows that they do mind. As we have heard,
we can see when we look at the figures that children are particularly
vulnerable to second-hand smoke. Why? Because they have small lungs,
because they have faster breathing, and because they have a less
developed immune system. That makes them more susceptible to
respiratory problems: asthma, bronchitis and lung malfunction. Knowing
that, and that passive smoking results in more than 165,000 new
episodes of all sorts of diseases associated with lungs and
respiration—and I am talking about children here—are we
serious about allowing children and babies to be strapped in a car
where that happens? Surely not; all the other arguments pale into
insignificance.</hs_para>

said, “How are we going to make this happen? The police are very
busy; can we really make it happen?”. I have two answers to
that. Do noble Lords remember when seat-belt legislation was suggested?
People got up and said, “Oh no, this is an attack on my civil
liberties; oh no, we will solve the problem by advertising”. It
was the “clunk click” advertisement, was it not?
Oh—perhaps we had better move on from that. With the
“clunk click” advertisements, in fact, something like 24%
of people started to belt up in cars. Legislation was then brought in
and we found that 97% of people then put on a seat belt. We do that
automatically; we do not think about it, or sit in our cars saying,
“This is an infringement of our liberties; we shouldn’t
be doing this”; we do it. Why do we do it? Because it saves
lives: it saves our lives and the lives of other people who are
travelling in the car.</hs_para>

conducted in Scotland—we talk about Scotland a lot in this
Chamber, thank goodness—suggested that air quality inside a
smoker’s car was comparable to industrial smog in cities such as
Beijing or Moscow, even when the driver has the window open. Are we
seriously suggesting that children and young people should be subjected
to air quality which is akin to that in Beijing or Moscow? Of course,
we are not. Research by Aberdeen University found that 7% of 11
year-olds experience smoking in cars. That is why I am pleased that one
of my colleagues in Scotland, the Liberal Democrat MSP, Jim Hume, is
introducing a Private Member’s Bill looking at safeguarding
children by banning smoking in cars. That is now going out to public

end by making two further brief points. It is easy to find all sorts of
reasons why you cannot do something. We could ask, “What about
cars that are convertible? What about yachts? What about this? What
about that?”. However, if you believe in something and think
that it is right, you get on and do it. My only regret regarding the

Scott of Foscote:</Member></B> My Lords, I wish to add a word on the
amendment about smoking in cars when children are present. I do not
wish to say anything about standardised packaging because I thoroughly
support the amendment on that. However, so far as smoking is concerned,
the support for the relevant amendment is focused on smoking in motor
cars. However, that is not what the amendment says. It refers to
“a private vehicle”. Motor cars are a very
common—perhaps the most common—species of private
vehicle, but there are all sorts of other private vehicles that one
must take into account as well. The word “drives”,
commonly used in relation to motor vehicles, comes from the driving of
carriages and ponies and traps. Suppose that somebody has a pony and
trap, and has a child in the trap, why on earth should he or she not
smoke? If this amendment were confined 
<?notus-xml column=1244?>simply to motor cars, I would have no objection to it at all; indeed, I
think that I would support it. However, in relation to all private
vehicles, it simply goes too far. I do not believe that was intended

arguments. One is the basic libertarian argument that people should be
free to do what they like in their cars because they are private spaces

have done in our history, there is always a balance. Freedom for some
is often at the expense of freedom for other people. The balance we are
considering here is between the freedom for adults to smoke in cars
when they like and the freedom for children not to breathe in that
smoke in a situation from which they, by definition, as several noble
Lords pointed out, cannot escape.</hs_para>

there is a difference between smoking, which is a legal activity, and
other things that we have prohibited in the home in relation to
children. But the things that we were talking about then, such as
neglect of children and the beating of children, have not always been
illegal in the home. They were made illegal because they are
particularly harmful to the well-being of children. We take it for
granted now that such things are illegal but they were not always. We
invaded that private space because of the need to protect children. The

second argument was: if cars, why not private homes? There have been
contributions today that have made it clear, citing research by the

qualitatively different levels of risk to children from the smoke in a
confined space, from which they cannot escape, compared to that in
homes. Yes, children will be harmed in some homes where space is
limited. That is undoubtedly true. But the potential for children to
escape those spaces is clearly there in a home situation. They can go
outside as well. In a car, the toxicity levels and the fact that the
child is trapped make that a distinctly different situation, of which
we should take account with this amendment.</hs_para>

of view. A baby of itself could not move to another room.
However—we have these arguments in many ways—the fact
that we cannot remove the harm to all children in all situations
presented by passive smoking is not an argument in itself for not
taking the action that we could take to reduce the harm to the majority
of children in the most dangerous situations. That is the argument in

third argument we heard was about enforcement. Again, we had some
helpful contributions which I was going to make myself, but I shall
just mention them. This is primarily not about enforcement, and we have
precedence here with the ban on using mobile phones in cars, the
mandatory use of seat belts and the ban on smoking in public places.
All of those were hotly contested before legislation came in. I
particularly remember the ban on smoking in public places because I was
involved in it. That measure not only established smoke-free common
areas for people but, equally importantly—and it is true of the
other two measures—precipitated the biggest reduction in smoking
we have seen: a significant and beneficial change in behaviour on a
massive scale. That is the issue here, as the noble Baroness, Lady
Tyler, pointed out. I have no doubt that this would precipitate a very
significant change in behaviour in relation to smoking in cars with
children. Particularly when we see so much public support for the

I know that the noble Baroness understands that; but equally for that
reason, it would be premature to set out a detailed timetable. What I
can confirm is that the regulations would be subject to the affirmative
procedure to ensure an appropriate opportunity for parliamentary
scrutiny in both Houses. She may like to be aware that before being
laid in Parliament, any draft regulation that seeks to regulate tobacco
packaging would need to be notified to the European Commission and

provisions that tie our hands in this way. One of the amendments
imposes an arbitrary timetable for government action, and both pre-empt
Ministers’ proper and careful decision-making, involving
consideration of all the relevant issues. Litigation by the tobacco
industry is always a risk when introducing tobacco control legislation.
Indeed, the World Health Organisation says that one of the six main
forms of tobacco industry interference in public health is the
intimidation of Governments with litigation or the threat of
litigation. Government must have time and space to give proper
consideration to the wider issues raised by standardised packaging of
tobacco, and demonstrate that it has done so. Doing so will also reduce
the risk of successful litigation. I do appreciate the desire to go

turn to smoking in cars. Since we considered the issue at the previous
stage of the Bill, I have met a number of noble Lords who support the
idea of legislating to stop smoking in cars with children present. I
have also listened very carefully to the debate as it has proceeded
this afternoon. One thing is clear from those meetings and the
debate—we all want to eradicate smoking in cars carrying
children. None of us wants to see children continuing to be exposed to
harmful second-hand smoke, whether in the home or the family car.
However, although we agree on the destination, I have to acknowledge
that there are differing views on the most effective route. As your
Lordships will know, the Government believe that encouraging positive
and lasting behaviour change by making smokers aware of the significant
health risks of second-hand smoke will be more effective than resorting
to the use of legislation—which is of course a blunt
instrument—to tackle the problem. I believe very clearly that we
should consider resorting to the use of legislation only if our work to
promote positive changes in behaviour is shown not to have had the
desired effect.</hs_para>

issue in Grand Committee, a good deal of time was spent considering the
practicalities of enforcing an offence of smoking in cars carrying
children. I do not propose to rehearse those arguments in detail again
today. Nevertheless, I want to encourage your Lordships to reflect on
just how difficult it would be to enforce such a provision. My noble
friend Lord Cormack referred to this. In my view, there would be
substantial challenges in enforcing any such legislation, particularly
with respect to vehicles travelling at speed. Currently, local
authorities enforce smoke-free legislation, but they do not have the
powers or the means to require moving vehicles to pull over. We would
need therefore to set up a complex and probably resource-intensive
enforcement regime, which would need to involve the police. These
remaining questions of how to achieve effective enforcement undermine
the credibility of the measures that have been proposed. If it were
known that there was little chance of enforcement action, I have to ask
whether individuals would comply with the
law<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T18:12:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012963000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0002.htm#14012963000040"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Hunt of Kings Heath" PimsId="1076" UID="14012963000526" xid="1755" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0002.htm#14012963000526">Lord

accepting it, for the reasons that I am explaining now. One of the
points made about enforcement was that we could make a useful
comparison with seat-belt legislation. I understand why that comparison
has been made but it needs to be borne in mind that we are not
comparing like with like. Seat-belt 
<?notus-xml column=1252?>legislation is a road safety measure which is properly enforced by the
police; smoking in cars is a public health matter and the police have
no public health role or functions. That is part of the reason that the
issue is so complex. Before launching into the kind of amendment that
the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, invites us to accept, we need to take stock
of these questions. There is no point in putting something on the

will focus for a moment on why the Government prefer to achieve
behaviour change without recourse to imposing the law. We believe that
our approach is making a distinct impact, both in terms of raising
awareness and, more importantly, changing behaviour. There is a very
simple point to be made here, which was made by my noble friend Lady
Tyler. I cannot believe that any parent would want, knowingly, to
expose their child or children to harm. I am convinced that smoking in
family cars and the home is much more likely to be due to a simple lack
of understanding among smokers about how damaging to health second-hand
smoke can be. Our social marketing campaigns remind us that more than
80% of cigarette smoke is invisible. Our campaigns have used the
strap-line:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="14012963000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0002.htm#14012963000081">“If

regard to pregnant women, there is a need to encourage everybody to be
aware of the risks to health from second-hand smoke. We are achieving
high levels of awareness as well as changing attitudes and behaviours.
Almost three-quarters of those surveyed said that our campaigns had
made them realise that smoking out of an open door or window was not
enough to protect children from second-hand smoke. More than a third of
those who saw the adverts reported that they had taken action to reduce
their children’s exposure to second-hand smoke after seeing

so far, forced out of their homes or pushed deeper into poverty and
debt. We know from consistent research that children who are forced to
move home, away from settled communities and their schooling, suffer
health problems and have poorer educational outcomes. Meanwhile,
families who stay put suffer an average loss of income of £14 a

is also the ongoing issue of the impact on foster carers. When we
debated it in Committee, we welcomed the Government’s concession
to allow one additional room in their home as long as they had

months. However, the reforms still apply to foster carers who have two
or three bedrooms for fostered children. Foster carers could be
deterred 
<?notus-xml column=1259?>from providing foster care for more than one child at a time, so that
more children would be more likely to be separated from their siblings.
Given that there is already a shortage of foster carers in the UK,
these reforms are likely to mean fewer new recruits coming forward and
children’s well-being suffering as a result.</hs_para>

Government will regard the amendment as too wide-ranging. It provides
for a 
<?notus-xml column=1260?>determination setting aside the bedroom tax, potentially for a very
large number of families. For a considerable number of families a move
into new and smaller accommodation will be contrary to the interests
and the welfare of the child. At the lower level of harms—if one
can call them lower level—a house move may involve the children
having to change school at the same time as they move home. Other
children will move away from a grandparent or somebody else who looks
after them when their parents are working. These sorts of changes could
have very serious consequences for very sensitive children—not
necessarily just disabled ones. At its most serious, a move may deprive
a family of the basic space they need in order to continue managing a
severely disabled child, or indeed an adult, in the family and
therefore keeping the family intact. I want to focus on this to avoid
duplication.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012963000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0002.htm#14012963000069">We
know that families with a disabled child have been disproportionately
disadvantaged by the bedroom tax, although the Government accept and
have made changes to ensure that a disabled child should at least have
a room of their own. That was certainly progress. The Minister always
tells us that the discretionary housing payment is the answer to all
possible problems. It will no doubt help many families with a
short-term problem, if they are able to move into smaller
accommodation—that is a big if—without serious
consequences for a child or for the family as a whole, but where there
is a short delay before the move can take place. I guess that would
work pretty well. I accept that discretionary housing payments can be a
helpful safety net for some people in the short term. That is how I

not a spare bedroom and not actually a spare room at all. It is a vital
sensory haven for her very severely, multiply disabled daughter. The
room contains a ball pool: a plastic space full of balls of different
textures and sizes in which her daughter can sit and have a little bit
of pleasure in life—not very much but a little. The room is also

to find an extra £570 bedroom tax per year for her essential
space. I emphasise “essential”. We are not talking about
a luxury here. That is the point of my remarks. For a small number of
families extra space is not a luxury. Yes, Mary Jane’s mother
has now been awarded a discretionary housing payment that should cover
the shortfall, apparently, for the start of the year. However, what is
that to this mother who has the most enormous stresses to start with

family in the situation described by the noble Baronesses, Lady Jones

the support that can be received from the discretionary housing
subsidy. What I do not understand is why, for example, in my local
council in Liverpool, last year £337,000 of government
discretionary housing payments were left unspent and returned. The sad
thing is that, in every year since 2001-02, a large sum of money has

currently, after six months, Labour councils have spent only 29% of the

housing subsidy was left unspent. Should we not encourage those
councils to use that money to do the same things that both noble
Baronesses have suggested? If there is money available, it must be used
for that. It is a disgrace, when children are in difficult

who know those housing estates know that there are excellent
communities within them. In fact, those of us who have lived in big
cities think of them not as a big city but as a collection of villages
and communities. Many of the housing estates that I know of and are
excellent were built just after the war, when the soldiers came home
from the forces. The families were regarded as big. I came from a

that, if you have a long waiting list, you will fill the vacant
accommodation. That is not necessarily the case. Anyone who has been a
constituency MP or a councillor will know that people will come to you
to say, “I’ve been on the waiting list for 10 or 12
years”, but when you say, “I can get you a house

do that in Glasgow. Being on a waiting list does not mean that the

the Minister has a choice when he responds to the amendment, which was
so effectively moved by my noble friend. He can say either that
children of a certain group—disabled children, children in
poverty or whatever—are exempt from the application of the
bedroom tax to the tenancy, or he can say, on the contrary, we will
leave it to local authorities to exercise their discretion, so that the

advantage of the first path is that you can perfectly easily have ways

disabled people and so on. If that is the way which the Minister wishes

alternative is to rely on discretionary housing payments, as the

that depends on the initiative of the family to go in for, effectively,
a local means-testing regime. What we know at the moment, and the
Minister will know this as well as anybody in this House, is that what
happens with a means-testing regime is that more than a third of
pensioners, for example, who are eligible for means-tested 
<?notus-xml column=1264?>benefits do not apply and therefore do not get them. We know that many
families who are entitled to council tax benefit—again, it is
something like 40%—do not apply and do not get it. He is
dependent on the ability of that family to touch resources to which
that family may have no access. That money therefore does not get drawn

if you are relying effectively on the means-testing principle, you are
relying on the insecurity of the local authority. I can tell the
Minister why that money is not being spent. Something like 18 or so
months ago, my own local authority, Norwich, ran out of its
discretionary housing payment money by November. The Minister is very
fond of quoting at me on the Floor of this Chamber—he has now
done so twice—what has happened in Norwich. After November,
other families in distress who needed the support could not access any
more money because it had
gone.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012973000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0002.htm#14012973000015">As a

need, knowing that demand fluctuates in the course of the year,
particularly after Christmas when the energy bills go up and the debts

that the Minister has fought for additional moneys. Every time that he
fights for additional moneys, at the end of the day it will not make a
penny of savings on this whole damned policy. It is a lousy policy. By
the time he has got to £180 million, taking into account
arrears, voids, administrative costs, eviction costs and the costs of
those who go into the private rented sector, which increases their HB,
he will find that there will be no savings left but he will have put

moment which is taking means testing out of the system because we know
of its inadequacy. The Minister is now importing that back into the
relief of children in poverty, which he does not need to do. I hope

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and
Pensions (Lord Freud) (Con):</Member></B> My Lords,
as one would expect, this has been an interesting debate with some
impassioned and important contributions, which I welcome. Let me start
by reminding the House of the fiscal environment that led to this
measure’s introduction. In the final year of the previous
Government, borrowing had risen to £150 billion. In 
<?notus-xml column=1265?>cash terms, over the previous 10 years, expenditure on housing benefit
had nearly doubled to £24 billion. Left unreformed, annual
expenditure on housing benefit would have exceeded £26 billion
per year by the end of this Parliament. Nearly four years on, the range
of economic indicators are showing that our policies are
working and have led to the number of workless households,
the number of lone-parent workless households and the number of
children in workless households all being the lowest since comparable
records began in 1996.</hs_para>

will not spend a huge amount of time responding to the policy issues

Housing Benefit (Amendment) Regulations 2006 are secondary legislation,
which contain detailed provisions that set out how local authorities
should administer housing benefit. It is very unusual to seek to amend
secondary legislation through primary legislation in this way. The
amendment itself is imprecise and ambiguous, unlike the rest of
Regulation B13. For example, under proposed new paragraph (5A) it is
unclear what “restriction to one bedroom” or the concept

amendment is potentially to allow local authorities to determine that
the removal of the spare room subsidy does not apply where the
household contains children, as it is not in the interests of their
welfare. So this amendment is likely to add around £160 million
a year to the housing benefit bill, reducing the savings from the
policy to around £330 million a year. It would extend only to
the social sector and so reintroduce the inequity in treatment between
housing benefit claimants that we have sought to remove with the
implementation of this change. Applying the spirit of the amendment to
the local housing allowance to re-establish fairness is likely to more
than double the cost of making this amendment to around £460
million a year. This amendment does not deliver the intended outcome.
If accepted, we do not intend to amend it and it will be sent to the
other place in its current defective state.</hs_para>

remind noble Lords that we have already taken account of the interests
and welfare of children in developing this policy. In March, we amended
the regulations to allow an additional bedroom for foster and kinship
carers. We have also made £5 million of discretionary
housing payment funding available specifically for foster carers who
require further additional rooms to allow them to foster two or more
children, including groups of siblings. The discretionary housing
payment data for the first six months indicate that foster carers are
applying for and receiving payments, as intended. In March, we also
issued guidance to local authorities indicating that they should allow
an additional bedroom for disabled children who would ordinarily be
expected to share a room but are unable to do so because of their
disability. This was put into a 
<?notus-xml column=1266?>regulatory framework in October. We have provided £180 million of
discretionary housing payment funding for this year, and £165
million for next year, to enable local authorities to support the most
vulnerable families affected by the reforms. This funding is already
meeting the need that the noble Baroness seeks to address through this
amendment.</hs_para>

on two of the vital points raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher,
on the costs and benefits for children who go into residential care as

look at the effects on families. We are not currently aware of any

up the example that the noble Baroness raised about Mary Jane and
focusing on the uncertainty that that family had with that poor girl, I
am aware that some local authorities, following the introduction of the
policy, have understandably taken a very cautious approach to awarding
discretionary housing payments, as they assess the level of need in
their area. I have instructed my officials to amend the guidance to
local authorities to encourage them to make longer-term awards where
the circumstances are unlikely to change. The revised guidance is being
prepared and will be shared with the local authority associations in

Lords who have spoken. I also thank the Minister. I welcome him to this
Bill for, I think, the first time. Some of us are long veterans of this
Bill. We have been debating it since last June. Our focus has, perhaps,
been very different from the values and priorities that the Minister
has been enunciating this evening. We have been very much focused on
the child welfare issues and have seen those as a priority in the
progress of the Bill. We have reached quite a lot of cross-party and
cross-Chamber consensus on all of
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012973000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0002.htm#14012973000028">Once
again the Minister put great emphasis on the discretionary housing
payment scheme. The fact is, in ways that were never foreseen when the
original bedroom tax was introduced, it has already had to be increased
and increased. This very much demonstrates that the policy, as
originally planned and thought out, was not working and is still not
working. It is making the evaluation of the costs very difficult.
Indeed, the savings that were originally envisaged are now not being
met. The whole policy is being turned on its
head<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T19:13:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

all the calculations that I have heard the Minister cite, he does not
take into account some of the extra costs. Noble Lords around the
Chamber have given us examples, including the whole issue of managing
evictions, debt, arrears, the extra costs to local authorities of going
back to people to try to collect those debts and arrears, and the more
ill defined, but nevertheless very much present, extra social problems
that arise from some of these

local authorities that are trying to administer it. This is a murky

localism—a word that this Government do not seem to use very
much any more. It is also about trust. Our amendment would trust local
authorities to manage their housing stock and the vulnerable families
within them most effectively. The noble Lord, Lord Martin, began to
illustrate that. The housing stock and the experience of people living
in Glasgow are very different from that of people living in the Welsh
valleys, London and other urban areas. It is very difficult for local
authorities to operate a blanket scheme when the housing stock, the
availability of alternative stock and so on are so different. We are

the moment, those local authorities are trying to manage the sometimes
perverse impact of that national policy on their local families. For
example, they have to move families whose homes have been adapted to
smaller homes, which in turn will need to be adapted all over again; or
push families into the more expensive private rented sector as those
smaller properties are not available, leaving behind sometimes larger
properties that nobody wants to live in, which then remain
empty<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T19:16:26"></hs_TimeCode>. These are

disability, but it is not just about disability. There can be complex
family problems, personal problems, things to do with special
educational needs and services that they need in the locality. We have
debated these on other occasions. There could be all sorts of other

My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T19:29:57"></hs_TimeCode> Lords,
another week, another set of legal aid regulations to regret. These
regulations will severely limit the availability of legal aid advice
and assistance in prison law. I shall mention four examples of issues
for which legal aid advice and assistance will no longer be available
by reason of these regulations. The first is Parole Board proceedings
for indeterminate sentence prisoners—ISPs—where the
Secretary of State refers the case before the expiry of the minimum
term for advice on a move for the prisoner to open conditions, and also
where an ISP is removed from open conditions and the Minister seeks
advice from the Parole Board on a return to an open prison. This will
no longer be covered. The Parole Board itself said in its written
evidence to an inquiry on this subject by the Joint Committee on Human
Rights that because most prisoners require a period in open conditions
before the Parole Board can be satisfied that they are safe to
release:</hs_para>
<hs_quote UID="14012973000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0002.htm#14012973000080">“There is in

reviews”.</hs_quote><hs_para UID="14012973000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0002.htm#14012973000038">The
need for high standards to be applied at such hearings, in the
interests of the prisoner and in the public interest, is obvious, and
because of the impossibility of prisoners representing themselves
effectively at such hearings and problems such as how to manage a
prisoner cross-examining a professional witness giving evidence about
the prisoner’s conduct in prison, the Parole Board told the
Joint Committee in its written evidence that it believed the proposal
to remove legal
aid,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="14012973000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0002.htm#14012973000083">“is

is very surprising that the Secretary of State should have proceeded
with the changes despite the concerns expressed by the Parole
Board.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="14012973000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0002.htm#14012973000039">The
second example of decisions which will be excluded from legal aid is
decisions to place or keep a prisoner in Category A—that is,
prisoners assessed to be a high security risk—which of course
affects prison conditions. A third excluded category is the allocation
of places in mother and baby units. Vulnerable women will be denied
access to legal advice on whether they should be separated from their
babies. A fourth example is decisions on removal from
association—that is, segregation decisions. One could give many
more  examples.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14012973000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0002.htm#14012973000040">What are the
justifications offered by the Secretary of State for denying legal
advice and assistance in such important matters, even if all other
eligibility criteria are satisfied? The main answer given by Mr
Grayling, the Secretary of State for Justice, in his oral evidence to
the House of Commons Justice Select Committee on 3 July 2013 is that
the difference between him and his critics was
“ideological”—his word. Indeed, he used that word
three times in as many minutes in 
<?notus-xml column=1272?>response to questions on this matter. The report of the evidence is
published as HC 91. Mr Grayling told the Justice
Committee:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="14012973000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0002.htm#14012973000081">“I
do not believe that prisoners in jail should have the right to access
legal aid to debate which prison they are put
in”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="14012973000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0002.htm#14012973000075">He
went on to say that they should not have the right to legal aid to
raise other questions about their treatment, with limited
exceptions.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="14012973000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0002.htm#14012973000041">This
is to reverse 35 years of progress in the approach adopted by the legal
system to the treatment of prisoners. The modern era of prison law
began in 1978 when the Court of Appeal required fair disciplinary
proceedings for those alleged to be involved in the Hull prison riots.
Since that decision, our courts have repeatedly made it clear that
administrative decisions in prison must comply with basic standards of
legality, procedural fairness and
rationality.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012973000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0002.htm#14012973000042">The
application of legal standards to decision-making within prisons has
immeasurably improved the quality of those decisions and ensured
greater transparency and accountability. No one, with the possible
exception of the Secretary of State for Justice, could doubt the public
benefits in enabling prisoners to hold prison authorities to basic
standards of legality and fairness or the indispensable contribution
which has been made in this respect by legal aid. That a Secretary of
State, and indeed a Secretary of State for Justice, should now, for
so-called ideological reasons, wish to reverse such developments is
very much a matter for
regret.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012973000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0002.htm#14012973000043">Mr
Grayling’s second point is that legal aid is not needed because
the internal prison complaints system and the Prisons and Probation
Ombudsman will provide redress where appropriate. Without legal
assistance a prisoner is simply not going to be able to make his or her
points effectively and speedily by reference to the applicable legal
requirements. Unhappily, many prisoners lack basic skills of literacy
or suffer from other problems which impede their ability to present an
effective grievance. Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Prisons,
Mr Nick Hardwick CBE, echoed these concerns in his evidence to the
Joint Committee on Human Rights, as recorded in paragraph 174 of the
Committee’s seventh report.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14012973000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0002.htm#14012973000044">As the Law Society has
pointed out in its helpful briefing on this Motion, at present many
complaints are simply, effectively and speedily resolved by a
solicitor’s letter setting out the legal position to the person
taking the decision. The Prisons and Probation Ombudsman can only make
recommendations and provides a much slower method of seeking redress
than a solicitor’s letter. The ombudsman, Mr Nigel Newcomen CBE,
told the Joint Committee on Human Rights that he was concerned about
the Government’s proposals, in particular because his office was
unable to cope with the expected increase in workload.</hs_para>

not even save public money. The cost of maintaining legal aid in ISP
cases before the Parole Board, for example, is minimal, and the cost of
ISPs remaining unjustifiably in closed conditions when they could
safely be allowed to move to open conditions is high. The Howard League
for Penal Reform has pointed out that the Ministry of Justice has put
the cost of dealing with each complaint to the  
<?notus-xml column=1273?>ombudsman at £830, which is more than three times the £220
fixed fee for a solicitor doing this work under the legal aid
arrangements.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012973000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0002.htm#14012973000046">In

will speak specifically about women. As we in this House all know,
women in prison are very largely those who have experienced abuse or
domestic violence. They are often in prison because of serious social
problems, they have mental health problems, and often have problems of
addiction. The panoply of problems that they have do not make them
people who will be well able to represent themselves in trying to get
their rights in

will mention the issue of mother and baby units. In the past I have
been involved in such cases, where a woman seeks to prepare for an
application to have her baby remain with her, and has to secure
supportive evidence, expert reports, and so on. It is impossible for a
woman to do that without the help of a solicitor. Representations have
to be made in relation to any refusal to offer a woman a place in a
mother and baby unit, and I can assure noble
Lords<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T19:42:06"></hs_TimeCode> that that
is sometimes done—and not done—for the best of
reasons.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012973000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0002.htm#14012973000052">Women
sometimes make applications for temporary release when something
disastrous is happening at home with other children; they seek a
temporary licence so that they can spend time at home. Many female
prisoners are their children’s primary carer. We know that 55%
of women in prison have a child under 16 and wish to make use of that
release on temporary licence when they have emergencies at home. I know
from experience that the application of the release on temporary
licence policy is frequently misapplied by prisons, and women who are
eligible are incorrectly refused. Legal help is vital to them for
making their application, making representations, drawing on supportive
evidence, and so on, but it is no longer available.</hs_para>

have real problems about the suitability of their accommodation or
other services they need, and need legal help to acquire them. Mentally
ill prisoners do not get legal help to deal with many of the attendant
matters that go along with convincing the authorities of the

or as regards behaviours that clearly show disturbance, but which often
bring them into dispute with the authorities in the
prison<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T19:43:27"></hs_TimeCode>. There
are often arguments about the capacity of such women. They present with
difficult and challenging behaviour which is often met with a strong
disciplinary response from the prison so that they are awarded extra
days as punishments, when in fact mental health is the problem. As
extended prisoners, women often have the date of release set further

to their mental ill

should want; it is much better that effective remedies are provided in
this country. Why do I say that? I have the cases of Sidney Golder and
Reuben Silver in mind. Sidney Golder, many years ago, was a prisoner
who thought

wanted to go to a solicitor to see whether he could sue for libel. The
Home Office said, “Sorry—you can’t go to a
solicitor while you’re a prisoner”, so Mr Golder had to
go to Strasbourg. The Strasbourg court said, years and years ago,
“There must be an effective domestic remedy. Access to justice
is a fundamental right, and prisoners are entitled to that
right”. Therefore Golder led to reform of the prison rules, or
was meant to do so. I was working in the Home Office with Roy Jenkins
on the subject, and I am sorry to say that Home Office officials did
not do as they were instructed, so that led to the case of

became a prisoner, under the rule that said that you had to know the
person beforehand. Therefore Mr Silver was one of my seven prisoner
clients who went to the Strasbourg court complaining of the absence of
a domestic remedy. The Strasbourg court had no difficulty in finding
that the prison ombudsman could not provide and had not provided an
effective remedy, and the same would be true
today<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T19:48:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012973000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0002.htm#14012973000059">Those
cases are not just routine internal disciplinary matters. I lost
another case called Boyle and Rice in which they complained about being
moved from one place to another and not having artwork, and so on. That
is the kind of case which Mr Grayling is perfectly right to say should
be dealt with by the ombudsman system. However, there are other,
grosser, cases where that is not so. When I put this to Mr Grayling in
evidence his reply was, “Well, I’m sure that in that sort
of case you can find barristers who do no-win, no-fee cases”.
That is no answer; for a prisoner to have to find such a barrister and
to negotiate with the clerk and all the rest of it is patently absurd.
One overwhelming reason to regret what has happened is that it will
lead inevitably to more cases going to Strasbourg, which is not in the

to the release by the Secretary of State or for consideration for
release by the Parole Board, and for proceedings that involve the
determination of a criminal charge. However, they are very small

essential to protect against the risk of challenge by prisoners whose

<?notus-xml column=1276?>system of complaints is on which there is so much emphasis and to draw

that to which the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy, has drawn attention;

male and female, in prisons and in young offender institutions

am struck by one of the provisions in paragraph 9.2 of the Explanatory
Memorandum, which tells us that a note has been issued for distribution
to prisoners to explain the changes to the system—but what
provision is being made for those who cannot read or who do not speak
English? Can we really be confident that steps are being taken to deal

heart of this is something else, which, I suggest, is profoundly
worrying: the increasing tendency to treat prisoners as some kind of an
underclass. They are to be regarded as having surrendered their right,
when they go into custody, to be treated like everyone else, except to
the extent necessary to serve their sentence. We are all familiar with
the debate about prisoner voting; but the effect of denying them the

years ago Justice Breyer of the US Supreme Court observed in a lecture
in London that it is not the job of judges to be popular. That is why
we have judges who are not elected. If you want to be popular, you have
to win votes: you must appeal to the majority. Of course, one way of
doing that is to devalue the rights of the minority. When it comes to
the use of resources, there is a temptation: they can be diminished or
left to one side because the majority can be relied upon not to care
about them and not to object. That is all about winning the confidence
of the majority, which is what this sentence really refers to. It is
not difficult to imagine what, in the wrong hands, this may eventually
lead to. The line of thinking, therefore—the political
philosophy that seems to underlie these proposals—is perhaps
even more worrying than all the details which, in themselves, are so
troubling.

been raised already, but let me take a different point. As a former
family judge, it is the baby that I worry about. There is no one to
speak for the baby; he or she is removed from the mother, with all the
emotional harm that is done to a baby in those circumstances, even if
that mother and baby are reunited at a later stage. In that instance, a

group that has already been referred to is that of vulnerable adults. I
will make two points. First, in our prisons there is a very high
percentage of people with mental health problems. Some have single
mental health problems; many have multiple problems. There is also no
shortage of people without education and with learning disabilities.
How on earth are they to cope with putting forward whatever is the
issue that needs to be put forward if they do not have someone to help
them? I doubt very much whether the internal arrangements or even the
ombudsman will meet the specialised help which, for a very minor cost
to the public, these lawyers can give. If, as the noble Lord, Lord
Pannick, suggests, it is ideological, the money does not matter; but I
suspect that for the rest of the Government money matters very much. It
is not very much money and it saves a great deal. Therefore I urge not
just the Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Justice, but
the Government generally, to rethink the balance of saving money and
the damage caused by taking away this facility and the lack of
appropriate legal advice and representation that to me, as a former
judge, is a denial of access to

to support this Motion and also, in part, to atone for my own part as
Treasury Counsel 30 years or more ago, when I did all that I
could to obstruct the recognition of prisoners’
rights—sometimes successfully in the short term, although
generally not in the longer term. Preparing for the debate tonight has
involved me in a wander down memory lane. In 1981, in a case called
Payne against the then chairman of the Parole Board, Lord Harris of
Greenwich, I succeeded in persuading the Court of Appeal under Lord
Denning that it was quite unnecessary to give prisoners any reasons
whatever as to why their parole applications had been refused. In 1984,
in a case called King, I persuaded the Court of Appeal that prison
governors’ disciplinary proceedings were wholly immune from
judicial review, lest their authority be undermined.</hs_para>

now look back on these forensic triumphs of yesteryear with some
astonishment—and, indeed, each of them proved to be short lived.
Nor, indeed, were all my attempts to obstruct and restrict
prisoners’ rights successful. Anonymous reference has already
been made this evening to the famous case of Raymond v Honey in 1982,
in which I failed to persuade the House of Lords that prison governors
were entitled to prevent a prisoner applying to the courts to commit
them to prison for contempt. In 1983, in the Tarrant
case—another case that features in the Joint Committee’s
report—I failed to persuade the Divisional Court that prisoners
should never have the right to legal representation before boards of
visitors. Indeed, in a case that has already been mentioned this
evening by the noble Lord, Lord Lester—Silver v the United
Kingdom—which was aptly named, considering it followed on from
the case of Golder v United Kingdom, I failed to persuade the
Strasbourg court that the prison authorities were entitled to read
every letter that a prisoner sent out, even those sent to his
solicitors<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T20:01:00"></hs_TimeCode>.

in the debate have focused—and, no doubt, will continue to
focus—on a number of detailed objections to the regulations, and
have pointed to particular situations where the withdrawal of legal aid
will be especially harmful and problematic. However, I wish to make a
single, substantial point, which to my mind is a point of overarching
importance and which has already been touched on by others. By these
regulations, legal aid will cease to be available for a number of cases
which otherwise would have passed all the relevant merits and
qualifying tests and would have been funded. That must be so, because
otherwise there can be no point in the
regulations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012979000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0002.htm#14012979000004">It
follows that these cases are no longer to be funded for the very reason
that those who wish to bring them are prisoners. It is no answer to say
that there are other complaints procedures available to them in prison.
To the extent that these are, indeed, sufficient, a legal challenge
would in any event be impermissible because judicial review is always
regarded as a remedy of last resort. So it is by virtue only of 
<?notus-xml column=1279?>their status as prisoners—an unpopular group and thus perhaps
regarded as a soft and popular target for cuts—that prisoners
will have fewer rights to funding and so less access to justice than
the population at large. And yet—it is this that I regard as the
key point which makes the point one of overarching importance, as I
have called it—prisoners, as members of a closed community
uniquely subject to the exercise of highly coercive powers, far from
having fewer rights of recourse to independent courts than most of us,
should, rather, have at the very least equal access to
justice<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T20:03:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012979000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0002.htm#14012979000005">Just

depend on where they were standing when a florid episode took place,
whether there was a sympathetic or an unsympathetic police officer
present or whether or not their family was there to protect them. It is
purely because of a small event that one person may now be in a
hospital, with all the care that a hospital provides, and the capacity
to obtain legal aid for important litigation that may establish the
course of the rest of their lives, and another may be in prison, where,

statutory funding. The result has often been to allow them to be

and deliberately tough sanctions against prisoners, and are resulting
in mounting unrest. Prisoners are deprived of their liberty for a

make comparatively minor changes that we believed were appropriate. We
implemented them and, dare I say, they appeared to work fairly
satisfactorily. But now, yet again, our successors go much, much too

been here before. I spoke in the debate of the noble Baroness, Lady
Deech, as did many other noble Lords. On that occasion, I mentioned the
work of the CAB. But today, like others, I am much more concerned about
the effect of these regulations on young people in difficulty,
including asylum seekers in detention, unaccompanied minors and even
young 
<?notus-xml column=1286?>people released from prison and wishing to make a new life. These young
people would normally benefit from professional legal advice at a
critical stage in their lives when they are separated from their
families or being made homeless at the moment of leaving
prison<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T20:33:19"></hs_TimeCode>.
Specialised agencies such as the Howard League mentioned by the noble
Lord, Lord Carlile, have given hundreds of people not just hope but
essential practical advice on restarting their lives. This kind of
work, as the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, said, characterises fairness
in our society. It is not charity.</hs_para>

notice that the Minister has been a member of the Select Committee
looking at mental capacity, so he will be more aware than most of the
special problems of the mentally ill already mentioned. Many of those
people are in prison through no fault of their own. I said in the legal
aid debate that those with mental health problems were especially
vulnerable. There were no exceptions for children nor for prisoners
accepted to have a disability. A detained child unable to identify
legal issues will not have the financial resources, let alone the
intellectual resources, to pay for lawyers or even to frame their
complaint to the prison authority, as is suggested. That is a serious
point that the Minister has to answer. It would be a serious personal
crisis for young
people<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T20:34:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012979000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0002.htm#14012979000043">A
case of a 12 year-old boy was mentioned to me by the Howard League. He
was an unaccompanied minor who had been detained in a secure
children’s home. He had behaved well, earned himself early
release and had sought help with resettlement. The lawyer concerned
approached social services but only then discovered through an
interpreter that he had been wrongly detained in the first place and
had to appeal against his sentence. None of this will happen if cases
are not referred in the future and legal aid is

September, there were 1,789 immigration detainees spread across the UK
in removal centres and short-term holding facilities simply waiting to
be removed. Many are moved from place to place and I doubt if the
Minister or anyone else can keep count of how many of them are young
people. I heard from a Member of Parliament last week that one young
detainee, originally from his constituency, had been moved eight
times<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T20:35:45"></hs_TimeCode>. Mental
health problems loom large in these situations because no one knows
when they can leave or even when they can receive a hearing. Detainees
depend heavily on outside advice. This may be a subject for the
Immigration Bill next month, but it is surely highly relevant to the
present regulations. Is it fair to exact cuts that will impinge on
young people in these conditions and restrict their lives even more

is true that the Joint Committee on Human Rights accepted that it was
legitimate for the Government to introduce a residence test, as the
Minister may mention, and to restrict the scope of prison law funding.
But it strongly recommended that there should be more and broader
exemptions from these proposals to make it less likely that they will
lead to breaches of the fundamental right of effective access to

unfortunate, as the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, mentioned, is that young
people in prison had been receiving much better attention over a long

seem to run through the Government’s approach. The first is a
reference to and reliance on judicial review. I do not need to comment
on the paradox in that given the policy regarding judicial review. I
was not aware of the <I>Daily Mail</I> article quoted by the noble and
learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith. I do not think that I need to spend any
time on saying how undesirable it is to rely on judicial review. But I
will mention the skill that is needed, at what I shall describe as
first instance, to ensure that the right points are raised and dealt
with in order that there is a basis for an application for judicial
review. I think that that is not a job for someone who is not

theme which I picked up from the JCHR report is that the Justice
Secretary thinks that the number of cases affected will be very small.
If that is so, I do not understand why the Government do not give in
gracefully. We know about the cost pressures on the MoJ. We know that
the Government want to focus public resources on cases with sufficient
priority to justify the use of public money and to get value for money
for the taxpayer. But I know that I am not alone in this Chamber in
setting justice high in my priorities as a
taxpayer<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T20:40:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

seems to be a common theme in the responses to the Government from
those who work in the sector is a mention of the “see-saw
impact”—that is, cuts here meaning costs there. Concerns
around mother and baby units and the cost of keeping a baby in care is
one example, undermining the principles of rehabilitation and the costs
associated with all that. We will all have seen and read particular
cases. I shall mention one which I found very compelling—the
story of a 17 year-old who was given a 36-month custodial sentence. He
was studying for his A-levels at the time. With the work of solicitors,
who engaged in both detailed representations and liaison with a clutch
of agencies, he was granted release on temporary licence to attend
college part-time and then home detention curfew, and so he lost only
one year of education, not the further years which were in

course, there is also the cost of the loss of expertise among
solicitors. I have seen, and heard about tonight, a large number of
points relating to costs rather than savings. We really have not got
any better, have we, at joining up and reading across budgets? I have
actually been defeated—my level of energy depleted—in
trying to understand the savings projected as against the knock-on
costs. I hope that when the Minister—who has everyone’s
sympathy in this—replies he will be able to unpack this for the

third theme I picked up was the emphasis on the non-judicial complaints
system. I do not see this as an either/or. There should be a good
complaints system. That should then alleviate to some extent the
necessity for lawyers to be involved. There should be an effective
system that inspires confidence. However, there are limits to the
system that we have—to the powers, to the remit, which does not
extend to making recommendations to external agencies or investigating
them. These concerns seem rightly to have been stressed.</hs_para>

League for supplying the relevant information. The first was a mother
and baby case of the kind referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Pannick,
the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy, and the noble and learned Baroness,
Lady Butler-Sloss. A Spanish mother, who spoke no English, was informed
after sentence that her baby would be removed and placed into care
because it was not known whether she would be allowed to remain with

the second case, a prisoner with severe learning disabilities could not

practitioners, and charities and voluntary organisations. Time after

clearly the case with the proposals we are debating tonight. Not only
are the measures deeply flawed but the process is tainted. Paragraph
after paragraph of the Joint Committee on Human Rights report

the Government abandoned proposals to exclude two areas from legal aid,
namely where the Parole Board considers whether to order release and in
relation to the calculation of sentence when the release date is in
dispute. That is welcome, but as paragraph 154 of the report sets out,
two new matters were excluded from legal aid—contrary to the
express intention set out in the consultation that legal aid would
continue to be available—namely, the areas of sentence planning

with disabilities, especially mental health problems, and, as the noble

the complaints system was crucial to prison safety. As recent events
have demonstrated, prison safety is a real concern. Similarly, at

paragraph 188, the Joint Committee noted that since 2010 the majority
of treatment cases were mental health cases and it was not satisfied

funding for these cases where the implications for access to justice
are clear. Noble Lords will not need reminding that the majority of
prisoners suffer from mental health disorders: 70% of one or more
mental health disorders for adults, 90% for young offenders. Again,
what is the Government’s response to the case of prisoners
suffering from these disorders? In relation to mother and baby cases,
of which there are mercifully few, the committee called for an

will begin by saying something about the wider context of the
instrument. It is worth noting that spending on criminal legal aid for
prison law in England and Wales has increased markedly in recent years,
from around £1 million in 2001-02 to around
£22 million in 2012-13.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14012979000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0002.htm#14012979000077">Legal<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T20:58:17"></hs_TimeCode>
aid is a vital part of our justice system. However, limited public
resources need to be targeted at those who need them most. With
departments across government being asked to reduce their expenditure,
legal aid cannot be immune. The legal aid scheme is paid for by the
taxpayer, and we have to demonstrate to the public and hard- working
families that we have scrutinised every aspect of legal aid spending to
ensure that it can be justified. Unless the legal aid scheme is
targeted at the people and cases where funding is most needed, it will
not command public
confidence<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T20:58:56"></hs_TimeCode>. It
was with this aim in mind that the Government proposed a number of
changes to legal aid in England and Wales in April 2013. Following
public consultation and careful consideration of the responses, the
decision was taken to restrict the scope of criminal legal aid for
prison law, among other reforms.</hs_para>

suggestion has been made that the Government did not respond at all or
modify their view. With respect, that is not quite right. As a result
of the consultation the Government agreed that they would fund all
cases that involved the determination of a criminal charge for the
purposes of Article 6, cases that required legal representation as a
result of the successful application of the Tarrant criteria—the
Tarrant case referred to by the noble and learned Lord, Lord
Brown—all proceedings before the Parole Board where the Parole
Board has the power to direct release, and all sentence calculation
matters where the date of release is disputed.</hs_para>

of this legal aid aims to focus limited public resources on cases that
are of sufficient priority to justify the use of public money. Criminal
legal aid for prison law continues to be available for disciplinary
hearings that determine a criminal charge and for ones before a
governor where the Tarrant criteria are fulfilled—that is, where
the governor has exercised discretion to permit legal representation
following consideration of a number of criteria. Criminal legal aid
remains available when the Parole Board has the power to direct the
individual’s release. It also remains for cases regarding an
individual’s sentence where the calculation by the Secretary of
State of the date on which the individual is entitled to be released,
or eligible for consideration by the Parole Board for a direction to be
released, is disputed.</hs_para>

matters have also been removed from scope, including, but not limited

that these issues removed from scope do not require the input of a

alternative means of redress already in place. These alternative means
of redress, including the internal complaints system, the prison
discipline procedures and the probation complaints systems, should be
the first port of call for issues removed from scope. The internal
prison complaint procedures, set out in Prison Service Instruction
02/2012, are robust and effective. The system is accessible to all,
with measures in place for young offenders and for those with mental
health issues and/or learning difficulties—and there has been
much reference to those

means of redress, including the prison complaints system, are
effective. No mother and baby unit cases have in fact been funded by

was expressed about the issue of categorisation. Of the areas removed
from the scope of criminal legal aid, there are about 6,000 legally
aided categorisation cases per year, based on the 2012-13 data. If
prisoners were to be held in a higher security category than necessary
as a result of that change, there would be an additional cost burden.
However, we consider that the alternative means of redress, such as the
prisoner complaints system, are sufficient to deal with those matters
satisfactorily. In fact, being in a higher category does not of itself
prevent release. If, contrary to our view, as a result of the change to
criminal legal aid, prisoners were held in a higher category than
necessary, there would be an additional cost burden, although we cannot
quantify the number of
cases<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T21:08:10"></hs_TimeCode>. Although
the average cost per prison place increases as a result of increases in
the prisoner security classification, it will have only a marginal
impact on overall costs, as there is an oversupply of high security
places and an undersupply of lower security
places.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012979000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0002.htm#14012979000089">The
issue of Parole Board hearings was raised. As many noble Lords will be
aware, a Parole Board hearing is invariably inquisitorial, and we do
not accept that it requires a legal representative to ensure fairness
for the prisoner. I appreciate that the Parole Board has expressed
anxiety about some prisoners not being represented, and of course any
Parole Board would probably prefer to have a prisoner represented by a
lawyer rather than to deal with them directly, but the Government have
great faith in the highly skilled members of the Parole Board and their
inability to elicit and assess relevant information and do not consider
that the additional costs are
justifiable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012979000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0002.htm#14012979000090">While
dealing with particular costs, reference was made to the standard fee
of £220. That is the lower standard fee for advice and
assistance; the higher standard fee is about £600 for more
complex cases. The average cost of Parole Board representation is, I am
told, around £2,000. As noble Lords will appreciate, where
release date and the sentence term is concerned, there will be
representation before the Parole Board.</hs_para>

deal with serious issues of concern for prisoners or those released on
licence. Only those cases that cannot be satisfactorily resolved via
these processes, which we expect to be a small number, will be referred

leave them especially vulnerable but allows them to make complaints in

decision that the noble Lord, Lord Nash, and the Government made to
include in the Bill a duty on schools to make arrangements for children
with health conditions. I am genuinely grateful for that; it is a
hugely positive step, and one that we hope will ensure that children
with medical conditions get the support and help that they need to
thrive at school. The draft guidance sets out many things that schools
must do to ensure that children with medical conditions can take part
in all parts of school life and give them the best possible chance of
reaching their academic potential while staying safe and healthy. The
draft guidance also acknowledges the different roles that CCGs, local
authorities, schools, nurses, GPs and providers of health services have
in ensuring that children with medical conditions get the support that
they need to be in school. School nurses have several key roles in
helping schools to meet the needs of children with medical
conditions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012979000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0003.htm#14012979000112">For
many children with medical conditions, their specialist nurse often
fulfils this role. Without this medical expertise, schools would not be
in a position properly to support children with medical conditions,
from awareness training about a condition right up to full training
about a child’s condition, the administration of medicine and
the use of equipment. While these responsibilities are included in the
draft guidance, there remains no requirement in the Bill for local
authorities or CCGs to fulfil their roles. That is why I have tabled
Amendment 57C. It is essential that schools know that they can rely on
their local authority, CCG and local health services to provide the
expertise and training their staff will need.</hs_para>

report to many of the charities in the Health Conditions in Schools
Alliance suggest that there will be an initial increase in requests for
training as schools improve their support. We do not want to see some

that there have been many occasions when schools have asked for
training and the local authority or the local health service has not
been able to provide it. The draft guidance refers to the NHS Act 2006
and Section 10 of the Children Act 2004, but these are general duties
rather than ones that specifically meet the very particular needs that
schools will have in securing the training they need for their staff.
Has the Minister considered the possibility that some schools will not
be able to access the training and expertise their staff need? If local
authorities and CCGs cannot or will not provide the training and skills
they need, will the Minister clarify what the next step is for a school
in that situation?</hs_para>

point, it is important that we face up to some of the realities. We
know that there are roughly 1,300 fully qualified schools nurses. The
average school nurse already looks after around 10 primary schools and
two secondary schools. Even if the number of school nurses were to
increase, it would take several years, and the duty needs to start to
make a difference this September.</hs_para>

that for more complex needs it is often the specialist nurse who
organises training, helps to produce the individual healthcare plan and
advises how much support each child requires. If the duty is to make an
impact, the roles of the specialist nurse, school nurses and the local
authorities that commission them and other healthcare professionals are
vital. How will the crucial role of healthcare professionals, local
authorities and CCGs in making sure that things improve in school for
children with health conditions be communicated to them?</hs_para>

makes it very clear just how important an individual healthcare plan
is. An individual healthcare plan draws together the thoughts of the
school, a healthcare professional, pupils and parents. It makes clear
how the condition might affect the pupil, sets out the medicine and
equipment they need, and details the management of their condition, who
should be trained, the level of support needed, what to do in
emergencies and who is responsible for doing what. It is also tailored
specifically to each child or young person with a medical condition.
Yet the indicative draft guidance also states that not all children
with a medical condition will need an individual healthcare plan. The
Health Conditions in Schools Alliance has said that it cannot envisage
a situation in which a child with a medical condition would not need an
individual healthcare plan. Even in circumstances where the pupil
manages the condition themselves and is rarely affected by it, it is
worth noting in an individual healthcare plan that the condition
exists, the medicine the pupil takes to control it and what to do in an
emergency. As it stands, the guidance gives schools an opportunity to
opt out of delivering individual healthcare plans. It also raises the
question: who makes this decision? We do not want a situation where
someone is making arbitrary judgments on who does and does not get an
individual healthcare
plan.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012979000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0003.htm#14012979000118">The
draft guidance makes very clear the role of the governing body in
fulfilling the duty, both in agreeing policies and in making sure that
they are delivered. Paragraph 10 of the guidance covers renewing
policies 
<?notus-xml column=1301?>regularly, which is very welcome. It would be strengthened further if it
was made clear that governing bodies should audit the support the
school provides for children with health conditions so that they know
their medical condition and put it into policy, and ensure that any

medical conditions be excluded from full or part-time education, school
trips, physical education and extra-curricular activities because of
their medical condition. I applaud the Government for the stance they
have taken in this area, as do the voluntary and charitable sectors.
This is light years from where we were before. This document, which is
still for consultation—that will be an opportunity to feed in
many of the issues—is one of the best things I have seen. It

important thing for me, which is in the document, is that governing
bodies will have the responsibility to ensure that the procedures are
followed and that when a school is first notified that a pupil has a
medical condition, action will follow. Governing bodies will also
ensure that the policies cover the role of individual healthcare plans.
I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Kennedy, on this—and I will be
interested in the Minister’s reply—as I cannot envisage a
situation where a child or young person who has a medical condition
would not have a healthcare plan. I cannot get my head around that, as
it seems obvious. This is not bureaucratic or about more clerical work,

Again, I will not repeat the many things that have already been

Brinton (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, offer my thanks and
congratulations to the Minister and the Government for the considerable
progress made since Committee and for the frankly stunning indicative
guidance. It is not yet out for consultation, but it is extremely
helpful. Of course, the problem with providing your Lordships’
House with such prospective guidance is that we all have things that we
think could better it. I will not repeat the points that noble Lords
have already made, but will add briefly the two or three that I am
concerned about.</hs_para>

guidance must make it explicit that children with diagnosed health
conditions are given an individual healthcare plan, even if there are
no obvious actions, not least because medical and health conditions
change and for a child at school suddenly to have to go through that
process, when it was known about at the start, seems rather foolish. It
will speed up the planning process and the school’s ability to
monitor the child’s health if they are already on the radar of
the school.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14012979000128" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0003.htm#14012979000128">I
particularly like the section in paragraph 39 on unacceptable practice.
This is extremely helpful, but there is one glaring omission. Nowhere
does it say that schools must take account of a doctor’s
diagnosis rather than make their own. In Committee I mentioned a young
man who was struggling with severe ME and chronic fatigue syndrome; but
because the head did not believe that ME existed, he was given no rest
times and was actually excluded because he was unable to take part in
sport, which was deemed to be bad behaviour. Despite the fact that his
hospital consultant had given the school formal advice, the head chose
to ignore it. That is unacceptable bad practice and, in my view, it
needs to be included.</hs_para>

relates also to the ambiguity in the guidance about whether pupils with
medical conditions should have individual healthcare plans. We must not
have a get-out clause for schools. I hope that the Minister will be
able to give reassurance on that point and others that my colleagues
have made.</hs_para>

I give my particular thanks to the Minister and his team for meeting me
to discuss my idea about access for teachers with frequently asked
questions on a range of health conditions. This is now progressing:
discussions are about to start with officials in the Department of
Health. I know that the Health Conditions School Alliance already has a
date to discuss that and other things with the department in the very
near future. When a school nurse is not around, this tool for teachers
is going to be absolutely vital. It is not going to be technical and
complex but will help to alleviate the fears that a teacher will have
if a child suddenly moves into their class with a condition of which
they have no experience at all, and if they want to understand both the
learning and social implications of such a
condition.</hs_para>

Young of Old Scone (Non-Afl):</Member></B> My Lords, at this time of
night I shall be brief and not repeat anything that has already been
said. However, I wish to make effusive remarks about the
Minister’s response to the case made by the Health Conditions in
Schools Alliance and for bringing forward a government amendment to the
Bill, for which we are grateful. I thank the Minister for ensuring that

thank the noble Lord, Lord Kennedy, for proposing this very important
amendment. He sought a response from the Minister on what happens if a
school—schools now have a very clear responsibility to look
after these children—fails to get an adequate input from the
local health system in terms of support and making plans for individual
children. From time to time staff at schools across the country say
that they would like to provide a better response in this regard but
are unable to do so because they do not get adequate training and
support from the local health system. Therefore, this amendment is
important as it would reinforce the existing duties under the Children
Act—which, alas, are currently ignored—and make sure that
a school is not put in the impossible position of having a statutory
duty but no means of carrying it out if it is not given the necessary
support<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T21:41:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012979000133" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0003.htm#14012979000133">School
nurses are important but so are specialist nurses for various
conditions because in many cases their specialist knowledge will be
required to establish an adequate plan for each child. Therefore, this

raised<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T21:41:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012979000134" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0003.htm#14012979000134">I
know that this issue is of great concern to the trade unions. It was,
indeed, their only stumbling block. I held the mistaken belief that the
trade unions were not willing to take up this challenge on an
ideological basis. However, their concerns were practical ones. They
were very willing to see teachers give this support to children
provided they were properly supported 
<?notus-xml column=1304?>and trained to do
so<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T21:42:21"></hs_TimeCode>. Therefore,
the question is: what does a school do if the NHS does not step up to

indicative guidance rightly talks about the role of Ofsted in ensuring
that schools meet this new duty. However, there needs to be further
discussion between the department and Ofsted about the latter’s
role and what it will be able to do in relation to this issue. The
guidance says that inspectors are already briefed to consider the needs
of pupils with chronic or long-term medical conditions and to report on
how well their needs are being met. However, that was not quite the
impression I got when I met the Chief Inspector of Schools a few weeks
ago, so clarity is needed about what requirements will be laid on
Ofsted, not perhaps in terms of this duty being fully inspected but at
least the forthcoming guidance to inspectors should brief them on it.
Perhaps at some stage an ad hoc report could be produced on how well
the guidance is being implemented. I press the Minister to tell us what
a school will do if it hits a brick wall with the

that children and young people receive the right support from relevant

support the intention behind the amendment but I believe that there is
no need to place a direct duty through primary legislation on clinical
commissioning groups and local authorities to co-operate in this way

the right practice are in place to make sure that pupils receive the
support that they need in school, and this is achieved by what we are

Lords may be aware, a duty to promote co-operation already exists in
Section 10 of the Children Act 2004. This requires a local authority to
make arrangements to promote co-operation between its relevant partners

bodies, such as clinical commissioning groups, and governing bodies.
Local 
<?notus-xml column=1305?>authorities are required to make such arrangements with a view to
improving the physical and mental health, emotional well-being and
education of children in their area. This duty to promote co-operation
also extends to any other persons or bodies who exercise functions, or
are engaged in activities, that relate to children in the
authority’s area. I believe that the new duty and statutory
guidance, when taken together with this existing legislation, will

relationship between schools, health bodies and local authorities is
extremely important and we have good examples of where it already works
well. Local authorities are commissioners of school nurses and they
look to CCGs to ensure that sufficient provision is available to meet

support pupils with medical conditions as appropriate. CCGs and local

existing models of good practice that we can draw from. Specialist
local nursing teams, for conditions such as asthma or epilepsy, work
closely with schools, and the NHS offers training days, hosted by

Brinton:</Member></B> My Lords, first, I thank my noble friend for the
helpful meeting and exchange of letters that we have had on this
important matter of provision and support for bullied children since
Committee. I have laid a much simplified probing amendment in the hope
that we can make further progress, given that there was considerable
cross-party support for the original amendments.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14012979000151" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0003.htm#14012979000151">My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T21:53:43"></hs_TimeCode>
amendment falls into four distinct parts. The first three sections all
seek to strengthen the definition of bullying and the cross-links
between the special educational needs code of practice and the bullying
code of practice for all bullying incidents. The new draft definition,
which I was kindly shown, strengthens and picks up many of the points
in the original amendment. There is one minor omission. The second to
last line of the new paragraph refers to how bullying can result in
intimidation of a victim through the threat of violence or by isolating
them either face to face or online. I am afraid the reality is that we
need to insert the words, “as well as actual violence”.
Apart from that, the
new<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T21:54:27"></hs_TimeCode> definition
is extremely helpful and I am grateful that we were allowed to see
it<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T21:54:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the House more concrete evidence that, when bullying has happened, a
school or college is required to consider the SEN implications for that
pupil or student, and that there will be formal cross-links between the
two codes of practice? If the Minister can provide that reassurance, it
would go a considerable way towards the original amendment tabled in
Committee, which asked for all severely bullied children to be
considered as having special educational needs. This is because
a<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T21:55:11"></hs_TimeCode> very large
number of children are affected both physically and mentally, because
they and their families often seek help from doctors and because at
present there is no requirement for children and adult mental health
services to prioritise them.</hs_para>

(4) and (5) of the proposed new clause address that. A child out of
school for a period of three months as a result of bullying almost
invariably suffers from depression. They can self-harm, develop panic
attacks or anorexia or want to kill themselves—and as we know,
around 20 a year are successful in killing themselves. Speedy access to
CAMHS is vital. Will my noble friend provide reassurance that children
in this state can get the help they need, with quick referral? Three
months out of school is too long for a pupil to be away from learning
and without active
support<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T21:56:06"></hs_TimeCode>. Will he
also confirm that a child diagnosed with clinical depression, whether
from bullying or not, would be considered as having a health condition
and therefore come under the guidance that we have discussed in the
previous group of
amendments<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T21:56:20"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012979000154" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0003.htm#14012979000154">The
next part of the proposed new clause—subsections (6)
and (7)—tackles the difficulty of educational provision for
those children so severely bullied that they cannot face attending
school or college. I remind your Lordships that academic research by
the National Centre for Social Research estimates that on average
16,000 pupils or students a year are in this position. That is the
equivalent of 16 average-sized secondary schools, which is a shockingly
high number. I am grateful for the points that the Minister commented
on in Committee. There is some specialist alternative provision through
the new free schools, but at present there are only a handful in the
country as a whole, and most of the alternative-provision free schools
focus on students with emotional and behavioural difficulties and only
a handful on bullied children. There is certainly  nothing that
would cover the 16,000 children who need
support<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T21:57:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012979000155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0003.htm#14012979000155">These
children cannot face going into the school where the bullying happened,
even in a special unit inside the school—they cannot even cross
the boundary through the school gates. They must not go to pupil
referral units or to an alternative provision for children with
emotional and behavioural difficulties. What can be provided for these
children, both in the short term and the longer term? What support can
local authorities access to make that provision for them work, as some
schools do not allow the money to follow the child, even though the
child is not in
school<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T21:58:01"></hs_TimeCode>? Finally,
will the Minister ensure that at the very least Ofsted will ask schools
to account for children who are not attending for long periods, for
whatever reason, and to state what action the school has taken to help
them?</hs_para>

end on a positive note. The Government are doing very well on beginning
to change the culture around bullying, particularly through their
£4 million support for the Anti-Bullying Alliance, and including
the work of Anti-Bullying PRO, which is training pupils as
anti-bullying ambassadors. I have seen them in practice and in training
and they are extremely impressive—but it takes time, and only a
few can be trained at any one time. It is a small organisation and
there are thousands of
schools<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T21:58:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012979000157" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0003.htm#14012979000157">I
have also seen the wonderful new online ChildLine help that helps
combat cyberbullying and sexting, called Zipit. If noble Lords have not
had a chance to look at it, they should do so. It is a polite and
slightly tongue-in-cheek way for the young to put down friends and
pupils who send them inappropriate or bullying messages in a way that
does not make them feel as though they are victims. The whole thing can
be simply calmed down. ChildLine has done very well by producing
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T21:59:21"></hs_TimeCode>. Frankly,
more needs to be done, and I hope to hear the Minister today provide

be done for these children. So far, not an awful lot has been done,
until very recently. What we need—and what we have,

to echo my noble friend’s comments about Ofsted. We all know how
very influential it is when Ofsted makes a point of inspecting
something or asking about something. Unfortunately, what often happens
is that when a child is on the school roll but does not attend,
pressure is put on the parents to take them and give them home
education even though the parent may not really be capable of doing it
and would have to give up their job, which the family economy could not
bear. We must try to stop that practice happening. If Ofsted is putting
schools on the spot and saying, “This pupil has not been
attending—what have you done about it? Where are they going? How
are you making sure that the money follows them into appropriate
provision”, then something will

Baroness, Lady Brinton. She is a real expert in this area and it was
important that she put this amendment down. I would like to stress one
particular point—the role of the school in all of this. At one
stage I came across a group of schools that had a very effective policy
of dealing with this situation. Their method was to have a mentor for
each pupil who entered the school, and the child who was mentoring got
merit points for successfully introducing and making life smooth for
the new student. I very much hope that we can do a little more to find
out what group of schools that was—I regret to say that I have
lost my details on it. It seems a very good example of best practice to
sell right across the stage of all schools. As we know, it is not just
a question of bullying in schools—there is bullying in all forms
of life, including employment when you grow up as

say that often the bully needs support as well. I have seen many
occasions where that support has been given to the bully. Sometimes the
bully, with the support of the parents, is referred and the problems
are sorted. I say this with great caution but often, quite rightly, we
put all our emphasis on the poor child or young person who is being
bullied and we forget about the bully. Often with the bully, it is a
cry or plea for help. As well as doing all the excellent things that my

I am not persuaded that legislation is the right approach, those
discussions have proved extremely useful in identifying gaps in our

address these important issues. As a direct result of the debates in
this House and discussions outside it—with both my noble friend
and other experts, notably the Anti-Bullying Alliance, which has always
provided us with helpful and constructive input in the development of
our approaches—we are committed to enhancing our advice to

Government take a zero-tolerance approach to bullying and our advice to
schools on this is clear and firm. I acknowledge that there is a place
for legislation. All schools are required to have a behaviour policy
which contains measures to tackle bullying, and we think that this
approach is the right one. The noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, talked
about these policies being on shelves but I do not think that, in the
modern world, with the kind of pupils and inner-city issues that we
have, any school can afford to have any of these policies on shelves.
They are right at the forefront of practice and I know that bullying is
something that all good schools take very seriously indeed. However,
the national strategy that the amendment proposes could focus
schools’ attention on complying with it as a tick-box exercise
at the expense of allowing teachers 
<?notus-xml column=1312?>to exercise their professional judgment, creativity and energy to tackle
bullying as it presents itself in their particular
school.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401301000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0003.htm#1401301000007">We
had a question earlier today about Islamophobic bullying. Shortly after
9/11, outside Pimlico Academy in Lupus Street, which my wife and I
sponsor, there was a fight between 200 non-Muslim and 200 Muslim pupils
who just went at each other. It was basically a riot. There were police
on horseback and ambulances. It was quite dreadful. Such issues are not
easily sorted out by dusting bits of paper off shelves. I am not saying
that having a strategy is not important, but that school has worked
hard over a long period and I am pleased to say that racism there is a
thing of the past. This is essential to all good
schools.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401301000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0003.htm#1401301000008">However,
it is important that schools are held to account for their
effectiveness in tackling behaviour and bullying. That is why we
reduced the reporting requirements for school inspections in 2011 to
focus on the core business of a school: four core areas, of which one
is behaviour and safety, instead of the previous 27. In setting out how
inspectors should judge this, Ofsted’s inspection handbook
includes explicit reference to considering types, rates and patterns of
bullying. The noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, also referred earlier to
friendship groups. School inspectors must consider how schools prevent
and tackle bullying, and where necessary prompt schools to improve.
This approach encourages schools really to focus on behaviour and
bullying.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401301000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0003.htm#1401301000009">I
know that concerns were raised in Committee that inspectors do not
always see schools as they really are. Since the first Ofsted
inspections in 1992, there has been a steady journey towards
unannounced visits. Initially schools received more than a
year’s notice of inspectors turning up. Over time, this shifted
to eight weeks, and from 2005 to around two days. Under this
Government, this has been reduced to almost no notice, with inspectors
calling head teachers the afternoon before an inspection takes place.
In December, launching his annual report, the chief inspector announced
that where there were concerns about pupils’ behaviour,
including bullying, schools could be subject to visits with no notice
at all. I believe that these measures ensure that inspectors see
schools as they really are; we no longer hear stories of pupils being
sent to the ice rink for the day or asked to stay at
home.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401301000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0003.htm#1401301000010">Our

Lords expressed concerns in Committee that the advice that we currently
outline to schools does not include a reference to the imbalance of

duty applies to children who are not receiving education for any
reason, including as a result of bullying. This existing duty does not
require a certain threshold of absence before it is triggered and so
does not require a child to miss school for three months, as the
amendment would require. Indeed, all schools are already required by
law to inform their local authority at agreed regular intervals of the
name and address of pupils who have irregular attendance, or who have
been absent from school without authorisation for 10 school days or
more. We would expect a local authority to take action as soon as it
became aware that a child was missing education, whether or not the
child was on the roll of a school. Ultimately, the department could
intervene if a local authority failed to discharge its duty or did so
unreasonably.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401301000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0003.htm#1401301000015">Local<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T22:16:19"></hs_TimeCode>

disparate bits of information that have not all been drawn together. We
were aware of where there was a requirement but it was thought to be
beneficial for schools to have something in one place to work their way

Education Act 1996 and the Local Government Act 1999 to the effect that
when a Secretary of State intervenes in a local authority, usually in
response to poor performance, any legislative provision applying to the
local authority can be read as passing to a third party which has taken
over the local authority’s functions and service delivery.
Subsection (2) of Clause 82 applies these provisions to
children’s services and subsection (3) to any best-value
services across a local authority. I have to say at the outset that
there is no disagreement with the need for intervention powers. It is
absolutely necessary to protect services for local
people.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401301000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0003.htm#1401301000025">In
Grand Committee, we sought to clarify the effect of the
Government’s intentions here and the Minister assured us then,
and subsequently in letters to my noble friend, that the intention was
simply a helpful clarification of the effect of a direction under the
Secretary of State’s last-resort power and did not expand those
powers. She gave the example of clarifying for a family court in the
case of a care order or adoption that the court can legally recognise
the decisions and arrangements of a third party which has taken over
the local authority’s functions, even though that third party
will be exercising legal responsibilities and powers vested in local

am also grateful to the Minister that her officials met with my noble
friend to discuss the clause in more detail. However, the
Government’s clause still leaves 
<?notus-xml column=1316?>some uncertainties about where the accountabilities lie following
interventions. I apologise if this all gets rather technical, but it
requires some further clarification. In essence, the clause as it
stands leaves open the question as to where the statutory roles of the
director of children’s services and lead member will reside
after intervention and whether they, or the third party, are
accountable for the way in which local authority functions are
executed. Taken at face value, Clause 82(2), underpinning the roles of
director of children’s services and lead member, could be read
as transferring accountability to a third party. If so, the local
authority would no longer be required to appoint to these positions and
accountability would no longer rest with the local authority. The local
authority would then effectively be severed from delivery of
children’s services and accountability would reside with the
Secretary of State and the third
party.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401301000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0003.htm#1401301000027">These
amendments do two things. First, they insert a process in which a
specific decision is taken about whether the roles of the director of
children’s services and lead member transfer to a third party
following a direction. Secondly, they allow a local authority to make
representations to the Secretary of State as to which functions are
transferred to that third party and which remain with the local
authority. This is a belt-and-braces amendment to ensure there will be
no loose ends or lack of clarity as to where accountability resides,
and for what functions, following a direction. It is necessary because
while the Minister in her examples has sought to reassure us that the
clause is very limited in effect, in fact the wording is very wide in
scope and potentially goes far beyond the specific cases of family
courts considering care orders and
adoptions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401301000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0003.htm#1401301000028">If

in part, because Sections 18 and 19 of the Children Act 2004, which set

reassure the noble Baronesses that proposed new subsections (4AE),

that the Secretary of State gives the local authority written notice of

have contemplated issuing a direction, we have conducted initial
discussions about its content beforehand. We have then formally given
notice of our intention to issue a direction and formally invited
representations from the local authority and other interested
parties—I am glad that I am going to hand this to

were we looking to transfer the exercise of some of a local

envisage, we would of course have to follow the provisions of
employment law in respect of any employees. That would require
consultation and appropriate due diligence around the terms of the
transfer, which could only be done together with the local authority.
In any event, in all but the most urgent cases, common-law principles
of procedural fairness and good governance would require that notice of
a

cases, as noble Lords will know, government intervention in local
authorities rests on the use of non-statutory improvement notices. Such
improvement notices and the process that surrounds them, including
engagement with Department for Education officials, serves as an
effective mechanism for providing local authorities with fair warning
about any proposed escalation to the use of statutory intervention
powers. Although Sections 15(11) and (12) of the 1999 Act allow the
Secretary of State to proceed straight to a direction where he
considers it urgent enough, he must explain his reasoning to the
authority in question, including why no prior consultation has taken
place. I can provide additional reassurance that the dialogue between
the Government and local authorities in intervention cases is always a
two-way process.</hs_para>

sufficient reassurance to the noble Baroness. Statutory directions, by
their very nature, must be absolutely crystal clear about the functions

the 1996 Act or Section 15 of the 1999 Act would be legally

I turn to proposed new subsection (4AH) in Amendment 57E and proposed

497A(6) and 15(6) of the 1996 and 1999 Acts respectively, which set out
that a direction may be indefinite or may operate for a specific
period. In either case, the provisions allow the direction to be
revoked earlier by the Secretary of State. If the Secretary of State

intended to equip Oftsed with the powers required to make a prompt and
timely intervention when it identifies serious concerns about the care
of children. The amendment would extend provisions in the Care
Standards Act that already operate in Wales to England to allow Ofsted
to suspend a person’s registration in relation to a setting
caring for children that is regulated under Part 2 of the Care
Standards Act. This means a criminal offence would be committed if a
registered person continued to operate the setting while their
registration was suspended.</hs_para>

this<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T22:34:58"></hs_TimeCode> power could
apply to any setting regulated by Ofsted under Part 2 of the Care
Standards Act, for example a fostering service, we expect that it would
be used almost always in relation to children’s homes, where

present, in England, if there is a serious incident in a home, Ofsted

we and Ofsted recognise that a power to suspend a person’s
registration is a draconian one. We expect that moves to suspend
registration would happen only on rare occasions where there were very
serious concerns. Ofsted would take this action only if, following
consideration of other enforcement options, it was judged to be
necessary given the specific circumstances of the
case.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401301000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0003.htm#1401301000048">Ofsted<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T22:36:11"></hs_TimeCode>

Drake (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I am conscious of the late hour,
but I rise to speak to Amendment 63, which addresses the need of
kinship carers and their children by seeking to prevent a situation
where the carer loses their job. We are addressing a care community of
an estimated 300,000 children—not a minor group. Family members
step in to avoid them being taken into care. Kinship care, as we know,
is by far the most common way of providing permanence and stability for
children who can no longer live with their parents.</hs_para>

arguments many times. Yet, we know, in spite of the key role that
kinship carers play, that they get too little help. As a society we
depend on kinship carers to protect so many vulnerable children, but we
reciprocate by giving them limited support. Yet the children being
raised with kinship carers can have experienced similar adversities to
those in the care system; they have been through trauma or tragedy,
they have multiple needs and they need time to settle with their
carers, who themselves are required to attend a plethora of meetings
related to the children’s needs.</hs_para>

those carers have no statutory right to any form of adjustment leave to
settle the children. With no give in the employment system, many
kinship carers are forced to give up work in order to do what is right
for the children. The aim of this amendment is to bring kinship carers
into employment protection through a statutory entitlement to a period
of unpaid adjustment leave when taking on the care of the child. Not
only in this Bill but in other recent Bills we have extended or are
extending the rights to statutory leave of other carers and approved

see an incongruity in the Government’s position. In the passage
of the Welfare Reform Bill, when again the arguments about the key role
of kinship carers were rehearsed, the Government, and particularly the
noble Lord, Lord Freud, accepted that friends and kinship carers
undertook a valuable role in protecting vulnerable children, which
often requires them to give 
<?notus-xml column=1322?>up employment, and agreed that kinship carers in receipt of benefits
should be exempt from work conditionality for 12 months. However, when
it comes to employment protection and continued labour market
participation by kinship carers, we see the incongruity. It would not
always be necessary for a kinship carer to lose their job if they had a
period of adjustment leave, and many would remain in the labour market
if they had such leave, which may well improve the life outcomes for
them and their children. So we face a situation where the Government
recognise the challenges facing kinship carers in the welfare system
but are reluctant to do so in the employment system. In effect, the
DWP understood the issue and acted, but BIS remains

Younger of Leckie, recognised the extremely valuable contribution made

that I have referred to—albeit briefly, because of
time—exist now, and I fear that following the passage of the

Viscount also indicated in his letter that the information required for
the broader review of the shared parental leave and pay provisions to
which he had committed is unlikely to be available until 2018, but that
he wishes to work to a much earlier timeline for considering the needs
of family and friends carers for adjustment leave.</hs_parafo>

for the Minister. Am I correct in my understanding of the letter of 23
January that the Government wish to work to a much speedier timeline?
Could the Minister give an indication of how soon he thinks the issue
of labour market attachment and adjustment leave for kinship carers can
be addressed? Notwithstanding the urgent need for adjustment leave
provision for kinship carers, could he also agree to include family and
friends carers in the broader review of parental leave and pay
provisions that the Government have committed to? This would allow for
a more holistic and comprehensive review of childcare leave provisions.
To exclude family and friends carers from that wider review would leave
a key and potentially growing area of caring for
children—kinship care—untouched and unreviewed. I look
forward to a positive reply from the Minister to those three
questions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401301000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0003.htm#1401301000060">I

Stevenson of Balmacara (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I hope it has been
very clear that this side of the House strongly supports the main
thrust of the measures in this part of the Bill in relation to parental
leave, and we do not want to do anything to withhold any form of
approval for what is happening. We have tried to express our support
for that. The amendments tabled today are a reflection of two things.
First, that the broad thrust of the way in which the Government have
taken forward this agenda is exactly as we would like to see it.
Indeed, I might almost say that they have done a little bit more than
we would have considered had we been in power and had to take forward
this responsibility. Secondly, in so doing they have thrown into sharp
relief a number of areas in which measures could be taken which would
level up kinship carers to the position that is now being adopted for
parental leave.</hs_para>

Minister responding to the debate, but we should reflect on the fact
that, during the passage of the Bill, we have moved from the original
position we found ourselves in when we opened up discussions on this
part, which was that nothing could be done in this area, to a situation
where a number of reviews and considerations of particular issues are
now taking place. The purpose of these amendments is to invite the
Minister to reflect upon and read into the record the decisions that he
has been able to reach in relation to kinship and friendship care, some
of which were mentioned by my noble friend Lady Drake, and to ask him
whether he will use this opportunity to reflect a little more on the
gaps that
remain.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401307000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0003.htm#1401307000003">I do

Amendment 59, we have discussed at length the valuable contribution of

them to have the information they need to ask for services when they

on Amendment 63, I fully understand the sentiment behind what is

interventions. For this reason, I announced in Grand Committee that the
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills will lead a research
project into those issues. Officials met recently with the noble
Baronesses, Lady Massey and Lady Drake, and representatives from a

Northover:</Member></B> My Lords, in September last year the Government
announced their intention that all children attending state-funded
schools in England in reception, year 1 or year 2 should be offered a
free school lunch. Amendment 59ZA places a duty on all such schools to
provide lunches to those children and also provides a power for the
Secretary of State for Education to extend that provision to other age
groups by order, subject to decisions by future Governments and the
will of
Parliament.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401307000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0003.htm#1401307000021">We
know from pilot schemes in Durham and Newham, which commenced under the
previous Government in 2009 and concluded under this one in 2011, that
the provision of universal free school meals has
the potential to deliver considerable benefits for children, and

backgrounds.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401307000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0003.htm#1401307000022">One
of the most striking positive effects demonstrated by the pilots was
the impact of universal free school meal provision on educational
outcomes. Independent evaluation showed that pupils were on average two
months ahead of their peers in English and maths and that these
improvements were most marked among children from less affluent
families. Noble Lords may wish to note that these improvements were not
reflected in a third pilot area, where free school meal entitlement was
extended to more pupils but not offered to all
children.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401307000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0003.htm#1401307000023">Other
benefits demonstrated by the pilots included higher take-up rates of
free school meals, including among that the group of pupils who had
previously been eligible for a free school meal but had not taken one.
This is important: we know, due in large part to the good work done
under the previous Government, that school meals are far more likely to
meet good nutritional standards than the packed lunches that children
bring to school. Offering all infants a healthy lunch will allow
schools to play their part in helping children to develop long-term
healthy eating behaviours.</hs_para>

interested to know that the pilots demonstrated certain social
benefits. Universal free school meals help to engender a culture where
children sit down to eat with classmates and teachers in a civilised
environment. Shared mealtimes are a natural training ground for
learning to talk, behave, take turns, be polite and share. The pilots
showed that a universal approach was valued by parents and staff for

respond to this debate, I was initially tempted to run back through the
history of this initiative, not least the Government’s early
decision to cut the funding of the School Food Trust and the associated
rollout of the nutritional standards. However, in the circumstances I
felt that this was rather churlish. However 
<?notus-xml column=1329?>the transformation of policy came about, it is absolutely the right
thing to do. I agree with the Minister that it will bring health,
educational and social benefits to this group of children. It will, I

encourage them to continue eating nutritional school lunches in later
years. It will also provide considerable savings to hard-pressed

play a major role in assisting that rollout. There will obviously be
different challenges for different schools to adapt their kitchens and
dining spaces to meet the new demand. I hope that schools, and
particularly head teachers, embrace this challenge positively and do
not try to cut corners. The school lunch has the capacity to be at the
heart of the school’s community and brings a wealth of other
benefits as well. I very much hope that in a short period the policy
will justify itself. I am pleased that the amendment allows scope for

by the introduction of universal school meals for infant pupils. In
particular, the funding for the next financial year 2014-15 is informed
by school census data collected in the January 2014 school census. This
census is taking place prior to the introduction of universal infant
free school meals. In subsequent years, we will be gathering the same

it would be an impossible task. However, the amendment of the noble

particular groups with specific problems—for example, children
in custody, unaccompanied migrants and trafficked children. In other
words, it is about children who are living without their

public body and that it is for the commissioner to determine what
activities to undertake in carrying out his or her primary function. I
am therefore glad to see that the provisions that currently allow the
Secretary of State to direct the commissioner’s work are to be
repealed but, like the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, I do not feel
completely confident about the appointment process. That is why I have

to my Amendments 59B and 59F, the aim of Amendment 59B is twofold.
First, it is to ensure that the expectation of the UN Committee on the
Rights of the Child that all children’s commissioners shall have
the power to bring and intervene in court cases to ensure that
children’s rights are respected is made explicit in the Bill.
Legal cases can be complex, lengthy, expensive, intimidating and
distressing for children who are often unable or unwilling to take
action themselves. In addition, courts are likely to be even less
accessible to children following cuts to legal aid and proposals for
further reform of legal aid and judicial

second purpose is to put the commissioner on an equal footing with the
Equality and Human Rights Commission in being able to bring cases under
the main legal protection for children in this country, the Human
Rights Act. It should not be presumed that the commissioner will
automatically take up every case but it will be up to him or her to
decide which ones to

59F would expand on the list of those groups of children currently
under the remit of the Office for the Children’s Rights Director
to whom the Children’s Commissioner must provide advice and
assistance. At present, Clause 86 prohibits the commissioner from
providing advice and assistance to children living away from home or
receiving social care who are not within the group defined in Clause
93. As I have seen all too often, there is considerable inconsistency
in how children in custody or migrant children are looked after by
those responsible for them. I have not had the same practical
experience of trafficked children but, in view of their vulnerability
and possible legal needs, it would be invidious to leave them out of
this proposed

more generally, as the Bill has progressed—and particularly in
relation to the best endeavours rather than duties that the Government

said in Grand Committee and by the Joint Committee on Human
Rights—up to a point. With regard to Amendment 59C, I fear that
we are still talking past each other. The Joint Committee on Human
Rights amendment, which I moved in Grand Committee, was not intended to
provide an exhaustive definition of children’s rights, as the
noble Lord suggested in his letter to my noble friends Lady Hughes and
Lady Jones on 22 January. The purpose was to include the UNCRC rights
explicitly in the statutory definition of children’s rights for
the purposes of defining the Children’s Commissioner’s

to be—acting independently from
government<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T23:19:33"></hs_TimeCode>. That
is why we are removing a number of provisions in the existing

independence, as recommended by John Dunford following his review. As a

activities he or she will undertake, or what timescales he or she will
work to—these are all matters for the commissioner.</hs_para>

59B, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, which seeks to add,
“initiating and intervening in legal proceedings”, to the
non-exhaustive list of activities that the commissioner may undertake
in the exercise of his or her primary function, as set out in proposed
new Section 2(3) of the Children Act 2004, inserted by Clause 86.
During the debates in Committee, I said that initiating or intervening
in legal proceedings was, in the Government’s view, implicit
within the commissioner’s primary function. The commissioner has
intervened in legal proceedings on a number of occasions under the
current legislation, and there is nothing in this Bill that changes
that position.</hs_para>

the Children’s Commissioner wanted to bring legal proceedings,
it would fall to the judge in the individual case to determine whether
the commissioner had “sufficient interest” in the matter.
However, the fact that the Children’s Commissioner will have a
statutory role to promote and protect children’s rights,
suggests that the commissioner would have a sufficient interest in any
matter before the courts where children’s rights were involved.
The question is not, therefore, whether it is possible for the
commissioner to initiate or intervene in legal proceedings, but whether
it is desirable to emphasise this aspect of the commissioner’s
remit explicitly on the face of the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401307000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0003.htm#1401307000063">There are
a number of reasons why I do not wish to do that. First, we have
avoided adding to the list, in proposed new Section 2(3), of activities
that are already implicit within the commissioner’s primary
function. Secondly, while I agree that the commissioner should, in
certain circumstances, be able to bring matters before the courts, I
share John Dunford’s view that a decision by the
Children’s Commissioner to initiate legal proceedings should not
be taken lightly. We would expect any commissioner to use this power
sparingly, given the range of functions and issues in which the
commissioner is likely to take an interest, and in the light of his or
her responsibility to make effective use of public

intervening in legal proceedings would raise expectations that the
commissioner will take up legal challenges on behalf of any individual
or group who brings a matter to the commissioner’s attention.
The Office of the Children’s Commissioner is clearly not
resourced to operate in that way, and it could end up wasting time

turn now to Amendment 59F, also tabled by the noble Lord, Lord
Ramsbotham, which would add categories of
children—–namely, children in custody, children who have
been trafficked and unaccompanied migrant children—to the
definition at new Section 8A, which is inserted by Clause
93. In the Government’s view, it is not possible to define
precisely in legislation every interaction that the commissioner and
his or her staff might have with children; nor would we want to. What
the legislation seeks to do, therefore, is to put down some clear
markers that are designed to achieve particular
objectives.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013013000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0003.htm#14013013000003">First,
as noble Lords will be aware, there is a provision that prevents the
commissioner investigating individual cases. This is specifically to
avoid the commissioner getting swamped with individual casework at the
expense of his or her strategic role. John Dunford’s report was
clear that where commissioners had taken on a full ombudsman’s
role, it had reduced their
impact.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013013000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0003.htm#14013013000004">Secondly,
as recommended by John Dunford, we have included provisions in the
legislation that ensure, as far as possible, that the support provided
to children within the Children’s Rights Director’s remit
can and will continue under the new arrangements. Beyond that, we do
not wish to try to enshrine in legislation what level of support the
commissioner should provide to individual children who may contact the
commissioner or his or her staff. It is inevitable, as now, that
children will contact the commissioner through, for example, the
OCC’s website. Where they do, we of course expect the
commissioner to offer appropriate
help.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013013000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0003.htm#14013013000005">In many
cases, that help would involve signposting the child to information or
support. In others, it would involve helping the child to access an
existing complaints or advocacy service, while in other cases it may
involve the commissioner providing support that is similar to the
“advice and assistance” function that the CRD currently
provides. Ultimately, if the commissioner felt that the child’s
case highlighted a matter of wider strategic importance, he or she
could conduct an investigation into that issue. Our view, therefore, is
that it should be for the commissioner to determine what level of
support to provide to children when they approach him or her. That is
why we do not wish to describe how the commissioner should interact
with children in legislation, beyond the two exceptions mentioned
earlier.</hs_para>

believe that it is necessary to extend the definition at Section 8A to
include the groups of children that the noble Lord proposes. The
commissioner will have wide-ranging functions and powers to give him or
her the flexibility to support children as he or she deems appropriate
in the exercise of the primary function of promoting and protecting
children’s rights. Many of those children will, in fact, already
be covered by Section 8A because they are living away from home and/or
are in receipt of local authority services. For example, children on
remand to youth detention accommodation are treated as looked-after
children.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013013000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0003.htm#14013013000007">For
children in custody, there are already adequate complaints, grievance
and disciplinary systems in place, which the noble Lord will be
familiar with, in young offender institutions, secure training centres
and secure children’s homes to enable young people to resolve
issues relating to their detention. Advocacy services are also provided
in YOIs, STCs and SCHs to assist young people in navigating the
complaints, grievance or disciplinary systems. Advocacy is provided by
Barnardo’s in young offender institutions and secure training
centres, with local arrangements in place in secure children’s
homes. If a young person is not satisfied with the outcome of a
complaint, they are able to refer the issue to the Prisons and
Probation Ombudsman, the statutory monitor or the local

advice and assistance role to children in custody does not mean that
the commissioner cannot investigate matters within the juvenile secure
estate as part of a wider investigation. In fact, the commissioner has
already done so—for example, with the commissioner’s
inquiry into the support available in the youth justice system for
young people with mental health issues. So far as the Children’s
Commissioner looking at new SEN support in custody is concerned, the
key plank of these reforms is to make it clear that the Secretary of
State cannot direct the Children’s Commissioner. However, if he

government amendments in this group, Amendments 59C, 59D, 59E and 64B,
respond to concerns that were raised by noble Lords in Committee. In
Committee we had an interesting debate about how the Bill defines
children’s rights, specifically those rights included in the
UNCRC. I set out that our expectation is that the commissioner should
consider all children’s rights—those set out not only in
the UNCRC but in domestic law and other international treaties that
the UK has ratified. However, I recognise that the UNCRC is 
<?notus-xml column=1337?>central to the children’s rights agenda, so I am proposing
through Amendment 59C that the commissioner should have
“particular” regard to the UNCRC when considering what
constitutes children’s rights. This clearly emphasises the
importance of the convention to the discourse on children’s

Committee there was a broad consensus that children’s views
should influence the work of the commissioner. However, it was clear
that some noble Lords wanted to add further provision that would
require the commissioner to summarise in the annual report to
Parliament how he or she had consulted and subsequently taken account
of children’s views. Having considered this further, I have
decided to table Amendments 59D and 59E to this effect, which I hope
will be welcomed. In addition, I have tabled a technical amendment,
Amendment 64B, that will allow the provisions relating to the
commissioner to come into effect on 1 April of this year. This will
allow the reformed OCC to come into effect from the start of the
financial year, and ensure that the transfer of staff and other assets
from the office of the Children’s Rights Director can go ahead

set out in response to the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady

reassurances that the independence of the commissioner is strongly
protected. I therefore urge the noble Baroness to withdraw Amendment
59A. I have also set out the reasons for resisting the amendments
tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, and hope that he understands
the rationale for doing so and is persuaded not to press them. I hope

it is just a matter of words, but it is not how I read it in the first

realistically cope with individual cases. That would be far too big a
burden and would, as the Minister said, “hamper” the

correct me if I am wrong, but he and I are saying that we see the

up his annual leave to be with his son through the surgery. After the
operation, he stayed by his son’s bedside for two weeks as he
slowly died. This used up all his leave. When his son died, the father
rang his employer to explain and was told that he had to be back in
three days. The funeral had not been organised at that point. The
father lost his job because he could not return to work. He needed to
be with his
family.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013013000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0003.htm#14013013000023">In a
second case, a father had known that his baby would be born with a
complex heart condition. He had organised leave for the delivery and
immediate surgical period, but his son died some weeks after the
surgery. His employer told him that he had had enough leave and, as he
had known his son was going to die, he would expect him back in three
days having organised everything. His GP issued him a sick note to
allow him more time to be with his wife, which his employer contested.
The stress of fighting his employer, grieving for his son and
supporting his wife created long-term
illness<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T23:40:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the whole story. There are many employers who support and help their
employees through this difficult time but it is a lottery not a right.
Relying on employers to be caring and supportive of their employees is
clearly not enough. The law does not support the bereaved. With the
increased recognition 
<?notus-xml column=1341?>that parents have a right to be with their children after birth, it
seems extraordinary that we do not extend the same thoughtfulness to
parents who have lost a

that there might be nervousness that this could be a burden on

emphasise again that many employers act with compassion and sympathy

the impact on parents is

give the Government powers to regulate for statutory leave for bereaved

Rhian, who had been in touch through Twitter. About a year after
Lucy’s son Jack died, Rhian’s 18 month-old, George,
choked on the food that his dad was feeding him at home. Sadly George
died. His father was distraught but was given only two days’
compassionate leave by his employer. He committed suicide seven days
later. Rhian has now lost her son and her husband. That is a
particularly tragic story, but it is worth noting that 90% of parents
who lose a child also suffer relationship breakdown. Many parents lose
a partner as well as a

different examples in Committee, showing that the NHS can be
a remarkably uncompassionate employer at times. Those at the top of

worry about a small minority of employers who will not follow guidance.
There are rogue employers and rogue managers who are either so
pressured that they have lost their compassion or never had it in the

back with regulations to ensure that we can all have reasonable time

Lordships may ask: why would the Government not want to take those
powers? Would it be unpopular? As I said in Committee, there is public
support. An opinion poll in the autumn found that, when asked whether
there should be a national guaranteed minimum entitlement to
bereavement leave for a close family member, 70.8% agreed. “Ah,
but would it not be an unpopular burden on business?”, you may
ask. Yesterday, I met the CBI to discuss this narrow measure about
bereavement leave for parents. It was a positive meeting. Although the
CBI is concerned to get the scope and structure right, it is happy to
engage in that debate on the back of the amendment and can see the
in-principle case to do so. It does not oppose it in
principle<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T23:46:36"></hs_TimeCode>. So

I must raise one other issue that I would be grateful if the Minister
would raise with his DWP colleagues. I have talked about time off work
following a bereavement, but not everyone who suffers the loss of a
child is in work. Will the Minister please also consider those on
benefits? Can he ensure that in that circumstance there is
compassionate leave from the conditionality attached to benefit, where
you have to be actively looking for
work?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013013000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0004.htm#14013013000035">Lucy

conclude, this is our case. No one speaks against it, and there is
public support, no business opposition and an overwhelming moral,
compassionate case. People get 12 months or more following a birth,
three days following a death. That cannot be right, and I plead with
the Minister at this late hour to put his prepared notes to one side
and take the time between now and Third Reading to talk to the CBI and
others to see whether taking those powers to regulate in future on top

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, I am glad of the opportunity
to return to this important issue on Report. The noble Lord, Lord
Knight of Weymouth, has spoken passionately about this matter at Second
Reading, in Grand Committee and again this evening. I have been deeply
moved and saddened by the distressing accounts that I have heard of
employees not receiving the support from their employers that they
needed at such a difficult time. We have heard more tragic examples
this evening from the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, and the noble Lord,
Lord Knight.</hs_para>

a loved one is always a difficult experience. Losing a child must cause
a grief that is beyond words. It is of course right that employees are
able and feel comfortable to take time off to grieve in those awful
circumstances. Grief is extremely personal, and everybody copes with
the challenges that it brings in different ways. Individual employers
are best placed to respond to the varied needs of grieving employees in
a sensitive and appropriate way. Fortunately, as has been pointed out
this evening, many employers are understanding and compassionate,
enabling individuals to take all the time off that they need when they
need it. However, as I acknowledged during Grand Committee, this is
sadly not always the case.</hs_para>

very little advice and support available to employers to help them to
develop company policies or approaches to time off for bereaved
employees. This lack of advice can mean that employers, particularly
small employers who have no experience of bereavement in the workplace,
are confronted with a situation that they do not know how to deal with.
As a result, they may inadvertently fail to give their employees the
compassion and support that they need at what is, we can all agree, a
particularly vulnerable time.</hs_para>

committed to ensuring that employers have access to the right advice
and information to facilitate good employment relationships with all
their employees. When this issue was debated during Grand Committee, I
gave a commitment that the Government would bring forward comprehensive
guidance to support employers in meeting the needs of bereaved
employees in the workplace. I am pleased to be able to announce today
that ACAS has agreed to draw on its wealth of experience in workplace
relations to develop guidance that will support employers in delivering
their approach to bereavement. It is, of course, essential that we
harness the knowledge and experience of expert organisations to get
this guidance right so that it can support employers and employees in
the most effective way. For this reason, ACAS will work in close
partnership with Cruse, the leading national charity for bereaved
people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and other expert
organisations during the development and refinement of the guidance.
The first round-table meeting with these organisations is scheduled for
as soon as 5 February.</hs_para>

reviewing the draft 
<?notus-xml column=1344?>guidance, to get in touch with my officials. Indeed, the noble Lord,
Lord Knight, and I had conversations about this last week. This
guidance will be comprehensive, covering the existing statutory

the public sector. Since then, my department has made contact with
employer groups in this sector, including NHS Employers and those in
Civil Service employee policy, as the noble Lord, Lord Knight, will be

Knight, and the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth. It is, however, essential
that we keep the effectiveness of guidance and how it is being applied
in the workplace under review. This is what the Government fully intend
to do. I understand the sentiment behind this amendment, and I believe
that it is important that all individuals are able to take time off to
grieve when they suffer the loss of a loved one. However, I think that
a flexible and sensitive approach, tailored to the needs of individual
employees, is what is needed at such a difficult time. It is not
feasible to legislate to accommodate the vastly different needs of
individuals, which are often the result of different personal
circumstances, family relationships and religious observations. For
this reason I believe that guidance, combined with working with our key
partners to encourage employers to adopt best practice in their
workplaces, is the best approach.</hs_para>

Lister of Burtersett:</Member></B> My Lords, in moving Amendment 63AZC,
I return to this question because, when we debated it in Grand
Committee, it was rather lost in the important debate on kinship care.
The amendment does not ask for very much. It does not require the
Government to introduce leave for workers with caring responsibilities
for a disabled, ill or frail loved one; it simply calls for a review of
the need for such arrangements. As Carers UK argues in a recent report
making the case for carers
leave:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="14013013000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0004.htm#14013013000090">“The

than 3 million people combine working with unpaid care for a loved one
and the numbers are predicted to grow as the population ages. The
danger is that, without the safety valve of a right to a few
days’ leave a year, carers will either reduce their hours or
give up paid work altogether. A Carers UK survey found that two in five
carers who had already done so were around £10,000 to
£20,000 a year worse off. The public expenditure cost of carers
giving up paid work is estimated at £1.3 billion a year.
A<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T23:56:39"></hs_TimeCode> strong

if it is to be of real help. At present, all too often carers use up
annual leave, which they probably need more than most. A combination of
the stresses created by combining care and paid work and no holiday
leave could be one burden too
many.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013013000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-0004.htm#14013013000049">Cross<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T23:57:52"></hs_TimeCode>-national

links the review with the one that we have already been promised into
parental leave, but there is no reason why it should wait until that
review is undertaken. The Minister has already helpfully committed the
Government to a more immediate study of the labour market attachment of

going to come back at Third Reading. There will be ongoing discussions
around those issues and I therefore urge the Minister, perhaps in the

supportive working arrangements can make a significant difference to a
carer’s life by ensuring that work does not add to the
carer’s stress levels. This is why it is important that carers
are able to adjust the way they work to allow them to stay in work,
because work can be important for a carer’s well-being and
income and for maintaining social contacts. As a nation, we cannot
afford to lose the talent and skills of carers from the workplace. The

effectiveness of the right to request flexible working against the

support of this amendment at this extremely late hour. I am grateful to
the Minister. I thought he made a rather compelling case for my
amendment when he spoke about the importance of supporting carers. He
talked about enabling them to participate and thrive, but the trouble
is that the present situation does not enable them to participate and
thrive. I was ultimately very disappointed by the Minister’s
response because it is not about simply collecting statistics, but
about having a formal, structured review of the case that other
countries have now accepted. Therefore I will, of course, withdraw the
amendment, but I suspect that it will not be the last amendment which

announce that, in accordance with the commitment previously given to
reduce the costs of learning to drive, new contract arrangements will
see a reduction in the cost of the driving theory test from
September this year and savings in excess of £100 million over
the next nine years.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14012960000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-wms0001.htm#14012960000005">The Government
Procurement Service (GPS, an executive agency of the Cabinet Office)
and the Driving Standards Agency (DSA, an executive agency of the
Department for Transport and now merged with VOSA into the new Driver
and Vehicle Standards Agency) jointly ran a competition to appoint a
supplier for a framework contract to provide computer-based testing for
the Government. The competition was concluded in early 2013. A call-off
contract for the driving theory test—an essential part of
arrangements to ensure road safety—has now been awarded under
this framework.</hs_para>

the framework agreement was subject to a formal challenge which
prevented award of the agreement during the course of the challenge. To
ensure continued supply of the driving theory test and a reduction in
test fees, and in accordance with Government policy to manage disputes
by the most effective and appropriate means possible, this dispute was
resolved by agreement. This resolution enabled the award of a
government framework agreement to learndirect Ltd on 18 October 2013.
Further, DSA and the Driver and Vehicle Agency Northern Ireland agreed
that the driving theory test will be provided by learndirect Ltd from
September 2016 and that the current provider, Pearson Driving
Assessments Ltd, should continue to provide the test until that
date.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012960000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-wms0001.htm#14012960000007">The
result of these contract arrangements has been to secure a very good,
value for money deal. The reduction in net cost per test, allied to the
Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency’s forecast of increased test
volumes as a result of the economic recovery, means that more than
£100m will be saved over the next nine years. In addition,
national coverage will be improved with tests becoming available at
more locations.</hs_para>

formal challenge and as a matter of good practice, the
Permanent Secretary of the Department for Transport
commissioned an independent review of the handling of the competition
by officials in the Driving Standards Agency and other parts of the
Department. This has now concluded. A separate report on the lessons
that can be learned to inform future procurements will be published
shortly. The National Audit Office has been apprised of these
matters.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Statement">

latter half of 2013 saw persistent planning and targeting by
terrorists, evidenced by a significant number of attacks with lethal
intent taking place in the weeks before Christmas. Many more such
attempts have been disrupted. Overall, the number of national security
attacks remains broadly comparable with previous years. The threat
continues to be tackled and suppressed and there have been some
significant successes by the security forces which should bring both
immediate and longer-term
benefits.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012960000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-wms0001.htm#14012960000013">While
we must remain vigilant about the threat from terrorism in Northern
Ireland we must not allow it to overshadow the many positives to emerge
from 2013, not least the successful hosting of both the G8 Summit and
the World Police and Fire Games. That such high profile events passed
without any significant security incidents taking place is a major
achievement. High levels of cross border police cooperation continue to
be a crucial part of efforts to combat terrorism and keep
people in Northern Ireland safe. Working relationships between PSNI and
An Garda Síochána are excellent. At a meeting in December
between Commissioner Martin Callinan and Chief Constable Matt Baggott,
along with Justice Ministers Alan Shatter and David Ford, it was agreed
that consideration would be given to whether there are ways in which
cooperation between the two police services could be further
strengthened and
updated.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012960000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-wms0001.htm#14012960000014"><I>Security

threat level in Northern Ireland and Great Britain has remained

were 30 national security attacks in Northern Ireland during 2013, over
half of which took place between October and December. Had it not been
for the tremendous efforts of the PSNI and their security partners in
disrupting and preventing further attacks, this figure would
undoubtedly have been higher. I thank the PSNI, MI5 and An Garda
Síochána (AGS), for their relentless and effective
pursuit of the very small, but violent, minority who favour terrorism
over democracy. I also wish to pay tribute to Army Technical Officers
whose expertise and courage has undoubtedly prevented injury in recent
months.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012960000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-wms0001.htm#14012960000017">As in
previous years, attacks have varied in their level of sophistication.
Police officers and military personnel have continued to be primary
targets for dissident groups. PSNI officers in particular have faced
relentless targeting in the last six months. In addition to pipe bombs
attacks against police patrols and devices 
<?notus-xml column=55?>sent by post to senior officers, in December PSNI officers narrowly
avoided injury after their vehicles were fired upon in north Belfast.
Three men were subsequently arrested and charged in connection with
this
incident.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012960000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-wms0001.htm#14012960000018">There
have also been a number of significant attacks on commercial targets.
In November, a taxi was hijacked in the Ardoyne area of North Belfast
and its driver forced to drive to Belfast City Centre with an IED on
board. The device later partially exploded close to the Victoria Square
shopping centre. Had it functioned fully, it would have caused
significant damage and
injury.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012960000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-wms0001.htm#14012960000019">Only
weeks later an IED was placed in Belfast’s Cathedral Quarter, an
area popular for its bars and restaurants and busy with those
celebrating the festive season. Although only a small device, an
erroneous warning about its location meant that it exploded before the
police could fully clear the area. Fortunately, due to the vigilance of
the public and the prompt response of the PSNI, there were no
injuries.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012960000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-wms0001.htm#14012960000020">These
indiscriminate and reckless attempts to intimidate and to damage
Belfast’s thriving retail and entertainment sectors highlighted
a complete disregard of terrorist groups for the people and businesses
at the forefront of Northern Ireland’s economic recovery. The
attacks were not, however, successful and the resilience displayed by
both individuals and businesses in the face of this disruption stood in
stark contrast to the cowardice of those responsible for the
attacks.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012960000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-wms0001.htm#14012960000021">In
September, a viable explosive device which could have killed or caused
serious injury was discovered close to a special school in Lurgan. In
October, postal workers and public officials were exposed to potential
injury after letter bombs were sent to senior police officers and
public figures. These were intercepted before they could cause injury
but, once again, these acts demonstrate a blatant disregard for the
safety of people working in the
community.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012960000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-wms0001.htm#14012960000022">Security
alerts, hoaxes and so called “come-on” attacks also

hugely
inconvenient.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012960000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-wms0001.htm#14012960000023"><I>Successes

PSNI and MI5 continue to devote all the resources required to tackle
the threat and bring those responsible for these attacks to justice.
Since my last statement, there have been a number of significant
disruptions, arrests and convictions as well as seizures of arms and

December, following a PSNI/MI5 operation, three individuals were
charged with a number of serious terrorist offences: conspiracy to
murder members of the security forces, conspiracy to possess explosives
with intent to endanger life and membership of the IRA. Two of the
three individuals were further charged with aiding and abetting the
attempted murder of police officers on 5 December 2013 and with aiding

Forkhill, south Armagh conducted jointly by PSNI and An Garda
Síochána on 18 December led to a significant discovery of
home-made explosives and equipment for bomb-making and highlighted the
importance and value of joint working with colleagues in the Republic
of Ireland. I congratulate the PSNI and AGS on their successes and look

co-operation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012960000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-wms0001.htm#14012960000027">A
number of dissidents have also been found guilty of offences related to
terrorist activity. In January, Gavin Coyle was sentenced to a total of
10 years after admitting having guns and explosives with intent to
endanger life and being a member of a dissident republican
organisation. It followed the discovery in 2011 of the arms and
explosives which included assault rifles and Semtex. The operation
undoubtedly saved lives and now those involved are being held to
account through the justice system. In a separate case, four other men
caught with guns and ammunition in Omagh were sentenced to a total of
36
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012960000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-wms0001.htm#14012960000028"><I>Dissident

so-called “new IRA” has continued to pose a significant
threat over the last six months and has repeatedly demonstrated its
lethal intent. In the north-west, the group has been responsible for a
number of low level attacks as well as an attempted mortar attack on a
PSNI station. In Belfast they have claimed responsibility for the
murder of Kevin Kearney, and conducted a shooting attack against
police. However, the actions of this group have been severely hampered
by the security forces. Arrests, searches, and seizures of terrorist
materiel both north and south of the border have slowed the
group’s development and prevented many more attacks. Security
force successes have constrained the threat posed by this
group.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012960000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-wms0001.htm#14012960000030">Oglaigh
na hEireann (ONH) was particularly active in the latter half of 2013,
demonstrating both its recklessness and its lethal intent with IED
attacks against commercial premises in Belfast, and shooting attacks an
IEDs against PSNI officers. The group has claimed responsibility for
three particularly significant attacks: a vehicle-borne IED which
partially functioned close to Victoria Square shopping centre; a
small IED which functioned in the Cathedral Quarter on a busy
Friday evening; and an under-vehicle IED found under a former police
officer’s car by the officer and his daughter. Terrorists in
Northern Ireland persist in their belief that warning calls
somehow absolve them of responsibility for their indiscriminate and
dangerous actions. This is not the case and these attacks, with their
inadequate and inaccurate warnings, brought us dangerously close to yet
another tragic loss of
life.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012960000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129-wms0001.htm#14012960000031">Over the
last year, CIRA has continued to splinter into competing factions.
Several of these pose a localised threat to security forces, though

Howe:</Member> The Food Standards Agency advises that the safety of
genetically modified (GM) foods is evaluated case-by-case and the
scientific evidence concerning each of the GM foods that is authorised
in the European Union is described in the opinions published by the
European Food Safety Authority. The EU assessment of proposed GM food
and feed products is based on detailed information on the genetic
properties of the GM organism, its agronomic characteristics and its
composition, as well as feeding studies in animals. As a minimum, the
evaluations include repeated-dose 28-day oral toxicity studies in
rodents to demonstrate the safety of newly expressed proteins.
Recognised good practice for GM safety assessments envisages that in
certain circumstances it may be necessary to conduct a 90-day feeding
trial with the GM food, and the need for and extent of additional
feeding trials is considered on a case-by-case basis. In April 2013, EU
regulation 503/2013 introduced a standard requirement for a 90-day
rodent feeding trial for many types of GM
crop.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question"><hs_DebateHeading UID="14012962000183" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129w0001.htm#14012962000183">Burma</hs_DebateHeading><hs_DebateType>Questions</hs_DebateType></NewDebate><hs_TabledBy UID="14012962000201" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129w0001.htm#14012962000201">Asked

Officer Grades on 29 January and it is expected that it will

Framework sets out the principles for transitioning probation staff
into the new structure. Staff will be assigned by automatic assignment
where a role remains substantially unchanged at the point of transfer.
Where an existing role spreads across functions transferring to both of
the new organisations, i.e. the National Probation Service (NPS) and a
Community Rehabilitation Company (CRC), staff in those roles are being
invited to express an interest in working for either the NPS or
CRC.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012962000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140129w0001.htm#14012962000085">Staff
