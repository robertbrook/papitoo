and Commonwealth citizens in Her Majesty’s forces who wish to
apply for naturalisation under section 6(1) of the British Nationality
Act 1981 may currently be at a disadvantage because of their time
served overseas. This is because an applicant must have been in the
United Kingdom on day one of the five-year qualifying period for
naturalisation. As a result, some members or former members of our
armed forces have to wait longer to apply than other people who are
simply living in the UK on the required date. The principles enshrined

service personnel or ex-service personnel and their families could be
helped by the Bill. This measure is not of vast significance and it
will certainly not impact on our immigration or naturalisation numbers

that it is wrong for our armed service personnel and our former armed

against in this way. It is anomalous, and it is something that this

<?notus-xml column=1108?>Second Reading, every day that members of our armed forces have
spent in the service of our country abroad should
have the same value in the eyes of the immigration authorities as a day
spent in the UK. The Bill enjoyed a very thorough and far-reaching

Home Office takes its responsibilities under the armed forces covenant
seriously, as I hope all hon. Members do. We have been steadily
pursuing a range of measures to improve the various interactions that
the armed forces community is obliged to have with UK Visa &amp;
Immigration. We recently implemented a new set of immigration rules for
armed forces families, which include a number of practical
improvements: a five-year visa; a dedicated application form; and the
ability to make applications from overseas. Small things can make a big
difference, and the small but important measure in this Bill is one

am pleased to inform him that our armed forces charities, those that

in this Bill was identified by the Armed Forces Covenant Cabinet
Sub-Committee as a priority commitment. Once implemented, it will
provide the Secretary of State with the discretion to overlook the
current requirement in schedule 1 of the British Nationality Act 1981.
As I said a moment ago, it is not anticipated that the volume of
naturalisation applications from forces personnel will increase
dramatically as a result of the Bill. Rather, it will help a small
number of applicants who will become eligible to apply for
naturalisation earlier than would otherwise have been the case. The
numbers benefiting will be modest, but important none the less. UK Visa
&amp; Immigration does not hold data on 
<?notus-xml column=1109?>the numbers of service personnel and ex-service personnel naturalising
as British citizens, but as I said to my hon.
Friend, we reckon that the number is something in the region of up to a
couple of hundred cases per year, and no more. Not all those cases will
require the discretion provided for by this Bill, but where they do, it
is only right and fair that the people involved should benefit from
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011781000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0001.htm#14011781000026">I

five years ago you were in Afghanistan fighting the Taliban and you

was established under this Government in May 2011. As we know, it is
based on the principles of removing disadvantage from serving personnel
in relation to access to public and commercial services. It also allows
special provision in relation to access for the injured and the
bereaved. Part of the ongoing process, which, I am pleased to say, this
Government as a coalition have set up, is to address that relationship.
If Members have not read the two reports on the military covenant, they
really should look at them. The 2012 armed forces annual covenant

behalf of Great Britain to defend us against the Nazis in the most
pivotal and important aerial battle that there has ever been, the
highest number of pilots was from Poland—higher than New

largest number by a significant degree. How we approach immigration
must be measured and fair. We accept the brightest and the best, and we

private Member’s Bill before us has the full support of my
party. Our only regret is that the Government did not include the
provisions in the Immigration Bill, as they could have done. That would
have allowed Members to table amendments on other categories of people

core principle of the Bill is undoubtedly right, namely that foreign
and Commonwealth personnel serving in our armed forces should not be
disadvantaged if they wish to apply for naturalisation as British
citizens because of time served overseas. The number who will be

The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T10:09:06"></hs_TimeCode> hon.

person injured in service would be disadvantaged if they were unable to
complete a tour of service and left the armed forces early. She cited
the example of a soldier from Ghana who was able to complete only two
years’ service before being medically discharged owing to
injuries incurred while he carried out his military duties. Because he
had not completed infantry training before his medical discharge, which
was a stipulation  of his visa, he was detained and removal
directions  were set against him. It seems wrong that a
concession was not given in that case, and I hope that, if the Bill 
<?notus-xml column=1116?>becomes law, the Minister will introduce guidance so that similar cases,
where the length of service is cut short by injury, do not result in
such an outcome, which I consider to be both unfair and

by Odysseus on opposite sides of the strait of Messina between Sicily
and the Italian mainland. Scylla was a six-headed sea monster on the
Italian side of the strait and Charybdis was a whirlpool off the coast
of Sicily. I am sure that you will appreciate that in this analogy,
Scylla is the Whips and Charybdis the procedural hazards of private
Members’ Bills, not to mention the amendments that can scupper

noted the incredible work done by women on sanitation and water. I also
have the honour to be chair of the all-party group on water and
sanitation in the third world, which I set up about five years ago.
What struck me was the dignity of the manner in which those wonderful
women, who lived on the streets as often as not, would go around and
collect money—one or two rupees—from the slums of Delhi
and Mumbai and aggregate that into millions of rupees that would then
be used to build lavatory facilities that were not available through
the municipal authorities.

represents a social revolution. The scope of the Bill and the statutory
duties it imposes on the Secretary of State, which the Government and
the Opposition have voluntarily and willingly accepted, will put more
flesh on the bones of the existing policies in legislative terms. As my
hon. Friend notes, half the world’s population are women. It

me give one or two examples of the necessity for such a Bill and the
basis on which I introduced it, linked to my personal
experience—including an article I wrote in <I>The Guardian
</I>when I came back from India, in which I said “Eat your heart
out, ‘Slumdog Millionaire’. I have been there and it is
worse than you imagine.” The women deal with the problems on the
ground, but they are estimated to account for almost two thirds of the
people around the globe who live in extreme poverty. Women perform two
thirds of the world’s work and produce 50% of the food but earn
only 10% of the income and own only 1% of the property.</hs_Para>

the same time, all around the world, women are not participating in
public and political life on equal terms to men or in equal measure.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T10:28:16"></hs_TimeCode>The evidence
shows that despite all the great efforts made by the Secretary of State
for International Development and the Department over the years, we are
still not solving the problem. Only one in five parliamentarians
worldwide is a woman, women hold only 17% of ministerial positions and,
at a governmental level, women account for only 13 of 193 Heads of
Government. Women from poor
backgrounds, 
<?notus-xml column=1121?>from rural and indigenous communities and from minority groups are
particularly marginalised in decision-making processes and
institutions. This is a unique opportunity in the post-2015 process
that I described earlier, and the Bill will achieve
as much as the British Parliament and the British Government can
achieve by imposing a duty within the legislative framework of the
international development statutes to put women’s rights at the
heart of the international development agenda.</hs_Para>

burden at all; it is an amplification by statute of existing policies.
It will help to generate self-help, enterprise and productivity in the
third world, because it is women who are driving forward the whole
market programme and helping to create micro-economic systems of
enterprise. It is precisely for that reason that generating all the
advantages of enterprise through women in the third world, who do all
the work in the marketplaces, in the slums and so forth, will increase
all the things that my hon. Friend advocates. He knows, as I
do—I certainly advocate those things—how important it is
to generate enterprise in those countries, because that will
effectively balance the amount of aid that is necessary. The Bill is

that, but the first Bill to promote votes for women was produced by Mr
Pankhurst—Emmeline Pankhurst’s father, I think—and

summary, the Bill places duties relating to gender on the Secretary of

require the Secretary of State, before providing such assistance, to
consider whether it will reduce poverty—I repeat the word
“poverty”—in a way that is also likely to
contribute to reducing gender inequality and, similarly, to take
account of gender-related matters before providing humanitarian
assistance overseas.</hs_Para>

the Bill will help enormously through the very efficient work that is

the great work they have done in this entire exercise. It is part and

international development thinking, because in order for them to give
effect to any particularly policy they will have to have regard to
those measures, as set out in statute. The Bill has all-party support,
including from the leaders of the respective parties, and an enormous
amount of assistance has been given by the Department. I hope and trust
that when it goes to the House of Lords it will manage to navigate
between the Scylla and Charybdis of all private Members’ Bills

increasingly difficult to run these Departments, because every time a

them and saying, “You have to tick this box, that box and the
other box.” Ultimately, it is not a very good way of running a
Department. My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T10:40:19"></hs_TimeCode>

course of four days, we saw the impact of international development on
the camp that we visited, Nizip 2, which is approximately 40 miles
north of Aleppo and 20 miles north of the Syrian border. It caters for
people in northern Syria who are particularly dependent on aid and who
have fled towns such as Homs and Aleppo. They are of all colours, races
and descriptions; it is not only the opponents of Assad and the
Alawites who have fled Syria. The camp is testament to the impact of
the work of international aid, and it is important to bring that to the
House’s attention. There were 17,000 people there, 9,000 of whom
were living in tents. In some cases, there were as many as 15 people to
a tent, albeit that they were very serviceable tents. That may sound
like a huge number, but the people we met and talked to felt that their
situation was much better than it would have been in Syria.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T10:48:43"></hs_TimeCode> camp was
also a container camp where people have, in effect, turned containers
into homes, exceptionally successfully.</hs_Para>

people in the camp, well over 10,000 are children and a vast
proportion are women. I was extremely pleased to see wholesale and
proper education of the young women and children there. I met a young
man called Suleiman who was formerly an engineer in Homs. He had been a
fighter in Homs and had lost several members of his family. He had fled
north of the border to Nizip. As an engineer, he knew about maths. He
was teaching year 7, 6 and 5 students in a makeshift
classroom—it was another container; everything there is a
container—so he had three class years similar to those in this
country’s primary and secondary schools.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T10:50:26"></hs_TimeCode> crucial
point is that all the young girls were getting an education. It was not
a restrictive education that entitled them to do only certain types of
projects. It was fantastic to see integration in the classroom and no
difference between young girls and young boys. There was positive
encouragement for young girls to become whatever they wished to
be.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011781000133" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0001.htm#14011781000133">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T10:51:24"></hs_TimeCode>
did a survey of the children in the class in the Nizip camp and asked
them what they wanted to be. Most of the girls wanted to be one of two
things. Many wanted to be doctors and discussed how they were going to
learn about medicine, including in a practical sense: there was a
surgery and hospital nearby. Many of the others wanted to be engineers.
When I asked these young girls, who were 11 and 12 years of
age—the equivalent of years 6 and 7—why they wanted to be
engineers, it was fantastic to hear them say, “Because I want to
go back to rebuild my

and the state of Syrian refuges, 600,000 of whom are in Turkey, is a
matter of discussion. The crucial point about international aid is
that, by providing a site just north of the Syria-Turkey border, the
international community is able not only to preserve the lives of
refugees, but, more importantly, to provide an environment in which
they are able to live relatively normal, healthy lives. I met dozens of
Syrian refugees and they all told me that they were desperately keen to
go home to their own country when the conflict in Syria abates. If it
does, those men, women and children will have a chance to go home. Such
international aid is outstanding  
<?notus-xml column=1126?>and we should be very proud of the role it

believe that this Bill will help. It is important that education
improves. The young girls I met were 10, 11 and 12 years of age. The
question the Minister needs to answer is: what happens to those girls,
who are receiving a basic education in a container in a refugee camp,
when they wish to have a university education? Given that there are
600,000 refugees in Turkey and that we are providing huge amounts of
international aid to the children, I hope that, by utilising this
wonderful Bill, that aid will provide assistance to those children so
that they can maximise their education potential and address the gender
inequality that has unquestionably existed for many a generation. This
Bill will address the problems those children
face<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T10:54:08"></hs_TimeCode>. Primary
and secondary education can be provided, but the problem starts when
someone wants to be a doctor or an engineer and to rebuild their
country. The Bill will make a massive difference with regard to the
quality of their education aged 14, 15, 16 and
18.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011781000136" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0001.htm#14011781000136">On<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T10:54:36"></hs_TimeCode>
any interpretation, for too long women have battled for equality. They
have fought generations of deep-seated injustice. We could name dozens
of countries where that has been the case, but it is particularly true

Bill’s background is the huge amount of gender-based violence,
but that is merely one part of the oppression. Marginalisation is also
an issue. Anyone who reads the international aid periodicals and
journalistic articles will have read about marginalisation, which
sounds like such a philosophical and normal term, but it is totally
abnormal and abhorrent. It represents a denial of access to land,
credit and banking facilities and other simple matters. There is
plentiful evidence that some female farmers are denied access to seed

is ample evidence in all the periodicals of the economic implications

any interpretation, gender inequality makes labour markets less
competitive, stunts agricultural productivity and decreases expected

House of Commons or the presidents and chief executives of FTSE 100
companies, we can see how only a limited number of women are given a
chance in this country—let alone in others around the

blunt in this House that in many developing countries, discriminatory
laws and social norms are not only a reality, but a fundamental
barrier. They stop female entrepreneurship, curb productivity and stunt
economic growth. As Benjamin Franklin

of gaining an education and going to university. It will make them more
likely to become the doctors, and indeed engineers, that are so badly
needed in the country that we hope will become Syria reborn. I was

bilateral aid, but of multilateral aid. Clearly, we have complete
decision-making power over our bilateral aid programmes. And I would
like to think that we could find a mechanism to bring into effect the

important because a lot of our money is spent on multilateral aid. The
same principles that will be enshrined for bilateral aid when the Bill
has passed through this House and the House of Lords should be part of
our multilateral aid programmes. If in the course of ensuring that our
partners in multilateral aid programmes have regard to gender equality
and relieving the poverty and suffering of women and girls, we persuade
those countries to take such a view in their own bilateral aid
programmes, the beneficial effects of the Bill will be multiplied

law. People must have security in their own property so that they know
that if they build a business or if they have a successful agricultural
concern, even if it is only on a small scale, they will be able to reap
the benefits for themselves and their families. We need to do
everything that we can to support world trade and to support our
businesses in their relations with the poorer nations of the world. A

I turn to the substance of the Bill, I thought it might be helpful to
the House if I clarified a couple  of points that the hon.
Member for Gainsborough (Sir Edward Leigh) put to the
Minister that are central to the argument over why the Bill is
necessary. The Bill speaks to two scenarios. The first is where there
is a broader programme of poverty reduction and the second is where
there is humanitarian assistance. Humanitarian assistance relates not
just to the period immediately following a disaster, such as that in
the Philippines, but to the weeks and months that follow because such
operations have a long time
lag<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T09:56:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

consideration of gender equality can literally be a matter of life or
death. In the light of recent conflicts and humanitarian disasters, for
example, we have seen alarming reports of women finding themselves at
extreme risk of exploitation and of serious and sexual violence. It is
right for the Department to give due consideration to that point. The
basis of all successful humanitarian interventions is effective
planning, and DFID has also been doing good work in that regard. I
believe that is why we have been a successful partner in work around
the world. Awareness of gender issues is required, and we know that
women, much more than men, are at risk of violence in lawless
conditions. It is therefore right to have the dual provisions in the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T11:20:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

gender inequality is one of the defining issues of our time. It is core
to development now and will be as we go through the post-2015 process.
As the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T11:20:48"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Member for Stone (Mr Cash) rightly pointed out, we live in a world in
which women shoulder 66% of the burden of work but own only 1% of the
property. It is a world in which women account for two thirds of the
1.4 billion people living in extreme poverty and the
774 million people struggling with illiteracy; in which,
tragically, an estimated 1.6 million daughters each year are not born
because of a deep-seated preference for sons; in which one in five
adolescent girls continue to be denied an education by the daily
realities of poverty, conflict and discrimination; and in which one in
three women are subject to violence, whether at a time of armed
conflict or behind closed
doors<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T11:21:41"></hs_TimeCode>. We know
the disproportionate impact of conflict on women, yet less than 3% of
signatories to peace agreements are female. The House should also
remember that only one in five national parliamentarians are
female.</hs_Para>

the Bill. The Opposition should draw attention to
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T11:27:15"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Hackney South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier), who I know

fact that we live in the world that I have described places a moral
duty on all of us to do more. Manifestations of inequality, brutality
and cruelty still occur on a daily basis, which is why we welcome the
Bill. In government, Labour started the journey of prioritising gender
equality in development work—from DFID’s first ever
gender policy document in 2000, which highlighted the importance of
women’s empowerment beyond just regarding them as instruments of
poverty reduction, to the three-year gender equality plan launched in
2007, which imposed specific responsibilities and embedded expertise
across DFID’s delivery of programmes. In fact, one reason why we
welcome the Government’s approach to the Bill is that at that
time, there was concern about that action plan coming to an end. I
believe that the Department has a genuine commitment to gender
equality, from the Secretary of State downwards, and we support it in
its
work<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T11:23:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011781000181" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0001.htm#14011781000181">Some
of the biggest global challenges that we face will require the

have made before. When I came into the post of shadow International
Development Minister, I believe I became the first male Member of
Parliament, either in government or in opposition, to have
responsibility for the brief of the prevention of violence against
women and girls and gender inequality since it was divided out as a
separate area of responsibility within DFID’s work. I say that
because we increasingly need to encourage men to have confidence to
speak on those issues. This debate is a good example of that. Holding
back women in society is not just holding back women, it is holding
back society. It affects not just the development of women but the
development of nations, which is why we absolutely need to make the
case for this being a mainstream issue, not just a
“women’s
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T11:25:56"></hs_TimeCode>”.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011781000185" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0001.htm#14011781000185">Experience
has repeatedly demonstrated that targeted initiatives for women need to
be complemented by action to bring mainstream attention to gender
equality and women’s rights across all development
interventions. A focus on gender equality is often characterised by
tokenism and hollow gesturing. That is why I believe the Bill is
important—it is not a box-ticking exercise, it is about a shift
of mindset in how we engage in these complex issues. I hope it will
address them by putting the well-being of women and girls and the
achievement of gender equality at the forefront of everything that we
do. <hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T11:26:31"></hs_TimeCode>Gender

fewer children; and women are participating more in the labour

Violence against women and girls is a global pandemic, and one in three
women have experienced violence in their lifetime, which is a terrible
statistic. I believe that that is the greatest unmet challenge of our
time, not some sideline issue. It is a matter of basic human
rights—the right of girls and women to live a life free of
violence, to have an education and a voice in their community, to
choose who to marry and when, and to have control over their
bodies.</hs_Para>

equality is also a critical building block for progress towards other
development goals. Around the world, people recognise that where open

opportunity to participate, people and communities are more prosperous,
healthier and safer. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister refers to
that as the “golden thread” of development, and time and

power that the United Kingdom is able to exercise, through the
Department for International Development, is the power of example.
Where we lead, many others follow. For instance, where we have led in
assessing multilateral organisations, or in a review of how to respond

all the world-leading work that DFID is doing on girls and women, but
we cannot afford to take our eye off the ball. Although we have come a
long way on gender equality, there is so much further to go. There are
still too many girls and women whose potential is wasted, and it will
not be easy to reach them. We are talking about some of the poorest,
most vulnerable people in the world—in many cases, the unseen
and the unheard. We must keep up the pressure, the resources and the
visibility of our actions to achieve better outcomes for women. That is
why we all think that the Bill is so important. It will give our
commitment to addressing gender inequality in countries where we
provide development assistance a statutory footing, and enshrine it in
law. If passed, the Bill will mean that a Secretary of State for
International Development must have regard to reducing gender
inequality before making decisions to provide development assistance
under the International Development Act
2002.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011781000200" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0001.htm#14011781000200">Such
a duty will bite not simply in the act of providing development
assistance, but in the work that takes place beforehand—for
example, in the preparation of a business case by officials that
informs the eventual approval decision of a Minister. In other words,
right from the outset the Bill sets in train a proper approach to the 
<?notus-xml column=1136?>priorities that need to be addressed. That is crucial because gender
equality is not something that can be just tacked on to our development
programmes and humanitarian assistance, and it cannot be an
afterthought if we want to get to the root of the problem. In that
respect, perhaps I can address the concerns of my hon. Friend the
Member for Gainsborough (Sir Edward Leigh), and reassure him
confidently that as far as I can see no perverse consequences will
ensue from the Bill. Indeed, to use modern jargon, it reinforces
“best practice”—that is perhaps not a turn of

shapes ministerial leadership and does not in any way impede it. As we
have heard, we already feel that there should be a keen focus on women
and girls when taking humanitarian action, because as we know, women
and girls are susceptible to rape used as a weapon of war, and that is
the sort of humanitarian peril we try to address in our
assistance.</hs_Para>

not introduce any significant costs. It is about ensuring that
Ministers and officials fully take into account the interests of girls
and women—as well as those of others—in administering the
United Kingdom’s bilateral aid programmes. If the Bill is
enacted, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I will ensure
that training and other measures are put in place in the Department to

Bill comes at a timely moment. Many in this House will be aware that
the deadline for the millennium development goals for tackling global
poverty is fast approaching. The old ones expire in 2015, and a new set
will be designed and implemented. In May 2013, the UN
Secretary-General’s high-level panel reported back on
recommendations for that post-2015 development agenda. The panel,
co-chaired by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, alongside the
Presidents of Indonesia and Liberia, put forward a bold and ambitious
vision for ending extreme poverty by 2030. At the heart of their report
was a clear and powerful message that to defeat poverty we must leave
no one behind, regardless of gender, ethnicity, geography, race or
disability.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011781000204" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0001.htm#14011781000204">It
is important that this ambition is not watered down in the final set of
goals, which will replace the MDGs in two years. As negotiations get
under way, the UK will push for a standalone goal on gender, with
ambitious targets to tackle critical issues, such as ending child
marriage and securing equal rights for girls and women to open bank
accounts and own property, as well as integrating gender throughout the
goals. I believe that the Bill, if passed, will set an example and put
the UK in a stronger place to exercise influence in other forums,
including those of multilateral organisations where the UK has a voting
presence and to which we contribute significant
funds<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T11:40:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011781000205" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0001.htm#14011781000205">Where
half the population is locked out, prevented from being productive and
from pursuing opportunities, there is no sustainable path to
development. We urgently need irreversible gains in protecting the
rights of girls and women and an end to violence against them.
Improving the lives of girls and women is already a top priority in
every area of our international development work. The UK is helping
millions more girls and women to have voice, choice and control, and we
are working to drive social transformation and shift discriminatory
practices 
<?notus-xml column=1137?>such as early and forced marriage and female genital cutting.

Chope:</Member></B> I am sorry to disagree with my hon. Friend, but as
soon as he resorts to the expression “progressive” and
subsequently refers to the university of Essex, he has lost me. I think
that the level of wages should be set in a private arrangement between
the employer and the employee, and that it is not for the Government to
intervene. We hear all the current talk about whether the minimum wage
should be increased, but it is open to anyone currently on the minimum
wage to go to their employer and say, “I would like to be paid
more”, while it is open to the employer to pay their workers
more. The fact that they are not being paid more suggests to me that
the labour market is such that if they were paid more it would result
in either them or their colleagues being put out of work.</hs_Para>

different labour markets in different parts of the country. What might

some of the more remote parts of the country. I do not know what my
hon. Friend thinks the position is in Hexham, but if the national
minimum wage is designed to ensure that people in London and in Hexham
are treated equally well, it is likely to have the result of reducing
the employment opportunities in his

sources; they are independent. It has been shown that the minimum wage
does not impact on jobs. My hon. Friend challenged me specifically on
the north-east. I represent an area that has one of the highest levels
of social deprivation and there is still significant unemployment there
to this day. It is coming down, but it is still significant. A rise in
the minimum wage would be a fantastically good thing—for the
north-east and for employers. I suggest that it would produce greater
loyalty, greater productivity and greater enthusiasm in the work force.

that the minimum wage cannot have any impact on jobs is to ignore the

law in this area is evolving and changing. That is largely being done
through regulation, but it is also occurring through decisions taken by
the unelected judges in the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.
They are, in effect, giving an interpretation of what was originally a
free movement directive—everybody would have gone along with
that, because one core element in the European Economic Community was
that people should be able to go from one country to another and take
up employment there. Following the successive treaties, directives and
regulations, the interpretation now is of people having a right to go
to claim benefits in any country in the European Union once they have
been there for more than three

cannot claim benefits in a place such as Germany unless they have been
there for a considerable time. So why do the Government indulge in the
politics of the pre-emptive cringe, kowtowing before what the European
Commission might say in the future? Why do we not just say, “You
cannot get a benefit for 12 months” and see whether
it takes us to court? We could argue about it for years, so I do not

Minister of State, Department for Work and Pensions, the hon. Member
for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning), who is on the Front Bench today,
will tell us what has happened in the subsequent year regarding
recording nationality and immigration status, because if we do not even
have basic information about the nationality of migrants or people
claiming benefit, and have no means of finding that out, how can we
ever have the tight controls that the Government keep talking
about  
<?notus-xml column=1143?>to ensure that migrants from other EU countries do not abuse our benefit
system in their first three months here, or ensure
that they are genuinely seeking work?</hs_Para>

first provision in the Bill would ensure that national insurance
numbers were issued only after the applicant had declared their
nationality, and would not make it possible for anybody to claim
benefit without declaring their nationality. In that way, we could at
least gather some statistics about the use of our benefit system by
nationals from other countries, which we certainly cannot do at the
moment.</hs_Para>

is a big problem and I fear that it suits the Government not to give
the people the full facts on this issue. They have statistics measuring
net migration, for the purposes of meeting a commitment they made at
the last general election to reduce net migration to the tens of
thousands. However, there are different ways in which net migration is
calculated. The labour force survey estimates that the number of A2
nationals living in the UK has increased by 25,000 a year in the six
years between 2007 and 2013. However, the Government’s figures,
which are based on passenger surveys carried out at ports and airports,
suggest that there were fewer than 10,000 new people from Bulgaria and
Romania a year. As we do not have a way of measuring people’s
nationality when it comes to national insurance numbers or benefit
claimants, the Government have to rely on passenger surveys to find out
how many people have come from Romania or Bulgaria.

Martinez-Sala, case number 85/96, it says that it is
possible to require the payment of a “child-raising

I am delighted to be one of its sponsors. As he said, it addresses a
matter that is in the news a great deal at the moment—it could
not be more topical. I think it demonstrates the real difficulty that
the House sometimes has in connecting with people’s problems,
because of the way our processes work. I will speak as briefly as I

that I am on the right lines. The problem is not with him—he is

are two things to consider in the Bill. There is the meat of the Bill
itself, although I will not go into the detail, because it is very
straightforward. It can be summed up in one simple sentence: British
benefits for British citizens. That is really what it boils down to. It
is not rocket
science.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011781000279" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0001.htm#14011781000279">We
know this is a very popular measure. As
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T12:24:41"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
mentioned, Lord Ashcroft has scientifically tested the will of the
nation on a number of the measures in Bills that several of us had
proposed at the start of this Session. His polling company conducted a
poll on 28 and 30 June 2013—bizarrely, it covered
2,013 adults; I think that is purely coincidence—in which a
representative sample of the British people were asked whether they
agreed or disagreed with certain propositions in those Bills. It asked
specifically about the two proposals in this Bill: first, recording the
nationality of a claimant; and secondly, restricting welfare benefits
to UK citizens.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14011781000280" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0002.htm#14011781000280">The
respondents were not only asked whether they supported the proposals
but split into two groups. The first group were told they that the
measures had been suggested by some unspecified people and the second
group were told that they were being proposed by Conservative
politicians. Seventy-one per cent. of people in sample A—those
who thought the measures had been proposed by unspecified
people—agreed with the 
<?notus-xml column=1148?>proposition that we should record the nationality of benefits claimants.
The negative Tory effect, as it was called, was minus 3%, in that even
if people were told that those nasty Conservatives were making the
proposal, 68% still said, “I’m not bothered who puts it
forward—it’s still a damn good idea and I want to support
it<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T12:27:26"></hs_TimeCode>.”
Lord<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T12:29:45"></hs_TimeCode> Ashcroft
then took into account the people who said, “Frankly, I’m
not that interested in politics and I can’t give a view—I
neither agree nor disagree”; he called it the
“Meh” effect. Twenty-one per cent. of respondents said
they were not bothered either way, which, if one takes into account the
71% of those in sample A, leaves just 8% of the population disagreeing
with the proposition that it is a good idea that we should record
someone’s nationality when they wish to apply for a national
insurance number.</hs_Para>

proposition on restricting welfare benefits to UK citizen, which is
perhaps more important, was, I am pleased to say, even more popular,
because 74% of people in sample A said they agreed with it, and 70%
still thought it was a good idea even when they were told that it was
being put forward by Conservative politicians. The figure for people
who neither agreed nor disagreed—the “Meh”
effect—was

are enormously popular propositions, whichever way one looks at it. Our
own anecdotal experience will tell us that if we go out into the street
and discuss this with people they will say, “Of course British
benefits should be paid to British citizens.” Nothing annoys
people more than the thought of the taxes that they have paid as a
result of hard work being paid to claimants who have not contributed to
the system at all and have just come to this country saying that they
are looking for work. Frankly, they are bound to say that; they are
hardly likely to say, “I’ve come here because
you’ve got a better benefits system.”
I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T11:19:28"></hs_TimeCode> have no doubt,
to be fair, that it may well be true that most people come here looking
for work, but that does not negate the fact that the overwhelming

matters. As my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T12:31:37"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch has said—I fear the
Minister will say the same thing—the most we can do is restrict
for three months the benefits of people who come here from other EU
countries. To be frank, that is neither here nor there. It is no wonder
that people are not satisfied with that response. Of course, they agree
with it—it is better than nothing and we agree entirely that we
should do it—but it is nowhere near 
<?notus-xml column=1149?>being a sufficiently robust response to the complaints we hear every day
of the week, such as, “I know very well that there are people
living down the road who have moved here and made no contribution to
the system, and yet they are claiming benefits.” I do not think
that making them wait for a few weeks before they can claim will be
enough to assuage people’s
concerns<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T12:32:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011781000286" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0002.htm#14011781000286">I
do not want to go down another avenue, but, to be honest, our
relationship with the EU goes to the very heart of the problem, and
unless we deal with that relationship, we will not be able to solve the
problem. When this country joined the EU, it was not, of course, the
European Union, but the Common Market. People thought that they were
joining a free trade area. It had nothing to do with lots of people
coming here and claiming benefits. As my hon. Friend has said, over the
years we have seen a general competence creep on the part of the EU. It
has gradually taken over more and more competences: more and more
things have become its responsibility rather than the responsibility of
this Chamber. It is, therefore, no wonder that people feel that it is
not worth voting in elections and say, “There’s no point,
because you can’t change
anything.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011781000287" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0002.htm#14011781000287">We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T12:38:01"></hs_TimeCode>
have yet to hear what the Government’s red lines are in
renegotiating our EU terms of membership, but such matters should be
brought back within the control of this Parliament. I venture to
suggest that if any party put that in its manifesto, it would be
extremely well received and very popular, as shown by the evidence that
I have given. The popular nature of the measure would be demonstrated
if we put it in a manifesto and voted on it in a general election,
knowing that it could be brought into law and that its introduction
could not be stopped by the European
Union.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011781000288" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0002.htm#14011781000288">If<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T12:36:36"></hs_TimeCode>
the measure is prevented by our membership of the EU and that fact is
not changed in any renegotiation, the British people would be
absolutely right to vote to leave the EU so that we can get back
control over such matters as deciding who we pay benefits to. That is
the heart of the matter. The measure is popular and would receive
widespread support right across this country. I will not detain the
House with the details, but the poll shows that it is supported by all
age groups, sections of the public and parts of the

presumably campaign for every non-EU citizen who comes into this

be suggesting that all the people who come in from the EU are decent

need to restrict access to benefits for them. If he is not saying that,

many Members have had similar cases. A man from Poland came into my
constituency surgery who had come here to work, as he was entitled to
do. He had heard on the grapevine in his local community that he was
entitled to claim child benefit for his four children who were still
residing back home in Poland. He thought that seemed like a good wheeze
and that, if all his colleagues were doing it, he might as well do it
himself. Of course, he found that, bizarrely, he was entitled to child
benefit for his four children, who had never in their lives set foot
outside Poland and who were living there with his wife, their mother.
There is absolutely no justification for anybody from another country
in the EU claiming child benefit for children who have not even had the
decency to come over to this country and who are still residing in

proposition. I do not know whether my hon. Friend has in mind how long
that person might have had to work to be able to access
benefits—it was not clear whether he felt that there should be a
certain time span. As far as I can see, he is describing a non-British
citizen who has come here not out of the goodness of his heart and
concern for the UK’s economic well-being but, presumably, out of
concern for his own economic well-being. It sounds as though he would
have done rather well. Once the job is no longer available, I do not
see any particular reason why we should then sustain such people in
unemployment. It seems to me that at that point, we should be perfectly
entitled to say, “If you can’t support yourself, we are
not responsible for your continued upkeep.” I do not see why
that should be unacceptable.</hs_Para>

stop receiving that help. Some will be in receipt of other
non-contributory benefits such as pension credit, so we are talking
about some pensioners being affected, perhaps after a lifetime of
working in the UK. Some are in receipt of child benefit, which is not
insurance based, or tax credits, but under clause 4 they would suddenly
lose them. European Union citizens would suddenly be disadvantaged not
only relative to UK citizens, but also relative to citizens of

the shadow Minister and several colleagues alluded to, I am trapped,

House. I am also slightly restricted in that, if I, as a Minister of
the Crown, have legal advice that the Bill would be a breach for which

I had to mention universal credit because that provides the answer to
how we would know which country people claiming benefit come from. We
are working closely, too, on making changes to the legal framework at
the EU level, particularly in respect of family benefits for children
who are not resident in this country. We think—and I think hon.
Members would agree with me—that child benefit and child tax
credit should not be paid to non-EU member families that are not
resident in this country; we need to work on changing that.</hs_Para>

is whether the scope of the Bill is such that the Government could
support it. I am afraid that it is not. We sympathise with much of the
intention—and so would my constituents—but as we run into
the next election and the referendum, the Prime Minister will be
participating in attempts to renegotiate our position to give this
Parliament the sort of control over benefits and other issues that we
would expect. Sadly, on behalf of the Government, I cannot support the
Bill

Chope:</Member></B> That is both a surprise and a disappointment,
although I am grateful to the Minister for saying that he agrees with a
lot of the ideas behind the Bill. He says, in effect, that his hands
are tied, he cannot do anything about it and we need to renegotiate
these issues. My concern is that there does not seem to be any evidence
that we will be able to command a majority in the European Union to
renegotiate along the lines that we 
<?notus-xml column=1157?>seek. When I asked the Prime Minister whether this issue would be one on
which we would be renegotiating, my question was passed to the Foreign
Office and it replied by setting out priorities for renegotiation that
did not include anything to do with the subject matter of the Bill. I
hope that my hon. Friend the Minister has therefore been announcing new
Government policy today in saying that this subject will be right at
the forefront of our renegotiation of our terms of engagement with the
European Union. If that is so, I have not been putting forward this
Bill and arguing in vain.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for New Forest East (Dr Lewis). Their
presence and involvement shows that this subject will not go away and
that a lot of people feel strongly about it. I asked the Minister how
he will be able to find out whether somebody applying for
jobseeker’s allowance has been in this country for less than
three months, and whether they come from outside the United Kingdom and
are a national of another EU country. In reply, he said that he would
not be able to sort that out with a requirement as to nationality until
universal credit came in, but on any view that is some many months or
years away. Meanwhile, the Prime Minister, the Home Secretary and the
Secretary of State for Work and Pensions are saying, “We are
going to get tough, with effect from 1 January.” That is because
people from Romania and Bulgaria were able to come here from 1 January
and we were assured that we would be rigorous in ensuring that none of
them would be able to apply for benefits within three months of their
arrival. How are we going to know when people arrived and what
nationality they are unless we have some means of asking the
questions?</hs_Para>

Minister’s failure to answer that simple question drives a coach

we are giving people the impression that we have got control over this
when we have no control over it whatsoever. If that was

<?notus-xml column=1158?>apparent from what has been said already, the fact that the Government
are being taken to the European Court on the issue even

why I think I speak for most of my hon. Friends in saying that unless
we can sort this out, we would be better off out of the European Union.

Poole sees illegal immigrants from the continent getting out of the
back of a van or lorry and decides to call the police, the police are
not interested because they have no power of arrest as the person has
not committed a criminal offence. All they can do, if they are feeling
generous with their time, is tell those people to go to Croydon to
report to the  
<?notus-xml column=1160?>immigration and nationality directorate, which will tell them how to get

then come on to the question of penalties. Let me illustrate the point
with an example. I have a constituency case of a person who came here
on a visitor’s visa. As they are married to a British citizen,
all they needed to do was keep renewing that visa but they did not
apply for an extension within the specified time and as a result they
have been refused a new visa. I discussed with them whether they should
appeal against that refusal, but there is no power of appeal and the
advice that is given is that if an in-country application for a visa
extension is rejected the person should voluntarily make their own way
back to the country from which they came as it is possible they might
be subject to a deportation order in due course. Of course, under the
law a deportation order is subject to appeal so the authorities do not
want to make many such orders as the appeals would clog up the
immigration tribunal system. People therefore overstay their visas with
impunity as there is effectively no sanction against them. The only
sanction arises if they want to visit their country of origin to see a
relative or something like that, when they suddenly find that they do
not have the right paperwork to get back into the country. They can lie
low in this country with impunity for months or years.</hs_Para>

think it would be reasonable to say that somebody guilty of an offence
on summary conviction should be subject to a maximum penalty of six
months’ imprisonment or a fine that would be unlimited in
England and Wales and would not exceed £5,000 in Scotland or
Northern Ireland. A person would be brought before the court and, under
the provisions of clause 2(2), would be ordered to be
deported.</hs_Para>

the present laws relating to deportation, which are rarely exercised,
certainly for relatively minor offences—they are not applied in
the cases to which I have referred—the deportation order would
be mandatory unless the Secretary of State certified that it was
against the public interest. In practice, the person would come before
the court and, if found guilty, would be fined and deported or
imprisoned, probably not for very long, pending deportation. The
deportation would be ordered by the court, rather than the immigration
authorities—the Border Agency—which is what happens at
present<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T13:30:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011781000398" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0002.htm#14011781000398">An
official from the Scotland Office contacted me, wondering what will
happen in Scotland when the Bill is on the statute book. She pointed
out that in Scotland deportation orders are not made by the courts;
they merely make a recommendation to that effect. She agreed that there
is nothing to stop the courts being given the power to make specific
deportation orders, which I think is fundamental to clause 2. If people
are here without legal authority, the most important thing is that they
are deported as soon as possible, rather than 
<?notus-xml column=1161?>kept in custody at great expense. Rather than being subject to a
recommendation of deportation, they should just be
subject to
deportation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011781000399" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0002.htm#14011781000399">While

public that something is being done about all this, but my experience,
which I have referred to briefly today, leads me to believe that that
is another game of bluff and bluster by the Government and that, in
reality, they do not have the will to ensure that our borders are kept

support for the Bill promoted by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T13:36:54"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Christchurch (Mr Chope). In all the words he used to
describe it, he missed out “modest”, because it would
merely strike a blow for common sense. I do not see why anybody could
have any great objection to making being an illegal immigrant a
criminal offence. Indeed, I would have thought that most people think
that that is already the law of the land. I am sure we are all grateful
to my hon. Friend for highlighting this
issue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011781000410" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0002.htm#14011781000410">I
would like to raise a couple of additional points beyond what my hon.
Friend said—I agreed with every word—regarding matters
that go hand in hand with the Bill and that the Government need to
address. First, there is the need to extricate ourselves from the
European convention on human rights. One of the major problems that
this country faces in kicking out illegal immigrants is the Human
Rights Act 1998 and the fact that the European Court of Human Rights,
time after time, compels the United Kingdom to keep people in the
country who have no basis for being here. Unless we tackle that issue
as well, even my hon. Friend’s best intentions will be thwarted.
I make an appeal for us to scrap the Human Rights Act, which has become
a charter for criminals and illegal immigrants, and to get ourselves
out of the European convention of human rights, because it is no longer
acting in the UK’s national
interest<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T13:38:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011781000411" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0002.htm#14011781000411">My
other point, which I particularly direct at the Minister, is that
people who have served their prison sentence for being in this country
illegally should then be automatically kicked out. Unfortunately, on
too many occasions when illegal immigrants are sent to prison having
committed other criminal offences, even those people are not
automatically deported from the country, as most people would think is
the blindingly obvious thing to do. Far too many of them are released
back on to the streets to go into hiding or to go out and commit more
crimes. The Government can do an awful lot to get their performance
right in making sure that any illegal immigrant who is caught is kicked
out of the country straight away, which, on too many occasions, does
not
happen.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011781000412" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0002.htm#14011781000412"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T13:39:27"></hs_TimeCode>As
part of that overall strategy to stop people coming here illegally and
to make it easier to kick out those who are here illegally, I hope the
Government will make much more rapid progress on the e-Borders project,
the contracts for which the previous Government made a complete
pig’s ear of. We are way behind other countries and the project
has the scope to help prevent people we do not want to come to this
country from coming here. Surely we should be striving to stop these
people coming here in the first place. The trouble is that once they
are 
<?notus-xml column=1163?>here, the Government then have a job getting rid of them. The e-Borders
project would make a massive difference if introduced properly and stop
some of these people getting here in the first place. The Government
could do a lot
better<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T13:40:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011781000413" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0002.htm#14011781000413">The
second issue on which the Government need to pull their finger out is
exit checks. We are in the ridiculous situation whereby the Government
keep absolutely no track of who leaves the country. This is slightly
relevant to my hon. Friend’s previous Bill: we are already
fighting with one hand tied behind our back, because we have absolutely
no idea which of those people who have come here have left. I think I
am right in saying that the coalition agreement said that exit checks
would be in place during the course of this Parliament, but time is
running out and I see no great sign that everything the Government said
they would do to deal with these immigration problems is going to be
sorted
out<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T13:41:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011781000414" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0002.htm#14011781000414">The
Government could do an awful lot more, irrespective of my hon.
Friend’s Bill. There can be no doubt that making sure that being
here illegally is a criminal offence and that people can be sent to
prison for it would act as a deterrent to prevent them from trying to
come here in the first place. As I said in my earlier intervention,
there is nothing to deter somebody from chancing their arm, because the
worst thing that can happen to them is that they will be sent back to
the country they came from without receiving any punishment whatsoever,
so of course lots of people are going to come
here<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T13:41:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011781000415" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0002.htm#14011781000415">Many
of my constituents tell me, “People come into this country
illegally because we are so generous and give them too much
money,” but I think that is a myth. I do not think it has
anything to with that. I think that the reason why so many people
chance their arm and come to the UK is that they realise that once they
get here, the chances of their ever being kicked out are pretty remote.
That is what drives them to come to the UK and we have to be much more
robust at making sure that anybody who is here who should not be is
kicked out. I am absolutely certain not only that the Bill will be very
popular with the public, but that it will make a real difference in
tackling a problem that my constituents are sick to their back teeth of
hearing about and on which they feel that the Government are not taking
any meaningful

immigration, facilitating entry for gain, assisting entry in breach of

is a serious issue of deep concern to the public, and rightly so.
Therefore, we need a mature and sensible debate on immigration, not an

accept that the Government could do more to cut illegal immigration,
but this Bill misses that opportunity. There is a problem with the
Government’s net migration target, because it does not target
the right things. Two thirds of the drop in numbers since 2010 is down
to the fact that more British people are leaving the UK than are
returning here. Most of the rest relates to the falling number of
foreign students who, in any case, would be here only temporarily.

this Government, fewer illegal immigrants have been stopped, more have
absconded and fewer have been deported, while the backlog of
information on cases is not being pursued. We should do more to tackle
illegal immigration, including by perhaps giving border staff a new
power to enable them to act quickly when they find abuse. Alas, the
Bill proposes none of that; it simply repeats existing provisions, and
I fear that it would make no difference on a matter of concern to the

hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr Chope) has
referred to the poll carried out by Lord Ashcroft on 28 and 30 June
that asked 2,013 people about the merits or otherwise of various Bills.
I obviously do not know why each of those individuals decided their
views about each Bill, but on this one to introduce criminal sanctions
against those in this country illegally, 86% of people said that it was
a good idea, while only 9% said that they were not bothered either way.
Therefore, only one in 20 people did not think that this was a sensible
measure.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011781000437" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0002.htm#14011781000437">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T13:50:17"></hs_TimeCode>

of Government policy in removing people.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T13:50:54"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Christchurch (Mr Chope) spoke about some of the visible
enforcement activity that he has
seen.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011782000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0002.htm#14011782000012">Before<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T13:51:04"></hs_TimeCode>
I turn to the detailed provisions of the Bill, it might be helpful to
the House if I set out a little of the context, which Members can bear
in mind when they 
<?notus-xml column=1166?>consider how they will vote on the Bill if my hon. Friend decides to
test the will of the House. Immigration is an important subject, as is
the question of those who have no right to be in Britain. Some illegal
immigrants never had the right to be here, but still entered the United
Kingdom. A more significant number of immigrants came here lawfully,
but overstayed their
welcome<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T13:51:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011782000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0002.htm#14011782000013">Why
are people concerned about this matter? It is perfectly reasonable to
be concerned, given the significant amount of migration, both legal and
illegal, that we saw during the period of the last Labour Government.
We only have statistics on legal migration because, by definition, it
is very difficult to get a good handle on the level of unlawful
migration. Net migration during that period was 2.2 million people.
Despite what Labour likes to lead people to believe, the majority of
those people came from outside the European Union, so it had full
powers to do something about
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011782000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0002.htm#14011782000014">We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T13:52:38"></hs_TimeCode>
know that people are concerned about immigration and that they want
tougher immigration controls. That was my party’s policy before
the election and it is this Government’s policy. We have had a
fair bit of success, with net migration down by nearly a third since
2010. I am afraid that it is not true, as
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T13:52:54"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Croydon North (Mr Reed) said, that that is to do with a change in
the number of British citizens. The most significant change is the fall
in immigration. That has been put clearly on the record by the
independent Office for National Statistics. Non-EU immigration to the
United Kingdom is at its lowest level since
1998<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T13:53:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011782000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0002.htm#14011782000015">To
be frank, it is true that the most recent figures showed a small
increase. That was largely because of an increase in migration from the
EU. However, that has come not from the parts of the EU that have
recently been giving the press in this country the vapours, but from
more traditional EU member states such as Spain and other countries in
southern Europe which have economies that are performing less well. It
is important to put that in
context<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T13:53:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011782000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0002.htm#14011782000016">On
illegal migration, which is the subject of the Bill, I want to put two
points to my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T13:53:56"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch that I hope he will find
reassuring. A significant number of people who want to come to the
United Kingdom illegally try to get here through our sea ports or the
channel tunnel. He will be familiar with the fact that we have
juxtaposed controls, which means that our border is effectively in
France. We check freight vehicles, passenger transport that comes
through the tunnel and transport on the ferries. Our UK Border Force
officers, whom he mentioned, do an excellent job of preventing people
from entering the UK illegally in the first place. In the year to the
end of March 2013, for example, they prevented more than 11,000 people
from entering. That is important, because if people cannot enter the
United Kingdom illegally in the first place, the provisions in his Bill
are unnecessary. We stop them at the border, which, with the juxtaposed
controls, is in France, so they never get to our
shores<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T13:55:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011782000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0002.htm#14011782000017"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Chope" PimsId="2598" UID="14011782000129" xid="110" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0002.htm#14011782000129">Mr

Harper:</Member></B> My hon. Friend asks an unanswerable question, but
it is also worth considering the checks that our immigration
enforcement officers make. When 
<?notus-xml column=1167?>they encounter people who are working illegally, they look at when those
people entered the United Kingdom to test whether they got through our
juxtaposed controls. When we examine both sets of people—those
we stop and those we encounter in-country—the evidence is that
our controls are effective. I would not pretend that they are 100%
effective, but they are very effective in reducing the number of people
coming into the
country<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T13:56:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011782000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0002.htm#14011782000019">As
I said, most people who are in the United Kingdom illegally did not
come here illegally. They came here lawfully but for a limited period.
They are either a visa national—someone from one of the
countries where we have visa controls—who has applied for a visa
either to study or to work here and has overstayed, or a non-visa
national from whom a visa was not required, but who has been allowed to
come into the UK for only a limited period, perhaps as a visitor, and
has overstayed<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T13:56:47"></hs_TimeCode>.
In one sense, my hon. Friend was right to raise his concern, because
under the previous Government, if someone applied in-country for the
renewal of a visa and was refused—I believe that was the example
he gave—nothing happened. That was quite wrong. With our
immigration enforcement organisation, we have started to change
that.</hs_Para>

is worth mentioning in passing one change that I believe was generally
welcomed in the House, including by the Chairman of the Home Affairs
Committee, the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T13:57:26"></hs_TimeCode>
right hon. Member for Leicester East (Keith Vaz), who has already been
mentioned in this debate despite his not being here. Many people
criticised the UK Border Agency, and when the Home Secretary split it
up last year, one benefit was that our immigration enforcement
operation—the part of the business that enforces the law and
deals with illegal immigrants—was given a clear and separate
identity. It still works closely with its colleagues in the rest of the
Home Office, but we are creating much more of a visible law enforcement
culture, which I think is what
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T13:57:58"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Christchurch is looking for. He said that he had seen
some immigration enforcement vans with their livery, which is a
deliberate strategy to make people aware that we have legal powers and
are taking action. In a moment, I will set out for him some statistics
showing that we are stepping up that activity so that people know that
we are being
effective<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T13:58:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011782000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0002.htm#14011782000021">If
we are to deal with overstayers, it is no good just having more
effective controls at the border, because they were legal when they
arrived in the UK. Clause 1 of my hon. Friend’s Bill refers not
just to people who enter the UK without authority but to people who are
present here, so it covers overstayers. He referred to overstayers
being attracted to the UK because of their chances of being removed,
but I will set out in a moment why I do not believe that was a correct
conclusion. In the Immigration Bill, which is currently before
Parliament and waiting for business managers to agree the timing of
Report—that is well above my pay grade as a humble Minister of
State, as he will know—there are a number of provisions to deal
effectively with overstayers. For example, we will make it impossible
for someone who is in the country unlawfully to rent property. They
will not be able to get a driving licence, and if they have one we will
be able to revoke it. They will not have access to a bank account, and
we are toughening the law governing whether or not they will be able to
work lawfully.</hs_Para>

hon. Members have mentioned this—we are putting into primary
legislation clear rules about the impact of article 8 of the European
convention on human rights on our ability to remove foreign nationals,
particularly if they are offenders. Judges have told us that despite
having included such measures in secondary legislation, we have not
given a clear enough steer to the judiciary. They have asked us to put
that into primary legislation, and if my hon. Friend the Member for
Christchurch and other hon. Members have taken the trouble to look at
the Immigration Bill—I am sure they have—they will know
that it contains clear statements about what the public interest
requires, particularly regarding those guilty of criminal offences.
Except in the most exceptional circumstances, we would expect someone
guilty of an offence to be removed from the United Kingdom, and the
Immigration Bill will contribute well to that.</hs_Para>

Friend might also have spotted last October that we created the
National Crime Agency, so as to be more effective in dealing with
serious and organised crime. One part of that agency is the border
policing command, part of which deals with the issues he raised about
organised crime groups—based both inside and outside the United
Kingdom—who are involved in people trafficking. Such trafficking
could be either completely against someone’s will or when people
effectively con others into coming to the United Kingdom by suggesting
that all will be well, and perhaps charging them a fee. When people get
to the UK, they then discover that things are not quite as they were
led to believe, and sometimes they are almost in some kind of slavery
or bonded arrangement, and are indebted to those organised crime
groups. Hopefully, my hon. Friend will welcome the measures we have
introduced.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Shipley (Philip Davies), and my hon. Friend the
Member for Christchurch when he introduced the Bill, spoke about exit
checks. My hon. Friend the Member for Shipley said that we currently
have no idea about who leaves the country, but that is not correct.
Around 80% of those going into and out of the United Kingdom do so by
air, around 10% by rail, and 10% by sea. For the vast majority of those
travelling by air we have what is called advance passenger information,
not only for those coming into the United Kingdom, but also for those
leaving it. We use those data to protect ourselves from people coming
in and to detect people who have perhaps had no right to be here and
are leaving. We have that ability, but it needs to be
improved.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Shipley will know—I think he drew
attention to this—that implementing exit checks was one of the
commitments in the coalition agreement, and we are in the process of
improving the coverage and the amount of data we collect. He will also
know that the Immigration Bill contains provisions about outbound
journeys, so that where we do not collect advance passenger
information, the Home Secretary has the power—if we are not able
to do it on a voluntary basis—to direct the carriers to work
with the Home Office and perhaps collect some of that information. Such
information is already collected for other reasons such as security and
booking information, and so that we have more effective information
about those coming to and from the United Kingdom. I do not pretend to
my hon. Friend that the current position is perfect—it is 
<?notus-xml column=1169?>not, and there is more work to do—but it is not as bleak as he
set out. We have also had meetings with those in the rail and maritime

travel.</hs_Para>

that all three hon. Friends take a close interest in such matters, and
they will have spotted that in December I laid before Parliament
amendments to regulations covering the European economic area. We have
taken steps to restrict access to benefits for EEA migrants—that

exercising their treaty rights—for example, not working, not
looking for work, not studying, not self-sufficient, but rough
sleeping, begging or taking part in criminality. In those cases, we
have given ourselves the legal power—the Immigration Bill is
about putting provisions in statute to deal with offences—to
remove those individuals from the UK and, importantly and for the first
time, to prevent them from returning for at least a year, unless they
can demonstrate that they will immediately be exercising their treaty
rights. That is a significant new power that EU Schengen countries
cannot put into effect because they do not have internal border
controls. We can put it into effect because we do have those controls.
I hope that gives my hon. Friend some confidence that we can deal with
those abusing the free movement rules.</hs_Para>

on serious criminality. I think
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T14:06:19"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friends
the Members for Christchurch, for Shipley and for Bury North all talked
about people committing not just offences to do with their immigration
status, but more serious offences. In case they are not aware, I draw
to their attention the joint working that the immigration enforcement
directorate is doing with police forces, starting with the Metropolitan
police, as part of a project called Nexus. It is not surprising, given
that one third of London’s population are foreign nationals,
that one third of criminals in London are also foreign
nationals—they are not more likely to be criminals, but they are
not less likely either.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14011782000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0002.htm#14011782000029">We have
opened up a new set of powers, and we are helping the police to use
their powers more effectively. It is sometimes difficult to get the
required level of evidence to prosecute a person even for serious
criminality—for example, if they are involved in gang-related
activity, it can be difficult, because of intimidation, to persuade
witnesses to come forward—but if that person is a foreign
national, it is sometimes possible to use our immigration powers to
remove them from the UK and prevent them from returning.
Since<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T14:09:53"></hs_TimeCode> we started
Nexus a year ago, we have removed more than 1,000 high-harm criminals
and are now rolling it out to other parts of the UK with significant
foreign national populations. We are working with West Midlands and
Great Manchester 
<?notus-xml column=1170?>police and—this will be of interest to you, Madam Deputy

effective with criminality perpetrated by foreign nationals, which is
welcome. I hope

public are hugely in favour of these provisions—quite rightly; I
would expect them to be—but, as I think my hon. Friend the
Member for Shipley said, the general public are also right if they
think that they already exist in law, because they do exist. It may be
helpful, in trying to persuade my hon. Friend the Member for
Christchurch not to pursue his Bill, briefly to set out the existing
powers.</hs_Para>

section 24(1)(b) makes it an offence to “knowingly overstay or
breach” the conditions of leave. The maximum penalty for both
those offences on summary conviction is a fine of £5,000 and/or
six months’ imprisonment, which is the same as proposed in the
Bill—a spooky coincidence. Under section 24A of the Immigration
Act 1971, it is an offence to obtain or seek to obtain leave to enter
or remain in the United Kingdom by deception, or to secure or seek to
secure the avoidance, postponement or revocation of enforcement action
by deception—and the maximum penalty for that offence is
£5,000 and/or six months’ imprisonment on summary
conviction. On indictment, the penalty is two years’
imprisonment or an unlimited fine or both. I hope that Members can see
that the offences proposed in the Bill are already on the statute
book.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011782000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0002.htm#14011782000034"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Chope" PimsId="2598" UID="14011782000131" xid="110" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0002.htm#14011782000131">Mr
Chope:</Member></B> I asked the Minister a question about the incidence
of offences. Can he tell us how many people have been prosecuted and
convicted in respect of each of the offences to which he has referred?
In replying to the parliamentary question I asked him, he said that the
information could not be obtained because it would be too
expensive.</hs_Para>

Harper:</Member></B> My hon. Friend anticipates what I was about to
say. He refers to a question he asked me a few Home Office Question
Times ago. He basically asked me whether there was an offence in
relation to this issue and why we did not prosecute people who are in
this country unlawfully. I replied that that was against the law, but
that our strategy was to secure such people’s removal from the
United Kingdom. I think I made the 
<?notus-xml column=1171?>point during that session of Home Office questions that it was not
sensible, on the grounds of cost of the process, to prosecute everybody
who is here unlawfully. My hon. Friend will know—he has
expressed opinions about this before—that legal aid being what
it is, the taxpayer would, even with our reforms, be likely to have to
pay both prosecution and defence costs. Putting such offenders in
prison would also be at taxpayers’ expense, and that would be
necessary before we could remove them from the
UK.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011782000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0002.htm#14011782000036"><B><Member ContinuationText="Philip Davies" PimsId="4767" UID="14011782000133" xid="887" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0002.htm#14011782000133">Philip
Davies:</Member></B> The Minister talks about the cost of throwing
these people into prison, but he was also bandying around the fact that
£5,000 fines could be imposed, which I would have thought
amounted to getting money into the Exchequer. If he does not want to
send these people to prison because of the cost, will he tell us how
many £5,000 fines have been levied on these people since he has
been the Minister and since these marvellous laws that he has talked
about have been in
place?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011782000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0002.htm#14011782000037"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Harper" PimsId="4788" UID="14011782000134" xid="841" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0002.htm#14011782000134">Mr
Harper:</Member></B> My hon. Friend will know, because he follows
criminal justice matters intently, how much it costs to keep someone in
prison. He knows that it costs very much more, even for six months,
than £5,000. We are talking about costing the taxpayer
significant amounts of money. I shall come on in a few moments to the
number of people who are removed from the country; I would certainly
not want to fund the cost of keeping them all in prison.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14011782000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0002.htm#14011782000038">The current
strategy is that we try to remove people who are in the United Kingdom
illegally. Every year of this Government more illegal migrants have
departed from the UK than in any year before 2010, and that trend was
continuing in 2013.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T14:14:52"></hs_TimeCode> remove two
groups of people from the UK. Our preference is that people who are
here unlawfully leave of their own accord. There is a clear reason for
that: if someone leaves of their own accord, it does not put a huge
financial burden on the taxpayer. If we have to go through the process
of arresting and detaining someone, and going through an enforced
removal, sometimes including escorts, the cost of removal can be
upwards of £15,000 per person. I would rather not burden the
taxpayer with that. In 2012-13, 44,000 people were removed from the
country. It is worth repeating that figure of 44,000, because the
polling seems to show that people think that nobody is removed from the
UK, whereas the actual figure is significant. The number of people
removed voluntarily because they found that it is not easy to be in the
UK illegally increased by 30% between 2009-10 and 2012-13. That is the
right approach to take. Part of the reason for the measures in the
Immigration Bill is to make it more difficult to be in the UK
unlawfully, so that more people will choose not to come here unlawfully
in the first place and so that those already here will find leaving the
UK a more attractive proposition than staying here
unlawfully<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T14:16:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Davies:</Member></B> Has the Minister not considered the fact that
being much tougher on illegal immigrants might deter others from coming
here? He seems to be suggesting that the worst thing that will happen
to someone who comes to this country illegally is that the Minister,
like Sergeant Wilson in “Dad’s Army”, is going to
say, “Would you mind awfully leaving?” How is 
<?notus-xml column=1172?>there any deterrent to stop anybody coming here in the first place
illegally if that is the worst that is ever going to happen to
them<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T14:16:48"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T14:16:44"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para>

Harper:</Member></B> Not only do 40,000 people a year leave, but in
addition to those who leave voluntarily we enforce the removal of about
15,000 others, and that demonstrates that we are very effective. Part
of the reason for the measures in the Immigration Bill is to make
coming here illegally less attractive. We are also seeking to make it
clear that people who come here unlawfully will find it difficult to be
able to work; they will not have access to free treatment on the
national health service; and they will not be able to have a bank
account or a driving licence. In other words, it will be very difficult
for them to be here. So it will be both less attractive to come here
unlawfully and more attractive for those already here to leave, and the
evidence shows that we are making progress on that.</hs_Para>

Bill contains another set of penalty provisions. The first set of
penalties are the imprisonment and the fine, which of course are
already in legislation. The Bill also proposes provisions on
deportation and makes reference to the “public interest”.
That doubtless relates to the points that
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T14:18:22"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Christchurch made about the convention and the public
interest test. Immigration legislation already provides for removal
powers without the need to pursue a prosecution, so we have not only
administration removal powers but deportation powers in criminal cases.
Under schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971, immigration officers have
the power to remove an illegal entrant. An illegal entrant is for these
purposes defined as a person unlawfully entering or seeking to enter
the United Kingdom in breach of a deportation order or of the
immigration laws, or entering or seeking to enter by means which
include deception. Unlike with the criminal sanction, there is no
requirement for the migrant knowingly to be an illegal entrant. That is
important, because it removes a defence which there would be in a
criminal case in relation to the person having to know that they were
breaching the law.
Section<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T14:18:16"></hs_TimeCode> 10 of
the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 gives immigration officers a power
to remove a person who remains beyond the time limited by the
leave—in other words, an overstayer. Once again, for the purpose
of removal there is no requirement for the overstaying to have been
knowingly
committed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011782000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0002.htm#14011782000042"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T14:19:36"></hs_TimeCode>Part<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T14:19:33"></hs_TimeCode>
I of the 1971 Act sets out the Secretary of State’s power to
deport an individual where it is deemed to be conducive to the public
good or where there is a court recommendation for deportation, and the
UK Borders Act 2007 further sets out that, subject to the exemptions
listed, where a foreign national is sentenced to at least 12
months’ imprisonment the Secretary of State must make a
deportation order.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14011782000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0002.htm#14011782000043">That<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T14:20:04"></hs_TimeCode>
is the point, welcome though it is, that has fallen foul of the
provisions of the European convention on human rights. I agree with
what my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T14:20:06"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Friend the Member for Shipley said when he expressed frustration about
that, but that is why I hope that he welcomes the provisions in the
Immigration Bill, which I set out. If he has not looked at them
already, I can tell him that we have set out very clearly in them the
public interest test. In other words, judges can weigh up the private
interests of the people concerned against the public interest test that
Parliament will set out, if it passes that Bill. If 
<?notus-xml column=1173?>someone is a foreign national offender and they have committed a crime,
the normal position is that they will be removed from the United
Kingdom.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14011782000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0002.htm#14011782000044">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T14:20:47"></hs_TimeCode>
think that my hon. Friend will also welcome the fact that the test
makes it clear that if someone is here unlawfully or in a precarious
immigration position—in other words, they are not here for very
long—the court should put very little or no weight on any
private or family interests built up during that period. Someone cannot
come here unlawfully, create a family relationship and then expect that
relationship to count, and to be a way of their avoiding being removed
from the United Kingdom.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T14:21:21"></hs_TimeCode>That is very
welcome, because I think that most Members, and most members of the
public, will have the same view that I do: if someone has committed a
serious offence, it is not right that they are able to stay in the
United Kingdom because they have created some sort of family
relationship while they should not have been here. I think that
provision will be very welcome, and I hope that it will receive my hon.
Friend’s
support<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T14:21:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011782000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0002.htm#14011782000045">It
is also worth saying that the removal powers that I have set out do not
carry an in-country right of appeal before removal can take place. In
the Immigration Bill, we propose extending the use of non-suspensive
appeals so that we can remove more criminals whose article 3 rights are
not engaged—in other words, those who would not suffer torture
or worse in the country we are removing them to—before they are
able to appeal. They will still have an appeal right, but it must be
exercised out of country.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T14:22:13"></hs_TimeCode>My hunch is that
appeals will not then take place, because most of those appeals are
filed by people to try to delay their removal.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch and other hon. Friends who
support the measure are usually assiduous—this is a position
that I welcome—and particularly on Fridays in persuading the
House, whether by dint of argument or through their use of time, that
where legislation is not necessary, it should not be passed by the
House. I frequently marvel at their creativity. Sadly, as a Minister,
it is an activity in which I am no  
<?notus-xml column=1174?>longer able to partake. They give the House many reasons why many Bills
which other Members may support should not be put on the statute

provisions are already on the statute book and are well supported by
members of the public, as one would expect, given that they are
sensible measures. Knowing my hon. Friends’ general sense that
we should not burden the statute book with unnecessary legislation, I
hope that they will acknowledge that the offences are already on the
statute book, and will think it not worth troubling Parliament to pass
legislation that does not give us any more tools to deal with those who
abuse the law.</hs_Para>

the moment, turbines are proposed in excess of 200 metres—higher
than 600 feet—which is more than the height of Beachy Head. It
means that they will be seen from tens of miles away, in the same way
that one can see the cliffs of Dover from Calais. The turbines will be

thrust of this Bill would run counter to our policy of supporting a
range of different renewable technologies to increase the part that
renewable energy plays in our energy mix. It would also, therefore, run
counter to our policy that follows from that, which is that we should
offer to offshore wind projects the same type, if not the same price,
of strike prices that are on offer to other technologies. My hon.
Friend directly referred to the draft heads of terms, the commercial
agreements that we have reached with EDF Energy in respect of Hinkley.
Of course the final electricity market reform delivery plan that we
published in December confirmed a range of strike prices for all the
different technologies, including onshore wind, offshore wind, which my

Neill</B> (Bromley and Chislehurst) (Con):</Member> I am grateful for
the opportunity to introduce this debate on the behaviour of Her
Majesty’s Revenue and Customs in relation to company
liquidations. HMRC has cynically abused the system, which is a disgrace
to any public Department. HMRC’s behaviour also indicates
serious flaws in policy, which I hope Ministers will
address<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T14:33:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011782000086" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0002.htm#14011782000086">I
am conscious of the fact that HMRC is operationally independent of
Ministers, so my fire is not directed at my
hon<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T14:34:32"></hs_TimeCode>. Friend the
Exchequer
Secretary<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T14:34:32"></hs_TimeCode>; my
fire is directed at HMRC officials. There are concerns about individual
injustice and about the operation of policy and governance within HMRC,
which I submit are found to be woefully lacking on these matters. The
concerns stem from an understandable change of policy through which
HMRC has, over a number of years, used civil proceedings to pursue
allegations of evasion of duty against individuals and corporate
bodies. The proceedings frequently involve allegations of fraud that
are thought to be more advantageous to pursue through the civil courts,
where of course the burden of proof is lower—the balance of
probabilities—than for proceedings in the criminal courts, where
the Revenue would have to prove the matter to the criminal standard.
Dealt with proportionately and properly, I can see that that is a
legitimate tool in the box for protecting public revenue. The
difficulty is that if it is not used proportionately and properly we do
not get the real offenders. That was precisely what happened in the
case of a company run by constituents of mine, of
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T14:34:57"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

Duncan Smith<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T14:34:52"></hs_TimeCode>). I

I am conscious that there are still some matters of litigation, but I

the history.</hs_Para>

case concerns a company called Abbey Forwarding Ltd, a reputable and
established bonded warehouse operation that operated in east London
from 1971 until 2009. It employed 23 people. The directors were
constituents of mine and my right hon. and hon. Friends. In February
2009, Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs raised assessments
against the company for a sum of just short of £6 million,
alleging that excise duty had been evaded on the importation of
alcohol. They went to an ex parte hearing and successfully applied to
have the company placed in provisional liquidation on the basis that
there had been participation in what was alleged to be a diversion
fraud.</hs_Para>

court appointed Louise Brittain, a senior partner at Deloitte, as the
liquidator. She apparently had a great deal of experience in the field,
which might be surprising in the light of what comes later, and had
been appointed in a number of other liquidations in which the Revenue
had been involved. Of course, the Revenue says, “It
wasn’t us but the court,” but we know that that is a
play  
<?notus-xml column=1178?>on words. The appointment was made and she immediately brought
proceedings against the directors for breach of fiduciary duty,
alleging fraud.</hs_Para>

that had been done the business was shut down with no forewarning, the
staff were sacked and the business was effectively run down. The Abbey
directors were not present at the ex parte hearing and as they had been
dismissed as employees of the company they had no recourse to appeal
against the allegations or the assessments, which they have contested
from the very beginning. The liquidator, with the connivance of the
Revenue, I would say, deliberately sought to shut them out from
pursuing any avenue of appeal against those assessments.</hs_Para>

seems to me that the liquidator showed a remarkable lack of interest in
pursuing the interests of the company or the creditors, and to that end
she embarked on a fire sale of the company’s remaining assets to
the extent that vehicles worth £38,000 were sold for
£2,000 and alcohol stock worth £30,000 for £1,000.
There was intimidating behaviour towards the directors and their
families as friends and acquaintances were rung up, including on
ex-directory phone numbers, and asked whether they were owed
money.</hs_Para>

to use such a device to deal with fraudsters, but my constituents were

said—one might have hoped that this would have sunken in with
the Revenue, but it clearly did not—that the liquidator’s

she seek to correct the misleading information, despite signing a
statement—it had a certification of truth on it—that
included the inaccurate figure. She was thoroughly criticised by the
judge, and rightly so. She consequently left Deloitte and no longer
practises independently without  
<?notus-xml column=1179?>supervision. Frankly, she should never be appointed as a liquidator

rather than recognising that harm had been done and seeking to rectify

provided by HMRC officers. HMRC officers and their representatives
attended every single court hearing, and they were in regular

those responsible in HMRC. This is not a case of there being a

can, however, discuss the use of provisional liquidations, which my
hon. Friend has highlighted, and I hope it will be helpful if I do so.
Liquidation is a court-driven process that takes time. It can take
several weeks after the presentation of a winding-up petition for a
liquidator finally to be appointed. Where the company is being
controlled by fraudulent individuals, that delay can provide a perfect
opportunity for them to destroy the evidence of their fraud and move
assets out of the company. In such cases, any creditor, including Her
Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, may petition the court for
provisional liquidation. This allows the winding-up petition to be
presented without any notice to the company. If the court is persuaded
of both the company’s insolvency and the potential for fraud, it
will appoint a liquidator to take immediate control of the company, its
assets and its records. This protects creditors’ interests. The
company directors will have a chance shortly afterwards to argue that
the company is not insolvent and so should not be wound up. If they
succeed, the provisional liquidator is
removed<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T14:51:58"></hs_TimeCode>. Where
there is clear evidence that a company is perpetrating significant tax
or duty fraud, HMRC will apply to the court for an order that the
company be placed into provisional liquidation, to stop the fraud and
recover
assets.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011782000109" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0002.htm#14011782000109">Provisional<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T14:52:12"></hs_TimeCode>
liquidation orders can be made only by the court and HMRC applies to
the court only in the most serious of cases, such as alcohol diversion
fraud, whereby alcohol is purported to be exported lawfully without
payment of duty or VAT to another European Union country but is then
diverted unlawfully for consumption in the UK without payment of duty
or VAT. The cost to the Exchequer of this type of fraud is 
<?notus-xml column=1182?>estimated to be more than £1 billion. Provisional liquidation
action stops the fraud continuing, because trade ceases, and allows
assets to be recovered. It has also been used in
cases of VAT missing trader fraud and ongoing pay-as-you-earn and
national insurance fraud in the construction
industry<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-17T14:53:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011782000110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/debtext/140117-0002.htm#14011782000110">Provisional
liquidation is an exceptional action and it is worth highlighting one
or two statistics. In 2009, five provisional liquidations were
instituted by HMRC. In 2010, there were just two cases and in 2011
there were four, while 2012 and 2013 had just one case each. In total
since 2009, there have been only 13 applications to put companies into
provisional liquidation, although in some of the cases, associated
companies were liquidated simultaneously. In not one of those cases has
any company successfully argued before the court that the provisional
liquidation order should not have been made. Although my hon. Friend
has raised concerns in this regard, I could, if I were so inclined,
quote judges stating that HMRC’s behaviour in respect of
bringing a provisional liquidation was entirely reasonable and

Timpson:</Member></B> It is extremely important that organisations in
the children's sector understand their safeguarding responsibilities.
'Safeguarding Children and Safer Recruitment in Education' provides
information for schools and colleges on their safeguarding
responsibilities. Last year we consulted on revising this guidance.
Updated guidance will be published soon, reflecting the changes
introduced by the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012. The guidance will
set out more clearly the statutory duties on schools and colleges to
make referrals to the Disclosure and Barring Service. The Early Years
Foundation Stage Framework sets put the statutory responsibilities of
early years providers. Registered early years providers are required to
comply with the Safeguarding and Vulnerable Groups Act 2006, which was
revised by the Protection of Freedoms Act, and are required to refer
appropriate cases to the Disclosure and Barring
Service.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="14011786000043" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140117/text/140117w0001.htm#14011786000043">Food
