Northern Ireland Minister in the last Government, and most recently as
a distinguished member of the Intelligence and Security Committee. I am

never heard an ill word spoken of him. Labour to his core, he was, yet,
the least tribal of colleagues. Whether battling against poverty,
campaigning successfully for the victims of mesothelioma, working for
the rehabilitation of prisoners or striving for peace in Northern
Ireland, Paul was the same: principled, eloquent and tireless, but
unfailingly courteous, measured and respectful. He always played the

outstanding public servant who came into politics for all the right
reasons, Paul’s passing is a loss on so many levels. The House
has lost a valued colleague, his constituency a faithful

grandfather.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010841000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/debtext/140108-0001.htm#14010841000030">Prayers

a further 200,000 houses were affected. Whenever there is flooding, it

the issue of pensions, it is important to recognise that we are able to
make a commitment to the triple lock, which has been important in this
Parliament, only because we are committed to raising the pension age to
66, then 67 and so on. That means that the pension increase is
affordable. We made a very clear pledge about pensioner benefits for
this Parliament, and I am proud of the fact that we are fulfilling it.
We will set out our plans in the next manifesto. I caution people about
the belief that somehow not paying, for instance, the winter fuel
allowance or the other benefits to those, for instance, paying tax at
40p, saves money—you save a very small amount of money. Yes of

May, the First and Deputy First Ministers announced a working group
consisting of representatives from each of the five parties in the
Executive to look at three of the most divisive issues for Northern
Ireland: flags, parading and the legacy of the past. The initiative
formed a key element of wider proposals to tackle sectarianism set out
in the Executive’s strategy document, “Together: Building
a United
Community”.<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T12:40:00"></hs_TimeCode>
In July, former US diplomat Richard Haass agreed to chair the group. He
served as the US special envoy to Northern Ireland from 2001 to 2003.
Along with his deputy, Professor Meghan O’Sullivan, Dr Haass
began work in September with the aim of reaching agreement by the end
of the
year.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010841000198" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/debtext/140108-0001.htm#14010841000198">From<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T12:39:43"></hs_TimeCode>
the outset, the UK Government, along with the Irish Government and the
US Administration, have strongly supported the Haass process. We
welcomed the fact that it was the parties within Northern Ireland that
had taken the initiative in seeking progress on these complex and
difficult issues as part of the work that the Government had strongly
pressed them to take forward on building a shared society and
addressing sectarian
division.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010841000199" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/debtext/140108-0001.htm#14010841000199">All<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T12:40:09"></hs_TimeCode>
three of the issues under consideration in the Haass group have the
capacity sharply to divide opinion in Northern Ireland. Repeated
attempts to deal with the past have produced little consensus up to
now, while disputes over parading and flags have frequently led to
serious public disorder. Some form of accommodation on those issues
that commands cross-party support could therefore have significant
benefits for political stability, public order and economic prosperity
in Northern
Ireland.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010841000200" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/debtext/140108-0001.htm#14010841000200">Although
the UK Government were never formally a participant in the Haass
process, we have been fully engaged with it from the start. I had a
significant number of meetings with Dr Haass and my officials remained
in frequent contact with his team. During the latter stages of the
talks, I spoke regularly with Dr Haass, as I did with the
leaders of Northern Ireland’s political parties and the Irish
Foreign Minister, Eamon Gilmore. The Prime Minister also maintained a
close interest in the process. We worked to encourage an agreement,
even where that meant the parties making difficult decisions to try to
move things

days before Christmas and between Christmas and the new year, when a
number of drafts were circulated, the final one being presented to the
parties shortly after midnight on the morning of 
<?notus-xml column=304?>31 December. It proposed a new set of arrangements for
regulating parades and protests, with responsibility vested for the
first time in devolved hands. On flags  and emblems there was
no immediate resolution, but the document advocated the establishment
of a new commission to look at wider issues of identity, culture and
tradition in Northern Ireland. On the past, Dr Haass
proposed two new bodies: an historical investigations unit, in place of
the Police Service of Northern Ireland’s Historical Enquiries

was of course disappointing that it did not prove possible to reach a

resolve their outstanding differences. For our part, the Government are
continuing our dialogue with the parties and with the Irish Government
to see how best we can help facilitate that. I firmly believe that

pay tribute to Richard Haass and Meghan O’Sullivan for their
professionalism and commitment in striving for a positive way forward
on some of the most challenging issues facing Northern Ireland. Flags,

would be wrong not to acknowledge that the failure of the Haass talks
to reach a final agreement was both disappointing and potentially
damaging to public confidence in Northern Ireland’s politicians
and the political process. However, it is important that we retain a
sense of perspective and that all parties in Northern Ireland refrain
from name-calling or engaging in a blame game. Significant advances
were made that can form the basis of future progress, as the Secretary
of State said. That is particularly the case in relation to dealing

that context, I have a number of questions for the Secretary of State.
What dialogue is taking place between her and the First Minister and
Deputy First Minister on the potential legislation that will be
required to implement any agreement? What discussions has she had with
her counterparts in the Irish Government about the financial
implications of a new infrastructure to deal with the past? Can she
explain why, at this sensitive time, she has weakened the capacity of
the newly appointed Parades Commission by reducing the number of
commissioners and the number of hours that each commissioner will be
expected to work? While I acknowledge her contribution during the
course of the Haass talks, does she understand that at this time of
uncertainty the widespread perception of disengagement by the UK
Government is causing concern across a wide spectrum of opinion in
Northern Ireland, and that 
<?notus-xml column=306?>this needs to change? Finally, does she acknowledge the negative impact
that some of the welfare reforms mentioned in her speech, particularly
the pernicious bedroom tax, would have on people in Northern
Ireland<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T12:47:59"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010841000216" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/debtext/140108-0001.htm#14010841000216">Northern
Ireland has made tremendous progress over the past 15 years. This has
been possible only because of the determination of people to build a
better future for themselves and their families—but it is also
thanks to the vision and courage of Northern Ireland’s political

still. That is why we hope that the First Minister and Deputy First
Minister will convene an all-party working group as soon as possible

difficult to impose a solution from above. I agree with the calls on
both Governments to continue to engage, encourage and facilitate.
Ultimately, the best way to resolve these issues is through cross-party
agreement within Northern Ireland. It was important to give this House
the chance to debate the situation at the earliest opportunity so that
we could send a strong message of support to Northern Ireland’s
political leadership in their endeavours to reach an agreement on these

identity and flags is around 18 months. I have always thought that
there might be scope for the development of new shared emblems, and I
hope that that will be considered seriously by the new commission, if
it is set up. I genuinely think that there are merits in trying to have
a broader conversation with civic society about moving forward on the

<?notus-xml column=315?>to Alex Attwood and Joe Byrne, who formed a sterling team at the talks

survivors, it is important that an implementation plan is put in
process. Will the Secretary of State and the Minister of State take an
active interest in ensuring that immediate discussions take place with
the five parties to ensure that legislation, implementation and a
resolution are found for those such as two people I talked to last
week: one whose father was killed as a result of the activities of the
military reaction force; and a widow whose husband was a policeman in
Northern Ireland? Those people came from different perspectives, but
they were suffering none the less due to their tragic and sudden
loss.</hs_Para>

Lagan Valley (Mr Donaldson). Despite the fact that an agreement has not
yet been reached, a remarkable amount of consensus has developed
between the parties. We must build on that, and ensure that this is not
a wasted opportunity and that the parties can get together again to
resolve the remaining issues that divide them. On an implementation
plan, as I have said already at the Dispatch Box, if agreement is

have not worked out, and that no one in particular is being blamed, as
these issues are difficult and go back over a long period. Indeed,
there is a good deal of satisfaction that this much progress has been
made. It also appears that independent chairmanship worked. Given that
Dr Richard Haass is no longer available, it would be a shame to lose
the momentum and the progress that has been made, so should not the

Villiers:</Member></B> As the sovereign flag of the United Kingdom, of
course the Union flag must have special status in Northern Ireland. One
of the challenges that Dr Haass encountered was that it seemed
difficult to distinguish symbols of identity from symbols of
sovereignty when it came to an expression of Irishness. It is important
that consideration continues on those matters, and I wholeheartedly
endorse the hon. Gentleman’s assertion that, of course, the
Union flag will always have a special status as the national flag as
long as Northern Ireland remains part of the United Kingdom. The
Belfast agreement makes it clear that Northern Ireland will stay part
of the United Kingdom unless and until its people vote
otherwise.</hs_Para>

we would never find it acceptable for someone to draw equivalence
between those who sought to undermine and destroy the rule of law
through terrorism and those who sought to uphold it as members of the
security forces. However, a lot of progress has been made on the
proposals about the past—far more than most people expected. To
make that progress and build up such a degree of consensus in just four
months is encouraging. Some elements of what is in the Haass proposals
are difficult, so I understand concerns about

for compromise. The UK Government are prepared to be part of that

with you about the Prime Minister’s refusal to answer questions
from Back Benchers. Twice, he refused not only to answer my questions,
but to make any reference to them. Instead, he ranted about Unite the
union. You gave me some sound advice,  Mr Speaker. You told me
to write to the Prime Minister, which I did, on 31 October, but I am
still awaiting a response. You also suggested that I speak to the Table
Office. I have spoken extensively to the Table Office, which, after
long discussions, agrees with me, as I understand it, that there is no
mechanism in this place, when a Minister either refuses to answer a
question from a Back Bencher or makes no reference to the question, to
ensure that the question gets answered. If that is the case, is that a

for Wansbeck (Ian Lavery) regarding the release of papers on the
year-long miners’ strike, we are not talking about a day or two;
we are talking about the sentiments and points of view expressed over a
long period in the House by Ministers. It was pretty clear, according
to the papers that have been released, that many things said by
Ministers were based on something that was not correct. It therefore
gets to the heart of Parliament when we realise that
those  
<?notus-xml column=324?>statements made over a year-long period were shaping the views of all
people, including the judiciary, which learned what it wanted to know
about the nature of the strike based on ministerial statements on a
continuing basis. That is why this issue is so important

some incidents involving Governments from way back. That applies to
previous Prime Ministers as well as this one. I therefore think that it
is your duty, Mr Speaker—an adventurous Speaker—to use
your good offices on this matter. Since you assumed your office, you
have already moved into some such territories, so it is important to
check all the statements made in this House in violation of what we now
know as a result of the release of these papers. If you do that, Mr
Speaker, we will then be able to see how the course of events in that
year-long strike were shaped, resulting in the judiciary taking
action—on sequestration, on the imprisonment of people, on
blacklisting and on other events. What flowed from the mouths of those
who occupied the Treasury Bench at the time was the utterance of
statements that we now know to be untrue. That makes this a

stand today to present this ten-minute rule Bill because of something
that happened in the village of Overton in my constituency of Clwyd
South in October 2009. That was when Robert James Gaunt, a
nine-year-old boy, tragically lost his life. Robert was a schoolboy
from the village. He was mown down by a driver while crossing the road.
Young Robert was killed. The driver who so carelessly took Robert
Gaunt’s life was unlicensed and uninsured. He hit Robert, killed
him, and drove away. He not only failed to stop, but did not even
report the accident. Even worse, he attempted to cover up his crime by
re-spraying his
car.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010841000334" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/debtext/140108-0002.htm#14010841000334">Robert’s
life came abruptly and needlessly to an end—and for this, the
driver incurred a pitiful sentence of 22 months. That was the very
limit of what was possible under the law for that offence. This man hit
a child, took a young boy’s life and, after driving away to
leave that child to die, was sentenced to a grand total of 22 months
and a four-year driving ban. The man served only 10 months in jail,
which cannot be

the injustice of this case and many others like it, people from my
constituency launched a petition calling for sentences for this sort of
crime to be raised. More than 1,300 names were added online and a
further 2,000 collected on paper. The campaign continued, even though a
change of Government meant an early closure to the online petition.
Many of the people who signed the petition had probably never signed a
petition before and perhaps never signed one since, but they did so on
this occasion out of a passion for justice for Robert and for other
victims of road accidents around our
country.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010841000336" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/debtext/140108-0002.htm#14010841000336">As

sentencing guidelines mean that there must be a large and frankly
improbable series of aggravating factors for a judge to issue anywhere
near that sentence. Tougher penalties are not being used because judges
are being held back by guidelines that prevent them from handing out
longer

I have spoken about the tragic case of Robert James Gaunt, but cases
similar to Robert’s happen all over the country. Innocent people
are killed by drivers who are given risibly low sentences. Families
throughout our nation have lost loved ones through reckless, dangerous
or negligent driving, and the law is not doing enough to hold those who
take lives in this way accountable. Why should a sentence be so short
when the injury has been caused by a car rather than a weapon?
Sentences for assault are much longer, even when the act is not
premeditated. The average sentence served by drivers who kill or
seriously injure another human being while driving is currently just 11
months<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T14:01:57"></hs_TimeCode>. Since I
have been a Member of Parliament, I have seen other Members who, while
probably agreeing on precious little else politically, are at one in
urging reform on this issue. We know that there is a tremendous amount
of support for a review from Members of all parties.</hs_Para>

this House notes that the Government has failed to tackle the acute
housing shortage which is central to the cost of living crisis and over
the last three years has presided over the lowest level of new homes
built since the 1920s, with home ownership falling, rents at record
highs and rising faster than wages and a record five million people in
the queue for social housing; further notes that net housing supply
under this Government has fallen to its lowest level since records
began, and that affordable housing supply dropped in the last year by
26 per cent, homes built for social rent dropped to a 20-year low,
while there has been a 104 per cent increase in in-work
housing benefit claimants since 2009; believes that the Government
should take action to tackle the housing shortage; and calls on the
Government to boost housing supply by reforming the development
industry and introducing measures to tackle landbanking, bringing
forward plans to deliver a new generation of New Towns and Garden
Cities and giving local authorities a new right to grow to deliver the
homes their communities

fact that we face a housing crisis is common ground across the House.
Why do we face that crisis? Because people are living longer and
staying in their own homes, which is a good thing; because our
population is rising; because every relationship breakdown increases
the demand for housing; but principally because, as a society, we have
not been building enough homes. Whether we look at starts, completions
or net housing supply, the failure to build over the past three years
could not be more starkly obvious.</hs_Para>

is good to see the Secretary of State taking part in today’s
debate. By my count, he has participated in at least four major housing

housing in the past three years. I have brought some of them along.
They are headed “Building more homes”, “Welcome
rise in affordable housing”, “Plans to boost UK
housebuilding”, and “Prevention is best cure for
homelessness”. This is the question that the Secretary of State

is little evidence that the bonus has significantly changed local

Committee says there is no credible data available to show whether it
is working. Indeed, she has pointed out that the areas that have gained
most money tend to be the areas where housing need is lowest and the
areas that have lost most money tend to be those where the needs are
greatest. That is a familiar story with this Government: whether it is
local government funding or the new homes bonus, they like to take from
those who are least well-off and give to those who are most well-off.
What is more, the money that is taken from the least well-off goes to
areas where in all probability the houses would have been built anyway,

want to move on to discuss what else could be done to get the land, the

Ministers seem to argue that nothing is really wrong with the way in

State that we disagree. The planning Minister, in his latest written
answer to me, has said there are more than 523,000 units with planning
permission, of which 241,500 have not yet even been started on site.
That represents a lot of homes that could be built, yet companies are
sitting on the land, with planning permission, waiting for it to

Office of Fair Trading looked into this matter and found that strategic
land banks, including optioned land, were worth 14.3 years, which is
about enough land to build 1.4 million homes. That is why we think it
perfectly reasonable for communities that have given planning
permission to say to those who sought it, “Look, will you please
get on and build the homes you said you wanted to build? And if you
don’t, then after a time we will start levying a charge. After
all, if you had built them, we would now be getting council tax
revenue. In the most extreme cases, we will use compulsory purchase
powers to take the land off you, with the permission, and sell it to
someone else who will build the
homes.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010841000408" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/debtext/140108-0002.htm#14010841000408"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T14:25:40"></hs_TimeCode>I

that among those who support the idea of charging when permission has
been granted but no houses have been built are the International
Monetary Fund and someone who goes by the name of Boris Johnson, who,
when I last checked, was the Mayor of London. Moreover, the planning

Benn:</Member></B> Thank you very much, Madam Deputy Speaker. I have
two other points to make, one of which is about new towns and garden
cities. The Government used to be very keen on those at one point, but
they seem to have become less enthusiastic. I hope that the Secretary
of State will say something about that when he responds, because it is
hard to see how we will make progress without those things . We have to
incentivise local authorities to come forward, which is why the Lyons
commission is going to look at how we can help new towns and garden
cities to be established and why a Labour Treasury would use
guarantees—the Government are currently using guarantees for
Help to Buy—for “help to build” for these new
towns.</hs_Para>

we need communities to take responsibility for building new homes. On
that I am with
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T14:33:48"></hs_TimeCode> planning
Minister, because I believe that neighbourhood planning is the way
forward. For too long, we have had a system in which nobody has really
taken responsibility for building new homes. Thame in south Oxfordshire
provides a good example of the new community plan. If communities feel
that the new houses that they give consent to will solve the housing
problem in their own neighbourhood, they will be much more likely to
give agreement. That is why we need plots for self-build and local
allocation policies for social housing, and why we need to give local
people first call on having the chance to buy new developments in their
area. That will give communities confidence that the homes will meet
their need.</hs_Para>

progress so far has not been considerable, but the task is. I do not
know whether the Secretary of State in the end believed all his press
releases and announcements, I do not know whether he thought that
blaming councils would be enough and I do not know whether he was taken
in by what I have to describe as the bombast of this
Government’s first housing Minister, who boasted consistently of
the Government’s record. The problem is that the Secretary of
State’s record speaks all too clearly for itself. Therefore, the
country needs a new plan. The public need it because they are the ones
paying the price for failure. Homes give us security and a sense of
community: they are where we build and raise families; they are places
for children to do their homework; and they are good for our health.
However, rents are rising twice as fast as wages, house prices are
moving out of reach of families, and 5 million people are in the queue
for social housing. This country needs something different, and I urge
the House to vote for this
motion.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-08?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_08_PT_1/E12B41697CCEBC8E4A0C1D663188C8BEF78EE21C" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="8 January 2014">Wednesday

sincerity and eloquence, as did Mr Speaker, the Leader of the

Before we go on, I wish to say that I had experience of Paul as a
Minister when I 
<?notus-xml column=338?>pursued a constituency case, and I found him to be courteous, diligent
and helpful. I also had experience of him when I was the Minister, and
he pursued his constituents’ interest doggedly but always with

to offer to this House and, far more importantly, to his family has
gone so prematurely, and I will miss him.</hs_Para>

not built—perhaps in a silent, unconscious tribute to Nikita
Khrushchev—increased the number from five to 10. Not a single

resentment.

affordable, but about public housing for rent, because that provides
for the greatest need. Two fifths of the population—the figure
is higher in some parts of the country, especially London—simply
cannot afford to buy and cannot raise the money for a mortgage without
long years of struggle or winning the national lottery. Those are the
people who we need to help. We need a big build of public housing for
rent to provide for their needs, and that is also needed to bring down
the housing benefit bill, because the reason why it is now so high is

Government’s proposals, inadequate and belated as they are, will
make things worse because increasing the discounts on the sale of

people’s needs. That policy will certainly not generate enough
revenue to pay for new building. We should have a rule that every
council house sold must be replaced by a new one. If we had introduced

fact is that private sector build has not risen to 200,000 for many
years. According to Shelter, its highest ever total was 175,000. We
need a more public housing for rent, which we always had in the past.
We could provide for that by removing the cap on local authority
borrowing and channelling money into contracts to build. We could ease
the situation—perhaps as with the Bank of England’s
quantitative easing—by helping the housing associations, which
currently face huge problems with arrears, largely because of the

those in other villages may feel that there is not enough affordable

problem that we have in Leeds and in my constituency is that as soon as
these plans are proposed, the developer says, “Well,
that’s very good, but actually I want to build not 20 houses

change the nature of the villages in my constituency.

houses. If we put that in the context of there being 41,000 houses to

Garforth will all blend into one huge development.

land in the northern part of my constituency in an area called Headley
Fields, which is out towards the parish of Bramham, the village that I
reside in, although nowhere near it. That land could take the housing
allocation for the next 15 years proposed by Leeds city council.
Because it was there and could be planned from day one, proper
infrastructure, such as transport facilities, pubs, schools, and
doctors surgeries could be put in place. At the moment we face the
problem of 5,000 houses coming in through what I call death by a
thousand cuts—putting 400 houses into a village here and 400
houses into a village there. That would mean that not enough would come

local schools, that were needed.</hs_Para>

of a house without a job to go with it? How do we provide good-quality
green space? We have a massive problem with primary school allocation
that will become a massive problem with secondary school allocation. We
need to build new schools, let alone new houses. This is where the
challenge arises, and I can appreciate it because I hear about it in
many of the places that I visit. I am a Labour activist, and I
sometimes share the frustration about our record in government in
delivering more homes. However, people forget that, from 1997 to 2010

that the construction industry in this country is now in such a mess

the social housing sector, from local authorities and housing

introduced. They include, for example, encouragement for empty homes to
be brought back into use, which is a win-win situation. There is also

auctions, and I would be interested to know what progress has been

the “sustained turnaround” in the housing market. His

needed to keep up with demand according to the figures of his own
Department.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010855000136" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/debtext/140108-0002.htm#14010855000136">It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T15:41:05"></hs_TimeCode>

the Government are clearly complacent, the Labour party understands the
scale of the challenge. My right hon. Friend the Leader of the
Opposition announced in September that a Labour Government would build
at least 200,000 homes a year by 2020. That is a realistic but
ambitious agenda. We have asked Sir Michael Lyons to chair a
commission that will draw up a detailed road map towards that aim,
which is effectively to double the level of house building. There are
specific areas that the commission will consider and specific problems
that the Government are reluctant to recognise. I will refer to those
briefly. The first concerns problems with the land market, the second
is the restriction on communities’ right to grow, and the third
is the lack of any action by the Government on new garden cities and
new
towns.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010855000143" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/debtext/140108-0002.htm#14010855000143">First,
there are deep and structural problems with the land market. My hon.
Friends the Members for Great Grimsby (Austin Mitchell) and for
Sheffield South East (Mr Betts) have stressed that even in the good
times the private sector did not deliver anywhere near the number of
homes we need to keep up with demand. It is clear that developers are
sitting on land and waiting for its value to increase. The Government
seem to be in denial about land banking—although some of their
Back Benchers seem to recognise it as a problem—but the
International Monetary Fund and the Conservative Mayor of London
clearly say it is a problem. We intend to give local authorities the
power to escalate fees on developers who sit on land, and if that does
not work to use compulsory purchase orders if those developers still
refuse to get on and build the houses that this country so desperately
needs and for which communities are crying
out.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010855000144" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/debtext/140108-0002.htm#14010855000144">We
also have a problem with the dominance of big house builders. Small
house builders face major problems accessing land as well as finance,
and the market is dominated by a few big house builders. That was not
always the case; in the late 1980s, small and medium-sized house
builders delivered two-thirds of new homes, but now SME builders build
only around one third of new homes. We must find ways to make the
market more diverse and competitive—I hope we can agree on
that.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14010855000145" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/debtext/140108-0002.htm#14010855000145">Secondly,
over the past three and a half years we have had warm words—in
particular from the Deputy Prime Minister, but also earlier from the
Prime Minister—about garden cities, yet not one measure has been
taken to put in place conditions to deliver them. It was even reported
last week at the start of the new year that the Prime Minister has
forbidden Ministers from identifying any sites for potential new towns
during this Parliament. Some would say that is pouring cold water on
the proposal; others might say it is putting it into a deep freeze.
Labour, on the other hand, is committed to new towns, which must form
part of the solution to the housing crisis. The post-war Labour
Government started 11 new towns because they had
the determination and vision to act. That is exactly what we need now
and what the Government are lacking. The Lyons commission is looking at
ways to incentivise local authorities to come up with sites, and my
right hon. Friend the shadow Chancellor recently committed a Labour
Treasury

the Member for Rugby (Mark Pawsey) is a huge supporter of housing
growth, and I know from my conversations with him that he is committed
to ensuring that local communities shape their own housing. I look
forward to further debates about large-scale housing, which I know he
greatly supports. On land banking, he said that confiscating land was
not the way forward and that if Labour’s policy was implemented,
it would result in fewer houses being

this issue, as on many, Labour has a problem with credibility. It was
the party that allowed access to mortgages six, seven, eight times
individuals’ salaries. It was a totally unsustainable path that
contributed to the banking crisis that led to the deepest recession
since the 1920s. Even in the boom years, it failed to deliver the
required housing. The total build dropped to the lowest number in 100
years. It promoted eco-towns—10 in total—but not one
appeared. New Labour at its finest: all spin and absolutely no
delivery.</hs_Para>

only did Labour fail to deliver the houses promised, having nearly
bankrupted the country, it took the livelihoods of 250,000 construction
workers and destroyed thousands of businesses by its actions. It talks
about a cost-of-living crisis, but how many families did it break by
its actions? How many meals did it take off the table by its actions?
How many summer holidays were lost? How many more homeless people were
created by its actions? Yet it never apologises. It always blames
somebody else. It is the “Not me, guv!” party.

this House is concerned that the clustering of betting shops in or
close to deprived communities is being driven by increasing revenue
from fixed odds betting terminals (FOBT) rather than traditional over
the counter betting; believes that this has encouraged betting shop
operators to open more than one premises in close proximity to one
another; is aware of the growing concern in many communities about the
detrimental effect this is having on the diversity and character of UK
high streets; is alarmed that people can stake as much as £100
every 20 seconds on these machines; is further concerned
that the practice of single staffing in betting shops leaves staff
vulnerable and deters them from intervening if customers suffer heavy
losses thereby undermining efforts by the betting industry to protect
vulnerable customers; further believes that local authorities should be
able to establish a separate planning class for betting shops and that
they should be given additional licensing powers to determine the
number of FOBT machines within existing and proposed shops and to
require that the machines are modified to slow the rate of play and to
interrupt when people play for long periods; and calls on the
Government to put local people before the interests of the betting shop
operators and give local authorities the powers they need to respond to
concerns from their local communities and stop the proliferation of
FOBT machines and betting
shops<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T16:15:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="14010855000722" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/debtext/140108-0003.htm#14010855000722"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T16:15:05"></hs_TimeCode>Many
people throughout the country are concerned about the impact of betting
shops on their high streets. They are worried that the shops are
clustered in close proximity to one another, and that they are too
often close to communities with high levels of deprivation. We are not
suggesting that there is a problem in every community, which is why we
are not proposing that the Government should introduce a blanket ban.
Instead, we are calling for local councillors to be given real powers
so that they are able to respond to the concerns of their local
communities and to act responsibly in the interests of the people who
elect them. Too often, we hear of councillors being frustrated that
they are unable to support local residents. Time after time, people
turn up at local planning or licensing meetings and watch in disbelief
as councillors who are known to oppose plans are forced to allow
another betting shop to open because the legal process favours the
lawyers representing the interests of the betting shops. That cannot go
on. It causes people to lose faith in local democracy, and we will stop
it. Councillors must be allowed some discretion; they should not be
expected simply to rubber-stamp such
applications<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T16:16:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

terminals actually predated the Gambling Act, but in that Act we
limited the number of machines to four per shop. What is unprecedented
is the fact that the amount of money that can be taken from the
machines is now greater than what can be taken from 
<?notus-xml column=366?>over-the-counter betting, and that is what is driving the clustering of
betting shops on our high streets. However, the Government are refusing

about fixed odds betting terminals

and I think I have been generous. Changes to the national planning
system are not the answer to local problems. Local authorities already
have a range of powers available regarding betting shops, and a local
planning authority can consult and make an article 4 direction that
removes permitted development rights, where it considers that necessary
to protect local amenity or the well-being of an area. The London
boroughs of Southwark and of Barking and Dagenham have brought forward
article 4 directions, thus requiring a planning application for any new
betting shops. That will enable them to consider the application
against their local plan. The betting shop must also comply with its
licensing conditions, and where those are breached, the local licensing
authority has power to intervene, including removing the licence to
operate.</hs_Para>

heard, the motion before us calls for local communities to ban gaming
machines in their areas. The Government agree that responsibility for
managing high streets should rest with local areas, but the truth is
that local authorities already have powers to control gambling premises
in their areas. Local authorities have power to reject an application
for a gambling premises licence, or to grant one with additional
conditions should that be necessary. They have power to review licences
after they have been granted, and to impose licence conditions after
review. Many local authorities have already used those powers to good
effect. For example, in November 2013, the London borough of
Newham—which has been mentioned this afternoon—imposed
conditions on a betting shop because of its concerns about crime,
disorder and under-age gambling. The conditions stipulate that a
minimum of two members of staff must be on duty throughout the day.
Additionally, the betting shop must carry out an undercover, under-age
test purchase to ensure that minors are not gambling, and it must send
the results to the council and the police.</hs_Para>

Government believe it is right for the industry, in conjunction with
local authorities, to agree on the appropriate level of staffing in
betting shops, depending on the circumstances of the local area. Local
authorities already have powers to ensure a minimum level of staffing
where appropriate. The Government urge local 
<?notus-xml column=381?>authorities to fully utilise powers at their disposal to limit the
number of betting shops in line with local demand, and to apply
appropriate licensing conditions where they have cause to tackle issues
of problem gambling in local communities. Adopting the
motion would lead to a patchwork of regulation right across the country
where it is okay for gaming machines to be located in some areas but
not in others. I do not believe that that is the right way forward. The

be necessary to make machines safer. I am clear that if the betting
industry fails to deliver on its commitment to implement enhanced
player protection measures by March 2014, does not share data for
independent research, and if the balance of the evidence suggests
precautionary action on stakes and prizes or other measures are
required, the Government will not hesitate to

is a myth to suggest that that is entirely a result of FOBTs. There is
a difficulty due to problem gambling, and a small number of people
suffer from addiction—of course they need some protection. It
has always been a principle that the harder forms of gambling are
permitted in more controlled environments. To that extent, it was
something of an anomaly that the previous Government allowed B2
machines on the high street while there were restrictions on those
machines in adult gaming centres and casinos. It was ironic, too, that
the previous Government wanted to introduce category A gaming machines,
for which there were no limits on stakes or prizes, in super-casinos.
Perhaps those anomalies should have been addressed. That was why, when
the Culture, Media and Sport Committee looked at the problem, we
recommended allowing up to 20 B2 machines in casinos and some B2
machines in adult gaming centres.</hs_Para>

We should consider such measures, but before taking any action, it is

club is drinking too much and clearly has an addiction or a drinking
problem, they are often asked to leave. If they become a
problem customer, they are shown the door. However, problem
gamblers pouring money into machines are not warned that their gambling
is excessive. In fact, they are encouraged by the fact that the
machines are placed next to the bar, so that any change put across the
bar is put into the machine as quickly as possible. Additionally, a
person may be drinking at the bar, and a machine next to the bar offers
a comfortable place to park a drink while using the machine. The
companies that provide gaming machines to clubs, pubs and bookmakers
use all sorts of techniques to maximise profits from the
machines.</hs_Para>

those businesses is not collected does not necessarily mean that the

<?notus-xml column=390?>just to pass enabling legislation to make limits even higher. FOBTs
allow almost unlimited winnings, as well as huge losses. Given the

us have a bit of a history lesson. FOBTs appeared in high street
bookmakers’ shops in the early 2000s, 
<?notus-xml column=391?>and, after a code of conduct was agreed with the industry restrictions
were put in place: the game type was restricted to only roulette; a cap
was put in place on the stakes and prices; a minimum time interval
between bets was introduced; and a limit was put in place on the number
of machines per shop. That was a useful compromise, but the whole point
of reviewing legislation is to see whether there have been any
unintended consequences. One of the most obvious unintended
consequences has been mentioned by many hon. Members: as the machines
are popular and there is a demand for them, what we have been seeing in
high streets in different parts of the country is that more and more
betting shops are appearing. That may be partly due to the fact that
premises are readily available. There have been mergers of various
banks and building societies, which are in the same planning class as
betting shops. Ultimately, those shops would not open if people did not

although I have great sympathy with many of the points made by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T17:55:06"></hs_TimeCode> shadow
Minister, the hon. Member for Eltham (Clive Efford), I cannot support
the Labour motion. I will not rehearse the reasons for that, but the
motion is cynical, opportunistic and, not least, confused. The Leader
of the Opposition launched a campaign in the summer about stakes and
problem gambling. It was about the generic issue—it was not just
about use class orders and planning, which is what the hon. Member for
Eltham is telling the House today.

remedial powers that the Government take to deal with the serious and
legitimate concerns of many of my constituents. There are 22
betting shops in central Peterborough, with 81 FOBTs generating about
£3.2 million. I am disappointed, because this could
have been a genuine cross-party debate on information and research
provided by bodies such as the Methodist Church, which has not always
supported my party, and the Salvation Army. I declare an interest as a

from the Labour party’s point of view, the
debate has been rather confused. Undoubtedly, there is a problem. The
precautionary principle is not that there should
be unambiguous, completely definable evidence of a causal
link between critical problem gambling and FOBTs. It is about the risk
of problem gambling. One of my worries, which has been partly
ameliorated today, is about the precautionary principle on the maximum
stake. I was concerned that the research on the impact of those
£100- spin games on the most vulnerable people in our
constituencies should be undertaken by independent individuals.

objectives<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T18:14:34"></hs_TimeCode>. It

to rubbish the work of the Responsible Gambling Trust, which was set up

fairer gambling, why is its only focus on FOBTs? There are many other
areas of problem gambling, as the gambling prevalence survey has shown.
For instance, there are issues due to the 
<?notus-xml column=400?>price of national lottery tickets being increased from £1 to

fails to address the problem of the £100-a-spin stakes that are
still allowed on our high streets. I am happy to reject the motion not

says that, but a study that was commissioned by the Gambling Commission
in 2010. The same study indicated that problem gamblers played up to
nine different products. They do not stand at FOBTs feeding in note
after note; they look for other outlets for their addiction. As well as
using the machines, a problem gambler bets on the horses and the dogs,
and buys scratchcards. I have not heard anybody talking about how many
people are addicted to scratchcards, yet people can just walk into a

careful speech on this sensitive subject. The Government’s

incredibly complex area with a lot of contradictory evidence.</hs_Para>

Members have asserted that there has been an uncontrollable,
unsustainable boom in gambling, but a study of the facts simply does
not support that. There was an increase in the use of FOBTs after the
Gambling Act 2005 was introduced, but the number of them on the high
street has declined in the past three years. Betting shops are changing
location, but there has been no explosion in their total number. Some
Members have cited the gambling prevalence survey, which they say shows
a 50% increase in problem gambling, but that increase is
from 0.6% to 0.9% in problem gambling, according to surveys
taken between 2007 and 2010. The change in numbers in those two studies
are within the margin of error, so not necessarily
statistically significant, and other studies since 2010 have
demonstrated that instances of problem gambling are declining. That is
why we must have a sensible evidence-based approach.</hs_Para>

that the Labour party paints about gambling on the high street, the
prevalence of FOBTs, and the clustering of betting shops, was created
entirely by the 2005 Act. Was the decision of the then Labour
Government based on robust evidence and science? No. The Act perhaps
had good intentions, but it has had massive unintended consequences.
When Richard Caborn gave evidence to the Select Committee, he was asked
why the previous Government settled on having four FOBTs in betting
shops—what was the reason for that number? He
responded:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="14010855002254" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/debtext/140108-0004.htm#14010855002254">“There

was their best guess, and it has led to the clustering of FOBTs on the
high streets. Because there is demand for FOBTs and not enough premises
to play them in, bookmakers have opened new betting shops so they can
have new

was interested in the shadow Minister’s response to
my earlier intervention when I said that, on face value, the wording of
the Labour motion suggested that local authorities could
retrospectively change the number of terminals in
a shop, but only downwards. I think that refutes the idea that the
motion is localist or about giving powers to local communities in any
way. If it was, it might do what the Select Committee
recommended and give local authorities the power to say,
“Perhaps we will have more terminals in fewer shops, and fewer
shops on the high street” and have the power to make that
decision. This is not a localist motion but one in which the Labour
party is asking councils to do what it wants—close betting shops
and get rid of FOBTs altogether.</hs_Para>

interest in this subject arose in late 2011 when a constituent came to
me having lost £25,000 in a single month on a machine in a
betting shop in my constituency. It was no surprise to me that the
betting shop was in one of the most deprived parts of my constituency.
He came to me not because he thought he had a problem, but because he
thought the machines were fixed. That underlines the point. I spent
some time with Hamilton gamblers’ anonymous. Strikingly, several
younger people in that group had accepted they had a problem, had gone
for help and were trying to resolve their issues, but they had a
problem relating to these machines. The situation was very different
with the older people in that group. The Government ought to take that
seriously.</hs_Para>

Bayley</B> (York Central) (Lab):</Member> Let us start on a note of
cross-party unity: I agree with much of what the hon. Lady has just
said. I have limited time, so I will cut directly to the chase. I see
five Ministers on the Treasury Bench, all of them well educated and
intelligent people, so I ask them to think about the contradiction in
the case they are making. They tell us that the Gambling Act 2005 was a
mistake, which has intentionally or unintentionally given rise to the
current problems, although those of us present in 2005 will remember
that we did not talk about fixed odds betting terminals at any length,
but about super-casinos and other matters. Ministers tell us that that
2005 Act, introduced by a Labour Government, has created a major
problem. They blame us for bringing it in and then for doing nothing to
correct the situation over the subsequent five
years.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010855001055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/debtext/140108-0004.htm#14010855001055">I
say to those Ministers that if there is a problem—they accept
that there is one, as we heard from the speech of the Under-Secretary
of State for Culture, Media and Sport, the hon. Member for Maidstone
and The Weald (Mrs Grant)—they have a five-year window in which
to do something about it. Let me challenge the Minister: will the
Government legislate during this Parliament to correct what they have
told us today about the grave errors in the 2005 Act? I lay down the
same challenge to the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and
Local Government, the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Nick
Boles), who is going to reply. If Ministers seriously believe that the
accusations made against Labour Members are correct—that there
is a serious problem, which I believe there is, and that it needs
solving—let me say, “The ball is in your court,
chum”. Are Ministers going to bring forward legislation before
the general
election?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010855001056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/debtext/140108-0004.htm#14010855001056">Secondly,
Members of all parties have rightly pointed out that the top 10% of
constituencies with the highest use of, and with the highest profits
taken from, FOBTs are largely in deprived areas, although they are not
all in those areas. I would like to mention a group of places in the
top 10% that I would call tourist destinations. They include my
constituency of York Central, Blackpool South, Brighton Pavilion,
Bournemouth West, Cambridge, Great Yarmouth, Kensington, Norwich North,
Oxford East, Torbay and the two Westminster constituencies.</hs_Para>

believe that the proliferation of high-street gambling in these tourist
destinations is good for tourism. If someone comes to York and has a
flutter on York 
<?notus-xml column=408?>races, that is part of a day out, and if £20 is lost on a race,
so be it; it can probably be put down as part of the cost of a good
day. If someone comes to York and loses £1,000 on one of these
terminals, they will not think that they have had a good day out, and
they will not forget it. For tourist towns as well as the deprived
areas, this is a serious problem that needs to be
addressed.</hs_Para>

wishes and needs of local communities. As many of my hon. Friends have
pointed out, there are more than 33,000 FOBTs making
£1.5 billion each year for the big
bookmakers—that constitutes about half their annual
profits—and traditional bookies throughout the country are being
turned into mini-casinos where people can gamble up to £300 a
minute. Liverpool alone contains 559 terminals, which took £607
million last year. Newham in east London contains 87 betting shops with
348 terminals, and figures released recently by the Greater London

under review. In 2009, when we were in government, we said that would

current Government, however, have decided to do nothing: five years on,
there has been no review. Government Members claim that local
authorities have the powers that they need to regulate betting shops,
but we have heard time and again from councillors of all parties that
that is simply not the case. The next Labour Government will change
planning and licensing laws to give councils the right to control the
number of betting shops in their areas. If betting shops are not a

the most urgent case needs to be made for changing again the system of
use class orders. Use classes play a central role in the planning
system by defining the potential uses of buildings. They not only
protect certain uses, but also streamline the system by allowing for
some changes without the need to apply for planning permission.
However, over the course of last year the Government have decided to do
away with the protections offered by the use class system and in doing
so have stripped communities of a say in the shape of their high
streets. In May 2013 the Government introduced changes to use class
orders to allow retail use to change to financial institutions without
planning permission for a period of two years, allowing the possibility
of more betting shops on our high streets and they also now have the
audacity to say they may make this change permanent. We are arguing
that the Government should do what they say they want to do and give
powers to local communities to have a say over what is happening in
their high streets, so that if a problem is identified with an
over-proliferation of gambling and betting shops local communities are

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government (Nick Boles):</Member></B> I understand that traditionally
Opposition debates were designed to allow Her Majesty’s
Opposition to attack Government policy but since 2010, when I was
elected to this House, there has been a constitutional innovation, as I
am sure you will have noticed, Mr Speaker. The Labour party
uses these debates to attack Labour Government policy and to condemn
those like the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T18:52:13"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Bradford South (Mr Sutcliffe) who
implemented those policies and to repudiate anything inherited from the
period which many Labour Members like to think of as the Blairite
apostasy. So this debate is nothing more than an elaborate exercise in
exorcising the ghosts of new Labour’s
past<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T18:52:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010855001069" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/debtext/140108-0004.htm#14010855001069">Let
us examine those ghosts. In 2003 the Labour Government doubled the
number of gaming machines allowed in licensed premises from two to four
and increased the maximum prize from £25 to £250, but
that was not enough. In 2006 the Labour Government saw the gambling
industry as the handmaiden of the regeneration of cities like Glasgow,
Manchester and Newcastle and they were not just proposing a row of
little betting shops: they wanted super-casinos with unlimited
jackpots.</hs_Para>

Jowell)—I believe the Olympics would never have happened without
her contribution—so in researching this debate I wanted to read
her words as Secretary of State when she was promoting gambling as the
best regeneration policy for Britain’s inner cities. Imagine my
shock, Mr Speaker, when I discovered that all of her speeches have been
erased from the Labour party website, and not just her speeches, Mr
Speaker, but every speech, every policy document and every press

article 4 measures, which this Government have made it easier to use
because they no longer require the approval of the Secretary of State,
are good enough for Southwark. They are also good enough for Barking
and Dagenham. In fact, 122 local authorities have made 270 article 4
declarations to restrict permitted development rights in the past three
years. If one Labour authority in London thinks they are a good thing,
and 
<?notus-xml column=412?>if 121 other local authorities think they are a good thing, it seems
pretty clear to me that we need no more planning changes to enable
councils to do what they want to do to protect their local communities.

tackle localised problems and target specific areas where the

might be problematic, as well as licensing powers to tackle individual

Kawczynski</B> (Shrewsbury and Atcham) (Con):</Member> My debate is on
the performance of UK Trade &amp; Investment in the west midlands, and
especially Shropshire. I have spent the past year producing a report on
UKTI, on which we had a debate last year to which the Minister kindly
responded, and hundreds of small and medium-sized enterprises from
around the United Kingdom were interviewed to understand their
perception of UKTI and what assistance they were receiving from this
important Government body on exporting
overseas<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T19:25:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14010855002190" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/debtext/140108-0004.htm#14010855002190"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T19:25:56"></hs_TimeCode>Once
the report was finished, it was important for me to expand and
extrapolate the work to focus on Shropshire, particularly Shrewsbury,
to try to find out how UKTI is performing to help Shrewsbury companies
not only to export but—this is the second part of the
body’s responsibilities—to secure direct foreign inward
investment into our county. I therefore invited the head of UKTI in the
west midlands, Mr Paul Noon, to visit Shrewsbury to meet
representatives of Shropshire council and the local enterprise
partnership, including the officer responsible for business development
at Shropshire, Mr Mark Pembleton.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T19:27:07"></hs_TimeCode> said to Mr
Noon, “Can you list the top 10 inward investment opportunities
in Shropshire?” Unfortunately, he had no idea, which was of
great concern to me. I could not understand how, given all the
resources that UKTI has, it had not carried out work in the west
midlands to identify and agree on the top inward investment
opportunities in Shropshire.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T19:29:18"></hs_TimeCode> therefore

then to start to move them forward. However, I worry that such work has
not been carried out in the past and that it took me such a concerted
effort to get all the parties together. Interestingly, I have spoken to
many fellow MPs in other shire counties—I will not name them
all—who are quite surprised by the work that has been carried
out in Shropshire. They do not see similar activities in their own
counties, and they are starting to get interested in what we are doing.
If the project is successful and the newly formed LEPs, the councils

of the work we have done in Shropshire can be disseminated to other

am delighted to have secured the debate today. I ought to start with
two disclaimers. First, although  I served for 12 years on a
county council, a strategic planning authority, I have never served on
a district council and am ignorant of some of the niceties of local
planning procedure. Secondly, despite some small differences in
government with the Minister—I have rather an affection for
productive agricultural land, which he affects not to share—I
believe in principle in the reforms introduced by the Government. It is
absolutely right that we turn around the principles of planning to make
it more responsive to local people and base it on local priorities
rather than on a Whitehall-knows-best
approach.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010837000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010837000008">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T09:31:37"></hs_TimeCode>
reason for calling today’s debate, however, is simply that the
reality in many local authorities at the moment—certainly for
those in my constituency in Somerset—is the precise reverse of
that. In the absence of agreed local plans and agreed five-year supply,
far from empowering local communities, we are disfranchising them from
decisions that will have the most profound impact on their local areas.
That is what I want to impress on the Minister
today<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T09:31:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010837000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010837000009">I
could give a number of examples from my constituency, such as the
villages of Evercreech, Rode or Beckington, all in Mendip, or Huish
Episcopi, where a recent planning inspector’s decision has gone
in completely the opposite direction to that wished by the district
council, and by local people, as evidenced through the parish council.
As an illustration, however, I will use the village of Norton St
Philip, which I have raised with the Minister before in the Chamber. It
is an example of what is actually happening on the
ground<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T09:32:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010837000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010837000010">Norton
St Philip is a beautiful village: it is an historic settlement and a
conservation area; it has, arguably, one of the oldest pubs in the
country; and it was the scene of a battle during Monmouth’s
rebellion. It has everything going for it, including one of the most
spectacular views from the said pub’s car park across the
village cricket pitch to the church—a view that one might wish
to see anywhere in the
country<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T09:32:56"></hs_TimeCode>. The
village also has the fortune, or misfortune, of being only a few miles
away from Bath, with its inflated Georgian infrastructure. Those few
miles are green belt, and Norton St Philip is therefore in reasonably
high demand as a dormitory village for the cities of Bath and, to a
lesser extent,
Bristol<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T09:33:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010837000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010837000011">The
problem that Norton St Philip faces at the moment is that it is under
siege from developers, with five applications already before planners

me say a little more about Norton St Philip. Under the new Mendip plan,
it has been classified as a “primary village”, and along
with that goes a requirement for 70 new homes. That is predicated on
the newly reopened shop and post office. Without that shop and post
office, Norton St Philip would revert to being a secondary village,
with a requirement for 40 new houses. Setting that aside, what has
happened already is 73 new houses. The applications before the planning
authority provide for a further 223 houses in that small village. In
other words, were those applications to be approved, the size of the
village would be doubled, without any improvement to the
infrastructure, and, needless to say, the character of the village
would be hugely changed in the
process<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T09:35:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010837000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010837000015">I
am particularly exercised by one of the applications, although I know
that Members of Parliament should always be cautious about getting
involved with local planning decisions. Nevertheless, to build on what
is called Great Orchard, which is the site of the battle of
Philip’s Norton, the skirmish during the rebellion, seems to me
to be an extraordinary proposition. It is deep within the heart of the
conservation area of the village and would put at risk some 200 metres
of the finest dry stone wall to be seen in
Britain<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T09:36:09"></hs_TimeCode>. I
apologise to hon. Members if I am exercising my Baedeker view of my
constituency, but it is vital to understand that the village is an
important and historic settlement. I cannot see the circumstances in
which such a proposition would be approved, and of course it was
not—it was not approved in the local plan and was not part of
what was reserved for
development<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T09:36:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010837000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010837000016">People
in the village are perfectly happy to ensure that the building that is
already taking place and that which is projected in sensible places go
ahead. They are not averse to development in the village. However, they
do not want their village destroyed. That is a perfectly proper

the neighbouring council area will not approve it. There needs to be
the flexibility, especially with town centre developments. If we are to

Heath:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. Let me come
on to where I think things are going wrong. We have a free-for-all at
the moment, an avalanche of applications that are opportunistic in
nature, because the local plans have not been
agreed<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T09:38:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010837000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010837000021">The
Minister has said on a number of occasions, “Well, it is up to
local authorities to have their plans approved.” He is
right—of course it is up to them, and everyone understands that,
but he underestimates the difficulties and the extent of the changes in
the process. The early adopters of local plans had an easy time. Some
of the local plans, which the Minister can look at in his office, are
paper thin and would never get through the process now, but because
they were done right at the start, they went through. The smaller rural
district planning authorities in particular are now struggling with an
extraordinarily cumbersome and complex
process<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T09:38:07"></hs_TimeCode>.<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T09:39:16"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010837000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010837000022">Let
me deal with some of the issues that are bedevilling that process. The
key is the five-year supply, which I have mentioned. There is a lack of
definitive guidance on how it is to be calculated. There was a clear
promise from the Department for Communities and Local Government that
definitive guidance would be produced in August last year, but it has
not appeared. Two things are happening as a result. First, planning
authorities are struggling to understand exactly what is required.
Secondly, plans are being picked apart at planning inquiries by clever
QCs, who are going back to the first principles in the planning
framework and using those to override any sensible local decision
making.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010837000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010837000023">There
are tensions within the system. Historically, census figures have been
used, but it now seems as though economic aspiration is a key factor.
Economic aspiration is fine, except that if it does not come to
fruition, an area is left with the houses but not the jobs, which does
not make
sense.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010837000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010837000024">There
is also the fundamental problem that housing supply is effectively
determined by the house builders themselves and what they say they will
be bringing forward in a particular year. Let us not kid ourselves:
there are a limited number of national house builders that effectively
have an oligopoly of supply. They are coming forward with figures that
might look all right on paper, but the house builders will build only
when the margin meets their requirements, and the profit margin on
those developments is relatively high. The Government might wish to see
more houses built—I certainly do, as we desperately need them
across the country—but developers are interested in banking
development land rather than building when their marginal profit is not
at its
greatest.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010837000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010837000025">As
a result, we have perverse incentives for developers to acquire
permissions but not develop the projects. We have what are called
technical starts, where developers will put in a road and say,
“We have started that project, but we are not actually going to
build any houses yet—we will leave that for the moment.
Meanwhile, let’s get on with our next application for the next
bit of land that we see.” That can distort the entire local plan
and what emerges from it.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=80?><hs_Para UID="14010837000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010837000026">The second key
factor is the weight that the emerging local plan has in planning
inspectorate decisions, as it is developed,
consulted upon and submitted to the Department. The Minister said to me
in the House a few months ago that the plan has weight, but that is not
evidenced by the decisions taken by planning inspectors, who are not
working on the basis of ministerial aspiration but of
regulations—quite rightly, as that is the only basis they can
work on—which require them to look at different criteria. We are
therefore seeing inspectorate decisions that do not match the desires
of local communities for local
planning.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010837000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010837000027">I
have to say to the Minister that, when we are talking about large
conurbations, sometimes it really does not matter which bit of land is
developed—there is capacity for spread, so if one development
comes on it is possible to deselect another bit of land to bring
everything back into kilter—but when we are talking about small
market towns and rural areas, the topography does not allow for that.
If the wrong bit of that sort of community is developed, it does not
help to deselect what would have been the right bit for development.
Deselection does not
work.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010837000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010837000028">There
is another aspect concerning the inspectorate that I shall mention in
passing: the perverse decision, which has been evidenced more than once
now, that because a particular design of building is right in one
place, it will necessarily be right anywhere. As a result of that, we
have lost the sense of the vernacular, which is key to good planning.
We should be able to ensure that the buildings in a particular area
suit how buildings in that area have been built historically and fit
with the urban or rural community landscape. Instead, the same model of
house is relabelled in different parts of the country: in Somerset,
they would probably call it a thatched cottage, despite the fact that
it is an executive four-bed home, whereas in the north it would be
called the Ullswater model or something like that. It is nonsense. Such
decisions show whatever the visual equivalent is of having cloth
ears.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010837000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010837000029">I
have a number of modest requests for the Minister. First, I want
emerging local plans that are on the point of publication to have real
weight in the planning process—to have what is called
materiality. That is simply not the case at the moment. If he wants
that to happen, he has to make it happen by regulation—to
instruct planning inspectors that they have to give the plans real
weight and back local councils in doing the right thing. That is the
whole principle of
localism.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010837000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010837000030">Secondly,
the Minister needs to provide definitive guidance on the five-year
supply, to show exactly what is to be taken into account and how it is
to be calculated. He must not leave it to clever QCs representing house
builders to determine what is right for a particular local area. That
is not localism, but an absolute divorce from it. Until we have that
clear guidance, I do not believe the situation will
improve.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010837000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010837000031">Thirdly,
we need to give real weight to the views of parish councils. That is a
gap in the new legislation. At the moment, they are virtually
non-people, and do not have the locus they should have in planning
decisions. I recently read a speech by the Minister about the
importance of neighbourhood plans. We went down that road with the
previous Government and their village plans.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14010837000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010837000032">I have
135-odd villages in my constituency, and many of them spent months and
years of really hard work on developing their village plans, thinking
that what they 
<?notus-xml column=81?>were doing would affect future planning decisions and ensure that what
was built matched needs and locality. The reality was, of course, that
those plans were completely ignored. I am worried that neighbourhood
planning will go down exactly the same road. Indeed, people are now so
cynical that they might not engage with neighbourhood planning in the
first place, because they do not believe it will have an effect. Unless

mentioned backing local councils and parish councils as well; that is
an important part of this discussion. There is a problem, however, when
those two organisations come into conflict. On my website there is a
petition, with nearly 2,000 signatures, objecting to our current plan.

together better to create greater consensus among local
residents?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010837000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010837000034"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Heath" PimsId="911" UID="14010837000139" xid="265" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010837000139">Mr
Heath:</Member></B> That is important, and I believe there is a duty of
co-operation within the local planning process that involves that sort
of consideration. As I said, I have never sat on a district council in
my life, but I know from my experience as leader of a county council,
where we were dealing with matters such as mineral planning, that
getting consensus is a long and iterative process. I do not believe
that it is impossible for local people to achieve that consensus when
they work together with shared objectives, but it is difficult when a
plan is overridden by an inspector at appeal, or, worse still, when a
district council feels so powerless to resist planning appeals that it
rolls over in advance of them. We have seen that time and time again
with local councils.</hs_Para>

debate, the importance of which is evident from the turnout this

constituency. I will name just five communities in mine: Lindley,
Linthwaite, Upperthong, Netherthong and Golcar. They are facing the
prospect of open land being pounced on by developers because my
Labour-run Kirklees council’s local development framework is up
in the air and it is refusing to use the latest figures from the Office
for National Statistics. The nub of the matter is that when local
councillors on the planning sub-committee listen to local concerns and
are minded to refuse an application, its planning officers run
roughshod over them, so there is no local democracy and no local

have said that I want four things to be considered: the materiality of
emerging local plans, a definition of “five-year supply”,
the position of parish councils, and the vernacular, which is really
important. I urge the Minister to look at that. It may seem to be a
minor matter, but simply allowing uniformity of design throughout the
country is contrary to the organic way in which architecture has
developed in this country and is a hugely retrograde
step.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010837000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010837000046">I
want to make one more suggestion. Central Government often put huge
pressure on local councils to do things within time scales and
castigate them if they do not. Could the same discipline be applied to
the Government in terms of non-determination? It seems to me that local
authorities are desperate to get local plans certified. Why do we not
have a period following completion of the local plan
process—perhaps six weeks from the plan being lodged with the
Department—when it will be certified or will be deemed to have
been certified irrespective of the planning Minister’s
decision<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T09:54:13"></hs_TimeCode>? It is
no good the Government saying that they do not 
<?notus-xml column=83?>have the resources to deal with the issue—they do not accept that
argument from planning authorities. The suggestion is a modest but good
one, and I am sure that the Minister, being a radical Minister, will
want to adopt
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010837000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010837000047">Something
is seriously wrong not with the principle but with the operation of
planning reform. It is causing great concern throughout the country.
There is concern that communities will be distorted by opportunistic
developments that our local authorities are apparently powerless to
stop in the present circumstances. We must look closely at that. I do
not want suburban sprawl across my rural constituency, but I see a risk
of that. Of course I want houses to be built—we have a desperate
need for them— but I want the right houses in the right places
for the right reasons determined by local people. Those are exactly the
principles that the Minister has espoused in his planning reforms. What

policy makers have the difficult job of reconciling conflicting
interests, but the Government’s approach to planning policy,
particularly their Localism Act 2011, is distinctly centralist. The
national planning policy framework ties the hands of local planning
committees and removes much of their discretion in making decisions
about planning applications based on local conditions. On Teesside,
Stockton-on-Tees borough councillors, both Labour and Opposition, have
been particularly vocal about that. Stockton council is not in my

points.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010837000051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010837000051">In
November 2013, Stockton council passed a motion calling for an urgent
review of the NPPF. It resolved that the framework effectively removed
planning control from the local community and placed it in the hands of
developers. It also made the interesting and valid point that that is
coupled with massive reductions in available funding for the
remediation of brownfield sites and that 
<?notus-xml column=84?>local authorities are effectively forced into permitting development on
greenfield sites. A Thornaby Independent Association councillor
questioned the reason for the very existence of a planning committee

continual attack by the hon. Member for Stockton South (James Wharton)

“Bob the Builder”, despite the fact that since May 2010
the hon. Gentleman has not once objected to a planning application, and
his Government are coercing the council into making the decisions. When
Yarm councillor Mark Chatburn defected from the Tories to UKIP, he

reintroducing a regional element into planning? Currently, one of the
few parts of joined-up thinking in the formation of local plans is
neighbouring authorities responding to each other’s

responding to Redcar and Cleveland’s plan, supporting the

on the five-year housing supply, which will be a requirement—not
only when there are approved local plans, but until 2031. At any point
between now and 2031, developers will be able to come forward and say
to a local authority, “At this moment, you haven’t got a
sustainable five-year housing supply, so we are entitled to build
wherever we want within your district”.</hs_Para>

present, there is no agreement on the methodology used by planning
inspectors to determine the five-year housing supply. Two distinct
methodologies seem to be used by planning inspectors. Different
methodologies are used in different cases. One is now referred to in
planning shorthand as the “Liverpool” method of
calculation, and the other as “Sedgefield”.</hs_Para>

a recent decision in a planning appeal in my constituency at

“Sedgefield-lite”.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T10:09:27"></hs_TimeCode> is simply not
good public policy for local councillors, chief planning officers and
others not to know what methodology a planning inspector will adopt in
calculating whether a local planning authority has met its five-year
housing supply. Ministers have to make clear and

second point is about brownfield sites. It has been an article of faith
in the planning system, quite rightly, that one should bring forward
brownfield sites first, but if local authorities are so keen and need
to have their five-year housing supply, they will bring forward sites 
<?notus-xml column=86?>that are easiest to develop in the five-year supply. Invariably, those
are greenfield sites, so brownfield sites will get put to the
back.</hs_Para>

example the Banbury canalside site in my constituency. The intention is
to have that built in the centre of the town on an area that was in the
flood plain, but now no longer is, because we built adequate flood
defences. The plan is for 950 houses, but my district is so determined
that it has to meet its five-year housing supply that that brownfield
site is being put back rather than being brought to the front of the
queue. That is daft.</hs_Para>

situation changing only if planning inspectors, in calculating the
five-year housing supply, give credit in housing numbers for brownfield
sites when local authorities can demonstrate that they are undertaking
sustained and credible work to make a brownfield site available in the
market. Otherwise, given how the five-year housing supply is working at
present, brownfield will be put to the end of the queue rather than
being brought to the beginning of the queue. As I said, that is
daft<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T10:04:04"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T10:03:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010837000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010837000067">My
third point relates to neighbourhood plans. All of us understood that,
with the new national planning policy framework, neighbourhood plans
and localism were going to be really important, but neighbourhood plans
have to clear two hurdles. First, they have to be consistent with the
local plan, and secondly, at present the community has to complete its
neighbourhood plan until such a point as is agreed by a local
referendum. Many of the communities that have started neighbourhood
plans carry them out diligently and earnestly, but they are unlikely to
complete them within a year or 18 months, by which time I
suspect that a large number of them will be redundant.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14010837000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010837000068">A<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T10:04:52"></hs_TimeCode>
classic example involves the community in Deddington, a village in my
constituency. People there are busily undertaking a neighbourhood plan,
entirely consistent with the provisions set out by the Government. A
landowner and developer come along and put in a planning application to
build up to 85 houses on the edge of the community, which is refused by
the local authority but allowed on appeal. Under the agreed local plan,
because of what is happening with most of Cherwell’s new
housing—we have planned for nearly 17,000 houses in our agreed
local plan between now and 2031, so we are hardly not stepping up to
the plate to meet housing requirements—Deddington is due to take
something like 80 new houses to the end of the survey period in 2031.
However, the location of up to 85 has already been decided—not
by the local community, but on the basis of whoever happened to get
their planning application in first. With respect, that is not
neighbourhood planning. It is not a plan-led system; it is a system of
first come, first served.</hs_Para>

planning authority has submitted an agreed local plan and if
neighbourhoods are carrying out a neighbourhood plan consistent with
the rules set out by the Government, in a timely and proportionate
manner, I suggest that any planning application that will effectively
pre-empt the neighbourhood plan should be dismissed on grounds of
prematurity, in that it would effectively rob local communities of the
opportunity to determine their future. Thank you, Mr Gray. If any

plans sound so good; we hear  about the examples that have gone

more support, although I accept that the Government are supporting the
process, because it is such an important way forward. I do not think
that we should lose sight of that on the Government side, because it

agree with my hon. Friend that the emerging local plan has to have more
material weight in the inspectors’ considerations. I do not know
how that can be achieved, but in the past an emerging plan certainly
had weight. Perhaps developers are finding new ways of getting around
things. The Government must concede the point, given the number of
places that do not have fully adopted plans as such, and support those
areas that do not have fully adopted plans.</hs_Para>

My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T10:08:41"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood) likes to make the point that
Cheltenham is very constrained, in terms of where new development would
be suitable. My constituency is very constrained because of protected
heathland. We have these dilemmas. There is a duty to co-operate, but I
think we need to look more at how local authorities can form natural
partnerships and work together to meet housing and other infrastructure
needs.</hs_Para>

shall briefly touch on rural exception sites, which I have raised with
the Minister. I was a big fan of rural exception sites until last week,
I think it was. In my constituency, one has come in for 35 homes. There
is a recently adopted plan in that part of the constituency. The parish
is working up its neighbourhood plan, but that site has not been
consulted on at all. It seems totally wrong that that could come in
without a proper round of community interaction. It may well result in
houses at the end of the day, but I am finding it difficult to see how
it fits with our new planning

the decision is then overturned or, as in this particular case, the
local authority gets the feeling that if it did turn the application
down, it would go to appeal, cost it a lot of money to defend its
position and the application would then be allowed. In many cases,

primary issue being debated is housing projections in our areas. Many

the debate is being characterised, or rather could be characterised
from the Whitehall and ministerial perspective, in a certain way. I

that the role of Government, through their policies and the
inspectorate, is to ensure that there is balance in the system and that
that group of people are seeking to resist simply from the perspective
of wanting to protect their own property values, scenery and
lifestyle—the drawbridge mentality, which often applies to
people living in a rural setting. The view is that the role of this
system is to stand up against those kinds of pressures. That is a
rather simplistic view of how the system operates in an area such as
mine. Cornwall is not a nimby place. The housing stock has more than
doubled in the past 40 years, but local people’s housing
problems have significantly worsened over that
period.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010837000099" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010837000099">We
cannot be accused of being nimbys, but successive Governments’
policies have been counter-productive for the region. They have ensured
that projections are maintained, but those projections have been
utterly unsophisticated. Many of the Office for National Statistics 
<?notus-xml column=91?>projections over the past 10 years have been significantly undershot,
and I believe that the ONS model for setting projections is rather
flawed. When there is a high projected figure, what happens—not
only in the five-year supply, as my hon. Friend the Member for Somerton
and Frome has said, but in the system as a whole—is that even in
areas that have not been designated for housing development, the hope
value on all surrounding land becomes extremely high, because of the
expectation that planning permission will be relatively easily
obtained. As a result, it becomes impossible to implement schemes to
deliver affordable homes, which require low land values.</hs_Para>

have a counter-productive impact. That sits against the aims of the
exceptions policy and “Planning Policy Guidance 3”, which
was established in the early 1990s under the then Environment
Secretary, Nicholas Ridley. The principle behind that policy was
absolutely correct. If a strict and controlling system that protects
the local community is established and a genuine exception, which
follows the policy, is granted, it is possible to achieve low land
values and deliver affordable homes in rural areas. The setting of high
projections will never achieve that.</hs_Para>

described by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid Dorset and North Poole
(Annette Brooke) is clearly not a proper exception. An exception would
have to be brought through with the support of parish council housing
associations and others, and the necessity for it would have to be
clearly demonstrated by a community needs assessment. My hon.
Friend’s example is a rather curious one. Over the past few
years in Cornwall, we have seen a lot more housing—we are the
second or third-fastest growing place in the United Kingdom—but
housing problems have soared. In the Penzance area, rough sleeping and
homelessness is second, proportionately, to London, so the policy has
clearly failed.</hs_Para>

Government must stop imposing projected figures on Cornwall. Cornwall
council will have a debate next week in which it will say that if it
does not accept the ONS projected figure, that figure will be imposed
on the council. That is not a basis on which Cornwall can establish a
plan to meet local housing need. Meeting the desperate need for
affordable homes, not accepting projections that divert us from
achieving that aim, is ultimately what matters. Otherwise, we end up
with more second homes, more unoccupied property, more investment
property and more retirement homes. Those sectors have certainly grown
in Cornwall, while opportunities for the local population to find
adequate housing have significantly decreased.</hs_Para>

<?notus-xml column=92?>hon. Friend the Member for St Ives (Andrew George), who has in a
nutshell articulated our dilemma in Cornwall. We have welcomed a lot of
people into Cornwall; there has been a lot of inward migration and a
lot of house building, but we still have a chronic housing situation.
People who are born and bred in Cornwall, who work in our local economy
and contribute a great deal to it, cannot afford to live there. Because
so many colleagues want to contribute to this debate, I shall take the

in mind, I seek some simple assurances from the Minister. As my hon.
Friend the Member for St Ives has said, Cornwall council will meet next
week to attempt to agree its plan, and some specific assurances from
the Minister today would help the councillors in that process. Our
councillors are being told by the planners that unless they accept a
projected housing target based on what Cornwall has delivered over the
past 10 years, the planning inspector simply will not agree the plan.
To help the plan-making process, I urged Cornwall council to undertake
a local needs assessment, which it has done. That assessment looked at
the number of homes that are needed in Cornwall for those who currently
do not have the right type of genuinely affordable housing, and the
number needed to support the growing businesses in Cornwall. The local
needs assessment demonstrated that Cornwall has been over-delivering
properties at a rate of up to 1,000 a year, and that we need a much
smaller number in order to meet our obligations and our desire to
provide the right sorts of homes and achieve sustainable
growth.</hs_Para>

councillors are being told that the good evidence base that has been
gathered in that local needs assessment cannot be used, or the planning
inspectors will throw out the resulting plan. I seek an absolute
assurance that if Cornwall councillors, when they meet next week, can
provide an adequate evidence base that supports the building of a
certain number of homes based on realistic population growth and
observed household composition rates, the planning inspector will
accept that number. Any reassuring words that the Minister can give
about the methodology that councillors can use in making their decision
next week would be most welcome, because we desperately need to agree
the plan. There has been a huge amount of consultation and very good
work is going on in neighbourhood planning, but that plan has to be
agreed.</hs_Para>

other hon. Members have described today, a developers’
free-for-all is going on in Cornwall and a huge number of speculative
planning applications are being made. We need to use the tools that the
Government have laid out in a new plan-making process to ensure that we
have development in Cornwall, but that it is sustainable and fits in
with our unique environment. Our key industries are tourism, farming,
fishing and food production. Only yesterday the Secretary of State for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs quite rightly pointed out how much
more food we need to produce in our own country, and how food security
will become an increasing issue. Those are key industries for Cornwall,
and we can make a key contribution to the nation if councillors are
given the tools to balance the need for housing with the need for a
sustainable environment.</hs_Para>

a year ago—as far in the past as December 2012. It was then
submitted to the planning inspector in May 2013 and it took him
until 28 October to give his interim thoughts on stage 1 of the
inspection. That is a total of five months. He found that the duty to
co-operate was being met and he had many good things to say about the
plan, but he still wants further information and has rejected all seven
methodologies presented to him for housing projections. We are playing
a game of “pin the tail on the donkey” in the dark with
the planning inspector and guessing what sort of housing numbers he
wants to see. He has told us that the next stage of part 1 will start
on 10 March 2014—a delay, with five months between that date and
the continuation of stage 1. He has also written to me to say that he

wanted to see how long our process took compared with what hon. Members
had seen around the country. There is a good spreadsheet on the
Department for Communities and Local Government website of the 350-odd
local plans currently in different stages of development. It
categorises them by whether a council has published its local plan,
submitted its plan, whether the plan has been found to be sound and
whether the plan has been adopted. I thought it would be helpful to see
how long the process takes. In about half the cases, the plan has been
fully adopted. It is interesting to note that the time between a plan
being submitted and being found to be sound has increased substantially
in the past year. Since the national planning policy framework 
<?notus-xml column=94?>became live at the end of last March, the number of
days between a plan being submitted and being found to be sound has
increased from nine months on average— a normal human
pregnancy—to 14 months. There is a material difference: the time
period is not as long as an elephant’s pregnancy yet, but it is
certainly increasing—the size of the mammal is going
up.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010837000113" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010837000113">My

planning inspectors, and it is currently recruiting additional
inspectors. I would like an update from the Minister on the recruitment
of those additional

is the delay since the NPPF became active a deliberate strategy? Does
the Minister believe that it is encouraging more home

submit that that is a mistaken view. It would be helpful if we heard
whether he had noticed any difference between the number of new homes
bonuses paid out in local council areas that have an adopted plan and
the number paid out in those areas that do not. Is there a statistical
difference in the rate of housing delivery? Housing delivery will speed
up and the arguments about planning will slow down if a plan is given
significant weight in the planning process.</hs_Para>

essence of the debate is that increasingly relying on an inspection
regime to sort out problems is not localism, but quite the reverse.
That is the cornerstone of most Members’ contributions today.
Stroud district council is busily preparing its local plan, but it is
of course a Labour-led administration, which is bound to hamper
progress, and it has a committee system, which is not ideal.</hs_Para>

left many communities spinning in the wind, as gusts of developers come
along and make proposals here, there and everywhere. I have been the
recipient of many messages from communities saying, “What are
you going to do to protect the integrity of our area while we
don’t have a local plan?” I reiterate the point made by
my hon. Friend and others: while emerging local plans are still being
formulated, we must give them more prominence in inspection
considerations. That matters because if we are talking about localism 
<?notus-xml column=95?>and giving local people a voice, we must be bold enough to do it. We
must give emerging local plans some consideration.</hs_Para>

same logic, incidentally, applies to neighbourhood planning. When we go
around our patches, as I do, encouraging neighbourhood plans, the
response heard is, “Well, that won’t be sufficient to
stop what’s being proposed.” That is absolutely true
unless or until such plans are given recognition in the planning
process, too. If a community is concerned about what will happen to it,
a neighbourhood plan is a good way to do something, but we must give
that plan some traction. We should not only think about the local plan
as a whole, but consider emerging neighbourhood plans. They are a clear
illustration of what communities are thinking, if they are bold enough
and sensible enough to have one.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14010837000120" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010837000120"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T10:38:27"></hs_TimeCode>Many
hon. Members have talked about housing numbers. It is important to
bring together two issues. The first is co-operation among councils.
They must talk to each other and understand the scope and content of
their plans and their relationship to each other’s plans. That
is essential. Secondly, this is not just about housing numbers, but
about the economic conditions that prevail in an area. We need planning
authorities to take much more account of the economic factors, which
should have a bearing on housing numbers. The Minister needs to express
that clearly, so that councils have to consider the economic issues, as
well as the obvious question of housing numbers.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14010837000121" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010837000121">Time<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T10:39:23"></hs_TimeCode>
is obviously short, so I shall finish by saying that we want to see
local communities planning and we want to see more houses. We need to
understand the value that more houses can bring to local communities
which need to feel involved and have ownership of the developments.
That is another essential point that needs to be transmitted to local
authorities. In short, we do not want an inspection-led regime, because
that is not localism; it is effectively the nationalisation of
planning. We want the reverse, and we want to be able to say to local
authorities, “Those of you that are doing something, do it well

Members attended that debate a few months ago in October. It was about
what happens 
<?notus-xml column=96?>with local planning decisions when there is not a local plan in place.
There was some dispute among Members about whether there was a need for
additional housing in rural areas, and that has been reflected to a
degree in some of the contributions today.</hs_Para>

know that we need more housing, including in rural areas. I shall not
rehearse again all the figures that I gave last time. Suffice it to say
that, to secure a typical mortgage, a rural resident needs to earn
£66,000. With the average rural income standing at just over
£20,000, there clearly is a problem with affordability, partly
as a result of insufficient
supply.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010838000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010838000007">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T10:43:10"></hs_TimeCode>
situation in rural areas is part of a wider problem. For decades, under
successive Governments, house building has stayed low relative to
demand. Private house building completions in England have been
relatively static for more than 30 years, averaging about 130,000 per
annum. That is below the peak average of 180,000 per annum in the
1960s. There is an ever-growing gap between supply and demand, which
means that millions of hard-working people are increasingly priced out
of buying their own
home.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010838000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010838000008">Recent<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T10:43:45"></hs_TimeCode>
data from Glenigan show that although approvals for new housing are
improving, they are not yet at the levels recorded for 2007, and are
not high enough to deliver the output of about 200,000 houses per year
that most sensible commentators suggest we need to meet demand, so we
must address the housing shortage.</hs_Para>

Government are right—I want to emphasise this—to allow
housing need to be objectively measured locally as outlined in the
NPPF, but as the National Housing Federation has stated in its briefing
for today’s debate, more could be done to clarify the
methodology used. Indeed, it appeared to back Labour’s call that
we need a common methodology to be applied across all local authorities
to ensure a consistency of approach. That might help to address some of
the concerns raised by Members this morning.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14010838000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010838000010">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T10:44:41"></hs_TimeCode>
also agree with other Members who have contributed today that
development sites need to be identified by local communities, with a
stronger emphasis on neighbourhood planning and with consent at the
heart of the planning system. I think that that can be helped in a
number of ways. I have paid tribute to the Minister before for his
support for neighbourhood planning; he has the Opposition’s
support. We want him to think about how neighbourhood planning can be
strengthened and how we can better integrate neighbourhood planning
into the local plan-making system.</hs_Para>

applaud the precedence that the Government have given to local plans in
the determination of planning applications, but, as
many hon. Members have said this morning, the process of getting them
adopted is still too slow, with only 55% of authorities having an
adopted local plan. I know that 76% of councils have published a plan,
but there are still not enough of them in place. 
<?notus-xml column=97?>In the meantime, we have a situation in which, as many
hon. Members have mentioned today, the Planning
Inspectorate, and in some instances local authorities, are approving
inappropriate schemes in the absence of a local plan, or they are not
taking enough note of a local
plan<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T10:46:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010838000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010838000013">A
few months ago when we debated the issue, the Minister had nothing much
to say about how he would remedy the situation. I hope he has stronger
words of comfort for us today. It is clearly an issue that relates to
many areas and it is causing anxiety locally. Worryingly, the Local
Government Association has said that local decisions taken in line with
emerging local plans are being overturned by the Planning Inspectorate.
I agree with it and others who have said that this will undermine trust
in the planning system and result in development that does not reflect
the needs of local communities. That is the opposite of what we all
want.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010838000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010838000014">The
LGA also points out, helpfully, that it is not planning that is the
barrier to growth. Councils are approving 89% of all planning
applications, and planning permissions are up 31% on 2012. Indeed,
planning approvals are at a 10-year high, so it should be possible to
have the housing we need and to reject inappropriate development as
defined locally at the same time. Otherwise, the current system risks
breeding further resentment towards development. Instead, we should be
supporting a planning system that more readily favours development
based on
consent.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010838000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010838000015">The
issue is<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T10:47:55"></hs_TimeCode>
important for the Minister, because the NPPF states clearly that weight
should be given to emerging local plans, but, in practice, this appears
to be being ignored by PINS. Members have this morning called for
greater guidance to be given to the Planning
Inspectorate.</hs_Para>

not considered strongly enough by the Planning Inspectorate. Again, I
want to emphasise the need to do something about quality and about

first issue is housing projections. What is the role of figures from
the Office for National Statistics in supporting housing projections?
The fundamental situation is that, just as we expect local authorities
to make plans to meet their needs for schools and for social care, we
expect in the national planning policy framework that local authorities
will make plans to meet their housing needs. Those plans have to be
evidence-based. Of course, we cannot entirely reject ONS population
projections, because the ONS is our national statistics body and those
projections are the best that we have, although I entirely understand
why they are often wrong and flawed, as all projections necessarily
are.</hs_Para>

I have said, however, does not mean that those ONS projections are the
last word. It is absolutely open to any authority—Cornwall
council will certainly have this opportunity—to look at the
actual figures achieved in the past, relate them back to the
projections that were in place then and then say why it thinks that
projections are not the last word and that different numbers have an
evidence base. It is absolutely open to authorities to do that, but
their numbers must be based on evidence; they cannot be based on
assertion alone. Authorities must 
<?notus-xml column=99?>use evidence and that evidence will be challenged in an examination by
developers and others, so it needs to be pretty robust.</hs_Para>

we are looking to do in the draft guidance, which we hope to confirm

exceptional circumstances, but exceptions happen all the time—to
refuse a planning application. That is the case if, one, the
application is so substantial that it runs the risk of undermining the
plan to which it is being referred, and, two, where a local plan has
been submitted for examination—it has not yet passed
examination, but has been submitted. A refusal can also happen in the
case of a neighbourhood plan, when it has entered into what is called
the local authority publicity period; it has completed consultation but
it has not yet gone to referendum or, indeed, to examination. Before
the plans have been examined, they will have material weight and they
can, in exceptional circumstances, be used just on the basis of
prematurity to refuse an application, if the application is so
substantial that it could completely knock the legs out from that
emerging plan.</hs_Para>

court. It would cost their local authorities a lot more money to fight
these things in court than it does to fight them either through an
examination or in an appeal with the Planning Inspectorate. Planning
inspectors are a better solution for local councils and local
communities than the available alternative in a system where the rule

to be here today under your chairmanship, Mr Gray. I am grateful to Mr

Vaccination and Immunisation. I requested this debate following the
JCVI’s decision on the 2 October 2013 to undertake further work
on key issues surrounding the human papillomavirus, or HPV, vaccination
programme. I understand that some colleagues may wish to comment on
other aspects of the JCVI’s work. I want to focus particularly

HPV vaccination programme,
specifically<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T11:01:22"></hs_TimeCode> in
terms of exposure to HPV-related cancers, which are increasing in boys

decision of the JCVI to prioritise consideration of vaccinating MSM is
noteworthy, not least because the minutes of its October meeting accept
that a full economic model might not be necessary where sexual health
clinicians can develop independent guidelines. Historically, the JCVI
has often rejected vaccination of adolescent boys and MSM on economic
grounds, so it is a major step forward for it to say that heath
clinicians with expertise—particularly at sexual health
clinics—can take such a decision on clinical grounds. That is
welcome.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010838000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010838000047">It

Freer:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point that repeats
some of the discussion we had in last year’s Adjournment debate.
The success of the vaccination programme among girls has had a dramatic
impact on HPV-related cancers among women. However, the flaw was that
it assumed herd immunity for boys who were having sex either with girls
or within the herd. But of course, not all boys have sex with girls:
some—shock, horror!—have sex with other boys, and not all
boys have sex within the herd. Increasingly, in a global economy, and
particularly in Europe where the vaccination programme is not the same,
adolescent boys in this country are exposed to women who have not been
vaccinated. It is important to close the loophole for 
<?notus-xml column=103?>adolescent boys having sex with unvaccinated girls and those having sex
with unvaccinated
boys<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T11:04:33"></hs_TimeCode>, who,

the JCVI has agreed to urgently review the economic case for extending
the vaccination programme, why is this debate needed? Before I discuss
that, it is worth reminding ourselves what health problems we are

duty Whip sink ever further on the Bench as we discussed certain topics

out of 10 cases of genital warts are HPV-related; oral-related HPV
infections—men are six times more likely than women to have oral
infections—increase the risk of cancers of the mouth, throat,
neck and head cancers; and there are HPV-related penile and anal
cancers: HPV is associated with 80% to 85% of anal cancer in men. In
2009, just after the HPV vaccination programme started, there were more
than 6,500 cases of these cancers, with 47% of penile cancer and 16% of
head and neck cancers thought to be HPV-related. The latest incidence

we look at the costs, we can start to see the scale of the savings. To
put that into perspective, the three-dose HPV vaccination programme
currently costs some £260. I understand that the JCVI is
also considering whether that may be reduced to a two-dose vaccination,
which would reduce the outlay. Let us compare that with the
£13,000 cost per patient of treating anal cancer, the
£11,500 cost per patient of treating penile cancer, the
£15,000 cost per patient of treating oropharyngeal cancer, or
the £13,600 cost per patient of treating vulvar and vaginal
cancer transmitted by an infected male. In 2010, the total cost to the
NHS of treating genital warts was £52.4 million. If we multiply
those figures by four, we can see the clear economic benefits of

of education and the cost of continuing care for the rest of her

Minister should consider the matter in the round, not just the cost to
the NHS  of vaccinating every child. We should consider what
vaccination is doing for the whole country in saving money and

all recognise that the NHS budget is a finite resource. New vaccination
programmes and extensions to existing programmes represent a
significant cost to the health service in terms of both vaccine
procurement and administration. Obviously, it is essential that any

ensures 
<?notus-xml column=106?>that increased spending on immunisation does not result in an overall
decrease in the health of the population because resources are diverted

hon. Friend the Member for Mid Derbyshire makes a powerful case for the
meningitis B vaccine, which the JCVI is currently reconsidering. The
updated statement published on 25 October 2013 reflects the
JCVI’s recognition of the burden and severity of meningococcal
meningitis and septicaemia in the UK and the need to explore the
potential for their prevention through immunisation. The situation is
difficult when we have a new vaccine, in this case against meningitis
B, but lack important evidence on its effectiveness. We need to know
how well the vaccine will protect, how long it will protect for and
whether it will stop the bacteria spreading from person to person. At
the committee’s next meeting in February, if it feels it is in a
position to make such a decision because it is in possession of all the
relevant facts, the JCVI will make a final recommendation on whether
meningitis B immunisation should be introduced. Obviously at that point
we will carefully consider and respond to the recommendation. I hope my

the issue raised by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T11:18:03"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Finchley and Golders Green, the primary aim of the
UK’s national HPV vaccination programme, which began in 2008, is
to prevent cervical cancer related to HPV infection. The HPV vaccine
protects against two strains of HPV—16 and 18—that
currently cause some 70% of cervical
cancer.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010838000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010838000071">As
HPV is responsible for virtually all cases of cervical cancer,
preventing the disease is the major aim, but as my hon. Friend rightly
says, HPV infection has been associated with other cancers including
cancer of the penis and anus, and some cancers of the head and neck.
The precise proportion of those diseases that can be attributed to HPV
infection is less well defined, but evidence is emerging all the time,
so HPV infection should be taken
seriously<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T11:18:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010838000072" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010838000072">Evidence
from clinical trials demonstrates that the HPV vaccine has a very high
efficacy against the precursors of cervical cancer. Evidence of
efficacy against cancers at other sites is emerging, and it is
recognised that the current programme may therefore provide protection
against a wider range of HPV-related cancers in females and,
indirectly, in males than originally
envisaged.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010838000073" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010838000073"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T11:19:23"></hs_TimeCode>It
is also worth saying that the UK’s HPV vaccination programme has
been a considerable success, with this country having some of the
highest coverage in the world—something we can be very proud of.
A recently published study by Public Health England provided new
evidence that the programme is successfully preventing HPV infections
in young women in England, and that adds to our confidence that the
programme can achieve its aim of reducing cervical
cancer<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T11:19:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010838000074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010838000074">With
a high uptake of HPV vaccination among girls, transmission of HPV
between girls and boys should, as my hon. Friend said, be substantially
lowered. Many boys will be protected against HPV infection and will,
therefore, be at reduced risk of developing the related cancers we have
spoken about, such as anal, head and neck cancers. However, I
appreciate that he is particularly concerned that the current programme
does not extend 
<?notus-xml column=107?>to men who have sex with men. He argued strongly that that is an
apparent health inequality, and he raised the issue with my predecessor

my hon. Friend will know, the JCVI has recognised that, under the
current programme, the protection that accrues from reduced HPV
transmission from vaccinated girls may not extend to men who have sex
with men. He made the additional point about men who might have sex

in October 2013, the JCVI agreed to set up a sub-committee on HPV
vaccination to assess, among other issues, the question of extending

when it will assess currently available scientific evidence and
consider what further evidence is required to advise the JCVI on the

Health England has begun preliminary modelling to assess the impact and
cost-effectiveness of vaccinating MSM, in anticipation of further

completed that work yet, but what I have seen so far leads me to

conclusion, this important work has yet to be completed. We have to get
some clarity on the time lines. We cannot achieve one of the things my
hon. Friend mentioned—bringing the work on the assessment
forward—because we have to review the available evidence and
fill in any gaps if further evidence is needed. A decision on the
vaccination of adolescent boys will probably require the development of
quite a complex model to determine whether vaccination would be
cost-effective, because the numbers involved are large. Such a model
may identify a need to generate additional evidence, so a decision on
that wider programme is not likely before 2015. However, as I said, the
evidence to support a decision on a selective programme to target men
who have sex with men may become available during 2014.</hs_Para>

Karen Buck</B> (Westminster North) (Lab):</Member> I am grateful for
the opportunity to speak on the subject of the NHS in London, and
delighted that so many colleagues from the four corners of London want
to say something about the health service in their areas. I want to
sketch out, with some specific reference to local issues, the momentous
changes that are happening within London’s health care and the
extent to which the Government have made necessary changes far more
difficult to achieve than should have been the case. I fear the
results.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010842000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010842000006">When
I applied for this debate before Christmas, I did not know that I would
spend a large part of the next two weeks experiencing the health care
system with a close relative, who was admitted to hospital on Christmas
day. We went through the whole process of ringing 111, of paramedics,
of the ambulance, of A and E and of spending two
weeks in St Mary’s hospital. I can confidently say two things on
the basis of that experience. First, I have seen, and my relative has
experienced, nothing but kind and efficient health care at St
Mary’s and within the health care system in general. It is true
that, over the years, there have been instances of the health care
system falling far short of the standards that we expect, but it is
also true that most health care professionals and auxiliaries are doing
a stunningly good job for the people of London and the rest of
England.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010842000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010842000007">There
is kindness and the effective delivery of health care everywhere we
look in our health service. We must be careful not to succumb to the
tendency—I see this too often from Government Members—to
talk down the health service’s achievements. It is completely
right that Sir Mike Richards of the Care Quality Commission said in his
comments on the first wave of inspections

are some very good hospitals in this country, and it is possible,
within the NHS, to receive good, excellent, even outstanding
care.”</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="14010842000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010842000008">Secondly,
from my observations this past fortnight, I can say that the health
service is under extraordinary pressure. One would expect not to have
the level of staffing for the two-week period of Christmas and new year
that one might have outside the holiday period, but it has been
alarming to note instances of health care auxiliaries being two thirds
below planned staffing levels and nursing being down by one third.
Incidentally<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T14:33:11"></hs_TimeCode>, I
was also shocked to discover when talking to health care assistants
that they sometimes work an 11-hour day for a £90 day rate,
which is not the London living wage—it is the minimum wage. How
can we expect people to provide the intensity and quality of care that
we want when we do not pay them even the living wage? That causes me
great
concern<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T14:33:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010842000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010842000009">Pulling
back to the wider picture, as our experiences have demonstrated, the
health service is under extraordinary pressure, particularly in the
emergency service. Some of that is unsurprising in London, because the
capital has the fastest-growing population and has had the fastest rise
in the over-65 population of any region in the country. It also has the
highest demands on mental  
<?notus-xml column=110?>health care services and an overwhelming concentration of rarer and more
difficult conditions, including tuberculosis, which places particular
pressures on
London.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010842000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010842000010">Unsurprisingly<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T14:34:07"></hs_TimeCode>,
those facts are showing themselves in A and E
attendance and waiting times. Just before Christmas, the London
assembly found that more than half of London’s A
and E departments failed to meet their waiting time targets
for more than half of last year. Across the capital, Londoners had to
wait for more than four hours on 202,000 separate occasions.
A and E attendance has soared in London since
2010 and is up by 47% at St George’s hospital in Tooting, 46% at
St Bartholomew’s Hospital, 33% at West Middlesex university
hospital and 35% at Hillingdon hospital. For my own Imperial College
Healthcare NHS Trust, even a relatively modest increase of 19% equates
to an extra 44,812 people seen last year compared with
2010<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T14:34:53"></hs_TimeCode>. Cancelled
operations were running at a 12-year high even before the winter, owing
to pressure on hospital beds. One London hospital, Barts, topped the
national list with 649 elective operations cancelled in the first half
of last
year<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T14:35:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010842000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010842000011">Vacancy
rates are a particular concern in London. Regionally, 11% of nursing
posts are vacant, compared with a national average of 6%. At some
London trusts, the rate is more than 20%. The regional total represents
more than 6,000 vacant nursing posts in London. The Royal College of
Nursing, which kindly briefed me for this debate,
says:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="14010842000180" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010842000180">“Our<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T14:35:27"></hs_TimeCode>
worry is that the hard work of some trusts in protecting posts is being
undermined by a lack of available, suitably qualified nurses to take
vacant positions, raising obvious questions about whether training is
being commissioned at the level
needed<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T14:35:29"></hs_TimeCode>.”<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T14:35:43"></hs_TimeCode></hs_brev><hs_Para UID="14010842000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010842000012">Given
that pressure, it is beyond dispute that there is a need to carry on
changing how health care is delivered, which we all accept and have
accepted for many years. The broad principles mapped out by Lord Darzi
in 2007, which were not new, proposed a greater concentration of
high-level surgical services to save lives, and better community and
primary services to reduce unnecessary admissions and enable speedy
hospital discharge. Both the demand side of the equation, which is
driven by an ageing population and the challenge of chronic conditions,
and the delivery side, which utilises the opportunities of new drugs
and surgical techniques, push us to the same conclusion. There is clear
agreement in principle that we need to carry on with the
changes<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T14:36:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010842000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010842000013">The
central thrust of my argument, which will be echoed by colleagues, is
that managing change of that scale requires that essential
preconditions are met. Those preconditions are, however, not being met
at the moment, and in some cases the means of delivering them are going
into reverse. First—all are important, but this is the
first—there must be public confidence in the process, and that
confidence is so catastrophically lacking.</hs_Para>

colleagues who are facing the closure or downgrading of their
A and Es will know what their own communities are
telling them, which is that closing A and E units

perverse and should not happen until and unless trusted alternatives
are in place. In that context, clause 118 of the Care Bill confirms
everyone’s worst fears, because, having failed to win public

there must be effective partnership working between hospitals, primary
care providers and local authorities in the delivery of services. It
was the failure even to inform partners that elective surgery had
already moved from St Mary’s hospital to Charing Cross hospital
that prompted my debate some weeks ago, to which the Minister replied,
and which subsequently prompted an apology for the breakdown in
communication. That was not only a matter of leaving someone off an
e-mail circulation list, but a complete unwillingness to collaborate
even within the national health service, let alone with outside bodies
such as the local council, which is responsible for social care

those three boroughs—Kensington, Westminster and

nothing to a Government who have let us down with a change process that
we should have been able to work through. They have done that by the
way they have treated local authorities and by the way that, through

resources from the leadership that could ensure that London’s

pleasure to serve under your chairmanship,  Mrs Main. I
congratulate the hon. Member for Westminster North (Ms Buck) on
securing this valuable debate. Although her conclusion was perhaps a
little more hyperbolic than mine would have been in the circumstances,
we work closely together, along with her hon. Friend, the hon. Member

lively debate about health care provision here in the capital, there is
one thing on which we can all agree, as the hon. Lady made clear in her
contribution: the pressures on the national health service here in
London are huge and getting bigger. They are set to increase
substantially, not only because the population is ageing but because of
the hypermobility and hyperdiversity of that population. In the past,
that was perhaps typical of inner London alone, but it now applies to
the entirety of the capital.</hs_Para>

national health service can seem a little like a national religion,
whose traditions must not be questioned under any circumstance. In my
view, if one good thing has come from the terrible events in Mid
Staffordshire, it is that we can perhaps start to have a more honest
and less ideological debate about where 
<?notus-xml column=115?>the NHS is performing well, where it is letting people down and how it

enormous respect for the Secretary of State for unashamedly refocusing
the NHS around patients rather than protecting the sanctity of the
system. Thankfully, the patient experience at some of our central
London hospitals is, as the hon. Lady rightly pointed out, a world away
from what happened in Mid Staffordshire. The diversity of population
and the presence of top-flight medical schools and universities,
particularly in central London, inevitably draw global talent to our
local hospitals.</hs_Para>

my constituency it is non-emergency services that fail to be so

their lives, and as a result they have the idea that they should expect

similar consumer-driven, flexible and responsive system when it comes
to primary care—one that allows them swift access to a GP or

a lot in recent days about the number of non-emergency cases being
presented at A and E departments. I think that
that is in part due to the hassle factor associated with the existing
GP system. With the hypermobility of population in London, many people
never bother to register with a GP, and those who do all too often find
that they cannot get an appointment for days or at a time that is
convenient for someone with a busy working life. It is therefore often
a perfectly logical decision for those people to spend a few hours in
A and E, where they are at least guaranteed to be
seen.</hs_Para>

their own GP will not be affected. I also know that plans are afoot to

Lady spoke in a debate that I led in the House almost a decade ago on
Barts, which is located in my constituency and has a special place in
the hearts of many millions of Londoners—and, indeed, of people
throughout the United Kingdom. The truth is that at that juncture, the
private finance initiative was the only funding game in town and we all
went along with it, but that £1 billion PFI has now caused major
financial issues that, I am afraid, affect not just Barts but hospitals

accept that in London, broadly speaking, we do pretty well as far as
hospital care is concerned. Being absolutely candid with everyone,
because I know what it is like, in central London we have a very good
service, and it is partly outer London that suffers as a result. That
is because of the strength of the links to which the hon. Member for
Hackney North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) rightly
referred—the passion that we have for our historic
hospitals—and the amount of resource that is pushed into central
London because  
<?notus-xml column=117?>the hospitals there are teaching hospitals with consultants, former
consultants and alumni who are willing to make a strong case for the
existence of those hospitals. Dare I say it, that makes it easier to

to face those issues. They have not arisen as a result of the
reorganisation of the past three and a half years; this has been the
situation in the capital for probably 40 or 50 years. I am aware that
even in the latest reconfiguration there has been a sense that central
London has got off slightly better than the middle portion of outer
western London.</hs_Para>

finance. There was a good outcome before Christmas for north-west
London on commissioning allocations, as all of our CCGs received an
uplift to offset inflation. However, I want to raise concerns about the
funding formula used to determine allocation. The formula fails to take
into account the needs of the large homeless population in Westminster,
which places massive pressure on acute services. Rough sleepers are far
more likely to attend accident and emergency; they attend six times
more often than any normal member of the population. They are admitted
to hospital four times more often and stay in hospital three times as
long.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010842000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010842000063">The
formula also ignores the fact that CCGs are responsible for all
attendances at urgent care centres or walk-in centres and for the costs
of patients covered by reciprocal funding arrangements with other
countries. Westminster welcomes more than 1 million commuters and
visitors each and every day, many of whom will need health advice and
care while they are here. It is important that a future funding formula
recognises the impact of that on local health care
services.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010842000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010842000064">The
proposed formula will exclude spending on community care. That cannot
be correct considering the important move to provide more high-quality
care at home and in the community rather than simply in hospitals. I
welcome the Government’s assurances that the Advisory Council of
Resource Allocation formula will not be accepted in its current state

future.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010842000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010842000065">I
turn to public health spending. A draft formula for local authorities
was set out in the “Healthy Lives, Healthy People”
consultation, which was published on 14 June 2012 and recognised that
further work was needed on adjustments for age, fixed costs and
non-resident populations. However, initial modelling by London councils
suggests that Westminster would have a drop of 57% in public health
funding. Central London and Westminster have unique population
characteristics that make it more difficult to make public health
improvements. They include the age structure, with a greater focus on
working age and children, and levels of mental health problems and
homelessness. Those are not properly reflected in the current
formula.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010842000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0001.htm#14010842000066">The

Christmas from GPs, emergency doctors and nurses, midwives,
physiotherapists, psychotherapists and NHS trusts. Their plea was for a
page to be turned in the way we talk about the NHS. We need to talk
about the failures in patient care, but we must also recognise that we
have some extraordinary abilities in the NHS to reach and look after
our communities as well as they do. Sadly, I have been close to the NHS
in the past three years, and I have seen excellence and the pits.
However, in general, the people who work in our hospitals do a
fantastic
job.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010842000073" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0002.htm#14010842000073">I
wholeheartedly endorse the sentiments of that letter because I fear
that the driver for the relentless daily trashing that the NHS receives
comes from base political motivation—the softening up of public
opinion so that marketisation and privatisation become acceptable. It
will not be acceptable. It is not acceptable now and I do not believe
it will ever be acceptable, so let us just  stop
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010842000074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0002.htm#14010842000074">I
am not the only one to mistrust the motivation and outcome of the
coalition’s top-down, unwanted and wasteful reorganisation of
the NHS. I did a survey of my constituents—I like to find out
whether my impressions are the same as theirs—and 97% of those
who responded said that the NHS would undoubtedly get worse under the
new system. When they were asked about their main concern, 60% thought
that the money intended for NHS staff and services would end up as
profit for private companies. My constituents are very
astute.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010842000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0002.htm#14010842000075">I
want to turn to local circumstances before I am coughed at. In 2006-08,
life expectancy for men in Newham was 75.8 years, lower than the London
average of 78.2 years. In the same period, life expectancy for women
was 2.3 years below the London average at  
<?notus-xml column=119?>80.4 years. Even within my borough, there are variations that make the
local situation much more complex and challenging. Life expectancy in
some wards is 8.1 years shorter than in others. That is
massive.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010842000076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0002.htm#14010842000076">In
primary care, the recommended ratio of GP provision is 1.8 GPs per
1,000 of population. In Newham, the ratio is appalling and equates to
not much more than half that, at 0.56 of a GP per 1,000 of population.
It is small wonder that in my survey, 35% of respondents reported that
it is never easy to get a GP appointment, and just 10% said that it is
always easy. Many practices—too many—are operated by
single GPs, so it is no surprise that the patient experience in Newham
is the worst in north-east
London.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010842000077" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0002.htm#14010842000077">The

that challenging situation and I enthusiastically endorsed and
participated in it. Now, there are no mechanisms in place to root out
poor practice and promote the best. I would like to hear from the

we are entitled, and that we have performance and outcomes that are the

London.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010842000078" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0002.htm#14010842000078">Incidentally,
I would be interested to hear whether other hon. Members here are
experiencing the new phenomenon that we have in Newham: dial a
diagnosis. When people contact their GP to arrange an appointment, they
are initially offered a telephone conversation with the GP. Is that
because GPs must bolster the failing 111 non-clinical service, which is
now contributing to the difficulties of our A and
E departments? Is it to save money, to sift out or deter patients or to
ration GP time? Has there been a risk assessment of what that might
entail, and does it contribute to the problems that my community is
facing? Again, I would like to hear from the Minister about
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010842000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0002.htm#14010842000079">Another
statistic from Newham that should be good news is that the incidence
rate for breast cancer is 104.6 per 100,000 of population,
significantly lower than the UK average of 123.6. However, disturbingly
and distressingly, the percentage of women alive five years after
diagnosis—the five-year survival estimate—is, at 75%,
also significantly lower than the UK average of 83.4%. The reason in
part is the take-up rate of breast screening services, but there is
anecdotal evidence of women who were part of Barts hospital’s
preventative health services being encouraged to go away and become
part of the general population, and to present sometime in the future.
That encouragement not to continue to attend for breast screening gave
a rosy picture of health

was pleased that in 2010 the Government made  £2.7

debate is about London and the issues specific to this great city. In
my constituency, in west London, the key health care issues tend to be
focused around tuberculosis, obesity—including in
children—diabetes and alcohol-related harm. As Members might

issues with obesity. Other issues include smoking during pregnancy,
smoking deaths and skin cancer. There are therefore specific issues in
west London, and I will focus on them.</hs_Para>

also want to pay tribute to London’s air ambulance service.
During the Christmas period, there was a fire and a massive explosion
in Chiswick, and the air ambulance was called. The service deserves as
much support as possible, because it serves 10 million residents in
London, and it has only one helicopter. It is world class, providing
high-trauma, acute care. Everywhere else around the country has one
helicopter for 1.5 million people, but the figure in London is 10
million, so there is an absolute need for another helicopter. I would
push everyone to support the London air ambulance service, which has

challenge now facing London is the increasing complexity of diseases
and the treatments that are required, which means that additional money

local level; they must be dealt with nationally. Although we have
supported those suffering from cancer and other diseases, there are
much more complex diseases that remain to be

shall list some issues on which I would like more improvement. We heard
how difficult it is to get appointments at general practices—we
call up and know that the answer is going to be no before we say
anything. There are also issues with getting to see a specialist as
quickly as possible. We want an effective complaints process in
hospitals, changing the culture to allow people, whether staff or
patients, to complain. There is an issue with how patients are moved
around London, and the hon. Member for Westminster North made an
important point about having to use public transport to get home.
Mental health and community public health are other important
issues.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010842000104" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0002.htm#14010842000104">My
final comment is about dementia, which is a growing concern in London,
as it is across the country. About 30% of patients who go into the West
Middlesex hospital have dementia. They do not go there because of
dementia, but they have it. There is a lot to be done, and the West
Middlesex hospital has just opened a new dementia ward. There needs to
be a greater focus on dementia, given our ageing population nationally,
and the size of the population in London. We must ensure that we work
together to support those who really need and deserve care and support
in London. That will improve the NHS for us
all.</hs_Para>

regarding Charing Cross hospital is far less clear. I will
précis where we are and explain the matters that we wish the

Charing Cross hospital site, leaving an urgent care centre on 3% of the
site. At the same time, there was to be an outline business case, to
report in October last year, that might preserve 13% of the facilities
and 40% of the site. That business case is now due in March, but we
understand—through the Imperial College Healthcare foundation
trust process, not any other process—that there will also be
elective surgery on the site. That might mean there will be elective
surgery as well as primary care and treatment facilities, and some form
of emergency centre on the site, with perhaps 50% of the land
preserved. That gain, in so far as it is a gain, is St Mary’s

State’s intervention so far has been genuinely unhelpful and
done for political reasons. We have invented a second-tier A
and E, as it is called. A second-tier A
and E is an urgent care centre. The only differences that
clinicians could identify for me were that at a second-tier

is not, they will go there when they should have gone elsewhere. We
will continue to campaign to save emergency services. It is not

services. The problem is related to the constrained financial
environment, but fundamentally it is about the increasing needs of our
population. The population of London has grown 
<?notus-xml column=125?>by 12% in the past decade and is likely to grow by another million in
the coming decade. That is why the plans to downgrade and close
desperately needed and often very successful emergency and maternity
departments in London are met with such incredulity and
anger.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010842000121" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0002.htm#14010842000121">I
would like to make a few points to the Minister today. First, I ask her
to consider the overall shape of maternity services in London. Much of
the debate focuses on big arguments about the reconfiguration of
emergency departments, but maternity services are often a victim of
those reorganisations, because as soon as an intensive care unit is
taken away from a hospital, it is unable to provide full maternity
services. Does the Minister really want to ask women in the capital to
travel even greater distances to give birth to their children, when
they want to be close to home and family? Will she look at some of the
sacred cows that have built up in the wisdom on maternity
services?</hs_Para>

is an aspiration to provide 168 hours of consultant cover every week in
maternity departments, but I understand that that currently happens at
only one trust in the whole country. I ask the Minister whether it is
achievable, affordable, or necessarily in the best interests of women
to continue to aspire to reach that standard in all our hospitals in
London<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T15:30:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010842000123" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0002.htm#14010842000123">Another
point I want to make to the Minister—it has already been
made—is on the crucial importance of the public being involved
and having a genuine say when hospital services are being reconfigured.
In Lewisham, we saw the exact opposite of that, with the unsustainable
providers regime. The Government are trying to augment that process and
apply it more widely, which has very serious implications for trust in
politics and in our health
service.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010842000124" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0002.htm#14010842000124"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T15:31:26"></hs_TimeCode>I
am very conscious of time and that two other Members wish to speak. I
ask the Minister to look very hard at the existing evidence on
centralising all hospital services in London. I know there is a lot of
evidence for creating centres of excellence for stroke, trauma, and
vascular disease in big hospitals. However, I wonder whether the same
evidence exists for other acute medical emergencies and whether there
is evidence, for example, for centralising mental health services or
maternity
services.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010842000125" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0002.htm#14010842000125"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T15:32:09"></hs_TimeCode>I
have one final point—I will sit down very shortly. There are
currently plans at many hospitals in London to flog off hospital sites.
That land should not be used to create playgrounds for the rich and the
international jet set. Public land is a very precious asset in London,
and if we are going to use it for anything, could we please explore the
possibility of using it for housing for elderly people, providing
communities of care? Provision of suitable accommodation is one of the
crucial things we need to get right if we are to tackle some of the
underlying problems in the

turned away ambulances is Northwick Park. With the closure of
A and Es at Central Middlesex and Hammersmith

to receive blue-light ambulances in north-west London, Northwick Park
will be under even more strain as patients are sent there for emergency
treatment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010842000131" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0002.htm#14010842000131">Northwick<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T15:35:21"></hs_TimeCode>

at the end of October, the Secretary of State confirmed the closure of
A and Es at Central Middlesex and Hammersmith

remain at Charing Cross hospital and Ealing hospital, in my

has, however, been made clear, through the Keogh review and Dr Mark

reduce the size of Ealing’s A and E, and
that Ealing would be unable to receive blue-light ambulances. The
Secretary of State, who pledged to keep the A and
E services, has in fact downgraded Ealing hospital, while keeping the
A and E in name only. The Secretary of State
promised an A and E for Ealing, but delivered
only more disappointment to local residents. There are many other
concerns, not least of which is the fact that many of my constituents
in Southall are the poorest and most vulnerable members of society,
with specific health needs that are met by nearby Ealing hospital. They
will have to travel considerable distances, putting their lives at

hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mark Field) referred
to the pressures on central London. That is not only to do with the
churn of people moving into London and moving out, but, as he rightly
said, it is most markedly about people who are dependent, or
over-dependent, on drugs and alcohol, and people with mental health
issues. A peripatetic patient cohort—I hate that word, but I
cannot think of anything else at the moment—is virtually not
being regarded, let alone something on which the multifarious bodies
and boards that are now responsible for delivering health care in
London are working
together.<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T15:30:49"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010842000139" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0002.htm#14010842000139">I
hope the Minister will take that away and put it at the top of her
list, because the enormous damage that is done to individuals when they
are allowed to go over the cliff of their crisis is reflected in the
damage inflicted on their families and their wider community. I am
firmly of the opinion that the right provision, as we have had in my
own constituency, is a house that is open 24/7, 365 days a year. People
who felt that they were going to go over the edge of their mental
health crisis could walk in through the door. There were people there
all the time to care for them. Yes, such facilities are expensive to
set up, but I am firmly of the opinion that the money we save by having
them could be put towards the sharp end of delivering a high-quality
health service to people who are not suffering from mental health
problems.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-08?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_08_PT_1/BE1673B617054781087AEB82EA37E9B4229A2A5D" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="8 January 2014">Wednesday

It has people coming in from all over the world, not just from
elsewhere in the United Kingdom. It is a diverse city. It is an
exciting, vibrant city—I am probably over-egging it for a
Mancunian, but it is a great place. Those complexities are what makes
London fantastic, but they are also what makes delivering health
services a real
challenge.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010842000151" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0002.htm#14010842000151"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T15:47:13"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T15:46:43"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T15:46:45"></hs_TimeCode>To
make the change work, there must be clarity and partnership. Everyone
must understand what is being proposed and how the decisions are to be

face of unpopular change to health services and what that can
achieve.</hs_Para>

their local hospital. The proposal to close their A

which included protest marches and a successful legal challenge to the

did not have the power to implement the cuts at Lewisham hospital. If

118 should give very real concern to all hon. Members in the debate,
because in future it will give carte blanche to the Secretary of State
and the Department of Health to reconfigure services right across the
country as they sought to in Lewisham, disfranchising the communities
that have spoken out very loudly across London against some of the
changes. Labour Members are rightly concerned about that measure and we

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Jane
Ellison):</Member></B> What an amazing debate! I congratulate the hon.
Member for Westminster North (Ms Buck) on securing it; a lot of issues
have been covered. Many London colleagues have contributed, made
interventions or simply been present to listen to it. As a London MP, I
am particularly conscious of the unique challenges facing health care
in London, and many of the issues raised apply as much to my
constituents as they do to those of colleagues across the House. As
hon. Members have said, London is an amazing city with world-leading
expertise and services, but it has unique challenges. Whichever party
was in Government, it would have to respond to those
challenges.</hs_Para>

best to respond to some of the points that have been made, but there
were such a range of points, and some of them were so specific, that I
may need to write to colleagues after the debate. I hope that hon.
Members understand that. I will ensure that I follow up those points
personally or ask NHS London to do so. Forgive me for having to make
that health warning.</hs_Para>

echoing the praise from the hon. Member for Westminster North for our
NHS staff in London. They work under many interesting and unique
pressures, and they respond, for the most part, magnificently. We all
realise that no service is above criticism, but our starting point is
that we have some amazing people working very hard under difficult
circumstances. I am particularly glad that the hon. Lady and her family
experienced good care at a crucial time.</hs_Para>

is right to caution that debates about health need to acknowledge, but
not to exaggerate, risk. We always teeter on the brink of exaggerating
points for political effect, and it is really important that we keep
some sense of perspective. Several hon. Members have referred
repeatedly to an A and E crisis. I want to put on
the record that for the week ending 29 December 2013 last year, the
figures for A and E waiting times in London
demonstrate that 96% of patients were seen in under four hours in all
A and E types, against a standard of 95%. For the
third quarter of last year, 95.3% of patients were seen in under four
hours in all A and E types.</hs_Para>

saying that we do not have problems and challenges, but let us be clear
that in many places, the NHS is responding well to those challenges and
meeting targets. Work force statistics show that the number of
community health service doctors increased by 8.5% from 2010 to 2013.
Let us make sure that we keep a sense of perspective on where we
are.</hs_Para>

comments during the debate referred to reconfigurations across London.
We are quite clear that reconfiguration of front-line health services
is a matter for the local NHS, precisely for the reasons that some hon.
Members have given. We are trying to make sure that they are led by
clinical decisions. That was

reconfigurations must focus on delivering modern health care, better
patient outcomes and services as close to home as possible, but, most
importantly, they must focus on saving lives and improving quality of
life. Those service changes are best led by clinicians, with all of us
getting involved and engaging with the process, as we must do. That is

achieve that.</hs_Para>

inevitable, as most, but not all, hon. Members have acknowledged. We
have debated questions such as the changes to stroke services in
London, which many campaigners predicted would have dire and dreadful
outcomes. In fact, the opposite has been true, and London clinicians
believe that hundreds of our constituents’ lives have been saved
by the concentration of excellence in certain centres. We must be
realistic about the fact that reconfiguration can bring great health
benefits as long as it meets the important tests set out by the
Secretary of State, and is clinically led.</hs_Para>

service has to respond to growing demand. Much of the debate has
focused on the long-term challenges to the health service in London and
across the country. The Government are trying to respond to those huge
long-term pressures. We are looking at GP opening hours and at access.
That could not be a bigger issue in London, which has a highly diverse
and highly mobile population in a 24-hour city. People need to be able
to access health care at a time that suits their work patterns and
lifestyle, and we are pushing for changes to contracts in that area.
There will be named GPs for over-75s. We are looking at the integration
of social care and public health. We know that there are big challenges
around that, but a big project is under way to try to tackle
it.</hs_Para>

public health budgets will empower local authorities to do the very
thing that many hon. Members have drawn our attention to, which is to
look at the needs of local communities and respond to them at the most
local level. We do not want to take a “Whitehall knows
best” approach; we want to tell local authorities, “We
have ring-fenced your local public health budget so that you can look
at the needs of your local population and work with health and
wellbeing boards and clinical commissioning groups to devise services
that help people to live longer and healthier lives without the need to
resort to acute services.”</hs_Para>

on health and wellbeing boards. The challenge around Newham GPs would
be ideal for discussion at a health and wellbeing
board, where all the key people are present. It is a big challenge, and
one of the first questions I asked as a Health Minister is why we
struggled so badly to get GPs in our most deprived areas. There are
varying answers to that, but it is a problem across the
country.</hs_Para>

and wellbeing board is exactly the right forum for discussion because
the right people are around the table. Tackling health inequality is
now built into statute through the Health and Social Care Act 2012,
which must be given due attention in all parts of the health service.
The Darzi-led London Health Commission will be interesting. I spoke to
Lord Darzi about it just before Christmas to improve my understanding
of its objectives. As a Minister with responsibility for public health
and as a London MP, I will be looking closely at the
commission’s outcomes and I will be keen to work with people on
that. It is a big opportunity.</hs_Para>

the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and
Westminster (Mark Field), the formula does not currently reflect
non-resident population or the homeless, but that is something that the
Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation and NHS England continue to

their attention, and that those are fed into the ongoing process of
looking at formulas.</hs_Para>

time, the formulas for CCG patients and public health allocations take
into account health inequalities, and they look at GP populations
rather than census-based populations. The formulas are also designed to
be more locally sensitive. As the hon. Member for Westminster North and
I know particularly well, in a city such as London areas that appear to
be quite affluent can contain pockets of tremendous deprivation. The
new formula allows for that by enabling consideration of sub-areas and
the real health inequalities that they suffer. I hope that hon. Members
feel some reassurance about that. We keep the matter under close
watch.</hs_Para>

detailed concerns were raised by the hon. Member for Lewisham East
(Heidi Alexander) about Lewisham, the south London reconfiguration,
maternity services and accommodation. The shadow Minister, the hon.
Member for Denton and Reddish (Andrew Gwynne) referred to clause 118. I
will ensure that I draw his concerns to the attention of the Minister
who is leading on that Bill. No doubt that point will be responded to
when the Bill is brought before the House. The Court of Appeal

I said, this is the year of separation, so it is important to have this
debate as we move towards the Budget on 19 March. I fully support the
“UK okay” campaign. One of the areas of vulnerability is
the current disproportionate tax on Scottish whisky compared with
English beer or cider. Whisky is taxed at 48% more than the same amount
of alcohol served as beer. That is the difference in terms of the
taxation on whisky and spirits. The beer duty escalator was abolished
last year, but the spirits escalator continues at 2% above inflation.
That should be addressed and I will come to the reasons
why<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T16:12:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010847000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0002.htm#14010847000010">Excise
duty on Scottish whisky is now 44% higher than in 2008. The escalator
in 2014 will mean an increase in duty of 4.8%, or, in terms that I
understand, 38p per bottle. That is what the escalator will bring. As I
said, taxation as it stands now is more than £10 a bottle.
Scotch whisky exports are growing, but the home market remains
important, and the UK is the third largest market for Scotch whisky by
volume<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T16:12:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010847000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0002.htm#14010847000011">However,
volumes in the UK have declined by some 12% in the UK since the
escalator was introduced—as a result of it, I would argue, and I
am sure some of my colleagues would too. The UK tax on spirits, which
of course includes Scotch whisky, is the fourth highest in 
<?notus-xml column=135?>Europe. When we compare that with Sweden, Finland and Ireland, which
have particular reasons for having high taxation, we can see the
unfairness of the tax for the spirits

Scotch Whisky Association, which helped the all-party group, has called
on the Chancellor to freeze duty on Scotch whisky in the 2014 Budget
and to scrap the escalator. It should be scrapped because UK
consumption has declined since it was introduced, and we want to see
the UK market expand. Ernst and Young research shows that scrapping the
escalator in 2014 would boost the drinks industry contribution to
public finance by some £230 million in 2014
alone<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T16:13:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010847000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0002.htm#14010847000013">Consumers
should be treated fairly across the range of alcohol products, but
Scotch whisky drinkers are being heavily penalised. The sales of Scotch
whisky form a significant part of the pub trade. Scrapping the

beer and cider, but not for spirits. I think that that is unfair and it
does not really stack up when one considers that the reasoning was to

Malcolm Bruce</B> (Gordon) (LD):</Member> The Government are arguing
that the duty on whisky has gone up by 37% compared with a rise of 42%
on beer. The trouble with that argument, of course, is that, because
the Government have eliminated the beer escalator, that division will
be eliminated very quickly. The point that we have to maintain in
export terms is that this is a home-based industry. If something is
good enough for beer, it is good enough for whisky; the escalator
should go and we should ensure that our most successful industry is
supported competitively at home and abroad.</hs_Para>

<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T16:22:13"></hs_TimeCode>I will finish by
putting four questions to the Minister. First, can the Treasury explain
why it was that, when it stopped the escalator on beer last year to
save struggling pubs, it failed to look at the situation as far as
spirits and wines were concerned? As I said, they account for some 40%
of the sales in those very pubs and the rest of the hospitality sector.
Given that the Chancellor wanted to help that sector, it seems strange
that the rise in duty on whisky was set against
that.<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T16:22:48"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

what assessment—if any—has the Treasury made of the
impact on pubs of last year’s announcement on beer? I hope I can
get a response to that question.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T16:23:01"></hs_TimeCode>Thirdly, can the
Treasury provide reassurances to the Scotch whisky industry that the
annual attack on Scotch whisky will come to an end in the Budget in
2014? Finally, does the Treasury acknowledge that the home 
<?notus-xml column=138?>market for Scotch whisky, which remains the industry’s third
largest market, is diminishing due to excessive tax rises each
year?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010847000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0002.htm#14010847000039">Sales
of Scotch whisky in the UK have dropped by 12% since the duty escalator
came into being. Is it possible to hear today what is likely to be in
the mind of the Chancellor? I am sure that the Minister is aware that
we, as an all-party group, have made a representation to him for a
meeting. I hope that what she says today will include an agreement to
that
meeting.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-08?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_08_PT_1/578EE0F6879C2DBF301593BBE0C43F8B7043CC88" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="8 January 2014">Wednesday

start by highlighting the Government’s continued commitment to
the Scotch whisky industry. First, Scotch whisky is a protected spirit
drink, which helps to maintain its high reputation both at home and
abroad. Secondly, and related to that, Her Majesty’s Revenue and
Customs will shortly be launching its spirit drinks verification
scheme. Within the first two years of that scheme, every single
business involved in the production of Scotch whisky will be verified
to ensure that they are creating a genuine product. This will help to
protect the industry’s deservedly high reputation. In fact, the
Scotch Whisky Association has praised HMRC’s commitment to
deliver a scheme that fits its needs.</hs_Para>

first products in the food and drink element of the GREAT
campaign<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T16:25:04"></hs_TimeCode>. This
helps to give Scotch whisky high visibility internationally in key
export markets, the importance of which we have already heard about.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T16:25:13"></hs_TimeCode> Scotch
whisky industry is to be congratulated on its export success. The
Scotch Whisky Association reports that the value of exports increased
by 11% to almost £2 billion in the first six months of 2013.
That is something that I think everybody in Westminster Hall today will
support. I think that people will agree that those measures leave no
doubt about the Government’s commitment to the Scotch whisky
industry, and I want that message to be heard and understood by Members
from all parts of the House.</hs_Para>

return to the duty escalator, including that on Scotch whisky. I am

rises for 2014. It may be helpful if I explain the background to these

the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T16:27:25"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Central Ayrshire. Of course, the previous Government were
responsible for introducing the spirits duty escalator and are
therefore responsible for this year’s increase in spirit duty.
The inflation plus 2% rises were first announced at Budget 2008 and
they were extended for a further two years, until 2014-15, at the March
2010 Budget. These rises were for all alcohol duties and, as I say,
were legislated for by the previous
Government<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T16:27:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010847000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0002.htm#14010847000049"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T16:27:51"></hs_TimeCode>This
Government made changes to beer duty at Budget 2013 to support pubs,
which, as we all know from our constituencies, play an important role
in local communities. The hon. Gentleman asked about the impact of last
year’s Budget on pubs and I shall address that issue in a
moment. However, he also talked about 68% of the alcohol that is sold
in pubs being beer, so the changes to beer duty were, overall, a
measure to help pubs. I can also tell him that although spirits and
wine account for 41% of sales by value in the off-licence trade,
they account for only 23% of sales in pubs by alcohol
volume.</hs_Para>

speaking specifically about York and north Yorkshire—the most
beautiful area within God’s own county—may I touch
briefly on the wider broadband roll-out? I am pleased that, as part of
their long-term economic plan, the Government have recognised that the
future of our economy rests on the ability of our infrastructure not
only to cope with the demands placed on it, but to exceed those demands
and facilitate new opportunities for growth. This is no less true of
superfast broadband than it is of our rail, road and air
infrastructure.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010847000077" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0002.htm#14010847000077">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T16:35:53"></hs_TimeCode>
Government’s investment in superfast broadband is, to my mind,
one of their greatest and most important achievements in this
Parliament, yet sometimes it does not get the plaudits it deserves. It
has by no means been an easy task. It has required huge investment from
the Government, totalling roughly £1.6 billion, and some hard
work from all those involved in organising the roll-out, including the
people physically on the ground, upgrading the telephone cabinets with
the
fibre<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T16:36:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010847000078" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0002.htm#14010847000078">However<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T16:36:42"></hs_TimeCode>,
all the hard work and commitment has been worth it. The recent findings
from the UK broadband impact study reveal that for every £1 the
Government invest in broadband, the UK economy will benefit by
£20. That represents fantastic value for money in the short
term. In the short term, the network construction will add around
£1.5 billion to the economy, creating 11,000 jobs this year
alone. In the longer term, it will increase annual gross value added by
£6.3 billion. Its benefits will be spread across the country,
with approximately 89% of that in areas outside London and the
south-east, such as York and north Yorkshire. That vindicates
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T16:37:18"></hs_TimeCode>
Government’s commitment to investing so much in this programme
and shows that all the hard work that is being put in on a local level
is delivering real
results.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010847000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0002.htm#14010847000079">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T16:37:26"></hs_TimeCode>
roll-out has not been without its problems and it has faced some public
criticism for the degree to which one company has achieved a monopoly
over the roll-out contracts. There is also some concern about the
apparent shortcomings in the contracts, with BT being obliged only to
upgrade telephone cabinets with their fibre-to-the-cabinet approach.
Some<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T16:37:47"></hs_TimeCode> of my
constituents have expressed concern that, because they receive their
telephone lines from an upgraded cabinet, they are being counted by BT
as though they were part of the 90%, despite being too far away from
the cabinet to receive the upgraded superfast internet
speeds.</hs_Para>

have received assurances from the chief executive of BT Openreach that
that is not the case, and that only those who receive superfast speeds

Superfast<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T16:38:20"></hs_TimeCode> North
Yorkshire has subsequently clarified that, although there may be issues
about how coverage is measured in other parts of the country, the north

the roll-out so far has been a roaring success. The project, which has
been overseen by Superfast North Yorkshire, has been run well. When it
first set out on its mission, it had a total of 670 cabinets to be
upgraded—I think the technical term is
“deployed”—but, to date, 350 cabinets have been
upgraded, which marks 52% of the total. However, it is expected that
this figure will rise to 370 next week, ensuring that the project is
well over halfway to
completion.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010847000082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0002.htm#14010847000082">In
north Yorkshire, roughly one cabinet is updated per working day. As a
result, phase 1 of the roll-out is expected to be completed by October
2014, well ahead of the national target, which originally intended to
provide only 90% of all households with speeds of up to 25 megabits per
second by the end of 2015. That target now appears to have been pushed
back, and phase 1 might not be achieved nationally until the end of
2016. Will the Minister clarify that? What might that do to the

North Yorkshire’s achievements are a glowing example of what can
be done at local level. I am surprised that north Yorkshire was not
part of the

of superfast broadband in north Yorkshire is outpacing the national
average by a considerable margin. After 12 months, take-up in the north
Yorkshire intervention area is 13.4%, which proves that Superfast North
Yorkshire’s demand-stimulation activity is working extremely
well. It also demonstrates that there is latent demand for superfast
broadband in the rural areas around north Yorkshire and York. I am sure
that north Yorkshire colleagues here today can testify to that and have
many examples from their
constituencies<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T16:41:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010847000086" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0002.htm#14010847000086">The
achievements of Superfast North Yorkshire are remarkable given that it
is dealing with one of the country’s most rural
counties. The county’s rurality, however, also has its
drawbacks. Although I have no doubt that Superfast North Yorkshire will
meet its 90% coverage target well before the rest of the country, I
remain concerned that there is a deepening digital divide between the
90% and the 10%, who appear to be being left behind by phase
1 of the
roll-out<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T16:42:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010847000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0002.htm#14010847000087">I
see the divide first hand in my constituency. Communities such as
Haxby, Wigginton, Dunnington and Elvington are already enjoying the
benefits of superfast speeds, which are coming soon to areas such as
Wheldrake. Even small, quiet villages in my constituency, such as
Rufforth and Stockton-on-the-Forest, have recently had their cabinets
upgraded, yet there remain a number of small communities in my
constituency that are sadly too far from the local cabinet to benefit.

to form, Superfast North Yorkshire has been excellent at engaging with
our local rural communities, and the chief executive officer has met
Askham Bryan parish council to discuss the problems it faces and the
potential solutions. In the specific case of Askham Bryan, it is
increasingly likely that other technologies, such as fixed wireless, 4G
or satellite broadband, will need to be deployed to provide the village
with the speeds it needs and deserves. The parish council has contacted
independent wireless broadband providers, which have explained that the
technology is available to the village and is relatively simple to
implement. The lack of certainty on the future direction of the
roll-out, however, has prevented the parish council from going any
further.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010847000091" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0002.htm#14010847000091">That
point is important because the wireless broadband providers appear to
be willing to invest their time and money if there is a chance that BT

a wait for the next tranche of Government funding for phase 2. Given
the complexities of procurement, planning and the roll-out, it would be
a tremendous shame for Superfast North Yorkshire to have to kick-start

finally come to the central purpose of the debate. From the
Minister’s recent response to my question, I am aware that the

the fantastic work of Superfast North Yorkshire and its partners,

have already touched on the several strong reasons for doing so.
Take-up in north Yorkshire is well ahead of the national average, which
proves that there is latent demand for rural broadband in the region.
Superfast North Yorkshire has achieved great things across the region
and the hard work that has been put in deserves to be rewarded. It has
not let the absence of further funding hold it back, but even after
taking the initiative and securing extra money for the interim period,
it is unlikely to get beyond the summer of 2015. Finally, considering
the fantastic pace that the roll-out has gathered in north Yorkshire,
it would be an awful shame for those who have worked so hard to have to
kick-start the roll-out again in 2016 after an indefinite
pause<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T16:51:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010847000100" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0002.htm#14010847000100">To
those points, I would like to add a further call on the Government to
provide greater clarity over the future of the roll-out—I hope
the Minister can do that in his remarks—so that those
communities left behind by the digital divide can plan ahead for how
they will try to bridge it. While I welcome the additional
£10 million for broadband as part of the national
infrastructure plan announced in the recent autumn statement,
I appeal to the Government to continue to support that
hugely

start by congratulating Superfast North Yorkshire, BT and the
Government—for the cash—as we have made good progress in
a relatively short space of time. With the project now halfway through
and the target of 90% of homes having access to superfast broadband
well down the track, the problem is that some villages will achieve
only 2 megabits. They can see that that is the case and feel that they
are being left in the slow lane. A constituency such as Selby and
Ainsty faces real challenges. There are well over 100 villages. Many of
them are on the border with other local authorities, where the exchange
is across that border. Residents in villages such as Ryther, which
currently has a 365 kilobit download speed, Newton Kyme, Catterton,
Bickerton, Kirkby Overblow, Ulleskelf, Fairburn and many more have all
expressed frustration at the pace of
roll-out.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010847000109" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0002.htm#14010847000109">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T16:54:02"></hs_TimeCode>
problem appears to be the lack of a transparent plan to deliver the
committed 2 megabits to the remaining 10%. The fact that the people who
currently get the worst speeds have no visibility on when or whether
they will be upgraded gives rise to considerable concern. I understand
that Superfast North Yorkshire is about to leaflet every home in north
Yorkshire to ensure that people are aware of the need to
order the upgrade, because if they do not order it, they will not get
it. Doing so might make the last 5% highly visible.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T16:54:13"></hs_TimeCode> is now clear
which areas are at risk of not being upgraded. They are the areas with
the strongest support for the roll-out programme, because speeds are
currently the lowest. They are also the areas that would have been the
most supportive of the spending of the additional funds to upgrade the
service. They might now be realising that they could see no improvement

leads quite nicely on to my next point. One of the features of the
contract is that if take-up is high, money can be clawed back and then
used to extend the project to further cabinets. For that reason,
encouraging people to sign up for faster speeds is extremely
important<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T16:55:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010847000112" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0002.htm#14010847000112">I
take issue with something that
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T16:55:30"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for York Outer mentioned. Take-up has actually been
relatively modest. Good areas typically have 25% to 30%. I am quite
happy to be put right on that, but I am sure that take-up has been
significantly less in other areas. That may be partly due to the lack
of clarity about needing to place an order, which will
hopefully be put right, or it might be that people who already
have 10 megabits or more simply think that there is no need to upgrade
to get 40
megabits<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T16:56:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010847000113" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0002.htm#14010847000113">Finally,
the vision for this excellent project was to provide
superfast broadband for 90% and at least 2 megabits to 10% and to
revitalise rural economies. That vision generated support and
enthusiasm for the project. Just because it is hard does not mean that
we should be walking away from delivering something that was initially
so enthusiastically received. In the next of my regular communications
with Superfast North Yorkshire and BT, I hope to be given some comfort
as to how the remaining 10% will be

NYnet on the ground and a proactive council, which have been vital.
Some people have criticised the way in which we have gone about working
with local councils, rather than having a national tender, for example,
but having councils that are partners with BT has made a huge
difference, because it joins up with things such as planning to ensure
that broadband is rolled out all the more
speedily<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T17:02:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010847000121" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0002.htm#14010847000121">Despite
criticism of the programme, the results are now beginning to speak for
themselves. For example, in Rutland more than 9,000 premises have been
passed, and we expect that project to conclude by the summer; 95 more
communities in Norfolk are now accessing fibre broadband, thanks to the
programme; and in Suffolk, 90 miles of fibre cable have been laid, and 
<?notus-xml column=149?>10,000 homes and businesses are getting broadband three months ahead of

authorities are going further than our original target of 90%:
Cambridgeshire is going for 98%; Lancashire 97%; Rutland 94%; and
Wales, which has passed 100,000 premises and is now six
months ahead of schedule, 96%. By the end of 2013, with 43 out of 44
projects signed, half of them already had live coverage. Superfast
Cornwall has seen more than 194,000 premises passed by fibre and is
aiming for 95% of fibre coverage. Northern Ireland has more than 90% of

take this opportunity to pay tribute to BT and its engineers. Over the
Christmas period, all of us have seen, or experienced, the horrendous
weather that led to trouble with power lines and so on. The flooding
still afflicts a great many areas of the country. Throughout that
entire period, however, BT engineers were working to meet their
milestones. I have been told stories of engineers working with water up
to their shoulders as they were preparing to lay fibre, or working in
holes where the pumps had to be kept on permanently to keep the water
from flooding them, so that the milestones could be met. BT gets a lot
of criticism for the programme, but most of it is unwarranted. It is
worth our pausing to pay tribute to the work of the BT engineers, in
particular over this Christmas
period<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T17:04:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010847000124" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0002.htm#14010847000124">On
the core points made by my hon. Friends, I would characterise the tone
of their remarks as, “It’s going well, but could do
better.” We could do better in two or three areas, the first of
which might be the allocation of the next £250 million. It is
worth making the point that, having allocated a little more than
£500 million to reach 90% superfast broadband, the Chancellor
has allocated a further £250 million to reach 95%. We want to
get that money allocated as soon as
possible.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010847000125" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0002.htm#14010847000125">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T17:05:24"></hs_TimeCode>

my hon. Friends that my officials and I and BT were all looking at the
issue over the Christmas and new year period. We hope to make an
announcement shortly, but I know that they appreciate that we have to
get it right and ensure that the money is allocated properly and
fairly. I can be certain, however, that good partners like North
Yorkshire will, I hope, receive appropriate funding to carry on their
good
work<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T17:05:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010847000126" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0002.htm#14010847000126">Furthermore,
it is important to acknowledge, as I have already done, that there is a
difference between a fibre-enabled cabinet and people getting superfast
access. I reassure my hon. Friends that we make the distinction. They
also mentioned the concern about BT first saying that a cabinet is
commercially viable, but then saying that it is not and that it should
be part of the rural roll-out. Detailed planning is undertaken, but
circumstances 
<?notus-xml column=150?>on the ground can change, so there needs to be a degree of flexibility
and give and take. I can, however, again assure my hon. Friends that
when BT finds that a cabinet is not commercially viable and seeks to
put it into the rural programme, we do have detailed discussions.
Likewise, sometimes there are parts of the rural programme that become
commercially
viable<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T17:06:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010847000127" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0002.htm#14010847000127">As
for clawing money back from BT when take-up is higher, I assure my hon.
Friends that where the take-up of broadband exceeds the target set
under the contract, we do claw money back. That money is put back into
the programme in order to extend coverage
further<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T17:06:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010847000128" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/halltext/140108h0002.htm#14010847000128">Finally,
I assure my hon. Friends that we are also looking at the £10
million that the Chancellor has allocated to us to take superfast
broadband from 95% to 100%. That is money for test-bed experiments. It
is important to stress that, in particular in rural areas, prices rise
exponentially for that very last

of a revised version of the air navigation guidance. I am grateful for
the technical assistance  of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA)

the Transport Act 2000, the CAA is required to take account of
environmental guidance given to it by the Secretary of State when
exercising its air navigation functions. The new guidance has two key
objectives. The first is to provide the CAA with additional clarity 
<?notus-xml column=16?>on the Government’s environmental objectives relating to air
navigation in the UK, including the need to improve the efficiency of
our UK airspace network. The second is a reaffirmation of the need to
consult local communities near airports when airspace changes are being
considered in the vicinity of these airports. The guidance now reflects
significant developments such as the creation of the future airspace
strategy and single European sky, and the aviation policy
framework.</hs_Para>

this guidance has been prepared, consulted on and revised by the
Government separately from the Airports Commission’s work, it is
notable that the clarity it brings around the introduction of
performance-based navigation routes at our major airports and the need
for greater delegation of decision-making powers over airspace changes
to the CAA are in line with the findings of the commission’s
recently published interim report. The Government’s full
response to the report will follow in the spring. In the meantime, this

</I>As I announced in my written ministerial statement of 19
November 2013, <I>Official Report</I>, column 43WS, 'Student Support in
England', we have taken action to deal with those providers who have
undertaken aggressive recruitment in 2013/14. Higher national

qualifications but, in order to manage their growth, my officials have
written to the 23 alternative providers that are expanding most rapidly
to instruct them to recruit no more HNC/HND students for 2013/14. It is
too early to make reliable estimates of the savings that will result.
The 
<?notus-xml column=233?>suspensions applied to the 23 alternative providers are temporary. They
will remain in place until we apply full time student number controls
to alternative providers in 2014/15. From 2015/16, we will allow
student numbers at high quality alternative providers to be freed in a
similar manner as for HEFCE-funded provision, but we will continue to

current Legacy benefits (including employment and support allowance and
job seeker's allowance). The maximum recovery period is normally 12
weeks, but claimants may request a shorter recovery period if they
wish. Deductions start from the second full benefit payment.
Negotiating the amount of the weekly deduction and length of the
recovery period is part of the STBA award process and agreement of the
terms and conditions are necessary before an advance is paid. STBAs are
advances of benefit and not loans therefore no interest or charges are
applied.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010859000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140108/text/140108w0001.htm#14010859000031">The
recovery period for universal credit (new claim) and (change of
circumstances) advances is six months and for budgeting advances 12
months, starting from the next payment of universal credit after
receipt of the advance. The rate of recovery for an advance is
calculated by dividing the amount of benefit advanced by the number of
months it is to be recovered over. This results in equal monthly
repayment amounts which are deducted from the claimant's monthly
universal credit award. universal credit advances are advances of

situation in Gaza, caused in part by restrictions on movement and
access for goods and people. Recent fuel deliveries from Turkey and
Qatar have helped to mitigate the situation in the short term, but the
energy supply is still inadequate and many families are experiencing
long blackouts each day. Reports from our partners indicate that the
emergency response mechanisms are currently working adequately, but
concerns remain over the need to replenish stocks and longer-term

current research using PNT in macaques has yet to be shown to be
successful. From unpublished data it appears that macaque zygotes
(one-cell fertilised egg) do not survive the PNT process well, but
published evidence suggests that there may be important differences
between human and macaque eggs and early embryos and that the macaque
may not be a sufficiently good model for the
