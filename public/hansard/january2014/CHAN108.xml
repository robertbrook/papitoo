particular point of going to visit Christian communities in order to
highlight their concerns and to ensure that the Governments in many of
those countries know we care about those concerns. I had a very good
visit with the Coptic community in Egypt the week before Christmas and,
as I said in my answer, I have just been to see the Christian community
in Algeria during my visit there. I will continue to do that and also
to examine with the Churches, and in particular with people such as the

Pakistan’s joining the GSP will drive better governance, as it
grants vulnerable countries duty-free access to the EU on two thirds of
tariff lines if they implement 27 international conventions on human
rights, labour standards, sustainable development and good governance.
That is good news for Pakistan and for the EU. Pakistan stands to gain
an estimated $500 million and 1 million new jobs from this agreement.
It is a sign of a deeper and more effective relationship that benefits
both our two countries, given that the UK was at the lead on
it.</hs_Para>

must stress that a huge amount of work remains to be done to arrive at
a comprehensive settlement of the nuclear issue. It will be formidably
difficult to do so, but it must remain the main priority. It is too
early to say whether that will be accompanied by wider changes in the

Friend the Member for Newbury (Richard Benyon). This is an important
negotiating success. It shows that decision making can be decentralised
away from Brussels, producing at the same time a more sustainable and
successful policy overall. That decentralisation and the greater
accountability to national Parliaments are important aspects of the
changes we want to see in the European Union, as the Prime Minister set

Union if this is done on a more decentralised basis. It is not about

Scotland, and we have done so very energetically in recent decisions.
Indeed, it is intended that a great deal of the benefit of the changes
in the common fisheries policy will be felt by Scotland. The United

do so more successfully than would a separate Scotland, which would in
any case be outside the European Union.</hs_Para>

the case of Huber Ballesteros, who will face trial in a number of

Simmonds:</Member></B> The hon. Lady raises a very important issue.
Significant discussions have been taking place and will continue to
take place. We support the Democratic Republic of the Congo through our
significant bilateral aid programme, as well as by supporting
multilateral institutions. The progress made by the UN mission and the
Secretary-General’s special representative to negate the
influence of the M23, which has now completely surrendered, and to
tackle other armed militia groups in the eastern part of the DRC, is a
key cornerstone to creating stability and security, which will then
lead to developmental assistance.</hs_Para>

shadow Foreign Secretary, this country has a huge consular
network—one of the biggest of any country in the world. We look
after British nationals wherever they are overseas, and there is no way
that a Scotland separate from the UK could compete with that network.

the 179th ambassador arriving in town, which could not compete with the

August 2006, Luke Molnar, the 17-year-old son of my constituents Gill
and Steve Molnar, died on the island of Tokoriki. Luke was a paying
volunteer on a diving expedition arranged by a UK-based company, Coral
Cay Conservation Ltd. On the day of his death, he went to assist a
friend who had received an electric shock when he touched a washing
line. When Luke touched the line, he received a massive electric shock,
which killed him. It transpired that a local electrician had wired the
washing line to the electricity supply in order to run power to a
number of huts that were being used as accommodation for the
volunteers.</hs_Para>

coroner’s inquest held in Manchester in 2011 returned a verdict
of unlawful killing and the electrician was convicted of manslaughter
by a court in Fiji, but no proceedings have been taken against Coral
Cay or its then directors. The company has since been taken over and is
under new ownership. Luke was a fine diver and he was well aware of the
risks involved in such an activity. He and his parents undertook very
careful research into the expedition and the facilities that would be
available before he embarked on the trip, but the coroner’s
inquest exposed a total lack of care for health and safety by the then
management of Coral Cay. Claims on the company’s website of high
standards and qualified personnel on site—claims that were
relied on by the Molnars—turned out to be entirely
false.</hs_Para>

death is not the only instance in recent years of young people, often

The inquest into the death of 17-year-old Samuel Boon, who died on a
trekking holiday in Morocco, concluded just last week. In a number of
cases, including Luke’s, coroners have highlighted a series of
concerns, including a lack of regulation and suitably qualified
expedition leaders with good local knowledge. Parents and families
place great trust in the UK-owned companies that provide and manage
such expeditions, yet they are being denied genuine assurance that
proper quality standards are being

course, in the case of UK activities, a much more stringent regulatory
environment has existed for a number of years, following the
establishment of the Adventure Activities Licensing Authority as a
result of the Lyme bay tragedy, in which four teenagers died. However,
the future of the AALA is now worryingly uncertain, and although other
excellent quality standards exist, including the Learning Outside the
Classroom badge and British standard 8848, today parents face a
bewildering landscape 
<?notus-xml column=158?>of standards, accreditation processes and inspection regimes, on which

its credit, the industry has been anxious to address these concerns,
and I want to place on record my thanks to the many groups and
individuals who have spent time talking to me about the different
regimes that exist and explaining their different features and
benefits. I would particularly like to thank members of the British
Standards Institution committee SVS/2/5 on adventurous activities,
expeditions, visits and fieldwork, which has been conducting a review
of British standard 8848; Beth Gardner of the Council for Learning
Outside the Classroom; and Alistair Cole of the Expedition Providers
Association, who is also chief executive of the Lifesigns group, the
new owners of Coral Cay. All those bodies are acutely aware of the
vital need for public reassurance and confidence that the activities
they are offer are safe.</hs_Para>

work done to establish high-quality standards, but the fact is that it
remains entirely possible for a completely unqualified, inexperienced
provider to offer overseas adventure activities without having to
comply with any safety standards at all. No parent could possibly be
willing to allow their child to participate in activities that have not
met the most rigorous safety standards. Every parent would want to
assure themselves that adequate safety procedures existed and that
proper checks and controls were routinely carried out. Parents would be
especially reassured where a provider had been accredited to an
independent standard. They would want to know what the standard
encompassed and whether an organisation that claimed to meet it had
been independently assessed.</hs_Para>

parents know that today? Given the range of accreditation processes and
standards, it would be difficult and chancy, even for the most clued-up
and careful parents, as the experience of the Molnars shows. That is
why I have been discussing with industry leaders the idea of providing
a register of accredited providers, which would clearly set out what
standard a provider had complied with, whether it had been
independently accredited as meeting that standard or whether it had
self-assessed. My motion proposes a Bill to introduce the establishment
of such a
register.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012168000194" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0001.htm#14012168000194">There
are those who will say that conformity assessment schemes can restrict
innovation and competition, and that the very essence of the activities
I am talking about is that they contain a degree of risk, which is, of
course, indeed the case. But no parent would consider a single
avoidable risk a price worth paying, and I am pleased that many of
those I have spoken to in the industry now recognise the value of a
register of accredited providers to reassure parents that avoidable
risks have been properly addressed. To be clear, this modest proposal
is not for mandatory accreditation, but for a publicly available record
of who is or is not accredited. The transparency of such a register
would create an impetus and expectation that good providers would be
accredited and bad providers driven out of business.</hs_Para>

register would not, of course, eliminate every risk, but it would be an
important step that could help to prevent another family from
experiencing the horror faced by the Molnars in 2006. Gill and Steve
have been brave, passionate and committed campaigners, and they are
here closely watching this debate. They strongly  
<?notus-xml column=159?>support the creation of such a register, so that some small good might
come from Luke’s tragic death. I commend the motion to the

people—often young people; often women, including working
mums—who are finding it particularly hard to obtain other work.
When a pub closes, its local economy loses about £80,000. More
widely, the production and

and right. In the last decade, our expectations of our locals have
changed, and consumers now rank food higher than beer or sociability
among their reasons for choosing a pub. As I know there is so much

are many aspects to the debate on the future of our pubs, but this
debate is about the pub companies. I will therefore resist his offer to
get drawn into what the shadow Chancellor should propose to do about
the taxation of the Scottish whisky industry. However, my hon. Friend
rightly identifies whisky as an important product for our pubs, for our

and again. Given the economic difficulties and the difference between
on-trade and off-trade alcohol, people understand that there are going
to be difficult times for pubs. They will also recognise that some
people are not suited to running a pub and, for whatever reason, are
unable to make a decent fist of it. What sticks in the craw of most
fair-minded people, however, is that the majority of those who take on
major pubco tenancies end up earning under £10,000 a year. It is
not a case of a few people doing very well, a reasonable number making
a decent living and a small number failing; we are seeing the majority
failing. Under the existing perverse disincentives, regardless of
whether the pub does well or badly, the pub company does all
right, and many people say that even when their trade grew they got hit
with higher rents or higher prices that took away all the increased
revenue they had generated. It is clear that there is a desperate

that voluntary regulation had failed and we voted

suddenly announced that there would be an investigation into the
success of self-regulation. A day before the Opposition day debate in
2013, the Government finally announced that they would consult on
introducing a code to deliver a fairer balance between pub companies
and their tenants. The response to the consultation was overwhelming:
over 7,000 people responded, 96% were in favour of regulation, 67% were

their business, and more than nine in 10 saying they would take a

therefore a little odd for the Government to say, as they do in their
amendment, that they want to take more time to learn from the
consultation. They chose the questions to ask and they got a big
response. On almost all the big questions, the level of support was so
overwhelming that even Robert Mugabe would have thought it was a bit
one-sided, yet the Government then commissioned a report from London
Economics, which critics felt was deeply flawed, apparently to try to
persuade themselves against the view they appeared to have taken before
their consultation. Nothing could more clearly demonstrate the failure
of the big pub companies than the desire to leave them on the part of
the very people they consider to be their business partners. But for

our communities, earn less

own Chesterfield pubs survey mirrored many of those encouraging
statistics, but also sounded a deadly warning about the cost of
inaction, with many pubs saying that they were on the brink of closure

the British Beer &amp; Pub Association claimed that tied
tenants’ pubs were cheaper, but that is far removed from the
reality that people see in their community. At The Nags Head in Dunston
in Chesterfield, I dealt with a Marston’s tenant who was
competing with Marston’s managed houses just across the road
that were selling the same product at up to £1 a pint less. The
big pub companies and the BBPA will tell us, “Yes, there is the
odd problem, but it is not typical.” They say, “You
can’t offer general criticisms. We need to know about specific
cases.” However, when we bring them specific cases they say,
“Well, that’s just a one-off.” It seems that no
evidence is good enough for them to recognise the reality of what
people are seeing in their pubs. The BBPA and the pub companies are
saying, “Mainly its just people who have failed in their
businesses wanting to blame someone else.” I do not think that

principles should have no fear. What the pubcos are defending is an
old- fashioned closed shop, whereas what we are proposing is a

central issue in the debate is not about the principles, which we have
debated before and on which there is a lot of common ground, but,
“Why the delay? Why have the Government not given a formal
response?” Let me explain the point. We received a big response
to the consultation, which, let us remember, was the first Government
consultation on a specific set of proposals in the long period, under
both Governments, during which the issue has been considered by the
Select Committee and others. We had a formal consultation, to which
there was a massive response. We received about 9,000 responses, more
than 1,000 of which were very specific—they were often written
communications with nuanced arguments, which we must try to address. We
are trying to look at the evidence in an objective way. The evidence
may well point in one direction, but there are competing studies; the
London Economics survey has been mentioned, but another good study has
been done by the Federation of Small Businesses. Such studies do give
different arguments, which we must evaluate.</hs_Para>

remember that the industry is a complex one, and it was not a simple
“yes or no” issue. The consultation also covered a set of
other issues, including flow monitoring, guest beer and the gaming tie,
each of which must be examined properly, not to mention its open
question, which was about the mandatory free-of-tie option and open
market rent review. Everybody concerned with the matter knows that that
is the core issue, on which, although there was a strong opinion, there
was less unanimity. We must respond to those issues and try to come
forward with a proposal that carries the House and as many of the
stakeholders as possible. I am very conscious of the legislative
timetable, and I can assure the hon. Gentleman that there is no attempt

issues with the regulation. Some incumbents, understandably, want their
industry regulated, but we need to balance that against the fact that
new companies coming into the industry might be less enthusiastic

me move on. As I said, we have had four Select Committee investigations
into whether the tied model is at the root of the unfairness in the
relationship. We have received an enormous amount of correspondence,
quite apart from that received from the various action groups, from
tenants about problems in their relationships with pub companies and
from MPs. The response I have had in the past 10 to 15 minutes shows
how widespread such concerns
are.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012170000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0001.htm#14012170000032">Although
pub-owning companies can and sometimes do treat their tenants well, the
overall sense from those representations is that the tie arrangements
with the pub-owning companies are unfair and that a lack of
transparency causes a severe imbalance of negotiating power. That is
the essence of the problem. There is an issue about what exactly we
should do about it, which is what we are consulting on, but there is no
doubt about the
problems.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012170000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0001.htm#14012170000033">It
has also been very clear from the discussions led by the Select
Committee over the years that the problem is not so much the tied
business model but the unfairness with which it operates. There is
quite a lot of debate about the evidence on the speed of closures and
how they operate in the tied sector and the non-tied sector. My
understanding is that there has been a fairly steady rate of decline,
from some 70,000 pubs in 1980 to 50,000 today. Depressingly, that is
something in the order of 18 a week net. That decline has continued
even after some of the big changes that have taken place in the
industry—from the beer orders to pub company consolidation. I
know that there is a debate among campaigners about whether tied pubs
are more likely to close than pubs that are free of tie, but the
evidence I have seen goes both ways. This is not fundamentally an
argument about pub closures; it is essentially about the unfairness of
and inequalities in the
relationship.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012170000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0001.htm#14012170000034"><Member ContinuationText="Duncan Hames" PimsId="5543" UID="14012170000118" xid="1042" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0001.htm#14012170000118"><B>Duncan

choice. Otherwise, the competition authorities would have been engaged

microbreweries has increased over the period for

business model that can be used and it has been around in various forms

that suggests that 57% of tied tenants earn less than £10,000 a
year. If we apply that to 35-hour week, 48 weeks a year, we are talking
about less than £6 an hour, which means that people are working
for considerably less than the minimum wage. Since many work much
longer hours, that means that this is a very low-paid industry. Many
publicans are struggling. In contrast, only 25% of those who are free
of tie are on at the same income level. There is a striking disparity,
which is at the heart of the
question.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012170000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0001.htm#14012170000043"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Bellingham" PimsId="3945" UID="14012170000124" xid="40" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0001.htm#14012170000124">Mr

Let me briefly reveal the history, as we have been talking about it
implicitly throughout these exchanges. We announced last January that
it was time for the Government to step in and the consultation was
launched along the lines envisaged by the Select Committee on a
statutory code of practice and an independent adjudicator. That was the
framework of the Government recommendation. We included an open
question on the 
<?notus-xml column=176?>mandatory free-of-tie option with open rent review and we tried to
underpin a specific intervention with a framework, a philosophy, a set
of principles, the overarching fair-dealing provision and the core

tenant.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012170000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0001.htm#14012170000045"><Member ContinuationText="Julie Hilling" PimsId="5581" UID="14012170000126" xid="1017" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0001.htm#14012170000126"><B>Julie

as well—there has been unanimity across the House of Commons on
what measures need to be taken. I pay particular tribute to my hon.
Friend the Member for Chesterfield (Toby Perkins), the hon. Member for
Leeds North West (Greg Mulholland) and, although he is not here, the
hon. Member for Northampton South (Mr Binley), and many others too,
right across the political spectrum, who regard this as a very serious
and important issue. There have been two unanimous votes in the House
of Commons on this, although on the second one it took 24 hours before
the Secretary of State decided that he agreed with the House of
Commons, and he came along and gave us great assurances of what would
happen.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012170000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0002.htm#14012170000055">There
have been four Select Committee reports, more or less all arguing for
the same course of action. Enormous numbers of people from our
constituencies—I think of Mr Phil Jones who owns the Open Hearth
in Griffithstown in my constituency—have written to us about the
iniquities of the system. A large number of organisations support the
basis of the Opposition motion, including the GMB, CAMRA and the
Federation of Small Businesses—a whole host of them. The essence
of it is that they all say—I understand that the Secretary of
State agrees with this—that first of all there should be a
statutory code of practice; secondly, a mandatory rent-only option for
pubcos that own more than 500 pubs; thirdly, an open market rent
review; and finally, an independent adjudicator. All those are meant to
enhance the significance and importance of the role of pubs in our
communities.

pubs. But the essence of my contribution is not what has been said and
will be said, but why we have had a delay, which strikes at the heart

allow them to make up their mind. If we were at the beginning of a
parliamentary Session, that would not be too bad, but we are not. We
are 15 months away from a general election. We are possibly
just months away from a Queen’s Speech. When my hon. Friend the

note a couple of other ways in which the pub trade is being

community rights. The community right to bid gives communities a fairer
chance to bid to take over pubs, but there is an issue connected to
this that I recently came across in my constituency. Residents were
shocked to discover, at the very latest hour, that the Beehive in
Sprowston had changed hands from regional brewery and pub company
Greene King to the East of England Co-operative Society’s retail
arm. I am the kind of MP who runs 
<?notus-xml column=182?>surgeries in pubs—I run a series called Politics in the
Pub—and I am sad to report that I had never made it to the
Beehive when this news broke. Now I may never have the chance to have a

6 January, the Co-op confirmed to the <I>Norwich Evening News</I> that
it had exchanged contracts on the Beehive and would announce plans for
a new community food store in the near future. Local residents then
quickly organised and held public meetings, and local councillors and I
met residents to go through the options for using the community right
to bid. In this case, however, it was too late because information
about the sale emerged at a very late stage. I have asked the
Co-op to provide information about its plans so that it can
engage with the community at an early stage. Understandably, the
community is concerned not only about the closure and loss of a pub but
the potential effect of a supermarket on other local businesses, as
well any intrusive aspects of the new premises that might arise from
parking, lighting or similar things.</hs_Para>

experience that the Co-op’s retail arm is extremely keen to work
with local communities, and I urge it to do so in this case so that the
necessary issues can be properly addressed, despite the fact that
planning permission is not required for a change of use from
A4—which, as Members will know, is for pubs—to A1 for
supermarkets. That feature of the planning system involves a very easy
switch, which sometimes means that communities are not consulted on the
concerns that can accrue when a pub

urge the Minister to look at this set of issues as it connects to pub
companies. This is not only about the relationship between a tenant and
their proprietor but the relationship of a pub to its community and the
relationships that ought to be examined in the planning
system—in other words, what citizens ought to be able to expect
in a well-planned local area. These issues come down to wanting to keep
the economy moving. I do not say that there should be stasis throughout
the whole planning system, but there should be sufficient safeguards

first, the overwhelming desire to get the industry into a position
where it would regulate itself; and secondly, the need to ensure
unanimity across all political parties on the measures to be proposed.
Successive reports said what needed to be done, what
progress—often very little—had been made, and what would
happen to the industry if it did not regulate itself. It has been said
in this debate—indeed, it is mentioned in the
amendment—that the previous Government did not do anything, as
if that is some sort of justification for this Government not doing
something. In the conclusion to its 2010 report, the Committee, under
the chairmanship of the hon. Member for Mid Worcestershire (Sir Peter
Luff),
said:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="14012184002235" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0002.htm#14012184002235">“The
industry must be aware that this is its last opportunity for
self-regulated reform. If it cannot deliver this time, then government
intervention will be necessary. We do not advocate such intervention at
this stage, but remain committed to a resolution to all the problems
discussed in this Report and those of the 2004 and 2009 Reports. Should
those problems persist beyond June 2011, we will not hesitate to
recommend that legislation to provide statutory regulation be
introduced.”</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="14012184000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0002.htm#14012184000012">Significantly,
it was never intended that there should be statutory regulation until
all other procedures had been exhausted in 2011. The previous
Government committed themselves to that course of action, as did the
current Secretary of State when he came into office. Yet still, after
all these years, we have not had statutory regulation despite the
overwhelming body of evidence that clearly demonstrates that the
industry was not prepared to regulate itself. I give credit to my
colleague on the Committee, the hon. Member for Northampton South (Mr
Binley), whom I think would have vigorously expounded similar views
today but had an unavoidable commitment and was therefore unable to be
here. I emphasise that successive Committees have tried to secure a
consensus across the board on this.</hs_Para>

Members, I was delighted when the Secretary of State changed his
position and agreed to have a Government consultation. That took place
in the early part of last year, and the Government have had the results
since June. Again, there is an increasing sense of exasperation as to
why those results have not been published. All right, it was the
Government’s own consultation, but as my right hon. Friend the
Member for Torfaen (Paul Murphy) said, the Secretary of State has the
people to analyse it, and there appears to be no coherent logic as to
why it has been delayed for so long. When the consultation was
published, the Committee was asked whether it would have a session
looking at it, as though it were the Committee’s job to analyse
it. We refused in somewhat robust manner.</hs_Para>

the Government credit for one thing—they are perhaps the one
organisation to have made the British Beer and Pub Association’s
speed of operation look positively dynamic. I can think of no reason
whatever why they could not have introduced legislation soon after the

different in the consultation from the evidence unearthed by Select
Committees or the points made in debates in the Chamber. The Groceries
Code Adjudicator Act 2013 could provide a model for 
<?notus-xml column=184?>that legislation. Although there might be different opinions on
different recommendations in the Select Committee report, it would have
been appropriate to put those recommendations in legislation and have a

is happening and why parliamentarians support the pubs in their
constituencies in debate after debate but do not seem prepared to vote
to bring forward legislation to do something about the situation. I

welcome the Government’s support for the licensed trade, such as
the scrapping of the beer duty escalator, the 1p of tax taken off a
pint, the extension of small business rate relief and the community
right to bid. It is worth remembering that the pub trade’s
problems predate the beer duty escalator and exist in both tied houses
and 
<?notus-xml column=185?>free houses. Top of the list is the declining propensity of men to visit
a pub after work multiple times a week to drink reasonably large
quantities of draft beer, which is a high gross margin product. The
second, related, problem is the wide price gap between the on-trade and
off-trade in alcohol sales, which has coincided with the arrival of
affordable, decent quality new world wine. There are a whole range of
other factors, many of which we would welcome in themselves but have
had adverse consequences for the pub trade. I refer to things such as
the smoking ban, radically different attitudes to drink-driving and
changes in people’s living rooms, such as having big-screen TVs
at home, not just at the pub. There is also intense price competition
in food and leisure in
general.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012184000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0002.htm#14012184000020">When
I used to work for an integrated brewer—I worked for Greene King
for a couple of years—the cost pressures that licensees used to
talk about included the massive price of Sky, which my hon. Friend the

national minimum wage and the cost of products through the
tie.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012184000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0002.htm#14012184000021">We
could argue that pub owners take too much money from publicans, but to
mention only the tie is to chase the wrong target. People have two key
objections to it: the impact on product range, and the way the product
is priced. On the first point, we must remember that the tie is not the
same for every pub. For some, particularly food-led pubs, it excludes
wine and spirits, for example, which can be bought from outside. For
others, even a tied house, there may be provision for a guest beer or
for what is sometimes called a “local hero”, which means
that a pub owner in an area where there is one dominant beer brand
might be allowed to have that brand, even though it is a director
competitor.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012184000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0002.htm#14012184000022">A
lot of the focus has been on whether licensees have the right to buy in
a guest ale of their choosing. The hon. Member for Chesterfield
mentioned the 160,000 members of CAMRA, and a lot of other people are
also real ale lovers. I am proud to count myself among their ranks. I
am proud of real ale—it is a uniquely British product that is
not found anywhere else in the world, and I am proud to bits that it is
growing. It is a craft product, and we should support it. I would love
the Triple fff brewery in Four Marks, in my constituency, to have more
outlets for its beer, which people would enjoy drinking. A guest ale
option is positive for the increase of the brewery industry. However,
we must be clear that it is a red herring for the survival of most
pubs. Real ale is a small category in most pubs, and four out of 10 do
not stock it at all. The drinks that matter in most pubs are standard
lager, bag-in-box Coke and the others that generate the bulk of
revenue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012184000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0002.htm#14012184000023">The
second set of objections to the tie are about pricing, which goes to
the heart of pubs’ profitability. Sometimes when we discuss the
matter—it happened in the last debate in the House—we
speak as though, if we could remove the tie and the inflated beer
prices from the equation, everything else would stay the same. Of
course, that is not what would happen at all. The target margin for
pubs is set by starting with a target return. There is an asset on the
books with a certain value, and it is believed that the shareholders
and the market require a certain return to be demonstrated on it. That
return is split between rent and margin, the latter sometimes 
<?notus-xml column=186?>being known in the trade as “wet rent” for that reason. If
the return was all on rents, the rent would clearly be higher and pubs
would be more operationally geared, with a higher fixed cost. Arguably,
more businesses might
fail.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012184000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0002.htm#14012184000024"><Member ContinuationText="Greg Mulholland" PimsId="4826" UID="14012184002330" xid="861" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0002.htm#14012184002330"><B>Greg
Mulholland</B>:</Member> With respect, although my hon. Friend speaks
from a position of knowledge, I think he is missing the point. The
whole point of the benchmark level of the market rent-only
option—the Select Committee’s solution—is to stop
the double overcharging that currently happens. The large pub companies
have skewed the traditional tie so that there is no longer a lower rent
if there are higher beer prices. The benchmarking survey by the
Association of Licensed Multiple Retailers shows that tied rents are
higher, on average, than free-of-tie rents, which is an abuse of the
tied

Hinds:</Member></B> I have a lot of sympathy with that view and it is
legitimate. We must not forget, however, that the owner of the pub also
has an interest in that business thriving, and it must be an
arrangement both sides are happy with. In one sense, the tie is just a
way of sharing risk. It is a way of having rent that goes up when
business is good, and down when business goes down. If we want to
complain about how much money pub owners take from licensees, that is
perfectly reasonable, but it is misleading to speak only about the tie
and to say that if that went, all those problems would disappear. I do
not believe they would.</hs_Para>

single most important thing for regulation is to ensure the
availability of proper financial and legal advice for new licensees.
That must include someone giving advice who is able to understand and
challenge what the pub company puts forward. It is called
FMT—fair maintainable trade—and involves an estimate of
what the pub can make, on which the rent and target return is based. If
the licensee enters that arrangement with their eyes fully open, it is
a commercial decision. Pub companies tell us that things are getting
better and that pre-entry training, consultation and so on has
improved, but it is difficult to tell that from the outside—I
know the Select Committee has had more opportunity to look at that in
detail.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012184000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0002.htm#14012184000029">Overall,
we want more of a partnership approach between the owner of the pub and
the licensee, and in the industry at its best that is of course what
happens. For a long time, pulling pints has not been enough to survive
and thrive in the licence trade. Such businesses are increasingly food
driven, and they are trying to attract a wider range of
customers while having to compete against managed houses that have
different cost structures. There can be big advantages to being part of
a wider group, 
<?notus-xml column=187?>such as consultancy and guidance on the development
of the food business and menus. For some, there are other streams of
business such as accommodation and retail opportunities,
or—critically—improving purchasing programmes to improve
margins.</hs_Para>

that as the industry evolves, the old tied model becomes less
appropriate as more business goes to food and other products, and a
franchising-type model may become more appropriate. It is
arguably easier to do that and provide a full range of
services if there are managed houses, as well as tenancies or leases.
It is not for the Government to force such things through, but
competition authorities can ensure there is sufficient space in the
marketplace for operators who would provide a different model to
licensees. The other crucial thing the Government can do to ensure that
pub companies are fully mentally invested in long-term pub operations,
rather than having an asset register of real estate, is make it harder
to convert to residential property. If someone knows that the way they
will make money out of a certain asset is by trading it well as a pub
or a place where people come together to eat and drink, their minds
will be focused on doing that more and more.</hs_Para>

communities want to take over a pub, but that does not work out with
the pub company and so on, I would like the Government to review
continually the way the community right to bid works. We have a number
of such instances in my constituency, and there is a great team working
on the Anchor in Ropley. People are giving up a lot of time and putting
in their expertise. That seems quite hard on occasion, and I hope the
Government will keep that under review to ensure the process is as
simple as
possible.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012184000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0002.htm#14012184000032">In
conclusion, we should beware of solutions, such as removing the tie,
that appear to solve a lot of problems. Let us think back to the beer
orders, and those who thought it was a great idea at the
time in terms of breaking the vertical integration hold of brewers on
individual pubs. I wonder what some of those people think about
that
now.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-21?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_21_PT_1/2E617C6AB17AA48C4250E2705866AE97CA46E5D2" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="21 January 2014">Tuesday

Barry Sheerman</B> (Huddersfield) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> It comes almost
as a surprise to me to speak in this debate. First, I am a member of
the Methodist Church and we have a long tradition of not being very
keen on drinking, although we have modernised a bit since those days.
As I said in an intervention, I also own a pub as chairman of the John
Clare Trust, because we bought the Exeter Arms in Helpston. It is
temporarily closed while we finance what we call an omni-hub in the
village, which will meet the needs of the local community and the
overall educational purposes of the trust. A journalist said to me the
other week, “You must be the only MP who owns both a church and
a pub.” Funnily enough, the church in Norwood Green in Halifax,
where we have an environmental body, has a strict codicil that states
we cannot serve alcohol. It is an interesting world we live
in.</hs_Para>

that in a partisan way because there is so much agreement about the
need for action. I shall support it not only because the Whips will

there is a majority in this House for action on the situation of the
many people in tied houses. When we took over the Exeter Arms, having 
<?notus-xml column=188?>negotiated a reasonable price with Enterprise Inns, there had been a
succession of tenants who just could not make it work while having to
pay premium prices for beer and everything else. They had to
pay if they introduced new varieties of food and for all the gaming
machines—I did not realise the tie could take a lot of that as
well. Many people had found it very difficult to make a go of that pub,

Sheerman:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right and I was
about to make point. Let us look at the history. I have been in the
House quite a long time and I remember what seemed to be a dramatic
change when Lord Young of Graffham, then Secretary of State for Trade
and Industry, cut up the industry, and the link between brewers that
cared about their pubs and the pub estate was broken. That was done
perhaps with the best intentions, but the unintended consequence was
that people who had a tradition of brewing and who loved beer and their
pub outlets were cut out of that relationship. The Conservative
Government at that time—I am not being too rancorous about
this—created unintended consequences that severely damaged
brewing and the pubs of this country.</hs_Para>

Mulholland:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman is right to say that that

organisations—particularly CAMRA at the time—said that

Sheerman:</Member></B> I agree, but we cannot get away from the fact
that, as I see it, the whole brewing industry and the pub estates have
been taken over by money men and women who are interested mainly in the
return they can get on the estate and do not have a real love of the
sector, brewing, beer and the leisure industry generally. I get the
impression that the people who own most of the pubs in our country are
not those who love the sector, and they are out to screw as much money
and profit from it as they can. Some of them, because they made unwise
takeover investments at a particular time, have become very ruthless

hon. Member for East Hampshire (Damian Hinds) made a very good speech,
but one thing I feel strongly about as a long-term campaigner against
smoking is the myth that banning smoking in pubs damaged trade. I do

<?notus-xml column=189?>people could not belong to a political society or trade union. The only
place they could meet—it was a secret society—was in
pubs. People still go to many of the pubs that the Luddites conspired
in, which is a lovely bit of history. The Exeter Arms in Helpston is
the pub where John Clare played the fiddle—he was taught by
Gypsies—and sang with his father, who was also a farm labourer.
That is the wonderful history of Helpston. John Clare also worked as

is history, but the industry, like any other, must be up to date. Many
people stopped going to pubs because they did not keep up to date. The
hon. Member for East Hampshire mentioned men going home from work and
drinking a lot of beer every night. That has gone. The pub trade should
keep up by providing good food and a good selection of drinks—I
drink wine, but not much beer. Pubs should have well trained people
serving. The skills training in the pub trade is very poor. I care very
much about high-quality skills in every sector, but there is
too little high-quality training of pub staff. I have found
that there is very little training in pub management. Many who have a
go at running a pub have never been trained to manage anything, which
is a recipe for disaster. We need an industry with training at its core
and with 21st century
skills.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012184000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0002.htm#14012184000042">We
also need a diverse community of pubs. One of the first social
enterprises I started as a young councillor was a folk club for young
people in a Welsh village. Pubs playing the relevant music for the area
are an amazing draw. People go to pubs to have fun and a good time. If
they cannot have fun and a good time in a pub, what is its purpose? A
good time means different things for different parts of the community.
The pubs mentioned by the hon. Member for East Hampshire reminded me of
Roger Davies, a well known singer-songwriter from Brighouse in West

The landlord leans in and says, “Don’t eat the
pie.” I am sorry that my hon. Friend the Member for Rochdale

too often the image of the pub. I love CAMRA and my local CAMRA
organisation, but it sometimes puts people off. There is sometimes a
stand-off in CAMRA pubs. There are only men, many wearing beards and
dressed in a particular way. They sometimes make going to the pub a

my own constituency, I am delighted to have seen creditable examples of
communities coming together to fight for change, but often that has
happened in opposition to the tied system, not because of it. I have
been hugely impressed by a group from the village of Minera. Faced with
a pub that had closed, local people came together, raised the money and
reopened a much-loved pub that is now a welcoming hub within that
beautiful mountainous community. Tyn y Capel pub is an excellent
example of a truly community-owned and run pub. Local people have
bought shares and are managing the enterprise, but financially, for all
their success in the community, it is touch and go. It is not possible
to run the pub full time; still less is it possible to have full-time
paid staff—much of the time, it is staffed by volunteers, with
only a temporary residue of paid staff.</hs_Para>

they reduce their prices so that more pubs survive. It makes sense.

the Government act and stop delaying on a promise that they made this

This is not just about beer drinkers facing higher prices and poorer
choice, or even about people losing their local; it is about fairness
for current pub owners and future jobs in our communities. The
Government made us a promise. Indeed, some of us can remember that
before the Secretary of State became a Minister, he was often referred
to—sometimes affectionately, sometimes not—as Saint
Vince. Today Saint Vince has a chance to redeem himself, for it is high
time that he and the Government delivered on the promise they made and

has been said about the value of pubs to communities. They are not only
places where people drink; they are places where they eat and meet.
Many golf societies, darts clubs and pool tournaments are hosted by
pubs, and they are of great value to local communities in rural areas
especially. Pubs also raise a lot of money for charities. Just this
Saturday gone, I had the honour of presenting three cheques totalling
almost £4,000 to local charities, and that picture is replicated
across the country.</hs_Para>

have concerns. We are seeing many pubs closing, as has been said, and
many landlords getting by on very little money. Their profits have been
squeezed by the business model under which many of them are operating.
There are no easy answers to the problem. As I said in an intervention,
I held an Adjournment debate on this issue in the last Parliament,
during which there were other such debates. The then Government were
accused of not responding to a report that came out in that Parliament.
I do not seek to make a party political point about that; I merely
suggest that it is fairly unusual for the House to be almost in total
agreement when discussing a problem, as it is today, yet for us all to
be struggling to come up with a solution that will actually
work.</hs_Para>

mentioned, the idea was tried with the beer orders in 1989, when
breweries were barred from holding more than a certain number of pubs.
That gave birth to the pubcos that we now see, which then bought pubs

now trying to recoup that money, in some cases quite
desperately.</hs_Para>

not make matters worse. There are some benefits to the existing
situation—I will come to the weaknesses in a minute. For
example, a pubco can allow people who do not have a great deal of
capital to enter the trade. They might be unable to afford to spend
£300,000, £400,000 or £500,000 on buying a pub
outright or to borrow that money. They also get their accommodation

the rent if there were no tie. I am not speaking against reassessing

it with? If we are looking beyond pubs, we might look to
McDonald’s, for example, or other franchise organisations. Is
that a direct comparison? I am not quite sure how the proposal would
work in detail—and of course, the devil is always in the detail.
What about the repairing side of the lease? Will people with a fixed
market rent be required to do more repairing of the fabric of the
building than they are now? I am not throwing those questions out as

Perkins:</Member></B> I am happy to help the hon. Gentleman on that.
The valuation would be done with transparency against the performance
of other pubs. We need much greater transparency in the industry. Under
the specific proposals that we have made today, the publican would be
able to decide, knowing what a fair market rent was, whether they
wanted to throw their lot in with the pub company, on the offer being
made, or to opt out and buy their beer from wherever they chose. I hope
that has answered his questions.</hs_Para>

Mulholland:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman will be glad to know that I
can help him. BIS Ministers have a copy of the definition of a market
rent only option, which sets out how it would work and when it would be
triggered. In essence, it is about simply paying a rent, which would be
independently assessed according to statutory guidelines, and then
being able to buy everything directly from the market. He seems to be
making a mistaken comparison. The pubco tied leases are generally
“fully repairing and insuring”. One of the scandals was
when, as part of a tied lease, all the responsibility for that was
shifted. A market rent only option is exactly what I have set out, and
I will send that definition to him.</hs_Para>

Robertson:</Member></B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman; perhaps I
could now move on to how rents are assessed. As has been said, quite
often they are assessed not on 
<?notus-xml column=198?>the turnover of a pub, but on the potential turnover, which takes in
things such as food and non-tied products. There is therefore an
unfairness in the way that rents are assessed now. If we can move to a
better system, I will certainly support that.</hs_Para>

said, there is also the inflated cost of tied products. For example,
certain pubcos will charge £130.70 for a keg of Carling when it
can quite easily be bought—we have looked at these
figures—for £95. That is a huge difference, which
squeezes the profits of the landlord and makes the beer more expensive
for consumers. To give another example, Stowford is sold for
£112.70 when it can be sourced for £79.99.
Those are just two examples; I could go on and on if I had the time. I

Friend the Member for East Hampshire (Damian Hinds) and my right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State both mentioned this, but this debate is
not just about the rent and the tie. We make a huge mistake if we
believe that. We can look at those aspects at the beginning of a
contract taken out with a pubco, but the relationship goes
on from there, and sometimes it is the behaviour of the pubcos that
causes the problems. For example, pubcos have the power to install
fixtures and fittings and charge an exorbitant amount to the landlord,
but he will not get anything back for them. Basically, the fixtures and
fittings rule, which has been in existence for a long time, is a con, I
am afraid. I thought carefully about whether I should use that word,
but I think that rule is a con. It is an additional rent that people
have to pay, which again squeezes the profits.</hs_Para>

go into a pub owned by a pubco, they often have to go on expensive
courses run by that pubco, for which it can charge exorbitant amounts.
The cost of carrying out electricity checks, for example, has doubled
in one year at the local pub I mentioned. It is the same pub, so why
has the cost doubled? These are the sort of extraordinary charges that
pubcos sometimes make in the course of running their ordinary
business.</hs_Para>

decisions are sometimes taken. The local pub I mentioned needed about
£100,000 of work carried out, but the electrics and the roof
were not completed when that work was done. There seemed to be an
obsession with putting up new wallpaper, which was not necessary and
not at all important. The work needed to be done over a six-week
period, yet the period covering the jubilee week of last year was
suggested. That is unbelievable—the busiest week of the busiest
year in memory was chosen, and when the landlord refused to
have the work done then and asked why it could not be done in January,
there was a startled reaction.</hs_Para>

difference. The Government keep telling us that they are not kicking
this issue into the long grass—I have lost count of the number
of times that has been said—and that everything is being handled
in a timely manner. Timely for whom? The Government should tell that to
the 26 pubs that are about to close. They are not acting in a timely
fashion. How many pubs will have to go to the wall before we finally
get legislation? Let us face it: at the moment, the legislative
programme is virtually non-existent, and there is no excuse for the

Nokes</B> (Romsey and Southampton North) (Con):</Member> I shall keep
my comments as brief as possible because the problems with pub
companies have been well rehearsed this afternoon. I would like to
thank the hon. Member for Chesterfield (Toby Perkins) for mentioning
the Abbots Mitre in Chilbolton; I can reassure him that the pub is
still open and doing business. In that instance, however, there have
been significant problems with the tie. That caused difficulties for
the local community, which then sought to establish a community buy-out
to make sure that their much-loved local is still open.</hs_Para>

numerous examples in Romsey and Southampton North of previously
successful and popular pubs shutting their doors. Some of the closures
have been temporary. I am pleased that the Hunters inn in Romsey, for
example, has reopened and is doing well. I echo the hon. Member for
Plymouth, Moor View (Alison Seabeck) in saying that it takes a very
special type of person to make a success of running a pub. The Hunters
inn is a good example because the landlord there is also the landlord
of two other pubs in the immediate Romsey area. He has certainly worked
hard with pub companies to make sure that he can make a go of it. I am
sure that it is partly attributable to his strong negotiation skills
when it comes to arranging and agreeing leases.</hs_Para>

afternoon I want to focus on a slightly less happy example: the
Stoneham Arms in Bassett, which closed in the middle of last year. I
fear that what I 
<?notus-xml column=201?>am about to say is almost inevitable: the pub was
owned by Enterprise Inns and is due to be converted to a Co-op store,
although there is already one just a few doors away. I have no doubt
that there is a sound business model to add to the existing retail
offer in Bassett Green road, because otherwise the Co-op would not be
seeking to do that, but the Stoneham Arms as a pub provided a meeting
place for the community, and there are precious few such facilities
left in Bassett. We often talk about the need for more community
cohesion, but pubs can and do provide ideal meeting
places.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012184000114" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0002.htm#14012184000114">I
know that pub companies often cite a lack of interest on the part of
potential future tenants as one of the reasons why they are obliged to
consider alternative uses. Enterprise Inns informed me that the
Stoneham Arms had been marketed on extremely competitive terms in an
attempt to find a new publican, and that, in its
words,</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="14012184002238" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0002.htm#14012184002238">“not

we cannot know how competitive those terms were, or, indeed, what other
bars there were to people seeking to run the premises as a pub. Nor can
I judge how significantly the beer tie acted as a deterrent to
potential publicans, but I am convinced it played a part. The tie, the
nervousness with which publicans regard possible abuses of it, and the
general uncertainty that exists in the industry as a whole have come
together to present a very bleak
picture.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012184000116" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0002.htm#14012184000116">As
we have heard repeatedly this afternoon, publicans just want to be able
to earn a decent income—and must work incredibly hard
to do so—and I believe that regulation is necessary to make that
a possibility. Those in the trade seek certainty, fairness and
reassurance that the Government are on their side, to ensure that they
can run their business models.</hs_Para>

the essence. As we have heard, 26 pubs are closing each week, and the
Stoneham Arms is just the latest in a long list of pubs in my
constituency that have either been lost or come under serious threat.
The Woodman, also in Bassett, is now a Tesco Express, and in the
villages of my constituency many pubs have been boarded up.
I do not pretend that that is just because of pub companies and beer
ties. Indeed, a pub in my own road is currently being marketed, and as
far I know it did not have a contract with a pub company. However, we
know from CAMRA that the rate of closures is increasing, and
that many in the trade are looking to the future and
considering their positions very carefully.</hs_Para>

that the Minister has heard a great many exhortations about timely
action today. I welcome the amendment and the fact that it is supported
by the hon. Member for Leeds North West (Greg Mulholland), whom I have
always regarded as something of an expert on this issue. As he has
said, it has and deserves cross-party support. We have heard from the
Secretary of State that statutory regulation is needed, and there is
agreement on that among Members on both sides of the House, but it
vital that when that is done it is done well, so that it works for the
whole of the licensed trade and, indeed, its
customers.</hs_Para>

that I am the last Back-Bench speaker in the debate, it is unfortunate
that it should fall to me to represent the voice of doom, but I must
urge the House to think about the unintended consequences of what it
calls for today. I listened intently to the very reasoned speech of my
hon. Friend the Member for Tewkesbury (Mr Robertson), who uttered those
words that strike fear into anyone who has been involved in the brewing
and pub industry over the years: the Beer Orders. This is the single
biggest factor that any Minister considering legislating in this area
should consider. It is because of the Beer Orders and because of
ill-thought-out legislation that we find ourselves in our present
position, and I urge the House not to repeat those
mistakes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012184000121" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0002.htm#14012184000121">All
Members who have taken part in today’s debate have done so for
the same reason. They want to see a healthy and successful pub
industry, and they want our pubs to thrive and to succeed. However, I
believe that the unintended consequences of the proposed regulations
will cause many more pubs to close.</hs_Para>

important for the House to understand exactly what we are talking about
when we refer to a free-of-tie option and to market rents. Let me cite
the example of a pub company in my constituency, a brewery called
Marston’s. It owns a number of pubs, which would be regulated
under the proposed legislation. It has been operating for many years,
and is a reputable business with a long and proud history. That brewery
might have owned a pub for 30, 40 or 50 years, and run it extremely
successfully. The tenant might retire or decide to do something else,
and a new tenant might take over. Within months, that new
tenant—despite having seen all the pub books and despite having
had the business case assessed by his lawyer, his business adviser, his
bank manager, and Uncle Tom Cobley and all, and despite knowing exactly
what rent he would pay and what he would pay for beer—might
decide that he wanted to become free of
tie.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012184000123" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0002.htm#14012184000123">What
is now being proposed is not only that the Government should tell
Marston’s what it can charge for beer and rent in a property
that it may have owned for 50 or 60 years, but that we should then
allow that tenant, paying a rent set by the Government, to sell beer
that is not Marston’s. We can see the unintended consequences of
successful pubs, well run by brewers, no longer selling the beer on
which they were
built.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012184000124" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0002.htm#14012184000124"><Member ContinuationText="Mr Jim Cunningham" PimsId="2803" UID="14012184002363" xid="147" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0002.htm#14012184002363"><B>Mr

has led a debate in the House on the same issue in the past, and it has
still not been resolved. The situation he is describing actually
happened between working men’s clubs and breweries. A number of
clubs ran up a lot of debt that they owed to the brewers, and were then
forced to sell their beer. How can we solve that problem? Many people

her to consider carefully the Office of Fair
Trading’s report to the consultation. It clearly expressed the
view that the tie is not distorting the market, and states that the
proposed intervention could result in a breakdown in economies of
scale, leading to an increase in rents and prices that would affect
tenants and consumers. I also urge the Minister to consider the report
from London Economics, which her own Department requested. It suggests
that more than 2,400 pubs could close as a direct result of the
proposed intervention in the
market.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012184000129" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0002.htm#14012184000129">The
reality is that many pub companies are nursing pubs because they cannot
find a tenant or buyer for them. The proposed economic model would mean
that those companies would have to free themselves of those pubs, which
could lead to thousands of pubs closing in a very short time. I ask the
Minister: why regulate? Is there a consumer issue involved? Not
according to the Office of Fair Trading. Would regulation help the
smaller brewers? Certainly not, according to the Society of Independent
Brewers. That organisation represents the micro-breweries. We have
heard people rejoicing today that those breweries have flourished and
blossomed. There are now 1,000 micro-breweries operating in this
country as a result of the progressive beer duty introduced by the
previous Government—I commend them for that—so why would

Member for Cardiff Central (Jenny Willott), to her post? She has taken
over the role from the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson)

have had yet another constructive debate on pub companies and their
relationship with their tenants, but I cannot help but feel a
significant sense of déjà vu. As my hon. Friend the
Member for Chesterfield (Toby Perkins) said in opening the debate, it
would not be January without his staying off the alcohol for a
month—I could flippantly say that he keeps off paying for it for
the other 11 months of the year—and without our
having a debate on pubcos. This is the third such Opposition day
debate—that is, this Opposition are using our own parliamentary
time to continue to raise this important issue and keep the pressure on
the Government, stressing that they are doing too little, too late and
too slowly.</hs_Para>

important that we should continue to re-emphasise the contribution that
pubs make to our local economies and local communities. Each pub
employs an average of 10 people, often young people who find it
particularly hard to find work in other sectors. They provide skills in
customer service, management and training. My hon. Friend the Member
for Huddersfield (Mr Sheerman) is no longer in his place but he talked
about training, which allows me to mention the Montpelier group in
Edinburgh, which set up its own training academy for people who work in
its pubs and restaurants. It deserves great commendation for the work
it does on that in Edinburgh.</hs_Para>

Murray:</Member></B> I think it is fantastic that communities are able
to bid for pubs. It is happening in Scotland as well, under the
Scottish Parliament. Indeed, I have a small vested interest in that,
because I am leading a consortium of fans looking to buy Heart of
Midlothian football club. Community ownership—or at least having

<?notus-xml column=206?>the opportunity to go into community ownership—is the way forward
for lots of industries that have a tie to the local
community.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012184000148" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0002.htm#14012184000148">The
combination of high rents and tied barrelage costs means that a pubco
tenant must sell a pint at a price level that allows some reasonable
profit margin. That level is well above what non-tied premises can
charge, which makes the pubco tenants uncompetitive and pushes up the
price for the consumer. As the hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr
Robertson) mentioned, barrelage costs can be 50% higher in tied
premises than in non-tied premises, which can distort the market in
terms of how much tied premises need to charge the customer. Add to
that an increase in VAT to 20% and we have a cocktail of disaster for
the
publican.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012184000149" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0002.htm#14012184000149"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Donohoe" PimsId="2998" UID="14012184002380" xid="174" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0002.htm#14012184002380">Mr

is indeed the case. My hon. Friend the Member for Huddersfield

Murray:</Member></B> There is a simple formula on employment in the
licensed trade: the more successful a premises is, the more people it
is likely to employ. The entrepreneurial nature of people in these
small businesses running licensed premises means that they tend to want
to get more licensed premises and expand what they are doing, so this
is very good for employment. I declare an interest again, Madam Deputy
Speaker, because I have visited some of the hostelries in my hon.
Friend’s constituency, some of which are rather nice, and I
encourage others to do
likewise.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012184000153" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0002.htm#14012184000153">I
was talking about the double whammy of Government decisions and the
tied contracts pushing up prices to the consumer, which perpetuates the
demise of licensed premises. We must also consider the ever-increasing
energy bills, the spiralling rates and the costs of other non-alcoholic
supplies such as food, which are rising much faster than tenants are
able to pass on to their customers. More has to be done to deal with
all those other relationships, and I hope the Government will back
Labour’s policy on both energy and business rates to enable us
to bring some of those other pressures
down.</hs_Para>

Murray:</Member></B> I am delighted that I gave the hon. Gentleman an
opportunity to mention a lot of the pubs in his constituency—I
hope that is reciprocated. As he rightly says, pubs provide a community
benefit, and many of the premises I have frequented, and one I used to
run, had the local Rotary club there raising a lot of money for
charity, so the community part of the pub is very well
established.</hs_Para>

reflect on the relationship between tenants and the pubco owners of the
premises, which has been mentioned. One thing I found galling when I
ran one of my own premises was that our business development manager
took great delight in telling us which tenants he was fining that week
for buying out, which they had to do to make a small living. That kind
of behaviour and culture in the pubcos highlights the problem we face.
We must also address the issue of inaccurate information being provided
when people are making big decisions, particularly, as my hon. Friend
the Member for Chesterfield alluded to, when they are putting life
savings into these premises; they have to make sure that the
information they get is accurate.</hs_Para>

“mocktails” on his trade mission to the United Arab

Speaker, a “mocktail” is a cocktail without alcohol. The
Secretary of State has invented a brand new word in today’s
debate, because he has developed a “molicy”, which is a
Government policy without legislation. He refused time and again to
commit to bringing legislation forward in the Queen’s Speech.
Why? It was because he probably does not want to bring it forward or he
is being pressed not to do so. Despite making the case for urgency, he
does not seem to be doing this. To continue the puns, he seems to be
serving the pub trade very much a short measure in his response to this

so they have been speaking from knowledge not only as constituency
Members but as former licensees and so on, which has lent weight to the
debate. My thanks go to the members of the Business, Innovation and
Skills Committee and their Chair, the hon. Member for West Bromwich
West (Mr Bailey). He and his predecessor, my hon. Friend the Member for
Mid Worcestershire (Sir Peter Luff), have done crucial work
over the years to raise awareness of this issue. I congratulate my hon.

thank the wide range of people who responded to the Government’s
consultation, including tenants, brewers, pub companies and their
employees, interest groups, trade bodies, supply chain companies and

a number of stories from Members whose constituents are facing real
hardship and adversity, which is clearly worrying. In his opening
remarks, the hon. Member for Chesterfield (Toby Perkins) name-checked a
large number of pubs that have been mentioned in previous debates, so I
will not do the same. I would, however, like to highlight some of the
Members who have given a passionate defence of pubs: my hon. Friends
the Members for Leeds North West, for East Hampshire (Damian Hinds) and
for Norwich North (Chloe Smith), the hon. Member for Huddersfield, my
right hon. Friend the Member for Hazel Grove (Sir Andrew Stunell), the
hon. Member for Clwyd South (Susan Elan Jones), my hon. Friend the
Member for Tewkesbury (Mr Robertson), the hon. Member for Plymouth,
Moor View (Alison Seabeck) and my hon. Friends the Members for Romsey
and Southampton North (Caroline Nokes) and for Burton (Andrew
Griffiths). That illustrates how important pubs are to a diverse range
of communities across the UK. The constituencies about which Members
have spoken today range from the urban to the rural and have
very different issues, and that shows just how important
pubs are.</hs_Para>

Members have mentioned, over the course of a decade there have been
four Select Committee investigations into the relationship between pub
companies and their tenants and into whether a tied model causes an
imbalance in bargaining power. The Government have received a large
amount of correspondence from tenants about problems in their
relationship with their pub company as well as from many hon. Members
writing on behalf of constituents.</hs_Para>

pub companies behave well and some tenants have written in support of
the tie, many others tell us that the tie arrangements with their pub
companies are unfair and that a lack of transparency in particular
causes a severe imbalance in negotiating power. Another issue that has
been highlighted during today’s debate is 
<?notus-xml column=210?>the research commissioned by CAMRA based on self-reported income,
showing that more than half of tied tenants earn less than
£10,000 a year compared with only a quarter of those who are
free of tie. The problems faced by tenants are real and clearly
something needs to be done.</hs_Para>

Government consulted on the creation of a statutory code of practice to
govern the relationship between large pub companies and their tenants
and of an independent adjudicator to enforce the code. As a number of

of the consultation was to consider the proposals to address the
problems in the relationship between pub-owning companies and their

more than 1,100 written responses and more than 7,000 responses to the
online questionnaire. One of those responses was 2,000 pages long, so
the 
<?notus-xml column=211?>amount of evidence we have received is significant. That also
shows that the situation is not as simple as some people have portrayed
it, as illustrated by the speeches made by a number of Members
today—not least those made by my hon. Friends the Members for
Burton, for Tewkesbury and for East Hampshire and the hon. Member for
Huddersfield. They raised concerns about what should be done to tackle
the problems, including mentioning the views of the OFT, and
highlighted that the matter is not simple but is far more complex than
has been suggested by those on the Opposition Front Bench.</hs_Para>

to the consultation came from a wide range of interested parties. Since
we published the responses online in December, they have
been read several thousand times. If hon. Members have had the
opportunity to look at even a little of the evidence that has been
submitted—I am fairly sure that no one will have read the
2,000-page submission—they will see that views are often
polarised on the degree and the nature of the problem, and what the
best solutions would be. That has also been seen in today’s
debate. The 2011 report of the Business, Innovation and Skills
Committee noted that the

breadth and depth of views expressed in the Chamber today and in the
consultation help to illustrate what a complex issue this is,
particularly if we aim to design a solution that is both effective and
proportionate. As some hon. Members have highlighted today, the tie
itself is not necessarily a problem; it is abuse of the tie that is the
problem. Nor is the tie the only problem facing pubs, so finding the
right solution is a complex
matter.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012184000188" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0002.htm#14012184000188">As
hon. Members have also highlighted, the Government had intended to
publish their response to the consultation by the end of 2013. I know
that those who are affected by the proposals, whether tenants or
businesses, need clarity from us. This is, however, a complicated
issue, and it is really important that we get the decision right. The
excellent response to the consultation has created a broad evidence
base upon which we can make our decision, and the evidence spans the
range of proposals that we have discussed today, including the market
rent only option, and puts us in a good position to make the right
decision to ensure a fairer and more sustainable pubs
industry.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012184000189" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0002.htm#14012184000189">We
intend to publish the Government’s response to the consultation
as soon as we can, but we are working to reach a proportionate solution
that delivers greater fairness for Britain’s publicans. We
believe fundamentally that a tied tenant should be no worse off than a
free-of-tie tenant. The beer and pubs sector makes a significant and
valuable contribution not only to our economy, although that has been
highlighted in today’s debate, but also to the more intangible
benefits of social cohesion and a sense of community. We want to
support a fair and flourishing pub sector, which is why we removed the
beer duty escalator, as has been mentioned by hon. Members, and reduced
the tax on beer in last year’s Budget. It is also why we support
the community right-to-buy scheme, which several hon. Members have
mentioned today, and why we are giving £19 million to help
communities to take advantage of the scheme.</hs_Para>

this House notes the ending of preventative measures allowed under
Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures (TPIM) for six
terrorist suspects in January 2014, including individuals that the Home
Secretary considers to pose a risk to the security of the United
Kingdom through terrorism-related activity; notes the decision made by
the Home Secretary to end TPIM controls after two years regardless of
whether she assesses individuals are likely to involve themselves in
terrorism-related activity; is concerned that the Home Secretary has
provided to Parliament no assessment of the current threat these
individuals may pose to the public through terrorist-related activity,
and notes the recent finding of Mr Justice Wilkie that the Secretary of
State does not accept that there is a general duty to tailor
measures towards the end of a TPIM in order to facilitate assimilation;
further notes the disappearance of two terrorist suspects subject to
TPIMs, Ibrahim Magag and Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed; calls on the
Government to make a statement to Parliament on the threat of
terrorist-related activity posed by the six suspects exiting TPIMs, and
to share the full assessment from the Security Service with the
Intelligence and Security Committee; and further calls on the
Government to establish a cross-party review of TPIMs in the light of
these assessments to decide whether changes are needed to protect the
security and liberty of the United
Kingdom.</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="14012184001326" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0003.htm#14012184001326">By
the end of this week up to six terror suspects will have all their
restrictions removed so that they can walk the streets of Britain
unhindered. These six men were previously considered sufficiently
dangerous by the Home Secretary and the courts that they were subject
to terrorism prevention and investigation measures, with their
communications and movements restricted to prevent terror-related
activity. According to the courts, one was a suspected suicide bomber
planning to blow up an airline; one was planning a firearms attack,
either in the UK or abroad; one was trying to join terrorists in
Somalia and another was trying to join Islamist terrorists in Syria; a
fifth was accused of fundraising and supporting terror activity in
Pakistan; and a sixth was accused of planning attacks and fundraising
for al-Shabaab, the group responsible for the awful attacks at
Nairobi’s Westgate centre last year.</hs_Para>

dangerous the court and the Home Secretary believed these men were even
just 12 months ago, when their TPIMs were renewed. The Home Secretary
needs to tell us today whether she believes they are still dangerous
now. Their TPIMs are not being removed because the Home Secretary has
changed her security assessment; they are being removed because the
Home Secretary changed policy and legislation three years ago. We need
answers today on the risk each of these men poses and on what action
she has taken to reduce the risk. Parliament also needs to know whether
TPIMs are still fit for purpose, or whether reforms are needed in the
interests of public
safety.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012184001328" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0003.htm#14012184001328"><Member ContinuationText="Dr Julian Huppert" PimsId="5589" UID="14012184003518" xid="1023" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0003.htm#14012184003518"><B>Dr

Cooper:</Member></B> I will make a little progress and set out our
concerns and views. We have always raised concerns about the
introduction of the two-year time limit, because 
<?notus-xml column=222?>we believe that that raises serious questions. We
also want nobody to be under control orders or TPIMs longer than is
necessary, so it is right that they are continually reviewed. However,
it is also right that we make sure that concern for public safety is at
the heart of the debate, and that is what we need to discuss
today.</hs_Para>

Friend is talking about the answers we need. Promises were made to the

Cooper:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is right. Figures were given in
briefings to newspapers of about £50 million of additional
funding to the security services and the police as a result of the
switch from control orders to TPIMs, but it would be helpful to have
that figure confirmed by the Government. In addition, however, we do
not know whether extra resources are being provided for the ending of
TPIMs. That clearly creates additional pressures on the police and
security services.</hs_Para>

has always to be vigilant against terrorism, and we should thank the
police and our security and intelligence services, which do a difficult
job incredibly well, often behind the scenes and unnoticed. According
to the independent reviewer of terrorism, the threat of a terror attack
directly by al-Qaeda has decreased since the mid-2000s, but the threat
from its affiliates and its power to motivate other extremists and
provide training and planning support all remain. Over this Parliament,
we have seen attempted bomb plots in the west midlands, plans to attack
a Territorial Army base and target Wootton Bassett, and of course the
dreadful murder of Drummer Lee Rigby last summer.</hs_Para>

attempting to travel overseas to fight and train are also potential
threats to the UK, both to our interests and citizens abroad and to us
here when they return home. The independent reviewer has warned that
the Syrian conflict might begin to rival the traditional threat from
al-Qaeda core and regions north of Pakistan. We need to be vigilant
against these threats and ensure that the British people are protected,
and to ensure that the terrorists do not divide us or undermine our
democratic values. The laws we pass against terrorism need always to be
proportionate and fair.</hs_Para>

like control orders before them, TPIMs are exceptional powers and
should be used only in exceptional circumstances, but there are
difficult cases: where there is substantial evidence that someone poses
a terror risk, but where convictions cannot be achieved—for
example, if they depend on secret intelligence that cannot be used in
court. Given the risk of harm and potential loss of life from terror
attacks, Parliament and our courts have long supported preventive
measures based on a clear legal procedure, with safeguards to reduce
the risk to the public.</hs_Para>

ago, however, the Home Secretary decided to weaken those terror powers
by replacing control orders with TPIMs, putting a two-year limit on
each one and removing relocation and other restrictions from them. She

imprisonment.</hs_Para>

and he knows he is wrong because he asked exactly that question of
David Anderson, the independent terrorism reviewer, in the Select
Committee on Home Affairs. The reply from David Anderson was clear. He
said that control orders had not been undermined by the courts and had
in fact been upheld by then—that the principle had been upheld
and individual control orders had been upheld. Of course it is right
for control orders to be scrutinised in the courts, as it is right for
TPIMs to be scrutinised. However, the independent reviewer was
absolutely clear: it was not the courts undermining control orders, nor
was it the courts that decided to replace them with the weaker TPIMs;
it was the Government.</hs_Para>

Minister told the House earlier this month that TPIMs “are
working”, but the verdict on TPIMs, two years on, is very
different. According to the independent reviewer, there have been no
successful prosecutions, despite all the Home Secretary’s
promises. The removal of relocation powers has badly backfired. No one
relocated as part of their control order ever absconded, yet the Home
Secretary removed relocation powers and lost two out of 10 suspects in
12 months. Ibrahim Magag ran off in a black cab; Mohammed
Ahmed Mohamed ran off in a burqa. They have not been seen since, and
the Home Secretary and Prime Minister have no idea where

exceptional legislation, but that strong safeguards should also be in

must also be in place. There should be provision to review TPIMs or

The Home Secretary has told us that the Metropolitan police have a plan

Committee is shown those plans? Will she also tell us what those plans

the Government provided extra funding for surveillance and
investigations. However, that extra funding was clearly not enough to
ensure that there was sufficient surveillance on Mohamed and Magag, who
were able to abscond, or enough to deliver successful prosecutions.
That reduction from control orders to TPIMs will have put additional
pressure on the resources of the police and the security services, but
surely the ending of TPIMs for those suspects altogether will put even
greater pressure on those resources now, as there are no restrictions
in place. Has any additional funding been made available to cope with
the ending of TPIMs for those men, or will surveillance resources have
to be redeployed from other important

the Home Secretary stands up to answer my questions, let me address
some of the points that she usually makes in her defence, as well as
some new ones that she has added to her list in the past few days. She
usually argues that control orders were not strong enough, and that
people absconded while subject to them. She and I agree that the
control orders without relocation powers, under the regime that
operated before 2007, were not strong enough, but that is why the
control order regime was tightened up in 2007 with a greater focus
being placed on relocation, after which no one absconded. My response
to that was to say that we should keep the relocation powers. Hers was
to ditch them. She has lost two terror suspects as a result.</hs_Para>

Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mrs Theresa

grappled with the problem of how to deal with terrorist suspects who
can neither be prosecuted nor deported. The last Government first
introduced the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act in
November 2001. This legislation effectively introduced
detention without trial for foreign terrorist suspects who could be
held pending deportation even when that deportation was unlikely ever
to happen. In 2004 the Law Lords struck down those powers.</hs_Para>

the extraordinary spectacle of the attempt to increase the period of
pre-charge detention to 90 days, which was rightly defeated
by Parliament, and in 2005 the last Government introduced control
orders, but control orders too, as my hon. Friend the Member for
Northampton North (Michael Ellis) has said, were steadily eroded by the
courts. Three control orders were quashed because the courts said they
were wrong in principle, two control orders were revoked because the
courts directed that they were no longer necessary, and three control
orders were revoked because the previous Government felt they were
unable to make the disclosures ordered by the court. All those
individuals were then freed from their
controls.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012184001386" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0003.htm#14012184001386"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Kevan Jones" PimsId="1213" UID="14012184003544" xid="318" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0003.htm#14012184003544">Mr

it shows is that the courts were giving a very clear message about
aspects of control orders. What we needed was a regime that was legally
viable and would command the confidence of the police and security
services, and TPIMs have been consistently endorsed by the courts, two
successive independent reviewers of counter-terrorism legislation, the
police and the Security Service. They provide some of the strongest
restrictions available in the democratic world 
<?notus-xml column=230?>and some of the strongest possible protections that our courts will
allow. We now have a strong and sustainable legal framework to handle

that forced relocation was struck down by the courts in four control
order cases, including those of two individuals who were subsequently
placed on TPIMs. The right hon. Lady also does not say that several
control order subjects breached their control orders even while they
were relocated, so the idea that relocation would prevent orders being

to have a new TPIM placed on that subject. That is something that is
entirely open to them. Besides, people coming off restrictions is

position, there is a basic difference between the individuals: one set
of individuals has been prosecuted, convicted and put in prison. The
suggestion that somebody who has at some stage been involved in
terrorism activity is never allowed to be released on to the streets is
not correct, yet that is the impression that the Opposition sometimes
give. In their comments on control orders, they fail to concentrate on
the fact that 43 people who were on control orders came off their
restrictions. That may have been because the orders were allowed to
expire or they were revoked or quashed by the courts, or people may
have absconded. As I have said, even before TPIMs were introduced, the
courts would simply not allow people to be parked permanently on
control orders. When the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police was

not think
so.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012184001417" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0003.htm#14012184001417"><B><Member ContinuationText="Pete Wishart" PimsId="4656" UID="14012184003567" xid="647" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0003.htm#14012184003567">Pete

Minister announced new measures to tackle extremism, with the outcome
of the extremism taskforce, which was established in the wake of those
tragic events. That built on the revised Prevent strategy, which we
extended to cover all forms of extremism, including non-violent

all we can to support the police and Security Service in tackling the
threats we face. That is why we have enhanced our powers to disrupt
terrorist travel, we will help deport foreign terrorist suspects, and
we have given the police and the Security Service tens of millions of
pounds in extra funding each year. The police and the Security Service

which it was understood in other circumstances they had committed or
were likely to commit. Some would say, “We should just leave
these matters to the courts.” At least the main parties are
agreed that some people are so dangerous—as confirmed by
information sufficiently reliable for the courts, albeit in closed
proceedings—that they cannot just be left at large. No
Government and no Home Secretary would survive if we washed our hands
of the risks before us and then an aeroplane was blown up with hundreds
of UK citizens on it, or bombs were let off. Control orders, imperfect

never understood, and we have had no reliable explanation today, why on
earth the Home Secretary decided, with no explanation whatsoever, to
change control orders, which were working, to a weaker system of which
there are two fundamentally different features: first, an arbitrary
time limit, which she did not need to impose; and secondly, the removal
of the relocation provisions, which was not required by the courts. She
referred to four cases, I think, where she said that the courts said
that they were not appropriate, as opposed to being struck down,
because that phrase is about striking down legislation. The courts had
decided, quite rightly, in the instant case, that they were not going
to approve that part of the control order. That is what the courts are
there for. They were not striking down relocations; they were merely
saying “Parliament asked us to substitute our judgment for that
of the Home Secretary. That is precisely what we have done. We do not
think this is justified in these circumstances.” By
the end of this process,

the current Conservative Government in having such orders at all,
because they are under attack from the civil liberties lobby. If there
is a choice for me, as a father, between my daughters being blown up on

everything we stand for and all our liberal values, and there being

am on record as being an advocate of our jury system, I have never
wanted to give the police extra powers and I recognise all the ancient
arguments for our civil liberties. However, given the danger that some
people pose and the views that they hold, what is the gross
infringement on their civil liberties that we are talking about?
Overnight residence measures; electronic tagging; restrictions on
communication or association; exclusion from particular places;
overseas travel bans; restrictions on bank accounts; restrictions on
the transfer of property; limitations on the possession and use of
electronic communication devices; work or studies measures that require
permission to be obtained for specific activities or notice to be given
prior to any work or studies being carried out; measures requiring
regular reporting to a police station; and measures requiring the

issue. I would say that if there has been a trial and that person has
been found not guilty, fair enough. There may, however, be reasonable
suspicion that somebody poses a real danger to the public. This whole
debate has been skewed because the Labour party has attacked the
Government from the right, but I am more interested in what the public
think. When the public look at the appalling outrages that have taken
place, and when they consider the plots to blow up hundreds of innocent
people for no reason at all, I do not think that most of them think
that the sorts of measures that the Labour Government brought in, and
that our Government are enforcing, are such a dramatic infringement on
our traditional way of life. In that sense I support the former Labour
Government; I think they had to act as they wanted, although we know
there was a problem with the courts.</hs_Para>

They are instigated by the Home Secretary with the permission of the

quite sensible. That is, I agree, a higher threshold than the one for
control orders, which required “reasonable suspicion”,
but as far as the public are concerned, is there a great deal of
difference between the “reasonable suspicion” that was
required under the former Labour Government, or a reasonable belief in
the subject’s involvement in terrorism? I do not think so; that
is not a great difference between control orders and TPIMs. The Home

engaged in any fresh activity for me to be extremely worried about
their release. Indeed, it is a curious point that TPIMs come to an end
if people subject to them are not engaged in any fresh terrorist
activity. That suggests that TPIMs are so weak that people on them

He is absolutely right: when it comes to national security, party
politics should recede into the background and the common interest of

debate is finely balanced. I took part in the Bill Committee on what is
now the Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures Act 2011, and I
sit on the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which this week
will publish its post-legislative report on the Act’s
implementation. While it would be wrong of me to pre-empt its findings,
personally, I can offer some opinions on where the balance needs to be
struck. I am sure that the first principle that needs to be emphasised
is accepted by most, if not all, Members. The fundamental basis from
which we all start must be the rule that individual freedom should be
curtailed only where there are reasonable grounds for arrest or
sufficient evidence to charge a suspect, or where custody is the only
appropriate sentence after a finding of guilt. Any departure from that
rule has to be exercised sparingly and within the narrowest parameters,
and cannot involve indefinite or permanent deprivation of liberty.
Balanced against that important principle has to be the duty of the
state and its agents to safeguard us in our daily lives, which is why
the activities of our security and intelligence services deserve our
strong support and praise.</hs_Para>

Buckland:</Member></B> My hon. Friend’s point allows me to make
two observations. First, we have to be careful, in setting the
parameters of any orders we impose, not to heighten the sense of
grievance; and secondly and most importantly, the Government have to
take other measures, in terms of the resources given to the security
and intelligence services, the work done by Prevent and the
counter-terrorism work done day in, day out to supplement the TPIMs
regime. Is there not a danger that in dwelling on the detail of TPIMs,
we ignore the bigger picture and the Government’s welcome
injection of extra resources into this area of activity?</hs_Para>

vigilance of our security services is not only underpinned by statute,
but, as the Home Secretary said, exercised by use of the royal
prerogative, which is still the residual source of authority for
Government activity in this area and which I know is used daily. The
motion calls on the Government to share with the Intelligence and
Security Committee the full assessment of the threat or otherwise posed
by the six individuals who are to exit the TPIMs regime imminently, and
then subject it to a cross-party review. However well intentioned that
might be, to link such a process with individual cases is misconceived,
because it risks bringing a Committee of Parliament into the field of
operations. It is the job 
<?notus-xml column=246?>of parliamentary Committees to consider the strategy and the legal
structure; it is not their job to consider operational matters, and I
can see any cross-party review falling foul of that
problem.</hs_Para>

Buckland:</Member></B> I accept the hon.
Gentleman’s point about the role of that Committee and its
structure, which perhaps allows it to go into more intimate
detail than debates on the Floor of the House would allow. However, if
members of that Committee were to intervene—I am sure some of
them will take part in the debate later—I think they would
hesitate before allowing the ambit of the Committee to include looking
at individual operational matters. That really is not the role, as I
see it, of a Committee of Parliament such as the Intelligence and
Security Committee.</hs_Para>

already subject to a number of reviews. We have heard a lot about the
independent reviewer, David Anderson, QC, and his annual reports,
which give a helpful and comprehensive analysis of the
effectiveness or otherwise of TPIMs. There are also, of course,
quarterly reports to Parliament made by the Home Secretary, and I have
already mentioned the work of the Joint Committee on Human Rights. As I
understand it, the Government intend to carry out a broader review of
counter-terrorism measures, which will no doubt include the operation
of TPIMs. For all those reasons, it seems unnecessary to call for a
cross-party review at this stage.</hs_Para>

with some of the points that have sparked debate this evening, the
first being the question of absconsion. The very nature of such orders
means that the risk of absconsion will always be present, whatever the
conditions may be. The only way to prevent absconsion is to lock people
up, and doing so without trial falls foul of fundamental principles
that we should all share as democrats and lovers of liberty. There is
an argument I have heard that the risk of absconsion would be higher if
TPIM subjects remained in their local communities, but to my way of
thinking it is equally arguable either way. It is equally arguable that
a person placed in another part of the country, isolated and therefore
disengaged from their community, would want to abscond as
well.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14012184001514" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0003.htm#14012184001514">The truth is
that there is no clear evidence to support the contention that the lack
of relocation powers in TPIMs has led to more absconsions. When it
comes to the reasons for those absconsions, Ministers must satisfy
themselves that the secret services and the police are taking every
step possible to reduce the risk posed to the rest of us by such people
and that suitable resources are available to deal with the situation.
That is why the increase in resources by the Government is so
important.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14012184001515" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0003.htm#14012184001515">As an
investigative measure, TPIMs are a bit of a misnomer in my view. I
agree with the view of David Anderson that the investigatory part of
TPIMs has not been effective. There is no evidence to suggest that they
have in any way led to further prosecutions. What they are is a
preventive measure. That was the view of the reviewer and it is
certainly my view. I agree with him that TPIMs are likely to have
prevented terrorist activity 
<?notus-xml column=247?>and, most importantly, they will have allowed resources to be released
from deployment on the former control order regime, to deal with other
pressing national security targets. Those are not my words; they are
the words of the David Anderson in his last review, and I
agree.</hs_Para>

about exit strategies. It would be wrong to explore individual cases,
but—to return to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for
Beckenham (Bob Stewart)—some information about the work being
done in the wider counter-terrorism context would be welcome, whether
it be general information about the Prevent strategy or information
about the work of the new extremism taskforce, which was set up in the
wake of the appalling Woolwich murder.</hs_Para>

made of time limits, yet an inescapable truth has been avoided by some
Opposition speakers: that the indefinite use of control orders would
inevitably be subject to legal challenge in the continuing absence of
guilt. The argument about time is therefore rather an artificial one

forward.</hs_Para>

when dealing with counter-terrorism issues. The Select Committee is in
the middle of its inquiry into counter-terrorism and is just about to
look at a report on TPIMs that will be published next week.
I have just read the report. I shall speak very briefly
about it because, having just read it, I do not want inadvertently to

up three personal concerns. First, what on earth is going to happen to
all the people who are on TPIMs and are about to be removed from them?
That is an important question, and I hope that the Minister will answer
it. I entirely accept what the hon. Member for Beckenham (Bob Stewart)
said in his intervention on the hon. Member for South
Swindon—that if we go to the trouble of making people subject to
TPIMs, we need to think about what it will do to those people if the
orders are suddenly stopped. One problem with control orders and TPIMs
has been the lack of engagement with those who have been subject to
them. The Government will have to introduce some kind of measure to
replace the one that is about to expire for so many people, so I hope
we will be able to ensure not only proper monitoring of those
individuals, but appropriate engagement with them.</hs_Para>

evidence in our last session from Cerie Bullivant, a young man who,
through association with another individual whose brother was a subject
of interest to the security services, was put under a control order.
His view was that control orders and TPIMs were exactly the same, but
he felt that his life had been transformed by the experience—he
became even bitterer because he had been made the subject of such an
order. When we are dealing with situations of this kind, we must have
these orders, but we must also engage with these people. If we do not,
when the order ends, we will be in the same position or an even worse
one than when we started.</hs_Para>

am still not clear about what has happened to the two individuals who
have escaped from their TPIMs—Ibrahim Magag and Mohammed Ahmed
Mohamed. We have had no explanation of what action has been taken. I
recall statements being made by Ministers and I know there was a
dispute about whether the passports had been retained by the Home
Office and the police. Frankly, however, we must have clarity on those
points of detail. We know the circumstances of the two individuals who
decided to break their orders, but as we come towards the expiry of the
orders for the others, we still do not know where these people are.
Presumably, we will make no attempts to find them, for what is the
point of trying to find people when their orders have
expired?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012184001526" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0003.htm#14012184001526">Finally,
I want to say something about foreign fighters. The Committee took
evidence from Charles Farr of the Home Office, and we have heard
speeches from the head of the security services. These are issues of
great importance to the House. What concerns us is not just those who
go abroad, but those who come back and then infect other people with
their ideology. We need a new counter-terrorism strategy that brings
the community on side with us so that they are our eyes and ears. We
cannot simply feel that we can prevent this happening; without
engagement, we will not be in a position to deal with these dangerous
times.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-21?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_21_PT_1/505D03328F32280C2ABCCB4D23CB7F3AAA4FFAC9" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="21 January 2014">Tuesday

be detained for 90 days without even telling them what they
were accused of. We also remember when the anti-terror powers,
apparently put in place for our safety, were used when the 82-year-old
Labour party member Walter Wolfgang was thrown out of the party

measures. They will talk about the alienation that they suffer as a
result of the schedule 7 searches at ports. They will also talk about
the effects of stop and search—the Home Secretary is quite
rightly reviewing that policy. When we send people a message that they

interesting to note the views of former Home Secretaries, who have had
the unfortunate responsibility of dealing with the nature of this

still live in a dangerous time, and that is why it is right and

claim that the threat is no greater than that previously posed by the
IRA and that British foreign policy is as much to blame as this hateful
religious ideology. They convince themselves that everything did not

the number of points that have been made, I will limit my remarks to
the issues that I think the Government still need to respond to. First,
the TPIMs regime was supposed to allow more prosecutions at the same
time as providing protection for the public. Will the Minister confirm
whether any of the individuals subject to TPIMs have actually been
prosecuted for terrorist-related activity?</hs_Para>

know that two of the people subject to TPIMs have absconded. The fact
that the power of relocation is no longer available to the Home
Secretary might have something to do with that. Will the Minister agree
to reflect on whether it was wise to ignore the advice of the former
Conservative Home Secretary, the noble Lord Howard, the former
independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, the noble Lord Carlile,
and the police when removing the power of relocation?</hs_Para>

replaced control orders, Parliament was promised that the introduction
of those weaker powers would be accompanied by extra surveillance
capacity. The Public Bill Committee was promised an elaborate web of
24-hour surveillance provided by specially 
<?notus-xml column=259?>trained officers. The cost was predicted to rise from
£1.8 million a year for a control order to £18
million a year for a TPIM, but Ibrahim Magag disappeared by getting
into a taxi and Mohamed did the same by donning a burqa and removing
his tag. Will the Minister set out whether the TPIMs regime provided
the direct surveillance of suspects that Parliament was promised? For
example, was either of those suspects under direct surveillance when
they disappeared?</hs_Para>

Secretary pointed out that individuals had in the past been taken off
control orders. Indeed they were, but the difference is that in those
cases the individuals were no longer deemed to pose a high risk. Now
the decision has been taken away from the Government with the automatic
ending of a TPIM after a maximum of two years. My right hon. Friend the
Member for Blackburn, when pressing the Home Secretary on her personal
view on when individuals should come off TPIMs, asked whether she
thought that they posed a risk. She refused to answer.</hs_Para>

Secretary was also asked whether she thought that the person known as
CD still posed a risk. As she was previously able to tell us what the
risk assessment was for Magag and Mohamed, it is rather unfortunate
that she was unable to be as candid on the Floor of the House in this
important debate about these
individuals.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012184001595" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0004.htm#14012184001595">Let
me say clearly to the hon. Member for Cambridge (Dr Huppert) that
nobody wants people to remain on TPIM orders indefinitely, but we do
want a proper risk assessment as to when a person should come off a
TPIM order, not an arbitrary two-year time limit. That is our position,
and I hope he will reflect on
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012184001596" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0004.htm#14012184001596">Control

My right hon. Friend the Member for Salford and Eccles (Hazel Blears)

Seven of the current TPIM suspects are thought to have travelled abroad
to Pakistan, Syria or Somalia to attend terrorist training camps, where
they develop the expertise and skills that make them so dangerous. I

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (James
Brokenshire):</Member></B> Let me say at the outset that this
Government regard protecting the British public from terrorism as
absolutely one of the most important functions of the state.
I stress the seriousness and weight that the Home Secretary, other
Ministers and I attach to the exercise of these powers, and therefore
the careful consideration that we give to
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012184001603" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0004.htm#14012184001603">We
have been consistently clear that violence and extremism of all kinds
have no place in today’s society. We believe that individuals
who engage in terrorist activity should be prosecuted wherever and
whenever possible. The right place for terrorists is behind bars. In
that context—I am sure that this will be supported by Members in
all parts of the House—I recognise and pay tribute to the work
of the police and the security services in protecting the security of
our country and pursuing those who would seek to do us
harm.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012184001604" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0004.htm#14012184001604">However,
where individuals who pose a threat to this country and its people
cannot be prosecuted or deported, we need powerful measures that can
help manage the risk. My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Sir
Edward Leigh) made that point clearly. That was exactly why we took
stock and reviewed the control orders that the previous Government had
used. Despite what a number of Members have said today, it was clear to
us that control orders were not working as they were intended
to.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14012184001605" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0004.htm#14012184001605">During the
six years for which control orders existed, seven people absconded.
Moreover, they were being steadily eroded by the courts. A total of
eight were either quashed or revoked because they were thought wrong in
principle, because they were believed no longer to be necessary or
because the previous Government were unable to make a disclosure
ordered by the court. Furthermore, in four cases the relocation of
individuals subject to control orders was quashed. That was why we
judged that the state of affairs was untenable. The British public
rightly expect protection from dangerous individuals, and we needed a
robust system that would provide effective and workable restrictions.
We therefore ordered a lengthy and considered review of our
counter-terrorism powers against the risk that then existed.</hs_Para>

judge that TPIMs have proved effective and workable. They have
consistently been upheld by the courts, they have been endorsed by two
separate independent reviewers of counter-terrorism legislation and
they have the confidence of the police and the Security Service. To

provide some of the toughest controls possible in the democratic world.
They provide for a comprehensive range of restrictions that can be
placed on terror suspects, including daily reporting; overnight
residence at a specified address; a ban on overseas travel; the wearing
of a global positioning system tracking tag; limits on the use of
telephones, computers and financial services and on association; and
exclusion from specific places such as ports and airports. They give
the police certainty about how individuals will be managed. In his

understand—I am sure he will recognise this, as a former Home
Secretary—that we need to focus on the management of dangerous
offenders’ exit strategies and how they are released. As the
Home Secretary made clear, the courts struck down relocation on a
number of occasions. Our concern has been, and always will be, about
having a continuing arrangement to provide assurance about the
management of such offenders. Most importantly, the police and the
Security Service, whose opinions are after all the ones we should
listen to on the subject, say that TPIMs have been effective in
disrupting individuals and networks that pose a threat to this
country’s security. As my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary

have all heard some of the statistics on outcomes for our
nation’s 68,000-plus looked-after children, and I think
everybody will agree that our country’s record on helping this
most vulnerable group of young people when they leave care is nothing
short of appalling. Of the 7,000 19-year-olds who were in care at 16,
36% are not in education, employment or training, and only 6% of all
care leavers are in higher education, compared with 43% of their peers.
We can add to those figures the fact that just 12.8% of children in
care obtained five good GCSE grades, compared with 57.9% of their
peers, and that about 23% of the adult prison population have spent
some time in care. Around a quarter of those living on the streets also
have a care background, while care leavers are four or five times more
likely to commit suicide. Finally, about 47% of looked-after children
aged five to 17 show signs of psychosocial adversity and psychiatric
disorders, which is higher than among the most disadvantaged children
living in private
households.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012184002190" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0004.htm#14012184002190">Physical
and mental problems increase at the time of leaving care. In order to
address the many serious challenges faced by care leavers, the
Government propose to introduce an amendment to the Children and
Families Bill to allow young people who are fostered to remain with
their carers until they are 21, if they wish and their carers agree and
if it is considered to be in their best interests to do so. All young
people in foster care will be offered enhanced support until they are
21. For young people in foster care, this is one of the biggest, most
fundamental changes to their support when they leave care and is widely
applauded as a hugely significant change in the right direction for
this incredibly vulnerable group of young people.</hs_Para>

however, is that the extension to fostering excludes the 9% of young
people in care who are placed in children’s homes. These young
people have a wide range of needs and challenges. What most have in
common is that they are vulnerable. That vulnerability is further
enhanced by a stigma attached to residential care among politicians,
the public and still, sadly, some in the social work profession.
Ministers appear to see living in a family as the best option for
children in care—I believe they are right—and as the only
setting in which children may thrive. That is reflected by some social
workers who see children’s homes as the last resort—a
place where children who have “failed” family placements
may be sent or as somewhere the more challenging young people may be
placed. Many of the public see children’s homes as places where
“naughty children” are sent. Historically, that view was
compounded by some local authorities that used children’s homes
to accommodate the more challenging young
people.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012184002192" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0004.htm#14012184002192">When
recently asked by the Select Committee on Education to explain
different care leaving ages for foster children and those in
children’s homes, the Secretary of State for Education replied
that fostering is different to residential options and that
children’s homes will not 
<?notus-xml column=270?>get support until an unspecified number of children’s homes
nationally have improved within an unspecified time, at which point he
may consider it. However, Ofsted inspections of 400 children’s
homes concluded by June last year found that on overall effectiveness
65% were good or outstanding and only 7% were inadequate; on outcomes
for young people, 67% were good or outstanding and only 3% were
inadequate; on quality of care, 74% were good or outstanding, with only
6% inadequate; on safeguarding of children and young people, 69% were
good or outstanding, with only 6% inadequate; and, finally, on
leadership and management, 57% were good or outstanding and only 9%
inadequate.</hs_Para>

data, based on Ofsted inspection standards, thus show that the
inspectors found most children’s homes to be good or outstanding
and only a small percentage to be inadequate. I wonder whether the
Secretary of State realises the absurdity of his argument. Surely, as
the holder of the purse strings, he should be targeting the homes he is
not happy with, and not the young people who are in them through not
fault of their own. This suggests strongly that the stigma and misuse
of residential care often mask some excellent work that is taking
place. It is a credit to residential care that so many of the young
children placed in children’s homes under such pressure grow up
to lead fulfilling
lives.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012184002194" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0004.htm#14012184002194"><Member ContinuationText="Tim Loughton" PimsId="1558" UID="14012184004199" xid="368" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0004.htm#14012184004199"><B>Tim
Loughton</B> (East Worthing and Shoreham) (Con):</Member> Perhaps I
should declare my entry in the Register of Members’ Financial
Interests. I entirely agree with my hon. Friend, but is not part of the
problem the fact that the children who end up in residential
children’s homes are, as he says, often there as a last resort,
and will usually be there only for a matter of months, when what we
really need to look at, rather than short-term spot purchasing of
places, is long-term planning? Children need to go into good-quality
residential children’s homes—the quality still needs to
be improved—as a long-term planned option, just as it is for
long-term fostering, rather than as a last resort. If that were the
case, enabling children to stay on, which would be wholly consistent
with fostering, could be seen as much more of a natural
process.</hs_Para>

Whittaker:</Member></B> I agree absolutely with the sentiments
expressed by my hon. Friend, who has had massive experience in this

vital.</hs_Para>

with allowing the amendment just for those in foster care is that it
leads to inequalities and discrimination within the system, creating a
two-tier system for these vulnerable young people. It does not include
young people in residential care, so the state just washes its hands of
children anywhere between the ages of 16 and 18 and cuts them free
without any support in the big wide world. I have even heard stories of
young people being sent back to their birth families just a few days
before their 16th birthday, so the local authority no longer has to
support
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012184002197" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0004.htm#14012184002197">As
chair of the all-party parliamentary group on looked-after
children and care leavers—a post held that the Minister held
before me, so he has had massive experience with the APPG—I have
been inundated with stories of young people feeling that the state is
yet again letting 
<?notus-xml column=271?>them down because of the inequality and discrimination being created. In
this particular case, however, I have noted a real anger coming from
those young people in residential care—an anger that I feel is
justified. The brilliant campaign led by the “Every Child
Leaving Care Matters” team has in less than a month secured
5,000 signatures for the petition from care leavers to change the
Government’s mind, and this has been backed by academics and
charities from all over the nation. Five thousand young people cannot
be wrong: they are angry about their exclusion, and as one young man
said to me, “We are being stitched up yet
again.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012184002198" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0004.htm#14012184002198"><Member ContinuationText="Bill Esterson" PimsId="5716" UID="14012184004201" xid="1148" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0004.htm#14012184004201"><B>Bill

suggest that the long-term objective might be to treat

Whittaker:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. I
believe that nowadays the average age of young adults who live at home

to fend for themselves? It just does not seem right.</hs_Para>

argue, as would many others, that young people in residential care are
the most vulnerable of all. The majority have been through the
fostering system, and have found themselves in placements that break
down. The average number of placements for each child in the care

residential care. Ben Ashcroft, who is a care leaver, had a total of 37
placements, and wrote a book about his experiences called “51

should we want to discriminate against the most vulnerable members of
an already vulnerable group? Most of us who are close to the system
understand that it is not quite as simple as delivering foster

have been very quiet about those in residential homes, and about what
some of the solutions might be. The Staying Put agenda has been
piloted, tried and tested for young people in foster care, but nothing
has yet been 
<?notus-xml column=272?>piloted for those in residential care. We need, at the very least, an
announcement from the Government that there will be such pilots, and an
indication from them that young people in residential homes can have
the same rights and entitlements as those in foster placements until a
long-term solution is found. However, the silence is

understand the caution, but I do not believe that young people who are
in placements now, who are settled, and who will benefit from remaining
in those placements until they are 21 should have to move elsewhere
simply pending further research. They have needs now. Some will be
facing failure, destitution, homelessness, exploitation and all the
other risks that young people face on their own. That is happening
now—not in the future, but now. Those young people should not be
placed at risk pending further
research.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012184002206" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0004.htm#14012184002206">One
of the Government’s concerns is that allowing young people to
remain in children’s homes after their 18th birthday may cause
problems for younger children placed, and that safeguarding issues
could be involved. I struggle to see how a young person who is settled
in a children’s home and enjoys a positive relationship with
staff and peers should suddenly become a safeguarding risk when he or
she turns 18, having never been so
before.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012184002207" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0004.htm#14012184002207">Some
people argue that it is too soon to include changes in the leaving care
arrangements for children placed in children’s homes by April
2014. I see no reason why those who are settled in placements, enjoy
positive relationships and want to stay with the agreement of those in
charge of their placements should not be supported and allowed to do
so. The Government should give a commitment to support all young people
leaving care until they are 21 by April 2014, while work is being done

the issue when it comes to including the 9% of young people in

supporting young care leavers in the criminal justice system. I would
ask about the costs to the benefits system and the mental health

highlighted a potential saving—and a good way of paying for such
a scheme—that would involve ensuring that the birth parents did
not continue to claim family benefit for the young person.
Evidence from inquiry workshops relating to the report on
entitlements produced by the all-party parliamentary group on
looked-after children and care leavers showed that several young people
on those workshops had birth parents who were still claiming child
benefit from the state on their behalf, even though they had been in

that local authorities should stop the benefit when a child is taken
into care, but in reality that practice is rather hit and miss. If the
Department for Work and Pensions incentivised local authorities
to stop the benefit by giving them, say, half the child

the DWP and extra money to fund a scheme for local
authorities. Sadly, however, the DWP fails to admit that this is an

for young people leaving foster care. However, the changes, which will
in effect increase the care leaving age for many
fostered children but not for those in other residential settings, 
<?notus-xml column=273?>could have unintended consequences. They risk creating a two-tier care
system, in which children in foster care receive longer aftercare
support than those in residential settings. They risk creating an
“underclass” of children in residential care who will
still have to leave care at 18. They risk reducing real choice for
children, as they will be compelled to accept family care in order to
gain better aftercare. They also risk creating serious issues for
social workers when family placements are breaking down, because the
social workers might repeat family placements in an effort to protect
aftercare instead of considering the best option for the young person,
which might include a residential care option. Finally, they risk
creating a negative impact on the self-image and confidence of children
in residential settings other than foster care, who might feel
undervalued and discriminated against by a change that excludes them
through no fault of their
own.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012184002212" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0004.htm#14012184002212">I
would like to ask the Minister why young people in residential settings
who are settled in placements, who enjoy positive relationships and who
want to stay, with the agreement of their placement, should not be
allowed and supported to continue to do so? There are no reasons why
that cannot be done while the research into the best long-term options
is ongoing. What is the Minister going to do to address any possible
gross discrimination? Will he tell those young people what the
Government’s plans are for pilots for a long-term solution that
will give them the same support as young people in foster care? The
brilliant amendment to the Children and Families Bill would represent a
fantastic advancement for all young people in care, not just those in
foster
care.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-21?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_21_PT_1/D7336FAC71DD4884C7BC217FE0DDE26B4D9FE317" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="21 January 2014">Tuesday

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education (Mr Edward

Calder Valley (Craig Whittaker) on securing this important debate. As
my successor as chair of the all-party parliamentary group on
looked-after children and care leavers, he is well placed to bring to
the House the concerns and views of the many children and young people
who actively participate in the group’s work. Like him, I
completely recognise the vital need for care leavers to be provided
with good-quality, stable accommodation and support if they are to make
a successful transition to adulthood. Likewise, I am sure that he
recognises my personal commitment, and that of the Government, to
making substantial improvements to services for care leavers. That will
include ensuring that young people are given help to access suitable
accommodation with the right support.</hs_Para>

said, we recently announced our intention to place a new legal duty on
local authorities to provide staying-put arrangements, supported by
additional funding of £40 million to local authorities over the
next three years. We will introduce a new clause into the Children and
Families Bill to place a duty on local authorities to give young people
the opportunity to “stay put” with their former foster
parents from their 18th birthday until they are aged 21. We have worked
closely with the Who Cares Trust and other interested parties to ensure
that we get the wording of the new clause right, and I look forward to
tabling it soon.</hs_Para>

the only step we are taking. This is all part of our wider reform
programme to provide care leavers with much better support as they move
into adulthood. Other reforms include changing the rules so that 16 and
17-year-olds remain in care until they are ready to move out, and
providing much greater financial support for young people leaving care
at
18.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012184002216" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0004.htm#14012184002216">My
hon. Friend has secured this debate in order to express his concern
about the potential for inequity between young people in foster care
and those in children’s homes. So let me be clear: I want to
ensure that all care leavers, whatever their placement while in the
care system, are provided with the appropriate support when they leave
care. As my hon. Friend is aware, one of my two adopted brothers came
to live with my family from a children’s home, so I have a deep
personal interest in wanting to see all children’s homes provide
the best-quality care and support on offer, both during a child or
young person’s time in care and as they move on to independent
living or other accommodation.</hs_Para>

Friend says that for some young people staying in the children’s
home is the right thing to do. I agree, and the law is clear that local
authorities can already provide funding and support to a young person
to stay with their former foster carer or to remain in a
children’s home beyond their 18th birthday, and we know and see
examples of that already happening. The issue, however, is whether it
is appropriate to place a new duty on local authorities to provide a
particular type of support to all young people in children’s
homes.
</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012184002218" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0004.htm#14012184002218">The
evidence for placing such a duty on supporting staying-put arrangements
for young people in foster care is robust. Staying-put arrangements
were tested out in pilots, and proved to have a positive impact on
their outcomes. Research from the Fostering Network since the pilots
ended shows that, where these arrangements continue, they show similar
positive outcomes. Making the transition from a children’s home
and from a foster home are very different, however. For some children,
leaving a children’s home means moving into residential
accommodation for adults. For others, it will be supported
accommodation back in their home community; I acknowledge that
many—too many—children’s homes are miles from
where their families live. We also know that a disproportionate number
of young people leave children’s homes and go home to live with
their
families.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012184002219" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0004.htm#14012184002219">There
are also a number of practical and legal issues we would need to
consider and test out before placing a duty on local authorities to
have to provide staying-put arrangements in children’s homes. A
key barrier would be having vulnerable adults living alongside much
younger vulnerable children. My hon. Friend addressed that point, but
children’s homes are, in law, establishments “wholly or
mainly” for children and are registered as such by Ofsted,
which, as my hon. Friend mentioned, inspects children’s homes
and makes judgments on how the home is achieving outcomes for children.
As part of our wider reform of residential care, a much stronger
inspection regime will be put in place to help drive up quality
standards.</hs_Para>

most children’s homes are now very small—typically 2, 3
or 4 beds—extending staying put could result, for example, in a
home accommodating two or three care leavers and one child. In this
case it could not be registered as a “children’s
home”, as it would mainly be an establishment accommodating
young adults, which 
<?notus-xml column=275?>could cause difficulties for the only child living there. For the same
reason, Ofsted would not have any legal scope to regulate and inspect
this
service.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012184002221" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0004.htm#14012184002221">I
recognise, however, that these should not be viewed as insurmountable
barriers, so my hon. Friend will be pleased to know that I have asked

Whittaker:</Member></B> The news my hon. Friend has just announced is
very welcome and I thank him for it, but I want to challenge him on
some of his points about children’s homes and the number of

allow someone who is 18 to stay in care. Surely if that is allowed, the
problems he is bringing up are not insurmountable and can be put
right.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012184002223" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0004.htm#14012184002223"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Timpson" PimsId="5321" UID="14012184004207" xid="581" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0004.htm#14012184004207">Mr
Timpson:</Member></B> I have expressed a clear view about some of the
legal and practical issues that remain. It is right that we consider
them carefully and understand the consequences more widely across the
residential care sector before taking any further steps. I want to be
absolutely clear that I am not looking to find excuses not to do this.
I am trying to establish what we will need to do to make me feel
confident that any further steps we take will achieve what we all want,
which is much more stability in placements, whatever that placement may
be while in care, and a much better transition into adulthood that is
co-ordinated and planned properly as a consequence of the input from
the professionals involved in that young person’s
life.</hs_Para>

my hon. Friend when I recently gave evidence to the Education Committee
on this issue, if I believed that including children’s homes and
staying-put arrangements was the right thing to do at this juncture, I
would do it in a heartbeat. However, I think it would be premature to
place a new duty on local authorities now or to pilot a scheme before
the work being carried out by the National Children’s Bureau is
completed. I also think such a move would be wrong when we know there
needs to be fundamental reform of children’s homes, as the 2012
report by the Deputy Children’s Commissioner and the all-party
group on runaway and missing children and adults illustrated so
clearly.</hs_Para>

wholeheartedly agree with my hon. Friend that children’s homes
should not be seen as a last resort and should be a positive option for
many, as I have said on several previous occasions in public and am
happy to reiterate this evening. However, too many current homes are
simply not good enough. He has said that Ofsted inspection reports show
that most homes are rated as “good”, but that is under
the current system of national minimum standards. Although there are
undoubtedly some excellent children’s homes, and we should
applaud them and try to encourage what they do well to be spread more
widely, we do not think these standards—the “good”
standards—are good enough, and neither do many of the children
and young people in residential care. We want to raise the bar and move
to much higher quality
standards.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012184002226" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0004.htm#14012184002226">Young
people living in residential care are more likely to make an early
transition from care at aged 16 compared with those living in foster
care. Those who do leave at 
<?notus-xml column=276?>that stage are less likely to be in education, training and employment,
as my hon. Friend said. That is why I have introduced a new duty that
directors of children’s services must sign off the pathway plan
where it suggests a young person should leave care between the ages of
16 and 18. As I said a few moments ago, research has found
that many young people are dissatisfied with the support they receive,
and report shortfalls in planning and preparation for leaving care,
which leaves their needs
unmet.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012184002227" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0004.htm#14012184002227">Our
immediate priority is to press ahead with driving up the quality of
residential care, and we have set out a substantial programme of work
to do that. We also want to test out new ways of delivering residential
care via the children’s services innovation programme I recently
announced. It will catalyse the development and spread of more
effective ways of supporting children and of new approaches to
commissioning—the point my hon. Friend the Member for East
Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton) made—and managing that
support. Part of that may well include a move away from spot purchasing
and towards more regional commissioning, as well as the extension of a
children’s homes remit further into adulthood. Our approach will
build on the call for change from the field, as evident in the
Association of Directors of Children’s Services “What is

children’s homes.</hs_Para>

the developing, testing and implementation of the most promising
approaches both in delivery and around the structure of services. I
encourage all those who want to see improvements in residential care
and its role in the transition to adulthood to come forward with their
own ideas as to how best to achieve just that. We must get the system
right before considering whether to run pilots or impose a duty on
local authorities that requires them to provide staying-put
arrangements in children’s homes. We must be confident that
homes can offer children provision of the highest standard and that the
£1 billion per year that we spend on placements in
children’s homes is truly delivering for those living in
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012184002229" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/debtext/140121-0004.htm#14012184002229">As
I said at the beginning of my speech, this all comes against the
backdrop of a wider reform package for care leavers. It is important to
remind the House that, to date: the Government have launched the care
leavers’ charter, which sets out the support that care leavers
can expect right up to the age of 25, with more than 120 local
authorities now signed up; we have introduced the junior independent
savings account for all care leavers, with more than 40,000 accounts
now open, and with a £200 contribution from government; I have
written to all local authorities calling for a dramatic improvement in
financial support for care leavers, resulting in a tripling in the
number of councils now paying £2,000 or more through the setting
up home allowance; and we have published the first cross-government
care leavers strategy, which sets out in one place the steps government
is taking, from housing to health services, and from the justice system
to educational institutions, to support care leavers to live
independently once they have left their placement.</hs_Para>

Hollobone, to speak under your chairmanship. I am grateful to the
Backbench Business Committee for allowing one of its first Tuesday
morning debates in Westminster Hall to be about this important issue.
Following last night’s positive cross-party debate on the recent
report on the payday loan sector by the Select Committee on Business,
Innovation and Skills, this debate allows us to expand on a vital and
timely matter, which was subject to a key recommendation in that
report.</hs_Para>

particularly welcome the cross-party support for this debate from the
Chair of the Select Committee, from its Labour members, including
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T09:31:04"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

debate is timely because, over the next year, the payday lending sector
and other high-cost lenders will begin to be regulated by the Financial
Conduct Authority and to pay the levy that it raises to cover the costs
of regulation and to fund the Money Advice Service—and, through
that, the provision of free debt advice services.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14012167000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000010">Hon. Members
will be as surprised as I was to note that, until now, the highest-cost
lenders have not had to make the same contribution to free debt advice
services as their competitors in the banks and the credit unions. That
has been unjustifiable, but I am glad that, thanks to changes made by
the Government and the FCA, such lenders will shortly be making at
least that contribution in future. However, there is concern that if
the machinery of regulation and the levy remain as they stand, and no
guidance is provided, the opportunity for those lenders to contribute
additional resource to free debt advice services might be
missed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012167000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000011">Another
reason why this debate comes at a crucial time is that the Money Advice
Service is negotiating with free debt advice services over their future
three-year plans and budgets. Almost all hon. Members will benefit from
the important work that the likes of the citizens advice bureaux do in
our constituencies, and will recognise the enormous value to
constituents of being able to access free, timely and impartial debt
advice. I value highly the work of Worcester CAB, Worcester Housing and
Benefits Advice Centre and other small debt advice charities such as
Two Pennies Money Advice and Christians Against Poverty. I am grateful
to all those organisations,  
<?notus-xml column=2?>as well as to national charities such as StepChange, for their work with
constituents and for the information they provided to inform this and
other debates.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14012167000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000012">A key way in
which the free debt advice sector is funded is through the Money Advice
Service and that, in turn, is funded through the FCA’s levy. The
problem was discovered by a cross-party group of MPs who have been
working together on these issues; I am grateful to the hon. Members for
Sheffield
Central<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T09:33:19"></hs_TimeCode>, for
Glasgow North<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T09:33:21"></hs_TimeCode>
and for Makerfield (Yvonne Fovargue), and to my hon. Friend the Member

the FCA sees itself as a collection organisation for the levy, with
powers to agree what is put to it, but not to set the terms of the levy
or measure the demand for debt advice services. Meanwhile, the Money
Advice Service has been under pressure to show that it is delivering
value for money and running efficiently, and its representatives have
told me and other hon. Members that it has no current plans to ask for
an increased budget in the years to come. If things remain as they are,
we could miss the opportunity offered by the fact that new
organisations will be paying the levy and contributing at last to the
budget for free financial advice; their contributions could be
cancelled out by a levelling down of the charges to other financial
institutions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012167000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000014">I
recognise that some colleagues, and even the Treasury Committee, are
worried about the cost of regulation encompassed in the current levy,
and I do not want to rule out a reduction in the contribution to the
levy of other financial organisations. I have no reason to object to
any such changes, but I want to ensure that they are not made at the
cost of funding valuable and necessary support for free financial
advice.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012167000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000015">I
also recognise that there is a legitimate debate about the role of the
Money Advice Service, and that it has been the subject of reports by
the National Audit Office and the Treasury Committee. The latter
recommended a full independent review of its work and questioned
whether it should continue at all. However, today’s debate is
not the avenue for taking forward that particular discussion. If we
accept that the Money Advice Service is the established channel for
allocating funds to the free debt advice sector and that its
negotiations with free debt advice providers are likely to set the
limits of lenders’ financial contributions to the sector, we
must show political leadership in calling for those limits to be
raised.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012167000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000016">I
would like the proceeds of the levy for debt advice to be allocated
among an even wider group of organisations, including some of the
smaller players in the voluntary free debt advice sector, alongside the
major providers, but that is also an argument for another time. I note
that the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux confirms in
its briefing that the six lead organisations work with more than 240
smaller organisations to deliver free debt
advice.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012167000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000017">In
previous debates on high-cost credit, I have advocated the advantages
of a levy on the highest-cost lenders to create a competitive advantage
for more affordable lenders such as credit unions. I have pointed out
that if such a levy were related to the rates of interest charged and
the extent to which they go beyond the existing  cap on credit
union lending, that could create a virtuous circle whereby the growth
of the high-cost lending market would fund ever greater provision of
debt advice 
<?notus-xml column=3?>or the availability of more debt advice might direct borrowers to
cheaper forms of debt, such as credit unions. I still believe strongly
that such a system is desirable, but I recognise that it is not what we
currently have. As a pragmatist, I want to make the system that we have
work
better.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012167000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000018">Charities
such as StepChange have made a clear case that the high-cost lending
industry in general, and payday lenders in particular, are contributing
to the growth in demand for free debt advice. As the BIS Committee
report reflected, tens of thousands of people have been put into severe
financial difficulty by taking out loans that turned out to be
unaffordable for them. They are in addition to the hundreds of
thousands who struggle to meet their obligations and the millions for
whom short-term, high-cost loans might not be the best financial
choice.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012167000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000019">StepChange
and citizens advice bureaux have reported rising numbers of people
seeking advice as a result of getting into trouble with payday loans.
The latter reported that the number doubled in the last year alone, and
the former referred to a sevenfold increase over five years. Citizens
advice bureaux highlighted that, in the last four years, there has been
a tenfold increase in the proportion of clients receiving casework help
with multiple debts that included a payday loan debt. They also
reported many problems with people taking out multiple payday loans,
and I hope that the speedy introduction of real-time data sharing and
action on rollovers will address
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012167000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000020">However,
we should not believe that, just because regulatory action is being
taken on some of the most pressing issues of high-cost credit, all the
problems will go away. Research by the Money Advice Service shows that
8.8 million people in the UK are over-indebted and, of those, 1.9
million are considering seeking advice. Although levels of household
indebtedness have come down from a peak during the last Government,
they remain well above long-term
averages.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012167000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000021">The
evidence of the last few years is that demand for short-term, high-cost
products is here to stay, and that consumers put a greater premium on
ease of access than on price in many transactions. That point was well
made in yesterday’s debate. There is a vital role for the free
debt advice sector in ensuring that consumers understand the true cost
of the financial decisions they are taking. The FCA’s current
guidelines include recommendations for greater signposting to free debt
advice services. Such signposting, although welcome, is likely to
create more demand on a sector already under financial
pressure.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14012167000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000022">I do not
intend to go into a long discussion of the financial and fiscal
difficulties that the Government inherited, but one consequence has
inevitably been pressure on the direct and indirect funding of free
debt advice services. Whatever our political views on that—those
are likely to differ from one side of the House to the
other—hon. Members of all parties should welcome an opportunity
to secure funding for these very important services at no cost to the
taxpayer and at no risk of being removed by political necessity further
down the line.</hs_Para>

greater funding through the FCA levy would achieve that aim. In its

payday loans come under the authority of the FCA, they will be subject

services.”</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="14012167000024" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000024">Similarly,

Debt Charity believes the inclusion of payday lenders and other
consumer credit firms as levy payers should be used to significantly
boost funding for free debt advice. It should not be used to level down
the total payments other financial services organisations have to make.
The OFT says around a third of payday loans lead to repayment problems,
suggesting the strain lenders place on debt advice is exceptionally
high. StepChange Debt Charity believes the contribution different
financial services firms make to debt advice should be based on the
level of detriment they cause as well as the firm’s size. Payday
lenders cause a disproportionate level of consumer harm relative to the
amounts they lend; relative to turnover, they should therefore pay more
towards debt
advice.”<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T09:39:51"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T09:39:51"></hs_TimeCode></hs_brev><hs_Para UID="14012167000025" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000025">In

progress has been made on the regulation of high-cost lending in recent

lenders will be paying the FCA’s levy and the bizarre anomaly of
their not contributing while credit unions did is at last being dealt

for today’s debate is simple: the need for free and independent
debt advice is growing, which is due in no small part to the
unscrupulous practices of payday loan companies. We now have a unique
opportunity to tackle the problem without cost to the public purse.
Payday lenders, as
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T09:43:19"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Gentleman pointed out, will soon have to pay the FCA levy to fund free
debt advice. When they do, we need to ensure that they pay an amount
commensurate to the problems that they cause and, crucially, that the
total pot of money collected increases to fund the additional advice
that is needed. There certainly should not be any levelling down of
payments simply because more financial service companies will be paying
the levy.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14012167000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000034"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T09:43:51"></hs_TimeCode>As
has been pointed out, the Money Advice Service is consulting on its
draft business plan as we speak. Extraordinarily, it is suggesting
keeping the budget for debt advice unchanged. That cannot be right and,
to my mind, it brings into question the organisation’s judgment.
MAS’s own research, which was conducted last year by YouGov,
indicates
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T09:44:05"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para><hs_brev UID="14012167000191" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000191">“there

estimates that 8.8 million people are over-indebted, from struggling
students to working families, and that only 1.5 million of those people
are getting advice. That is an extraordinary figure, but it is only the
tip of the iceberg, because a further 900,000 have said they were
planning to seek such advice and another 1 million said that they were
actively considering it. The FCA’s very welcome proposal that
payday lenders should signpost borrowers to free debt advice at the
point of roll-over means that the demand for debt advice will only
grow. Indeed, many of us think that the signposting should be on the
initial health warning, too.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14012167000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000036"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T09:45:03"></hs_TimeCode>According
to the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T09:45:02"></hs_TimeCode> Office of
Fair Trading, one in every three people who take out a payday loan seek
debt advice, which is a sure sign of the link between the 
<?notus-xml column=6?>payday loan product and the problems it creates. The number of people
contacting the StepChange debt charity for help with payday loan
problems increased sevenfold between 2008-09 and 2011-12, as has been
pointed out, while Citizens Advice has seen a tenfold increase. In the
past two and a half months, my local advice bureau said that it had one
new case resulting from payday loans every day. One new case might not
seem a problem, but in a stretched local advice it
is, given that these are complex
problems—they involve not quick interventions, but detailed
engagement in which people need considerable support.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T09:45:52"></hs_TimeCode>As I said, those
who are actively seeking help at the moment are just the tip of the
iceberg.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14012167000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000037"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T09:46:02"></hs_TimeCode>As
well as increasing overall funding for free debt advice, it is
important that the FCA looks again at how it calculates the levy paid
by each firm. For example, StepChange has argued that rather than
looking at a firm’s income and write-off rate—companies
would, perversely, be encouraged to pursue vulnerable borrowers more
aggressively if having fewer write-offs was rewarded—a better
formula for calculating the levy would take account of default rates,
the number of complaints made about lenders to the Financial Ombudsman
Service and intelligence on repayment difficulties from debt advice
agencies. The aim of the levy, after all, is to fund support for people
when things go wrong. If the business model of the payday lending
industry means that things go wrong relatively often, the lenders,
rather than profiting from that, need to pay to help to pick up the
pieces.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14012167000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000038"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T09:46:51"></hs_TimeCode>None
of the arguments that will be made this morning negate the need for
better regulation, and many of us who are in the room made that case
yesterday in the Chamber. If such regulation works, we might look
forward to a time when there is less need for debt advice. That would
be something that we could welcome, and we could review the levy at
that stage, but at the moment there is more need for debt advice, so we
should not miss the opportunity for it to be funded by those
responsible for the problems. I hope that the Minister will reassure
us, while recognising that this is a decision for MAS and the FCA, that
he and the Government will support such a funding
increase.</hs_Para>

see you in the Chair, Mr Hollobone, and I thank the Backbench Business

congratulating
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T09:47:43"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Worcester (Mr Walker) on bringing the subject to
Westminster Hall and his overall leadership on the issue, which he has
pursued consistently and
compellingly<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T09:48:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012167000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000040">We
all know the true human cost of problem debt, because we hear about it
all the time in our constituency surgeries and from our local citizens
advice bureaux, such as mine in Alton, Petersfield and Bordon. Problems
often start when someone gets a little overstretched and then a shock
happens, such as them losing their job, suffering a bereavement, or
facing an enormous unexpected expense. As we know, couples are often
reluctant to talk about money. Letters are left unopened, but calls and
demands get more frequent. It might be that an enticing ad leads
someone to borrow even more money, or that they go to a fee-charging
debt management company that seems to offer a solution. Then, at one
point, panic 
<?notus-xml column=7?>sets in. Stress and mental health problems can follow, and great strains
can be placed on relationships—all too
often, the family suffers.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14012167000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000041"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T09:48:58"></hs_TimeCode>At
some point, such a person may decide to seek debt advice. That is the
time when they can begin to take control, make a plan and start to turn
the corner. It is vital that, at that moment, good-quality, free and
impartial debt advice is available. I pay tribute, alongside others, to
the work done by citizens advice bureaux, StepChange—formerly
the Consumer Credit Counselling Service—and others in that
regard<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T09:49:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012167000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000042">This
debate is particularly timely because the FCA and the Money Advice
Service are
considering<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T09:40:08"></hs_TimeCode> how
to levy and how to use funds from payday lenders to provide money
advice and debt advice. The FCA levies two sums for the Money Advice
Service: the money advice levy, which funds MAS directly; and the debt
advice levy, which is onward allocated to third parties providing debt
advice. Those organisations rely heavily on that funding from MAS, and
all the more so because of the strains on public finances. It is worth
saying, however, that there is another source of funding from lenders
in the form of fair-share agreements and other contributions that they
make to some of those
charities<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T09:50:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012167000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000043">Soon
payday lenders, too, will have to contribute to the debt advice levy. I
think that we all welcome that development, but we understand that, as
things stand, it may not lead to an increase in the total pot available
for debt advice, but rather that the budget would be held flat, with
decreases in the contributions from other lenders to compensate for the
new source from payday
lenders<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T09:50:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012167000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000044">Our
focus today is on payday lenders, which make up the most visible part
of the market, given their sponsorship of TV shows and adverts on the
sides of buses. However, payday lending is certainly not the only part
of the high-cost, sub-prime market, or the only part that causes
problems. Home credit lenders—doorstep lenders as they are
sometimes known—logbook loans, rent-to-own and good old
catalogues are all significant players in the high-cost sector, as are
mainstream prime operators when people get into trouble. At a time when
payday lenders are becoming subject to the levy, we have a good
opportunity to ensure that total funding for debt advice is increased,
which would help to put advice organisations on a more stable, firmer
footing<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T09:51:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012167000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000045">Moreover,
there is good evidence that payday loans generate a disproportionate
number of debt problems. My hon. Friend the Member for Worcester
referred to the
StepChange<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T09:51:31"></hs_TimeCode>
statistics showing that although the payday market doubled in size
between 2008-09 and 2011-12, the number of people contacting the
charity with payday loan problems grew sevenfold over that period. As
the sector grows further—I am afraid that it does, and it
probably is not about to stop growing—it is important that the
availability of debt advice keeps
up<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T09:52:00"></hs_TimeCode> with that
growth.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012167000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000046">There
is a particular area due to which I assume that debt advice providers
face above-inflation cost increases: online—so-called pay per
click—advertising. Its pricing model involves an auction
element, and those who make money out of people’s debts have an
incentive to bid higher, so there is a tendency for costs to spiral. If
debt advice providers are to be able to compete, as it were, on the
internet, they need to be able to afford that.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=8?><hs_Para UID="14012167000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000047">It is
important that we stress two things today, the first of which is a will
for the total amount of funding available for debt advice
to grow. Secondly, we need to give some input on
how firms should contribute. As we consider those two things, there are
two funding principles that should in turn underpin them. The first is
a principle that has long existed in the debt
advice sector: the beneficiary pays. When a
creditor stands to regain some of what they are owed, it is right and
fair—and, in fact, in their interests—that they support
the organisations facilitating that. Secondly, a key principle of
economics and internalising externalities is the concept that the
polluter pays. In this case, that means that those associated with the
greatest numbers of knock-on problems should contribute the
most<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T09:53:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012167000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000048">I
think that the argument for a larger total pot of funding from the
industry is self-evident, but I also want to say something about the
formula that is applied, which was touched on by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T09:53:42"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Sheffield Central (Paul Blomfield). The FCA recognises that there
are certain higher-risk operators and parts of the market, and that
they should contribute more. I understand that the basis of the levy
would be a split—50:50, I think—between an element based
on the firm’s size and one based on the amount of debt that it
writes off, with the idea being that the amount of debt written off is
a proxy for riskiness or consumer harm. That principle is good but,
like the hon. Gentleman, I worry about the specifics. Such a measure
may tend to under-charge newer operators. By definition, when operators
are new to the market, they do not have any debts being written
off—that takes some time. It may also deter some firms from
writing off debt and instead, as he said, they will use more aggressive
collection
techniques<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T09:54:33"></hs_TimeCode>. More
generally, if there is one thing that we have learned from the field of
education and the metric of achieving five or more GCSEs at grade C or
above, it is that if we give people one big hairy metric to be measured
on, they will find 14 ways around it. Instead, we need a more balanced
scorecard<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T09:54:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012167000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000049">Obviously,
there is another balance to be struck: accuracy versus simplicity. It
could be argued that the amount of money that goes from the profit and
loss to the debt advice levy is so small that it is
unlikely, relatively speaking, to drive gaming, but I do
believe that a slightly more nuanced formula would be
useful. It could perhaps include—we may have slightly different
lists, and I am not an expert—a broader range of
things, such as the age of the debt due, numbers of consumer
complaints and so on. I hope that the FCA will consider
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012167000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000050">We

free debt advice is rising, which is not surprising, given the cost of
much short-term credit and the desperate financial situation that many
people face due to unemployment, under-employment, rising prices and
stagnant incomes. There are a great many people
with problem debt. According to the MAS report, as we have heard, 8.8
million people—18% of the UK adult population—are
over-indebted but, as we also hear, not all of them seek debt advice.
In fact, the same report from MAS shows that only 17% of such people
are actively seeking advice, so many people are not receiving the
advice that they almost certainly
need.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012167000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000053">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T09:56:45"></hs_TimeCode>re
are various reasons why people do not seek advice. I have talked about
the “behind the clock” syndrome: when people are too
frightened to open envelopes and just always put them behind the clock,
until the clock drops off the mantelpiece. For some people, the reason
is stigma—they cannot admit that they are in debt, as they see
being in debt as a failure. However, for many others, the reason is
simply a lack of signposting or the fact that if they have decided that
they need debt advice, they will ring the local CAB or charity to ask
for debt advice only quite often to be told that there is a six-week
waiting list. After plucking up the courage to make the call, a great
number of people are put off when they are told that they have to wait
another six weeks. However, that may change soon, when payday loan
advertising is required to provide information about sources of debt
advice. People will then know where to go. We have to assume that more
people will be seeking debt advice and that therefore more debt advice
will be
needed<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T09:57:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012167000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000054">Of
course, the extra debt advice must be paid for. It might be free for
the client—rightly so—but it is not free to provide. In
fact, it is expensive to provide such advice, especially face-to-face
advice, although I make a plea now that face-to-face advice is
available. That applies even to people who normally can deal with their
problems. The worst debt case that I saw involved an accountant who
just could not face the fact that she could not deal with her debts.
She had to be seen face to face; she could not have dealt with the
matter over the telephone. Face-to-face advice is expensive, but
valuable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012167000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000055">It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T09:58:18"></hs_TimeCode>

level. A freeze in the levy implies that current firms’
contributions will be reduced, on the basis that more firms will be
contributing to the same pot. If that is the case, this is truly a
missed opportunity. We do not want to squeeze firms dry or punish them,
but it is appropriate that the inclusion of payday lending firms should
trigger more funding for debt advice.</hs_Para>

against the payday lending industry, but that is not to say that it
does not contribute greatly to the financial problems of a great many
people—it does, and the problems are increasing at an alarming
rate. In the past four years, Citizens Advice has seen a tenfold
increase in the proportion of clients receiving casework help with
multiple debts, including payday loan debt. When I left the bureau in
2010, although I had seen plenty of people with home credit, I had
never seen a client with a payday loan, so there has been a big
explosion in the practice since then. In the first quarter of 2009-10,
1% of citizens advice bureaux casework clients had a payday loan, but
in the same quarter of 2012-13, 10% had at least one payday loan, which
represents huge growth.</hs_Para>

mentioned that StepChange has dealt with a sevenfold increase in payday
loan debt problems in the past five years. That increase far outstrips
the growth of the industry, which doubled during that period. The
average payday loan debt is £1,665, which has risen a third in
two years. The fact is that payday lenders cause disproportionate
consumer detriment, so there is a strong case for saying, as the hon.
Member for East Hampshire (Damian Hinds) and my hon. Friend the Member
for Sheffield Central have done, that their contribution to the levy
should reflect that. There seems to be an assumption that the levy will
reflect firms’ income and the level of debt that is written off.
I share my hon. Friend’s concern that that will encourage payday
lenders to pursue people even more aggressively. If the size of the
levy does not reflect the detriment caused by the industry, payday
lenders will be getting off far too lightly.</hs_Para>

ensure that the overall levy pot is increased substantially when the
payday loan firms are regulated by the FCA because free debt advice is
vital and can make all the difference to people’s lives. A
YouGov survey undertaken by the Money Advice Service showed that
individuals with a manageable debt who sought debt advice were almost
twice as likely to have their debt become manageable than those who had
not sought advice. Supporting people with financial burdens can help in
other ways, too, including with family relationships and mental health,
and by sustaining employment.</hs_Para>

done to help people in crisis, and we have an opportunity to ensure
that payday loan firms accept at least some of the burden of the
problems that they have helped to create. However, we cannot let the
banks and credit companies off, either. They have always contributed to
the levy for debt advice, and their contribution to the overall level
of individual debt has not lessened. The addition of payday lenders to
the pot 
<?notus-xml column=11?>should substantially increase the amount available for free debt advice,
but should not be a way of reducing the
contributions of existing payers. Banks and credit companies are still
responsible for the majority of personal indebtedness and they should
continue to pay at least as much as they do
now.</hs_Para>

small areas. I am the chair of the all-party group on financial
education for young people, and I am delighted that the Government have
supported our calls to include financial education in the national
curriculum. That drove my support for the idea that we are debating.
Underlining all our work, research by the Nationwide building society
shows that 91% of people who get into financial difficulty say,
“If only I had known better.” Hindsight is a wonderful
thing, but we live in an increasingly complex financial world, partly
because we are bombarded by marketing and partly because nowadays
direct debits, standing orders, roll-overs and all sorts of other
things encourage us to get into debt. If something happens—a
bereavement, the loss of a job or a family breakdown, for
example—people who have traditionally been good at managing
their money quickly become overwhelmed. Because they understand that
there is a problem, they might think “I will not go out at the
weekend. I will not spend any money.” When they look at their
bank account on Monday, however, they find that all the direct debits
and standing orders have gone out and they quickly become
overwhelmed.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Gosport (Caroline Dinenage) will shortly tell us
that such problems affect not only young consumers but existing ones.
Although it is brilliant that the Government are supporting financial
education, it will take generations for the benefits to filter through
and to ensure that consumers are equipped with the skills to make
informed decisions. That will not end the problem, but it will
certainly help to tackle it. We must also tackle the situation faced by
people today. The YouGov survey that the hon. Member for Makerfield
(Yvonne Fovargue) cited showed that those who get face-to-face debt
advice are twice as likely as those who do not to get their debts into
a manageable situation in 12 months.</hs_Para>

hon. Lady’s comment about putting envelopes behind the clock,
because it sums up the situation very well. People come to our
surgeries with a carrier bag full of unopened envelopes, having passed
the point when they should really have tackled the situation to reach a
position at which they are completely overwhelmed. We do our level best
to help them, and we have organised training with our local citizens
advice 
<?notus-xml column=12?>bureau so that my staff know the best way to deal with such issues as
swiftly as possible. The reality, however, is that
it is costly for organisations such as StepChange or Citizens Advice to
sit down with people, unravel the complex mess in which they have found
themselves and start to broker deals that will allow them to get back
on the right path.</hs_Para>

support the need for face-to-face debt advice. If money from the levy
is to go to the Money Advice Service, which commissions services from
several different organisations, it should be ring-fenced for
face-to-face debt advice. People should not simply be pointed to a
website, because that approach has not worked. That might help
consumers who already kind of know what they are doing to go that bit
further, but people in real distress can be helped only by face-to-face
debt advice. I also support calls for the funding to be additional so
that it provides for additional face-to-face advice, rather than the
new money simply offsetting the current levies that the banks pay.
Although payday lending makes a big contribution to the increasing
complexity of our world, other factors are also involved, so we need to
increase funding rather than simply offsetting it.</hs_Para>

ensure that debt advice is clearly signposted, because consumers often
do not realise that they can get help. When an individual takes out a
loan, there should be a clear sign—a bit like the health
warnings on tobacco products—giving them a telephone number to
call or a website to visit. Even if people are not yet in a mess, they
can simply ask whether the product is the most suitable one for them
and whether there are other alternatives.</hs_Para>

need to be done and given the FCA greater powers, and the FCA has been
proactive in meeting those of us who have campaigned on the matter. We

debate between the FCA and the Money Advice Service about the demand
for advice services and how best to use the additional funding, which I

heard of payday loans. They have grown like a cancer in the past few
years and led many thousands of our constituents

<?notus-xml column=14?>a spiral of debt and despair. Addressing this growing, innovating and

course, in and of themselves, payday loans are not harmful; it is their
propensity to turn into defaults and rollovers, as well as the
insufficient quality of the advice, that is leading to so much misery.
Unscrupulous traders and the devastating impact of continuous payment
authorities are concerns for all our constituents who have taken out
payday loans. That is why we must do all we can to bring clarity to the
dangerous terms and conditions that leave borrowers caught unawares,

a prophesy worthy of Mystic Meg, my hon. Friend the Member for North
Swindon (Justin Tomlinson) pointed out that I might allude to some
adult literacy and numeracy issues in my speech. He is quite correct.
Recent research conducted by the OECD shows that there are 8.5 million
people in England and Northern Ireland with the numeracy ability of a
ten-year-old child. Payday lenders can seize the opportunity to take
advantage of such individuals, who struggle to keep on top of their
weekly shopping bills, let alone the complex percentages and interest
rates involved in taking out a
loan.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012167000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000080">In
order to strangle the problem at the roots, we need to address the
problem of weak numeracy skills and promote the importance of financial
education. That is why my hon. Friend has done such sterling work in
this field. We cannot leave behind a generation of adults who are
unable to comprehend the staggering interest rates that we see. We must
improve how we signpost adults through debt advice to the numeracy
training that they so desperately need. Independent debt advisers
specialise in providing such a service, and their role in mitigating
against the devastating impacts of payday loans is crucial. Without
such targeted help and support, many of those who fall victim to payday
lenders will be unable to break the cycle of financial
trauma.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012167000081" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000081">Over
the past four years, Citizens Advice estimates that it has seen a
tenfold growth in the demand for debt advice, as many colleagues have
already said. That significant rise has undoubtedly been stimulated by
an increasing dependence on payday loans, which take advantage of some
of the most vulnerable people in our society. One aspect of payday
loans about which I am particularly concerned is refinancing. The
recent review by the Office of Fair Trading revealed that individuals
seeking debt advice had, on average, refinanced their loans at least
four times and were repaying six separate payday loans. Such shocking
figures show the extent of the difficulty that borrowers can get into
before seeking help, as the hon. Member for Makerfield
said.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012167000082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000082">What
we see is not responsible trading. The absence of ready access to
helpful information prevents people from gaining the necessary autonomy
that they need to put a stop to successive borrowing. Although the
FCA’s proposal to force payday lenders to signpost borrowers to
debt advice will promote greater responsibility and hopefully
discourage the selling of unaffordable loans, it will also place even
greater pressure on organisations that have limited resources.
Therefore, like many colleagues, I strongly advocate the new powers
that the FCA will  
<?notus-xml column=15?>have to levy all consumer credit firms to help to fund the MAS. We must
ensure, however, that the level of payment is commensurate with the
problem.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012167000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000083">Consumer
choice is a paramount factor in the issue of payday loans. Individuals
must be well informed and aware of the risks before and during their
engagement with payday lenders. That is why debt advisers are so
important and must be provided with the financial resources needed to
continue their good work. It is also important to emphasise that we are
not seeking to eliminate the access to credit streams that provide a
safety net to many of the lowest paid. However, such borrowing
opportunities must be subject to rigorous regulation and injected with
the responsibility needed to bring about greater consumer advice and
confidence.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="14012167000084" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000084">10.18

significance of the BIS Committee’s recommendation on
ring-fencing may have fallen below the radar. Certainly, in the
numerous interviews that I have done with the media, I have yet to be

that this is not just a dry academic issue. Debt advice does not sound
very exciting, but I was first confronted with its importance in
deprived areas when I was approached by my members of my local branch
of Christians Against Poverty, based at St Matthew’s church in
Tipton, who wanted me to see the work that they had done. I have
attended events run by the branch and talked to people who have spoken
of the life-transformative experience of taking advice from Christians
Against Poverty and adhering to the organisation’s
recommendations and support. They were so grateful that it was almost
unbelievable. It was very moving. Make no mistake: debt advice is not
just about somebody sitting in an armchair talking to people on the

very important, and there is a danger if MAS goes for a flatline

will continue to increase—the budget is static, meaning that an
increasing number of people would not be able to access the 
<?notus-xml column=16?>support that they need to transform their lives. I support the
recommendations made by the previous speakers. I will not go into all
the detail, as they have argued the case effectively and I realise that
others want to contribute to this debate, but to finish, I will say one
thing to the Minister: this is an easy win. It does not cost the
Government anything. Politically, it would be highly popular across the
board to ensure that the major contributors to the problem fund at
least part of the solution.</hs_Para>

positive side. The negative side is that the social cost of people
running into heavy debt and the potential impact on families can be so
devastating that the Government will incur costs by picking up the bill
for the resulting social breakdown and deprivation. If the Government
ignore the opportunity to get more money from the private sector that
is creating the problem, they will incur greater social problems with a
price tag, and they will have to pick up the tab. That is illogical and
incoherent. There is an easy win that has popular and political
support. It will benefit Government finances in the long run and

sure that it is due to the Committee’s good judgment rather than
simple coincidence that we had a Backbench Business debate on payday
loan companies last night in the main Chamber, followed by this one.
The two debates are linked, and it adds value to be able to follow last
night’s discussion with this one. There were 17 Back-Bench

opportunity to lay out a range of reasons why tougher action is needed

improved.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012167000092" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000092">When
I first saw that this debate was going to be about the levy, I feared
slightly that people would think the issue was only a technical one and
not quite as important, but it has been useful to hear a number of
speeches linking the principles of what needs to be done on payday
lending and regulation and how it can be put into practice for the
greater good. It has been heartening to hear that from Members from all
parties; we have not got bogged down in the technicalities of the levy,
as we might easily have done.</hs_Para>

has gone through the Library briefing—I am sure that everyone
here has, although perhaps people outside this room have
not—knows that it explains in great detail how the levy is
calculated and the various different sections and categories. The
Minister may want to say something about that and whether, in the
longer term, he has any plans to review the levy further. 
<?notus-xml column=17?>I know that the Government always say that they keep everything under

approach—but it might be useful to hear from him whether he has
any further work to do on that.</hs_Para>

that although better regulation is of course important, it is also
important that we continue to ensure that proper debt advice is
available. In his opening speech,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T10:26:48"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Worcester made the key point that there is a danger that the
Financial Conduct Authority might simply be seen as a collection
agency. Several speakers made the point that the Money Advice Service
has a flatline budget—I hesitate to use that word—but the
Government are not seeking to increase the budget, at a time when we
have all heard about and know the pressures on various organisations
that provide support. That is a potential problem, and I hope that the
Minister will address it in his reply.</hs_Para>

ensure that the cost of regulation does not take up all the available
resources. That is why I highlight the point about the complexity of
the levy as it currently operates. We do not want the FCA and MAS to
spend all their time trying to administer it, so that resources do not
get to the front line. Another key point made is that we do not want
the amount of advice available to be reduced.</hs_Para>

by my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T10:28:21"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Friend the Member for Sheffield Central (Paul Blomfield), who has a
long track record of campaigning on payday loan issues, as do the
majority—in fact, all—of the hon. Members here. He made
the point early on that we have a unique opportunity to tackle the
problem without additional cost to the public purse, a point reiterated
by my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T10:28:48"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Friend the Member for West Bromwich West (Mr Bailey). I am sure that it
will always be attractive to the Treasury, when we have a problem, if
we can identify a potential solution that will not cause additional
cost to the public purse, especially at a time when we are trying, as I
am sure the Minister will mention, to reduce the deficit and look to
the future. That ought to be considered.</hs_Para>

certainly be concerned by any suggestion that the changes to get more
companies paying the levy by bringing them into the scope of the
regulation would mean a levelling down in terms of what they pay. The
point about the payday loan companies, which has been emphasised in a
number of debates, is their potential detriment to individuals, because
of the way they operate. They should certainly not get off the hook,

identified.</hs_Para>

am also concerned about an issue that was raised in the briefings that
I have been provided with, for example by Citizens Advice and the
StepChange charity. We must not have a perverse incentive whereby the
system would mean, for example, that on the issue of write-offs
companies were somehow moving to operate in a way that would be
detrimental to the individual debtor, so that those companies could
somehow avoid paying what would be seen as their fair share of the
levy. 
<?notus-xml column=18?>Lenders should pick up the bill for some of that levy. Again, I hope the

for North Swindon (Justin Tomlinson) who referred to carrier bags. I do
not want to make this debate sound like a competition, but I spent many
years as a front-line social worker providing a lot of welfare benefits
advice, among other things. I recall occasions when people had large
black bin bags full of information. What never ceased to amaze me at
the time was the fact that people had kept all of the paperwork,
including every letter that had come in. Quite often, those papers were
stacked in fairly neat order, with elastic bands around them, but they
were not then dealt with; they had simply been put away because the
problem they related to was too difficult to deal with.</hs_Para>

thing that I learned from those experiences was that we do people no

a pamphlet, is not enough; it ought to be an introduction to them, so

people who have literacy and numeracy problems, which are often picked

to tell people before then, but the problem becomes very apparent in a

solution. Recently I visited a community primary school in my
constituency where the local anti-loan sharking team were holding an
assembly, which was entirely funded by money confiscated from illegal
loan sharks. That is one example of how good work can be funded with no
direct cost to the taxpayer and is this debate not another example of

Also, can he say whether or not he can ensure at this crucial stage
that all the organisations are brought together for further discussion?
I am almost hesitant to say this again, but, as I have already said,
there is sometimes a danger that people involved on the Treasury side

were made in the debate in the main Chamber last night. As she said,
the FCA is a new organisation and it has been given a wide-ranging

the specific issue of the levy slip through the net.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T10:36:46"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for West Bromwich West referred to the recommendation for a
levy in the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee report as the

Minister, who has been listening intently, will have heard the view
expressed in both debates on this subject—last night and

issue, and hopefully people from the FCA and MAS have heard that too.
There may be other areas where we would disagree, but there has been a
genuine consensus on this issue, which 
<?notus-xml column=20?>has built up during months, if not years, of campaigning by individuals
who have been very committed to tackling this problem and by
organisations that have been absolutely at the sharp end and see it
every day. Those individuals and organisations have
the ideas both to deal with the problems when they are identified
and—crucially—to put in place preventive measures. There
was some discussion of those measures last night, which include, for
example, action on advertising, education and so on, so that we can try
to prevent people getting into debt in the first place. However,
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T10:29:34"></hs_TimeCode>if they do get
into debt, the correct services must be there for them, not only to

Government believe that consumers should have access to free,
independent money and debt advice. The Money Advice Service has the
important job of ensuring that consumers get that advice. The
Government want to empower consumers to manage their money well and to
make responsible financial decisions, which is where MAS’s money
advice role comes in. However, as we have heard, for consumers facing
difficulties with debts, the first step in getting those debts under
control is debt advice, and MAS also has a role to play in that regard.
Money advice can help consumers to keep on top of their finances and
stop them getting into problems in the first
place.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012167000118" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000118">Let
me say something about payday lending generally, because it is
connected to consumer detriment issues, which we heard about both
yesterday and today. As well as giving MAS responsibility for ensuring
that consumers have access to debt advice, the Government are tackling

regulatory system that governs lenders and we are, in particular,
clamping down on payday
lenders.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012167000119" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000119">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T10:41:52"></hs_TimeCode>
Financial Conduct Authority takes on its consumer credit

have far stronger powers over lenders than the OFT has, and it will be
more nimble, meaning it is able to keep pace with a fast-moving market.
The FCA is already flexing its regulatory muscle in advance of taking
on regulatory responsibility for high street lenders. It plans to cap
roll-overs, hold payday lenders to account on affordability
assessments, curb the misuse of continuous payment authorities, and
mandate risk warnings on payday lending adverts that signpost borrowers

provide.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012167000120" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000120">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T10:43:04"></hs_TimeCode>
Government have taken decisive action to tackle the harm caused by the
cost of payday loans. In the Financial Services (Banking Reform) Act
2013, we gave the FCA a clear mandate and duty to put a cap on the cost
of payday loans by the beginning of 2015. This is not just an interest
rate cap, but a cap on all fees and charges associated with a payday
loan including, of course, default charges and
roll-overs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012167000121" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000121">As
we have heard—I agree with hon. Members about this—the
provision of debt advice is vital. Free debt advice is currently funded
by a levy on financial services lenders, which stand to benefit from
advice that helps borrowers to get back on their feet and in control of
their borrowing again. Once the responsibility for consumer credit
transfers to the FCA, it is absolutely right that the levy begins to
apply to consumer credit firms including, of course, payday
lenders.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012167000122" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000122">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T10:44:17"></hs_TimeCode>

We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T10:44:09"></hs_TimeCode> all agree
that payday lenders must pay their fair share towards the provision of
advice. However, although I listened carefully to points made by my

levy collected from payday lenders should be ring-fenced for debt
advice only and used to top up funding for front-line debt advice, and
I shall now explain why.</hs_Para>

should not consider debt advice separately from money advice. The two
go hand in hand to help consumers to get back in control and to give
them budgeting skills and financial awareness to help them to stay out
of problem debt, which is crucial, as my hon. Friend the Member for
Gosport (Caroline
Dinenage)<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T10:45:02"></hs_TimeCode>said.
We also should not forget that money advice can be vital in helping
those on the brink of taking out a payday loan. It can help them to
understand what they are getting into, how to borrow responsibly, how
to find out whether there are better and cheaper options available, and
whether they should be turning to payday loans at all. As
money<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T10:45:23"></hs_TimeCode> advice
could help to stop people from getting into trouble with payday loans
in the first place, it is right that payday lenders contribute to
funding free money advice and debt advice services.

has said about money advice. The Money Advice Service primarily uses a
website to provide access to money advice. In Glasgow, less than 30% of
those on the lowest incomes have broadband access in their
house<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T10:46:03"></hs_TimeCode>, so the
people who need advice the most are the least able to access it. It is

carefully to what the hon. Lady said, and others have also made that

much more closely at how it provides money advice. The hon. Lady is
right to say that it relies considerably on a website, but it is more
than just a website—there are individuals involved. I listened
to a lengthy recorded call that was an example of how people who wanted
money advice before entering into a financial transaction could be
guided through the process. I saw for myself how that was adding
value<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T10:47:04"></hs_TimeCode>. Although
that was obviously a phone call and not face-to-face advice, it was
more than just web

coming on to how MAS determines its budget. As we all would hope and
expect, the budget is based on demand. More generally, MAS has a
statutory responsibility to consult on its budget for the forthcoming
year. Right now, MAS is consulting on its budget for 2014-15. This
debate, the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee report and the
information from stakeholders, which we have heard about today, are
important in providing MAS with the information it needs to develop its
budget for the future. That makes a big contribution to how MAS decides
the correct allocation of resources for forthcoming
years<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T10:52:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012167000134" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000134">MAS’s
budget is based on what it needs to achieve its statutory objectives.
Although it is right that payday lenders contribute to that funding, it
is also right that the funding is based on demand and that it delivers
value for money. In the year ahead, MAS’s budget for 
<?notus-xml column=24?>debt advice will be based on its assessment of demand for such advice.
MAS must consult on its plans for providing debt

FCA.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012167000135" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000135">The
National Audit Office recently commended MAS for delivering value for
money in its debt advice provision. As we have heard, MAS is also
carrying out ongoing research to ensure that the debt advice it funds
has the best impact on consumers and that it reaches those who need it
most. MAS recently conducted an in-depth study of where in the UK debt
advice is needed most. The study shows that 21% of over-indebted people
do not even recognise that they are in debt and that 44% of people who
are in debt are not aware of the solutions available to them. It is
important that MAS reaches such people and engages with them
successfully to give them the help that they need. MAS will use the
report to inform how it funds debt advice, thereby ensuring that it
targets those who need it most. It is important to note that more money
does not necessarily mean better

mean better provision, but the Minister has acknowledged that there is
increased demand and that that increased demand is only the tip of the
iceberg. He will also know that many of those delivering services on
the ground have been hard pressed because of the reduction in other
resources, especially those available through local authority funding.
In many parts of the country, citizens advice bureaux are trying very
hard to reorganise provision. In my own city of Sheffield, there is a
comprehensive reorganisation to deliver value for money and ensure that
the challenge can be met. Nevertheless, given the escalating demand for
debt advice, which he has acknowledged, would he not also acknowledge

number of sessions is somewhat concerning because it is easy to provide
a one-off session to someone with one debt. Providing for ongoing work
with individuals with a high number of small debts, who continually
have to write to creditors, is what costs time and requires expertise,
which is why such organisations need paid staff with a high level of
expertise. Such staff also help those people with money advice, because
they identify the difference between priority debts and non-priority

My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T10:56:50"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Worcester is right that debt advice should be funded
appropriately to meet demand and to provide services that directly
benefit consumers. Last year, 94% of MAS’s £34.5 million
budget for debt advice was spent on front-line delivery services. MAS
aims to provide 150,000 debt advice sessions this year; last year, it

there is £38 million of Government funding to help

matter of grave importance that has brought my local national health
service trust into disrepute. An internal audit, an external audit, an
independent report and a council investigation have been unable to
provide those answers. The debate concerns the huge sum of £28
million that was mis-stated in Croydon primary care trust’s
financial accounts of 2010-11. I hasten to add that the issue does not
apply to the present
board.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012167000146" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000146">Croydon
PCT, now known as NHS Croydon, posted a £5.5 million surplus,
despite sitting on an estimated £23 million black hole. More
than two years after that mis-statement was exposed, we are still no
closer to finding out exactly how much, how, who and why. Our best idea
is that it was the result of a combination of incompetence bordering on
neglect and cover-up. A significant lack of documentation and a
conspiracy of silence from the people in charge have made it all but
impossible to ascertain the truth.</hs_Para>

of not only NHS England’s chief executive, but the Secretary of

Croydon and its NHS cluster, but for the NHS as a whole, are deeply
disturbing. That a health trust can lose such enormous sums of money

subsequently, is frankly unacceptable. The people of Croydon and the

me to recap the events that led to today’s debate, which has the
full support of my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon Central (Gavin
Barwell), who shares my frustration. In February 2011, NHS Croydon
merged with four other primary care trusts in south-west London to form
a cluster. Four months later, when the final accounts were signed off,
a £5.5 million surplus was reported for 2010-11. By that time,
however, a new financial director had begun to identify issues
regarding the budget-setting for the 2011-12 financial year. The budget
was indicated, but the figures lacked detail and transparency. For
example, there were unpaid invoices that were not budgeted
for.</hs_Para>

appeared, had been living beyond its means and other PCTs in the
cluster would have to cough up with their reserves. Suspicion fell on
the previous year’s finances, even though an external and
internal audit had signed them off at great expense; Deloitte charged
£60,000 and the Audit Commission charged £250,000. The
matter was referred to NHS London, which commissioned an independent
review by Ernst and Young. The final report, published in May 
<?notus-xml column=27?>2012, confirmed that the final accounts had been mis-stated by at least
£28 million. It also highlighted limited
scrutiny by the trust board and audit committee, a lack of leadership
in the finance team and the move from PCTs to clusters as contributing
factors to the multi-million pound black hole.</hs_Para>

The financial liabilities of NHS Croydon became the financial

deputy director of finance, Mark Phillips, who was effectively in
charge of the finance team, also snubbed it, while his boss Stephen
O’Brien, who also refused to give evidence, was off on sick

Croydon councillors David Fitze, who was in charge of the audit

who did oblige presented damning indictments of the culture at NHS

immense pressure to achieve a balanced budget at the end of the year
and were therefore reluctant to challenge the sums as long as they
added up. He also contested the claim that the poor finances had not

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Jane
Ellison):</Member></B> I tell my right hon. Friend the Member for
Croydon South (Sir Richard Ottaway) at the outset that if I cannot
respond today to some of the concerns he has outlined, I will be happy
to follow them up later. I have already had a couple of meetings about
the details of the matter and my officials tried to contact him
yesterday.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14012167000169" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000169"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T11:14:32"></hs_TimeCode>I
congratulate my right hon. Friend on securing the debate. I know that
the issue is a big one in his constituency; as he said, it is also a
big issue for the NHS. I share his frustration at the catastrophic
situation that arose at the former Croydon primary care trust. As we
have heard, a stated surplus of £5.4 million in NHS
Croydon’s accounts for 2010-11 was revealed to be a deficit of
£22.4 million, so there was a funding gap of £27.8
million.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14012167000170" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000170">I understand
that the gap arose from an overspend on the provision of health
services, but my right hon. Friend makes a fair point when he says that
such an overspend, in as much as it is not controlled, is hardly likely
to have been directed to the most beneficial places. It is probably
fair to say, and the Ernst and Young report pointed out, that patient
care was not compromised as a result of what happened. The situation is
slightly different from money being misappropriated and not spent on
health care. That does not make the situation better, but there is a
difference<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T11:15:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012167000171" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000171">I
am not going to try to defend the indefensible. The Government position
is clear: overspends are not acceptable and all NHS organisations must
live within their means. As my right hon. Friend is aware, an
independent review commissioned by NHS London was published in spring
2012 and it identified a series of failures in financial management. I
realise that my right hon. Friend is not happy with the use of the word
“systemic” but I would dispute his view slightly. There
were several systems, none of which picked up the problem,
so to that extent “systemic failures” is a fair
description. The question is what we have done to change the systems
and make it more likely that such a  
<?notus-xml column=30?>combination of circumstances cannot occur again. I think that we have
made progress on that, but there are probably further things we can
do.</hs_Para>

in question, together
with<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T11:16:18"></hs_TimeCode> substandard
financial processes and poor management reporting—and, indeed,
poor management—led to an inaccurate picture of the
organisation’s financial position. The report highlighted
contributory factors, including limited scrutiny and challenge by NHS
Croydon’s board and scrutiny committee; a lack of leadership in
the finance team during the finance director’s sick
leave—as my right hon. Friend said, the interim finance director
was insufficiently qualified; and difficulties with leadership and
operational continuity during the move to the cluster.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14012167000174" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000174">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T11:19:24"></hs_TimeCode>
PCT commissioned an internal audit and the Audit Commission
commissioned an external audit, both of which failed to uncover the
significant financial irregularities. That is extraordinary. One of the
audits was conducted by a well known firm of auditors; in a discussion
of the matter yesterday with officials there was a feeling that that
money was not well spent and should ideally have been refunded, given
that it did not uncover the issue.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T11:17:31"></hs_TimeCode>The Ernst and
Young report found that no individual was entirely at
fault—rather than that no individual was at fault—but
clearly there were people who performed poorly. It also found no
adverse effect on patient care and no evidence of personal
gain<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T11:17:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012167000175" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000175">As
I said in the House last week, it is important to note the measures
that have been taken to prevent what happened at Croydon from happening
again. Understanding what happened will give us an understanding of
prevention methods. Following publication of the report, NHS London
wrote to all primary care trusts outlining the lessons to be learned,
as one would expect. In south-west London, the joint boards of the PCTs
established a work programme to ensure that all the recommendations
from the independent report would be addressed. That programme was
overseen by the audit committee of the joint boards, implemented by
management and assured by internal audit.</hs_Para>

since their establishment the clinical commissioning groups have
adopted a harmonised ledger system, ensuring that they all approach
their accounts in a similar manner. That will make it more difficult to
conceal irregularities, and will allow more effective scrutiny by NHS
England and
others<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T11:18:43"></hs_TimeCode>. Someone
coming to look at the books of another CCG would not be thrown by a
different ledger system but instantly encounter a familiar system,
making it more likely that they could spot what was going on. Problems
would not be concealed by a particular version of the
system<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T11:19:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012167000177" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000177">I
know that my right hon. Friend is frustrated about the fact that no
former officers of NHS Croydon have been held to account, and I
understand that. He wrote to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of
State in support of a recommendation, from the joint health overview
and scrutiny committee in south-west London, that such committees be
given powers to enable them to compel former employees of NHS bodies to
appear.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14012167000178" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000178">As my right
hon. Friend knows, the Secretary of State was unable to accept that
recommendation. Employees attend before local authorities to answer
questions on behalf of the relevant body and not in a personal
capacity. Accordingly, the Local Authority (Public Health, Health and
Wellbeing Boards and Health Scrutiny) 
<?notus-xml column=31?>Regulations 2013 do not impose duties on people who are no longer
employees of the NHS body in question. Where employees have moved, we
would expect the relevant body to have appropriate handover
arrangements and to identify another suitable person to attend. It
should not be the case that people can move on and no one else will
attend as a result; someone else should be able to respond as part of
the handover arrangements.</hs_Para>

Department of Health will, however, publish new guidance shortly on
local government health scrutiny, and I am happy to ensure that it is
discussed when available.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T11:20:19"></hs_TimeCode> addition to
supporting local government, the guidance will help to ensure that NHS
organisations are aware of their duties and responsibilities. We want
to start to tackle the culture that my right hon. Friend describes of
people being able to move on without their mistakes catching up with
them<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T11:20:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012167000180" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000180">It
is extremely unfortunate that Croydon’s clinical commissioning
group is now operating with a deficit as a result of overspending by
the former primary care trust. It is important, however, to concentrate
on what has happened since, such as the measures being taken to bring
the local health economy back to financial balance.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14012167000181" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000181">My right hon.
Friend is rightly concerned about the impact on his constituents and
others in Croydon. I have already touched on some of the steps being
taken to minimise the risk of such a situation arising again, but there
are other steps to take and further questions to ask.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T11:21:15"></hs_TimeCode> CCG has
developed a five-year financial improvement plan and is working closely
with NHS England to help to achieve its target. I understand that NHS
England’s London regional team is meeting the CCG monthly to
track delivery against the plan. Furthermore, Croydon will be receiving
budget growth of around 3.5%, compared with the national minimum of
2.1%. Setting aside the problems of the past, that reflects
Croydon’s being some 7% below target and the growth, which is
above average, should help to ease its return to financial balance and
to close the gap
faster.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012167000182" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000182">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T11:21:55"></hs_TimeCode>
am also advised that the Croydon financial management team has been
restructured with new leadership, clear accountability and new team
members in post since April 2013. NHS England has retained reporting
oversight through the national financial reporting system, which is
another substantive change since the unfortunate events took place. I
am pleased to assure my right hon. Friend that, as I mentioned briefly
in the House last 
<?notus-xml column=32?>week, when CCGs were established all chief financial officers were
subject to a rigorous independent assessment and appointment process. I
hope that he agrees that that is a welcome development.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14012167000183" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000183">Furthermore,
NHS England has been involved in the appointment of all substantive
chief financial officers in London. I have asked officials to consider
the appointment of interim CFOs, as it was clearly a real weakness in
Croydon. I have not yet received assurance that there is the same level
of scrutiny for interim CFOs, so I have asked for more work on that.
NHS England and NHS London are looking at how to bring in more
oversight in the same way as they have with substantive chief
officers<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T11:23:15"></hs_TimeCode>. Going
right to the heart of what my right hon. Friend says, I have also asked
how we can prevent people from popping up in another position where
they could repeat the mistakes that they made in the past. Some such
systems are in place, but oversight of appointments is critical, so
more work must be done there.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14012167000184" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000184">The clinical
commissioning group has established a finance committee, as part of its
membership constitution, to oversee the financial performance of the
organisation and to provide additional time for board members to
scrutinise the financial position. I am assured that Croydon
CCG’s governing body remains committed to achieving its
financial targets—I would hope that it would say that, but I
have no reason to believe otherwise and know that it is taking the
matter seriously—based on clinical and quality led service
improvement
programmes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012167000185" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000185">I
understand and share the frustration of
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T11:24:13"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend. I think that I have picked up on some of the points made in his
very good speech, but we accept that others need further investigation.
I am happy to discuss those with him after the debate, so that he can
feed through any other questions or concerns.</hs_Para>

enough just to say that we have learned lessons; we need to do
everything in our power to reduce the chance of such things happening
again. I have met NHS England specifically to discuss the issue and,
obviously, I communicated my concerns. I will follow that up after this
debate and look at what more can be done to ensure that such
catastrophic events cannot happen again. I hope I have given my right
hon. Friend some reassurance, although I accept that he will continue,
rightly, to campaign for more
satisfaction.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="14012167000212" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012167000212">11.25

me, despite the continued stonewalling of the current 
<?notus-xml column=34?>Minister<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T14:33:47"></hs_TimeCode>’s
predecessors. My daughter is a second-generation Take That fan—I
being the first generation—and I was alerted to this scandalous
practice by her sense of great unfairness that she had not been able to
acquire Take That tickets for us, despite being ready to buy them
online the minute the tickets went on sale, only to see them moments

looked into the practice further and found that neither my daughter nor
Take That were alone. In fact, that day I found just the tip of the
iceberg, because this happens week in, week out with music, comedy,
sport and theatrical events up and down the country. The same situation
affects not only Wembley arena gigs and international matches, but
small and medium-capacity concerts in provincial towns and cities
throughout the country. It even affects art exhibitions; someone would
have been very lucky to pay face value to see the recent David Bowie
exhibition at the Victoria and Albert museum at a convenient time or,
similarly, the da Vinci exhibition at the National Gallery last year.
The Chelsea flower show regularly makes the news when its tickets hit
many times face value on secondary sites. The most recent example to
hit the headlines and inspire columns and features about the secondary
market was the Monty Python
reunion<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T14:35:18"></hs_TimeCode>,
probably because lots of journalists and editors wanted to go

the creative and live events sector, it would make sense for the

people who seek to defend the practice. Yes, there is a value to
secondary ticketing when people want to offload tickets because they
happen not to be able to make an event, or if people are able to snap
up tickets at the last minute after thinking that they would not be
able to attend. However, there is a big difference between those
practices and the market manipulation that is taking place on a huge

Hodgson:</Member></B> That is exactly the point that I want to expand
on. We all agree that the secondary market can serve a
purpose—if we have tickets to an event that we thought we could
go to, but then find that we cannot attend because of a change in work
patterns or whatever—but the exponential growth in online resale
that we have seen since 2008, with major players coming from America to
get a slice of the growing pie, proves my “green light”
point. If the brakes were on before 2008, while we were waiting for the
decisions, they were certainly smashed to pieces afterwards, and people
in the industry have seen touts making more and more money from their
work and investment without putting anything in. After all, when a
ticket sells for double its face value, the tout makes more money than
everyone involved in putting on the show.</hs_Para>

industry tried unsuccessfully to convince the Government and Parliament
to do something about the situation. Having failed in that attempt,
they decided—reluctantly, in my opinion—that if someone
was going to make that money, it might as well be them. Some are doing
so openly by selling premium packages or appointing a secondary website
as an official partner, as Jessie J did recently. Some, however, are
doing it through back channels because they do not want their fans to
know that they are effectively being ripped off by the artiste they
admire, as that would inevitably hurt their relationship.

touting and other crimes associated with the games, Operation Podium,
also looked at the wider secondary market in the years it was in
operation—from 2005 to 2013. It estimated that that market was
worth £1 billion, and its initial findings resulted in the fine
for touting Olympic tickets being quadrupled. I sat on the Public Bill
Committee that considered the legislation that put that in place, and
during our proceedings, a representative from the Metropolitan police
told us that the people they were tracking who were trying to tout
Olympic tickets were the same players who control most of the inventory

confirmation that the secondary market is allowing fraud to be
perpetrated, we got it in July last year, when it emerged through an
investigation by Radio 4’s “You and Yours”
programme, working with security expert Reg Walker, that thousands of
counterfeit tickets had been sold through the major secondary market
platforms. Those platforms tell people that tickets are guaranteed
because sellers receive their money for a ticket only once the buyer
has been to the event without incident. That would be the case if
someone were to try to shift a few tickets for an event they could not
attend or if they were small-time casual touts. However, the fraud
could be perpetrated because the restriction does not apply to the big
players, otherwise known as power sellers or brokers—although I
would call them industrial
touts.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012195000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012195000004">The
secondary platforms compete for inventory from those major players and
the commissions from their sales, so they bend over backwards to win
their business. That means preferential rates and premium services, and
even the odd party, with drinks and networking opportunities; but
importantly it also evidently means disbursing money paid for tickets
before those tickets have been verified by the end user.</hs_Para>

individuals—they would be called “gangsters” or
“organised criminal networks” in common
parlance—were able to establish themselves as power sellers by
selling large amounts of genuine stock, although we do not know from
where they got it. When they then carpet-bombed the market with false
tickets, they had ensured that they got their money within days of the
sale. By the time the reported thousands of fans were knocked back from
concerts by the likes of Beyoncé and One Direction, those
criminals were long
gone.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012195000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012195000006">I
am not saying that the four major secondary platforms that were stung
by that fraud were complicit in any way, although my understanding is
that they did not exactly run to the police about that criminal
activity, probably because it would harm their reputation; it was an
issue of damage limitation. However, the fact that their processes
allowed the fraud to happen shows that the market is not
foolproof—or gangster-proof—and desperately needs reform
and transparency. I have heard it argued that if those websites did not
exist, all those fans would be out of pocket, whereas now they will be
reimbursed eventually, if they are tenacious. However, without those
websites, with their aggressive marketing and their promise of safe
transactions, the criminals or criminal organisations would not have
been able to sell nearly as many counterfeit tickets in the first
place.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012195000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012195000007">The

identities of people who had broken its terms and conditions by
reselling tickets to high-profile games. Of course, it is only the
company address that has moved abroad; the business retains an

national sport governing bodies, the RFU is conscious of the need
continually to feed the grassroots and drive participation at every
level of the game. That is not all altruistic; if the grassroots are
neglected, every level of the game suffers very quickly—gate
receipts fall and talent does not come through, meaning that our clubs

damaging interest in the sport.</hs_Para>

reason, the RFU ensures that a significant number of tickets for
high-profile games are distributed to the 2,000 or so rugby clubs
across the country. Indeed, it even announced before Christmas that
that would include at least one ticket per club for the rugby world cup
final in 2015. The RFU knows that it could get much more for those
tickets—indeed, for all the tournament tickets—on the
open market, but that is simply not the point. It wants to ensure that
not just wealthy individuals and corporate buyers can afford to see the
best rugby teams and players in the world.</hs_Para>

wanted the identity of those reselling tickets to be known to ensure
that they contribute to the long-term fostering of grass-roots
participation, instead of making some individual a nice wad of cash.
That is why the RFU and England Rugby 2015 have continually asked the
Government to legislate to protect tickets for the 2015 rugby world cup
from being touted. It is disappointing that, so far, the Government

least one of the secondary websites, for around 10 times the face value
of one of the lowest priced seats. Some of the posh seats in the west
lower tier would set them back almost £18,000 a pair, and that
is despite the tickets not yet having gone on sale to the public; that

with some events, including those at the O2. If a ticket is found to
have been resold illegally and can be traced, it can be cancelled. That
is one mechanism that can be used. My proposal would give consumers the
peace of mind that they will not be left out of pocket if they are the
victim of ticket fraud. The websites that make money facilitating

bring to the market the much-needed transparency that the police and
many others say is needed, the websites should ensure that
all ticket listings display the face value and seat number, where
appropriate, of the tickets being purchased. That would prove that the
tickets were real and already in existence. Websites selling tickets
they have acquired themselves, or through direct allocations from an
event holder, should disclose that clearly to buyers, and individuals
selling tickets via these websites should be able to provide proof that
they own the ticket they are selling.</hs_Para>

probably the original platform for web-based touts. The main websites
these days could learn a lot from the information about a seller that
it allows to be seen. EBay no longer allows tickets to be sold; that
part of its activity has been moved to StubHub, through which it makes
commission from the buyer and seller. However, providing information
could still apply to other listings, so that the number of tickets sold
to other events, the number currently for sale, feedback from previous
purchasers, and the record of any previous accounts held by the
individual when possible could be detailed. That would allow consumers
to make an informed choice about whether to buy from a tout who sells
hundreds of tickets, or from a genuine fan who is selling tickets
because they cannot go to the gig or
event.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012195000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012195000028">There
is a serious problem with how some touts acquire tickets through the
use of botnets and sophisticated software programmes to circumvent

said before in debates on this subject, tickets give access to an
experience—sometimes, a once-in-a-lifetime experience—and
the normal market rules of supply and demand do not apply. The tickets
should not go just to those with the deepest pockets, access to
back-channel deals or criminal methods of acquiring them, unless that
is what the person putting on the event wants. The Government’s
job is to legislate to prevent such market failure and to ensure as far
as possible that everyone has a fair and equal chance of purchasing a
ticket to their dream event, at the price those putting on the event
intended.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-21?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_21_PT_1/18C2CF961FE40FA335E290AACDB82167B6536624" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="21 January 2014">Tuesday

commend the hon. Lady’s ingenuity. This matter, as she rightly
said, has been extensively considered by the Culture, Media and Sport
Committee, on which I serve. We found that the secondary market was
perfectly legitimate and worked, on the whole, in the best interests of
the consumer. The Office of Fair Trading has looked into the subject as
well; it also found that the market worked in the best interests of the
consumer.</hs_Para>

has decided to set up her own inquiry, from which she can at least
guarantee the answer she wants. I commend her for doing that, because
none of the objective looks at this issue have ever fallen on her side
of the argument. I also commend her for persuading the shadow Minister,
her hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Clive Efford), that this is
another populist bandwagon on which he must jump. It seems that there
is not one he is not prepared to jump on at the moment. He has added
this one to the
list.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012182000098" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012182000098">The
premise that the hon. Lady starts from is false. She believes that, by
definition, all ticket touting and all reselling of tickets must be
done at a profit, but ticket touts can make a loss—some 50% of
the tickets sold on viagogo are sold at face value or below. When she
and, I hope, the Minister go back over the Select Committee reports and
the Office of Fair Trading reports, they will 
<?notus-xml column=42?>note the excellent contribution to our Select Committee inquiry made by
the right hon. Member for Barking (Margaret Hodge), who gave evidence
as a Government Minister. We all know she does a fantastic job as Chair
of the Public Accounts Committee. She was robust in her defence of the
secondary market and explained the reasons why we should not intervene
and why it works in the best interests of consumers. I hope everyone
will look over the evidence that she
gave.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012182000099" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012182000099">I
see my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mike Weatherley) in his place,
and I have no doubt he will be looking to trouble the scorers as well.
He speaks consistently about intellectual property rights for event
promoters, but I take a different view. My belief is straightforward:
if someone sells something to somebody, they have sold it on for that
person to do as they wish with it. It happens all the time in the world
of retail, which is where I came from.</hs_Para>

Asda, we sold products, people bought them and whatever they did with
the products was up to them. We used to get lots of letters from people
saying that our Asda-branded whatever had been spotted being sold in a
corner shop down the road. Our view was that that was fine, because it
was their product. If they wanted to sell it on at a higher price than
they paid, that was fine, because that is how the free market
operates.</hs_Para>

that if someone does not want a person to sell a product on, they
should not sell it to that person in the first place. The first rule of
the free market is that if a product is sold to someone, the product
belongs to them and they can do with it as they please. That happens in
all walks of life. People buy stamps off other people as an investment
and hope that one day they can sell the stamps on to someone else at a
profit. People do it with gold. I am sure that the former Prime
Minister, the right hon. Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Mr
Brown), would have loved, when he sold the gold off at a ridiculously
low price, to have said, “By the way, you cannot sell it on
again at a price higher than what I have sold it to you at.” All
that would have done was emphasise what a ridiculous mistake he made in
the first
place.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012182000102" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012182000102"><B><Member ContinuationText="Kerry McCarthy" PimsId="4810" UID="14012182000334" xid="812" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0001.htm#14012182000334">Kerry

the difference surely is that in his examples—they are faintly

form distort the primary market. The sort of secondary market that my
hon. Friend the Member for Washington and Sunderland West (Mrs Hodgson)

Davies:</Member></B> I do not agree with the hon. Lady. For example,
when a new designer handbag comes on to the market and gets a lot of
hype, there are massive queues in department stores of people hoping to
buy one of the first 25 to go on sale. When new gadgets come out at
Christmas time, there are massive queues of people hoping to be one of

knew that 
<?notus-xml column=43?>the first 20 or 30 people, or however many could buy
one, would resell the toys at a massively inflated price, in much the
same way as happens with tickets. That is exactly what happened. Is
anyone suggesting that the Government should intervene in the law to
stop people reselling their Buzz Lightyears or their designer handbags,
or whatever goes on sale in department stores with a lot of hype, at a
higher price? If they do not want the Government to intervene to stop

experience. To use the Buzz Lightyear example, the situation would be
like someone buying all the toys from the shop’s stock room so
that other people never even had the opportunity to buy them off the
shelves. That is what is going on. Customers have not even got a chance
to buy them, because they have been bought out of the stock
room.</hs_Para>

operate, but it might well be that the shops say to staff, “If
you want one, you can have one.” By the time any real punter
gets in there, the items have all gone to members of staff. Does the
hon. Lady really think that the Government should legislate to stop

a newly released iPad from someone else, it becomes their property to
own and sell on, as would happen with baked beans. With tickets, the
creative owner might prefer them to be sold in a particular way. For
example, sports facilities might want a children’s area to build
up support. The facilities could sell those tickets at much higher
prices, but they prefer to sell them for a different reason than to be

50,000 tickets at £20 each, they have decided that they want to
rake in £1 million in ticket sales from the event. It seems to

tickets that they are not able to resell. They did not really want to

hon. Friend the Member for Hove is right: the event organiser can do
lots of things to try to discourage people from selling tickets on. For
example, for an event in, say, four months’ time, instead of
selling all the tickets in one go the moment the gates
open—therefore encouraging the secondary market—the event
organiser could sell a few tickets week by week, including up to the
final week before the event. In that case, the secondary market would
not be quite as attractive because tickets were still going to be
available the week before in the primary market.</hs_Para>

not do that? Perhaps it is because they fear that the courts will
decide that what they are trying to impose is an unfair condition on
the selling of tickets. I suspect that they shy away from doing so
because it will be exposed for the world to see that what they are
trying to argue for is anti-competitive and an unfair thing to impose
on somebody whom they are selling to. I suspect that is why we get all

that our customers wanted to buy it for a lower price, so we decided,
“Blow it, we’re going to sell them at a lower

everybody here who is arguing against the secondary market for tickets
are the sort of luddites who would have kept the net book agreement in
place, thinking that publishers should have the right to charge
whatever they like for a book and that retailers should not be able to
sell it at a lower price. I think that was a nonsense then and it is a
nonsense now, and there is absolutely no difference between the
arguments. Saying that the event organiser should be able to charge
what they like for a ticket and not allowing anyone to sell it for any
other price is the same as saying that publishers should be able to
sell a book at a price they set, and that nobody should be able to sell
it on at a lower price themselves. I hope that the Minister accepts

ticket market should not only be allowed to happen, but is desirable.
As I mentioned to the Minister, people in New Zealand may well be very
confident that their team will get to the final, so they might buy up
tickets for the final in huge quantities. However, their team might get
knocked out in the semi-final. We need some mechanism for allowing fans

internet selling becoming more streamlined, touts are able to use
sophisticated computer systems to buy large volumes of tickets

Metropolitan police published a comprehensive report on fraudulent
ticketing and the danger it posed to the Olympics that specifically
cited ticket fraud, touting and ticket reselling websites as areas of
concern. Among several issues, the Met noted that websites with their
servers based overseas were causing serious problems by advertising
fraudulent tickets and then making it difficult for law enforcement
agencies to track the offenders or shut down illegal sites. That is an
irrefutable fact, and the Culture, Media and Sport Committee did not
address it in 2007.</hs_Para>

Met’s report stressed, as I do, the need for an open and
transparent system for ticket reselling, with clear and appropriate
regulations. Transparency is the key to protecting not just content
creators but ticket buyers from dubious and misleading transactions. It
is common in the entertainment industries for all or part of the fee
for professionals involved in an event to be paid in tickets. The venue
might be paid in tickets to a corporate box, or a promoter or manager
might be given them as part of their fee. That is done with the tacit
understanding that the recipients of those tickets will subsequently be
able to sell them on for significantly more than their face value. It
is, of course, the prerogative of the content creators to do that if
they want to, but it should be done
transparently.</hs_Para>

touting represents an interference in the natural free market. However,
that is a misunderstanding of one of the key principles of the free
market—the ability of a market to respond to demand by
increasing supply. That is one of the five conditions of a free market.
In the case of sports matches or live music, there is no way to
increase supply. There are only so many games in the season and bands
can only play so many dates.</hs_Para>

Bingham</B> (High Peak) (Con):</Member> I did not intend to make a
speech, because I just wanted to hear Members’
arguments—both sides of the argument have been put with great
passion. My view is that we must take a pragmatic approach. There is a
market for secondary tickets. If people cannot go to a concert, they
have to get rid of their tickets. We live in a new world in which we
have the internet, and we need to harness it. I think that what has
been suggested is trying to preserve in aspic for a new world the way
in which tickets used to be dealt with. I have looked into the
secondary market and how people operate and, quite
honestly, I think it works. 
<?notus-xml column=50?>I think it is a good system. People can offer their
tickets for sale for the price that they want, and if other people want
them, they can buy them. I hear the argument, “Oh, well, the
ticket prices will be inflated,” but as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T15:31:36"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Shipley (Philip Davies) will know from his days at Asda,
if people overprice things, no one will buy them. The market will
dictate what price tickets will sell at, and we should let the market
do that. I do not think that we need to be wrapping things in
legislation at every
turn.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012182000149" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0002.htm#14012182000149">Many
of us will remember the days when there seemed to be people outside
sporting events and musical events with fistfuls of tickets. I have
never bought a ticket from a tout and I would not do so, but if someone
does buy a ticket from a tout outside a stadium, they do not know
whether it is genuine, and if an honest person is trying to get rid of
a ticket because a member of their family cannot go to the event, they
do not know whether the person buying it is paying them in forged
money—we hear tales about forged £5 and £10

secondary ticketing market, of which I was unaware until I looked into
the issue in greater depth, provides a secure way for people to dispose
of a ticket that they cannot use. There is a guarantee that they will
be paid for the ticket and that the person buying it will get the
ticket that they want. With regard to the price being driven up, let us
say that there is a surplus of tickets to see the Rolling Stones,
Motörhead or whoever

argument about bots—roomfuls of computers just harvesting
tickets. As far as I can see, however, such legitimate companies are
aware of their corporate reputation and, as a result, are making every
effort to prevent that sort of thing from happening. That is the way in
which the secondary 
<?notus-xml column=51?>market and the systems seem to work. We are in a brave new world in
which we are dealing with the internet. When tickets came out many
years ago, I remember that we would sit there on the phone, pressing
redial, redial, redial. Now we are on the internet, although sometimes
it seems somewhat the same—we just hit refresh, refresh,

internet, not abusing
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012182000154" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0002.htm#14012182000154">I

same as it was then. When someone buys a ticket, whether they are an
individual or a large corporate entity, it is up to them what they do
with it. It is not the job of the Government—it is not the job
of the Houses of Parliament—to try to legislate to control in
any way what they should do with

agree that it is up to the original owner of the ticket—the
band, promoter, sporting team or whoever—what they do with it.
If they want to sell it, to whomever they want, I am happy to go along
with that idea. It is perfectly sensible and right that they should do
that. I do not accept that it is the job of Parliament to try to say to
anyone that they cannot sell their ticket at a given price, whether
that is 10% more than face value, 15% more, 20% more or
whatever. Of course, the problem with introducing the 10% rule that was
proposed in the private Member’s Bill is that if it is okay for
the first person to sell the ticket for 10% more, what about the owner
who has already paid 10% more for it? Are they then stuck with being
able to sell it only at that price, or can they sell it for an
additional 10%? The idea is just
ridiculous.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012182000157" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0002.htm#14012182000157">My

a point about bands wanting to target a certain sector. Let us not beat
about the bush. What the proponents 
<?notus-xml column=52?>of controlling the secondary market seem to be suggesting is that that
target audience is somehow those who are of lesser means—those
who cannot afford to pay for a ticket in the open market. If bands are
really committed to helping those of lesser means, there are many ways
they can do so. What is to stop bands, on the day of the concert, from
letting a certain number of people—the genuine fans—in
for free? Those fans would be the people who were prepared to queue to
see the band for free. The top bands, and middle-level and lower bands,
could still get their money by selling the rest of the tickets at
higher prices. They would still get as much as they ever would have,
and they would be able to reward those fans of lesser means. I will not
call those people “real” fans, however, because if
someone is prepared to pay an inflated price, they are just as much of
a real fan as someone who is prepared to queue throughout the night to
see a particular band. I look forward to hearing what my hon. Friend

need to get one or two things clear at the start. No one is suggesting
that people should not be able to resell their tickets if they have a
legitimate reason to do so, such as if they are unable to attend an
event. We have all been in similar situations. The viagogo figure of
50% of tickets being sold for their face value or less arises because
many people use the secondary ticketing market to try to minimise their
losses when they cannot attend events. They did not necessarily buy
tickets with the intention of making a profit and fail to sell them
on.</hs_Para>

a robust secondary ticketing market that is properly regulated and that
gives consumers protection. The secondary ticketing market must also
allow organisers to monitor what is going on. The hon. Member for
Shipley (Philip Davies) said that if somebody buys a ticket, they own
the rights to it and can do what they like with it, but that is not
true. When someone buys a ticket, they enter into a contract with the
organiser. In many instances, the organiser makes stipulations
regarding the selling on of tickets, which must be honoured. The
ticketing market must be regulated and provide that information so that
organisers can check ticket details at the point of sale. Let us face
it; there is no other form of retail in which a consumer cannot examine
the full details of a product. Rugby union made a challenge against
viagogo on that basis, to try to secure access to such
information.</hs_Para>

not mention the link between crime and many instances in which people
hoover up large numbers of tickets and sell them on. Presumably, he

moment, 14 sets of tickets for the rugby world cup are available on the
viagogo site. Tickets for that event will even not go on sale until
autumn of next year, and the tournament will take place a year after
that. When people do not even own those tickets yet, how can they be
offering them for sale? The tickets on offer range from £86 to
£10,000, and the two £10,000 tickets carry a
£3,000 surcharge to cover the ticket guarantee and customer
service. I would have thought that that was well and truly covered in
the £10,000 price. What sort of extra cover could anyone need
from viagogo to get a ticket guarantee? I would expect that to be part
of the deal, but it is obviously not. People who use such sites are
subject to some dubious additional charges, which is another area of

the Minister to ask that the rugby world cup, like the 2012 Olympics
and Paralympics, be given a specific designation as an event of
national significance to protect rugby fans. The organisers of the
rugby world cup have priced their tickets to make them accessible to a
range of fans, and they want to be able to resell returned tickets at
face value through their own ticketing regime and reimburse the
original purchasers. They want fans to be able to buy tickets at
affordable prices so that a good cross-section of our communities and
sports fans attend the events. What is wrong with that? Inevitably,
however, criminal organisations and people who, even if they are not
involved in criminal gangs, attempt to avoid paying tax on the profits
that they earn from reselling tickets will buy tickets from under the
noses of the fans. In so doing, they will completely undermine the
ticketing policy that we, as politicians, have demanded of the England
rugby world cup 2015 to try to ensure that tickets are
accessible.</hs_Para>

2008, and says that the consultation found that the biggest issue with
regard to ticket resale concerned the practice of purchasing large
numbers of tickets with the sole intention of releasing them back

congratulate her on her very good musical taste and thank her for
securing this debate. I also thank my hon. Friends the Members for

welcome the opportunity to discuss ticket abuse, which is important to
my Department, and I would like to assure the hon. Member for
Washington and Sunderland West that the Government take the issue
seriously and keep it under review. My officials have had lengthy 
<?notus-xml column=55?>discussions with the organisers of the rugby world cup—who have
been repeatedly mentioned by Members today—and with other
organisers of various events. We are aware of the concerns that the
hon. Lady and others have highlighted
today.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012182000176" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0002.htm#14012182000176">Although
the Government have no plans to introduce new regulations on the
ticketing and events market, we continue to encourage improvements so
that all customers have an opportunity to purchase tickets and can do
so in a secure, safe and proper environment. We believe that it is for
event organisers, together with the professional ticketing
organisations, to determine suitable arrangements for ticket sales to
their various events. That is why my officials have had extensive
discussions with both the event organisers and the ticketing
organisations such as
Ticketmaster.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012182000177" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0002.htm#14012182000177">Where
the Government differ from some of the opinions expressed today is in
the belief that the best way to achieve improvements is through
legislation. Our view is that the best way to do that is by building
effective safeguards into the ticketing processes. For example, at a
meeting last month with Ticketmaster, which is the ticketing partner
for the rugby world cup, officials had a detailed briefing on the
options available to event organisers. Options include using barcoding,
having named tickets, staggering the release of tickets, and rewarding
fans with a history of support. I note that tickets for the
ever-popular Glastonbury festival, for example, are managed very
effectively in that way. I am pleased to learn that the rugby world cup
organisers have already decided to sell 500,000 of the 2.3 million
tickets to members and clubs through the Rugby Football Union. That
will ensure that tickets really do go into the hands of genuine
fans.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012182000178" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0002.htm#14012182000178">The
question of ticket re-sale is interesting and important. There are, of
course, genuine reasons why someone might wish to re-sell their
ticket—for example, if their team does not qualify for the
finals. In such an instance, we would look to the event organisers to
offer an official platform to return or re-sell the ticket. That would
have the added benefit, which I believe was mentioned by my hon. Friend
the Member for Shipley, of offering to fans a last minute opportunity
to buy tickets at face value. That proved to be a successful way of
ensuring that fans could safely buy and sell tickets for the 2012
Olympic and Paralympic games. I understand that the rugby world cup
will also have an official re-sale mechanism in place—the shadow
Minister asked about that a few moments
ago.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012182000179" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0002.htm#14012182000179">We
must recognise above all that there is a legitimate market. People are
willing to pay above the market value of a ticket to attend an event.
Others have genuine 
<?notus-xml column=56?>reasons to sell their tickets. I have listened carefully to everyone,
but we do not want to criminalise fans, and we must not. Successive
Governments and Select Committees have looked into the market in great
detail and concluded that events organisers, promoters and ticket
agents need to find solutions to ticketing and access to their events.
Members will be aware that the Government made an exception in
producing legislation for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games
because that was a requirement of the bid. The hon. Member for
Washington and Sunderland West conceded that
point.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012182000180" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0002.htm#14012182000180">Operation
Podium has also been mentioned. The report on that operation clearly
sets out that, even where legislation exists—such as for the
re-sale of football tickets—it does not necessarily prevent the
secondary market from operating. The hon. Lady raised the issue of the
football tickets loophole. I will certainly raise that issue with the
football authorities. I know that many season tickets take the form of
electronic cards that are quite difficult to sell on for individual
matches, which I think helps. I am happy to take that issue further.
The Home Office is in charge of the legislation, so it would decide
whether there is any risk to public order. I am sure that it will keep
an eye on the issue and act
accordingly.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012182000181" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0002.htm#14012182000181">Although
further regulations might act as a deterrent for some, the regulatory
burden imposed by stronger regulations is one that local authorities
and police forces can ill afford to bear. The Government have made a
commitment to reduce regulation and will only introduce new regulation
as a last resort. We believe that the lightest practical regulatory
burden is the right approach, particularly as powers exist to prevent
criminal activity and unauthorised re-sale. Local authorities have
powers to prevent unlicensed trading in the streets around venues under
the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982, and
fraudulent activity is already a criminal offence under the Fraud Act
2006. The police have had some successes in tackling such activity, but
some of it occurs abroad where our powers of enforcement do not extend,
unfortunately.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012182000182" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0002.htm#14012182000182">The
key aim must be to reduce fraud by carefully educating consumers about
the risks they take in using unofficial marketplaces. Removing the
ability for consumers to buy tickets legitimately will ultimately drive
demand to unauthorised websites, which are much harder to police. The
Government have previously stated that unless there is proper evidence
of market failure, there is no need for us to take action. We still
believe that to be the case, but we will keep the position under
careful
review.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="14012182000306" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0002.htm#14012182000306">3.59

My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T16:32:04"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
makes several good points. She is right about Smithfield, although I
note that Smithfield, which is an iconic site, albeit much smaller than
Earls Court, has been granted a public inquiry, as has the Shell
centre. In the case of Earls Court, the Secretary of State has
cynically refused a public inquiry for 80 acres in the centre of
London. My hon. Friend is also right that, in place of the rich
employment, cultural and residential areas that we now see, we will
have 8,000 faceless high-rise luxury flats sold off plan to foreign
investors with, at most, 11% new affordable housing—a quarter of
all housing—that will not be affordable to any of my
constituents. Unfortunately, every day in west London is Christmas day
for developers, but there is a lot of collateral
damage<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T16:32:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012182000199" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0002.htm#14012182000199">In
the remaining time, I will address the damage that will be caused and
the real loss that will be occasioned if the exhibition centre goes.
The proposal is part of a much bigger time scale. We have had five
years of attempts at demolition and resistance from the community, but
we have up to 25 years of further development on the site. That long
time scale notwithstanding, it is appropriate that we should be talking
about Earls Court today because we stand between two important events
for the future of the exhibition
centre<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T16:33:40"></hs_TimeCode>. Last
week, the developer submitted the first detailed application for that
part of the site, which includes the potential replacement for the
exhibition centre should Earls Court One and Two be demolished. That
detailed application followed the granting of the planning application
for the master plan for the whole area in November

what would the developer and the local authorities replace the
exhibition centre? The answer is luxury flats. The total floor space of
the detailed designs submitted to replace the exhibition centre is
290,170 square metres. The amount for culture, education, health and
community is 324 square metres, which works out at 0.1% of the site.
There will not be one single affordable home, but there will be 1,324
luxury homes in massive apartment blocks. That is what we will have on
the site instead of the Earls Court exhibition centre if the detailed
planning application is granted. Meanwhile, there is a question of land
ownership, and on Thursday of this week Transport for London’s
finance and policy committee—there are serious questions on
whether that is the appropriate body and whether it has the powers to
do this, but no doubt it will attempt to do so—will recommend
that the board approve TfL entering a joint venture arrangement with
Capital &amp; Counties Properties and/or a wholly owned undertaking of

debate is set against a mounting concern in the local residential and
business communities that will be directly affected by this contentious
development. The failure by the two local authorities to conduct an
Area Action Plan, which would have provided a wide-ranging strategic
assessment of the proposed development, has left the immediate area
vulnerable. The impact of this development is already being felt with

pause to observe that the local businesses that have been sustained by
the footfall to Earls Court over the years—mainly small
businesses in Kensington and Chelsea and Hammersmith and Fulham, but
also businesses in the wider area—are not only facing the loss
of most of their trade due to the closure and demolition but are
effectively being blackmailed and forced out by the developer, which is
increasing their rents by up to 100%. Mr Halwagi also points out that
ExCeL, which is considered the alternative to Earls Court, is 36th in
the world rankings, whereas Paris has two venues in the top 10. We know
that the national exhibition centre is possibly threatened because of
the forced sale due to cuts to local government funding in Birmingham.
Ironically, the NEC was supposed to provide an alternative to Earls

is therefore not the case that we can do without Earls Court, which is
unique by virtue of its space, history and central London location.
Indeed, more exhibition centres are needed. There are only 52 weeks in
the year, and in any one week we need as many exhibition centres as we
have. The industry is expanding, and we are trying to compete on the
world stage. It is the sheerest folly to have decided to destroy such

the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T16:44:26"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Hammersmith (Mr Slaughter) on raising this subject. The
Earls Court exhibition centre itself is primarily in the Kensington
constituency, but the proposals form part of a much larger development,
involving the demolition of large numbers of houses in the hon.
Gentleman’s constituency, so I fully understand
residents’ concern about all the changes. The hon. Gentleman has
set out the position
fairly<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T16:44:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012182000214" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0002.htm#14012182000214">This
description has already been used, but Earls Court is an iconic
building. It is always sad when such a building moves on. That has been
part of the history of London, which has seen so many changes of this
kind. Part of why London remains a vital and extraordinarily successful
city is that it not only tries to preserve the best, but adapts to
changing circumstances. The hon. Gentleman gave some of Earls
Court’s history and I can add to it in one important respect. In
1935-36, when it was being built, it was reported that

completion.”</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="14012182000215" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0002.htm#14012182000215">Running
over budget might not seem too strange, but the total cost rose to the
extraordinary, astronomic sum of £1.5 million in 1937. When
Earls Court Two was constructed in 1991, inflation meant that it cost
some £100 million. We are therefore dealing with major
projects<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T16:46:06"></hs_TimeCode>. I am
sad that Earls Court exhibition centre is likely to disappear. That is
unfortunate, because it has made an important contribution in the way
the hon. Gentleman
describes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012182000216" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0002.htm#14012182000216">With<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T16:48:04"></hs_TimeCode>
regard to my constituents, the massive development is going to last for
not one year or five years, because it will be up to 20 years before
the work is complete, and that has substantial implications for those
who live in the immediate vicinity. I want to make particular reference
to the residents of Eardley crescent and Philbeach gardens, the two
streets that are closest to the centre. The volume of traffic, the
demolition and all the various works associated with any major
development are bad enough, but something of this scale will be of
great significance. I visited the exhibition centre to see the
developers’ presentation, and I must confess that I was
impressed by their awareness of implications for residents in the
immediate vicinity of the area, the steps that they are taking to try
to ameliorate the difficulties, their willingness to have ongoing
consultation with the residents of the adjoining streets, who will have
to bear the brunt of the noise and dust, and various measures to ensure
that much of the rubble that is removed will not be taken through
residential areas. I am sure that the two local
authorities—Kensington and Chelsea, and Hammersmith and
Fulham—will be responsible for monitoring the work closely as it
develops. Conditions can be imposed on developers, but that is not good
enough. Even when good conditions exist, what can sometimes be more
noticeable is a lack of willingness to respect them once the
development has actually started. Local authorities have sometimes been
less than perfect at imposing real conditions that can be
enforced<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T16:48:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012182000217" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0002.htm#14012182000217">The

debate could range far and wide. I cannot be blind to the fact that
there is a huge debate about the merits, or otherwise, of the entire
development of the Earls Court area. However, while I put on record
that I do not doubt the sincerity of the points made by the hon. Member
for Hammersmith, or of the residents’ action group, which
campaigns on the issue, the hon. Gentleman has used Earls Court as a
good way to raise much wider issues in Parliament and to seek a
response from the
Government<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T16:50:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012182000221" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0002.htm#14012182000221">I
will focus on the Earls Court exhibition centre, which is the focus of
the debate. The hon. Gentleman gave a good history of the area. It is
interesting to note that the site was first opened as an entertainment
ground in 1887. Known as the Earls Court exhibition grounds, the site
closed in 1914 and was commandeered for the war—none of those
historical buildings survives. As was pointed out, the grounds were
replaced by the exhibition centre in 1936 to 1937, with Earls Court Two
added in
1991<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T16:50:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

lies in the fact that although people have talked about a magnificent
art deco building, one of my most important responsibilities as
heritage Minister is to decide whether to accept listing
recommendations from English Heritage, the official body that advises
the Government on such matters. It is worth pointing out, to provide
clarity and context to the debate, that the application to list the
building was first made in 2006, under the previous Government. As the
hon. Gentleman pointed out, this is not a party political issue, and I
respect and understand the fact that every heritage Minister not only
takes their responsibilities seriously, but approaches any decision on
a listing recommendation in a quasi-judicial capacity, if I may put it
in such
terms<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T16:51:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012182000223" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0002.htm#14012182000223">At
the time, the clear advice from English Heritage was not to list Earls
Court and, further, it provided a certificate of immunity from listing
for a period. The issue came back in October 2010 and again, although
some note was made of an exhibition centre that had survived, given
that a lot of such centres were temporary, the view of English Heritage

far as I am aware, no other opportunity to list Earls Court will come
up again for a number of years—not until 2016 at the

hon. Gentleman widened the debate to the merits or demerits of the
development itself, which is the subject of a Terry Farrell master
plan. Sir Terry Farrell was used by the previous Government to carry
out master plans, and at the moment is undertaking a review of the
architectural profession on my behalf. The hon. Gentleman is familiar
with both sides of the argument, but the opposing points to those he
made are: the development will provide 7,500 homes, 1,500 of which will
be affordable; there will be 750 replacement homes for the residents of
Gibbs Green and West Kensington estates; there will be 37 acres of new
open space, with a five-acre public park; and there will be investment
in the local tube stations of West Brompton and Earl’s Court. In

part of the armoury to combat climate change, it is essential that we
promote technologies that can capture carbon and restrict

at the point of generation, but carbon capture and storage offers
greater flexibility in the energy source, and as a technology it will
be important for coal and gas-rich

did we get to that particular solution? Part of it perhaps is that
carbon is seen as a waste product. Carbon has suffered from a bad
image, in particular among the greenies. Carbon itself, however, is not
bad; what is bad is its atmospheric build-up, the emitting of carbon
dioxide. Carbon can be recycled, utilising rather than storing this
so-called waste, not only reducing the cost of land fill—or sea
fill—but ensuring that new products do not need to use new
carbon. The issue is about resource reutilisation and remanufacturing

There are scientists, however, who believe that we must start looking

leading group of scientists from Imperial college, while warning that
carbon capture and utilisation must work in conjunction with CCS, agree
that there is potential for conversion into liquid fuel. They also
agree that captured carbon need not simply displace conventional

used for sustainable packaging and construction materials, as a
by-product of CO<Sub>2</Sub>. The universal key reservations, however,

debate aims to raise the profile of the utilisation of carbon, to
rehabilitate carbon and offer it a second chance—or even a
second life. I ask the Government to consider the following policy

up or work in conjunction with carbon capture and storage, would it
attract contracts for difference? The big potential prize of carbon
capture and utilisation is its transference into liquid fuels. As we
know, one of our biggest challenges is decarbonising the transport

capture and utilisation is an excellent example of the circular economy
that keeps products within the productive sphere rather than leaving
them as a waste product, and turns a malign substance into an economic
asset. Although there is much that we still need to overcome, with
economic and engineering challenges that are also shared by carbon
capture and storage, CCU could become an integral part of our
decarbonisation strategy and could deliver innovation. Perhaps some
game changers might even emerge. It is early days for utilisation of
carbon, but as we are still a while away from fully functioning carbon
capture and storage, utilisation technologies have time to catch up.
With a bit of Government help and encouragement, that could be achieved
for all our benefit, both here and

Minister of State, Department of Energy and Climate Change (Gregory
Barker):</Member></B> I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for
South Thanet (Laura Sandys) on not only securing but leading this
debate on green issues and the climate agenda. As usual, she is
absolutely bursting with provocative, interesting and thoughtful ideas.
I am pleased to have the opportunity to discuss the important issues
she has raised today, and join her in raising the profile of carbon
capture and use—or, as she said,
reutilisation, re-engineering and remanufacturing.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14012182000239" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0002.htm#14012182000239">I agree with
my hon. Friend that carbon capture and use is an interesting, albeit
nascent, approach and one that we are already investigating in the
coalition as part of our broader CCS programme. CCU refers to
technologies that can capture and then convert waste CO<Sub>2</Sub>
into commercial products of value—for example, construction
materials, biofuels, fertilisers, polymers or even the fizz in a
Coca-Cola. CCU can be seen as a subset of and complement to carbon
capture and storage, which is the focus of our current long-term
approach. Many people, particularly in China and the US, also use CCU
to refer to enhanced oil recovery, where waste CO<Sub>2</Sub> is used
to increase the amount of oil recovered from a field, although I do not
think that is what my hon. Friend was getting at.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14012182000240" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0002.htm#14012182000240">Let me first
remind my hon. Friend about why we are pursuing CCS, including CCU.
Coal and gas currently provide the majority of our electricity in the
UK—still, I am afraid, nearly 70% in 2012. They also represent a
key source of our carbon emissions. The energy supply sector remains
the single largest source of UK emissions today. We must reduce those
emissions if we are to meet our climate change ambitions. CCS and CCU
can help us do that, and let us continue to enjoy the benefits of
flexible fossil fuels without emissions. That is particularly important
for global efforts to reduce emissions, allowing countries to make use
of indigenous resources while they transition to a low-carbon
model.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012182000241" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0002.htm#14012182000241">That
approach can also help us meet our emissions targets in a
cost-effective way. The Energy Technologies Institute estimates that
successfully deploying CCS could cut the annual cost of meeting our
carbon targets by £32 billion, or up to 1% of GDP, by 2050. CCU
has the potential to add even further value to that. For those reasons
the Government see CCS as an important part of our energy policy and a
core element of our approach. We are taking forward a comprehensive
package of measures, with significant funding, to build the first
commercial scale CCS projects and establish conditions that encourage
the development of a wider
industry.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012182000242" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0002.htm#14012182000242">We
are looking not just at storing the CO<Sub>2</Sub> we capture, but at
how it can be used positively—an area of particular interest to
my hon. Friend. CCU covers a broad and diverse range of technologies.
It offers the potential for a new revenue stream to contribute to the
business case for carbon capture. It also presents a possible
alternative to transportation and storage, particularly in more remote
locations where it may not be economically sensible to invest in such
infrastructure.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012182000243" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0002.htm#14012182000243">We
envisage CCU having a flexible role in addressing the UK’s
CO<Sub>2</Sub> emissions. There is a wide range of possible approaches
and some will be better suited to  
<?notus-xml column=68?>certain regions than others. For that reason, we are investing in
research and development projects now. That will help us to assess the
viability of CCU and what role it could play in the future, and to
develop promising new
technologies.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012182000244" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0002.htm#14012182000244">Let
me provide some more detail on our support for CCU. As part of our
four-year carbon capture and storage research, development and
innovation programme, the coalition is investing over £10
million in new CCU projects. My hon. Friend highlighted three
particular CCU technologies: polymers, photosynthetic bacteria and
mineralisation. I am pleased to say that, with our partners, we are
involved in innovative research in all those
areas.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012182000245" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0002.htm#14012182000245">On
polymers, we are supporting Econic Technologies, an innovative spin-out
from Imperial college, to develop polymers using CO<Sub>2</Sub> rather
than hydrocarbons. With support from the Department of Energy and
Climate Change, Econic has already tested its idea, using
CO<Sub>2</Sub> captured from the DECC-funded CCS pilot at Ferrybridge,
a power station in
Yorkshire.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012182000246" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0002.htm#14012182000246">On
photosynthetic bacteria, we are providing funding to a Sheffield-based
SME, Carbon Sequestration Ltd, which is working with Sheffield
university to develop high-value chemicals from CO<Sub>2</Sub> using
novel algae and bioreactor technology. On mineralisation, the
Technology Strategy Board has funded Carbon8, an award-winning SME that
is developing a technology to mineralise CO<Sub>2</Sub> from waste
incineration. I understand it has also recently secured funding from
Europe to work with the university of Greenwich on further
research.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012182000247" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0002.htm#14012182000247">Mineralisation
technologies are also a good example of some of the challenges CCU
faces. Although Carbon8 is forging ahead, the Energy Technologies
Institute invested £1 million looking at other mineralisation
processes. Working with Caterpillar, the British Geological Survey and
the university of Nottingham, it concluded that at this time certain
technologies might not be economically viable. But, as we have seen,
CCU covers a broad range of different
technologies.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012182000248" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0002.htm#14012182000248">Our
approach shows that, despite austerity and the huge cuts that we have
had to make to public spending to correct the deficit, the coalition
continues to prioritise science and innovation, knowing that research
and development and such innovation are critical, right across the
board, to our future prosperity. It is part of our long-term economic
plan. The Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council is
supporting five British universities to undertake novel research into
CCU, working with major companies such as Johnson Matthey. That
research includes projects to develop catalysts for the conversion of
CO<Sub>2 </Sub>into chemical feed stocks and fuels, and projects to use
methane to convert CO<Sub>2 </Sub>into
fuel.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012182000249" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0002.htm#14012182000249">CCU
also forms an important element of the current techno-economic study
into industrial CCS, which was commissioned by the coalition Government
in October 2013. That was recommended by the CCS cost reduction
taskforce, which the coalition set up. We expect a final report to be
published this spring. Those work streams, led in the coalition by DECC
and our partners, will help us to assess which CCU technologies are
viable and what role they could play in the future. CCU covers a broad
range of technologies and each needs to be evaluated
individually.</hs_Para>

answer these questions and to encourage academics to share ideas, the
Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council has funded the
CO<Sub>2</Sub>Chem network, which I understand could be the largest CCU
network in the world, with more than 800 global members. My officials
attended its meeting in October 2013 to hear the latest news and
innovative ideas direct from the CCU community.</hs_Para>

biggest considerations for DECC is that CCU should permanently reduce
emissions. That is another great example of the UK now leading
innovation in a global way. We fully support the work of the
CO<Sub>2</Sub>Chem network, which has made carbon lifecycle analysis of
CCU technologies a key priority across its research areas. Through the
international Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum, of which the UK is
a co-chair with Australia, we also engage with the carbon capture
utilisation and storage action
group.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012182000252" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0002.htm#14012182000252">Back
in the UK, if some of the CCU projects prove to have significant
potential, they will need a constant supply of CO<Sub>2</Sub>. This is
where our wider work on CCS comes in: getting the first
commercial-scale projects built and laying down the UK’s first
CO<Sub>2 </Sub>transportation infrastructure. We also need to prove our
CO<Sub>2</Sub> stores in the North sea, which will be needed even if
CCU takes off. As my hon. Friend noted, given the huge scale involved,
few scientists can envisage full utilisation of CO<Sub>2</Sub> from
generation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012182000253" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/halltext/140121h0002.htm#14012182000253">We
have introduced a comprehensive package of measures to develop CCS in
the UK, as set out in the coalition’s CCS road map. We recognise
that that is most important for confidence in CCS and to kick-start
wider deployment to get the first projects up and running in UK
conditions. The coalition’s £1 billion competition is

progress.</hs_Para>

coal power plant with full carbon capture and storage, bringing clean
electricity to more than 630,000 homes and capturing approximately 2
million tonnes of CO<Sub>2</Sub> per year. That will link into the

are also looking beyond the first project, reflecting the
coalition’s ambition in this area. We want a strong and
successful CCS industry able to compete on cost with other low-carbon
technologies in the 2020s, and to deploy up to 13 GW by 2030. Our
policies are designed to help to bring CCS to the point where it can

my hon. Friend knows, the second Energy Bill of this Parliament
received Royal Assent just before Christmas, and we are now working to
develop the contracts for 
<?notus-xml column=70?>difference for CCS. My hon. Friend also asked about contracts for
difference for CCU. We do not believe that utilisation is currently
available on the scale needed for commercial electricity generation,
but if utilisation became established as a viable technique for
permanently avoiding the release of large quantities of CO<Sub>2</Sub>,
there is no reason in principle why the clean electricity produced
should not become eligible for contracts for difference. I hope that
that is the answer she wanted.</hs_Para>

focusing on how else we can strengthen the business case for CCS
projects. We are trying to learn from overseas experience, and we have
seen in north America how enhanced oil recovery using CO<Sub>2</Sub>

people believe that this is a type of CCU and have adopted the

oil recovery might have an important role in UK CCS projects and in
extending the supply of North sea oil. We have undertaken a detailed
mapping exercise to estimate potential and held a workshop with

could be important for industrial, energy-intensive sectors, and in

the inclusion of CCU in the IPCC best practices for greenhouse gases, I

conclusion, I thank my hon. Friend for allowing us the opportunity to

Children in care and those who recently left local authority care are
entitled to a 16-19 Bursary worth £1,200 to help with the cost

various assessments of using woodland to alleviate flooding. In
particular it joint funded a review called

woodland creation could contribute to reducing flood risk as well as
deliver other water and wider ecosystem benefits. This led to the

<?notus-xml column=128?>agenda. It is important that the Government and civil society
organisations engage constructively, though accepting we will not
always agree on every issue. Link's Nature Check report is a part of
that ongoing dialogue. There are some areas of the report where we are
in agreement, for example the historic reform of the common fisheries
policy, though generally we believe that Nature Check does not give

For example, internationally, we played a leading role in reaching the
important international biodiversity agreement at Nagoya in 2010 and
are playing an important role on topics such as ivory, whaling and on
illegal wildlife trafficking. In England, we have produced the first
White Paper on the environment for 20 years and are making good

reducing, is sufficient to enable it to continue to fulfil its
statutory responsibilities and Government priorities. The proposed duty
on non-economic regulators, to have regard to growth, will support
growth without weakening environmental protection. It will be

airfares to ensure they comply with the specific price transparency
requirements set out in Article 23 of EC 1008/2008, the Air Services
Regulation. Airlines are required to display airfares clearly and
transparently and prices must be inclusive of all unavoidable and
foreseeable taxes, fees, charges and surcharges at all times. There are
a number of further requirements that relate to the way optional price
supplements are presented and the breakdown of the airfare. The purpose
of these requirements is to ensure consumers can compare the cost of
flights effectively. The CAA has powers to enforce the requirements of
Article 23 of the Air Services Regulation and has used these powers to
ensure airlines display clear and transparent
prices.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012194000723" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/text/140121w0002.htm#14012194000723">The

a key part of the Government's United Kingdom 5 Year Antimicrobial
Resistance Strategy, which was published in September 2013. The
over-use of antibiotics is linked to the increase in resistant
organisms in human and animal health. One of the key aims of the
Strategy is to preserve the effectiveness of existing treatments
through responsible prescribing of antibiotics. This will build on
existing work such as the National Institute for Health and Care
Excellence (NICE) guidance for prescribes

Lamb:</Member></B> Muscular dystrophies are a group of muscle diseases
that weaken the musculoskeletal system and limit movement. There are a
number of different causes including abnormalities of structural
proteins, for example Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, and mitochondrial
abnormalities. Thus mitochondrial abnormalities can cause muscular
dystrophy but there are many other causes. Much of the research to
develop new techniques to prevent mitochondrial disease was funded by
the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign. Only those cases of muscular dystrophy
caused by mitochondrial DNA abnormalities could be prevented by new the
techniques.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012194000912" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/text/140121w0002.htm#14012194000912">Although

(NRIG) report on Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR), published
in 2011, made a comprehensive assessment of the role and opportunities
for SABR in cancer treatment. The guidance was intended to support
commissioners, providers and clinicians to deliver SABR services

report concluded that the evidence only supported the routine use of
SABR in the treatment of early stage non-small cell lung cancer for
patients who are unsuitable for surgery. With regard to other cancers,
such as those of the prostate, head and neck, liver, spine and pancreas
it recommended that treatment should only be commissioned within a
clinical trial or on an individualised basis. However, the report added
that SABR was an evolving treatment area and that those working within
the field should review the latest literature to support their clinical
practice.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012194000977" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/text/140121w0002.htm#14012194000977">The
Department's National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) welcomes
funding applications for research into any aspect of human health,
including cancer treatment. Applications are subject to peer review and
judged in open competition, with awards being made on the basis of the

clinical trials of SABR for cancer of the prostate, head and neck,

2010.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012194000978" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/text/140121w0002.htm#14012194000978">Finally,
since 1 April 2013 NHS England has been responsible for commissioning
radiotherapy services, including SABR. Its commissioning policy
statement on SABR, published April 2013, also concluded that the SABR
treatment was only suitable for a small subset of patients with early
non-small cell lung cancer. The policy will be reviewed in April 2014,
at which time the radiotherapy clinical reference group will examine
whether further evidence has come to light regarding the clinical and
cost effectiveness of SABR in treating other
cancers.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="14012194000137" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/text/140121w0002.htm#14012194000137">Secondment</hs_8Question><Question><hs_Para UID="14012194000979" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/text/140121w0002.htm#14012194000979"><B><Member PimsId="5729" UID="14012194002281" xid="1176" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/text/140121w0002.htm#14012194002281">Tessa

for health professionals is that any case involving a child aged under

organisation. However, while the presumption is that the case should
then be reported to Children's Social Care and a strategy discussion
held, ultimately the decision on whether or not to break
confidentiality is a judgment for a health professional to make. This
must be based on the facts of each case, in which the child's interests

speed capabilities to individual consumers. Consumers' experience is
also affected by a number of factors in addition to the performance of
the network 
<?notus-xml column=155?>provided in their area. These could include the type and installation of
the equipment in their homes, distance of the property from an exchange

broadband speeds within individual housing estates. However, DCMS is
aware that the Cheswick estate which crosses the Bristol and South
Gloucestershire boundary has different broadband provision in different
parts of the estate. Broadband Delivery UK in DCMS is working with
South Gloucestershire council on options for delivering superfast
broadband provision to the remaining premises in this area where this

Package Travel Regulation (SI 1992/3288) on the market for inbound
tourism, as the regulations apply only to packages sold or offered for

Prior to April 2010 the CPS maintained a record of the timeliness of
responses to complaints, and the figures for 2008-09 and 2009-10 given
in the table are taken from this source and represent all letters of
complaint received and replied to by the
CPS.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">2.
In April 2010 the CPS launched their Feedback and Complaints Procedure.
Prior to this date any expression of dissatisfaction with the CPS was
recorded as a complaint. Under the current Feedback and Complaints
Procedure, only correspondence from individuals (or their
representative) directly associated with a case are considered and
recorded as a complaint. Expressions of dissatisfaction from people not
directly associated with a case continue to be monitored but are
classified and recorded as
feedback.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">3.

addition the Government is also toughening up on enforcement of the
NMW. The revised NMW Naming and Shaming scheme which came into effect
on 1 October 2013 made it easier to name employers that break national
minimum wage law. By naming and shaming employers it is hoped that bad
publicity will be an additional deterrent to employers who would
otherwise be tempted not to pay the NMW. We anticipate naming employers
very soon. The Government also announced that we will be increasing the
NMW financial penalty in February 2014 subject to regulation receiving
parliamentary
approval.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012194001828" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140121/text/140121w0003.htm#14012194001828">At
a targeted level the Government has stepped up its communication
activity to increase the level of awareness of the minimum wage rules
across the board. As part of a spot the difference campaign we issued
national and regional press releases targeting the top five sectors
including hairdressing as well as the top five regions. We want to help
employers avoid falling foul of minimum wage rules unwittingly, and
ensure that individuals are well-informed about their minimum wage
eligibility. This will also motivate employers to comply with NMW by
highlighting the benefits to their businesses and drawing attention to
the consequences of not paying workers what they are legally entitled

work on the High Level Prosperity Partnership Pilot which is being led
for UKTI by the Minister for Trade and Investment, my noble Friend Lord
Livingston of Parkhead. He is in close contact with the Minister for
Africa, my hon. Friend the Member for Boston and Skegness (Mark
Simmonds), and the Secretary of State for International Development, my
right hon. Friend the Member for Putney (Justine Greening). A key aim
is to work more closely across Government, so that UK-based businesses
can be better positioned to win business in Africa. This will support
the development of the five African markets covered by the pilot, and
be of benefit to both the UK and Africa. The focus of UKTI is twofold;
helping deliver major projects, including the High Value Opportunity in
oil and gas in Eastern Africa, and supporting small and medium sized
businesses.</hs_Para>
