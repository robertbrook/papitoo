Ahmad of Wimbledon (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, the Government cannot
identify a full transcript of the Stephen Ward trial within their
records. Full transcripts are not automatically created unless ordered
by the judge or requested by the parties involved in the trial. The
National Archives and the Crown Prosecution Service hold partial
records of witness evidence given in the trial but a full transcript of
proceedings may never have been created. The partial records contain
sensitive information about people who are still alive. Disclosing such
records would invite renewed and potentially unfair speculation about
their activities. Accordingly, these records will not be released at
this
time<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T11:07:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Dubs (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, that is a very disappointing Answer
and seems to me part of the cover up that has gone on since 1964. Does
the Minister agree that the conviction of Stephen Ward is probably one
of the most significant miscarriages of justice in modern British
history and, while the establishment got its scalp, justice was not
done? Can we at least have released the papers that are available
because it is very likely that they would exonerate Stephen Ward and
put right this enormous miscarriage of
justice<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T11:08:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0001.htm#14011662000005"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon" PimsId="5907" UID="14011662000769" xid="2117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0001.htm#14011662000769">Lord
Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My Lords, as I am sure the noble Lord
is aware, on 2 December 2013 the human rights barrister Geoffrey
Robertson QC submitted a review of this case to the Criminal Cases
Review Commission, which is, of course, an independent public body set
up in March 1997 by the Criminal Appeal Act. Its purpose is to review
wrongful convictions. It is currently reviewing the case and it would
be inappropriate for me to comment
further.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0001.htm#14011662000006"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Thomas of Gresford" PimsId="4251" UID="14011662000770" xid="1837" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0001.htm#14011662000770">Lord
Thomas of Gresford (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, the trial was fully
reported in lascivious detail by the <I>Times</I><I> </I>at the time in
July and August 1963 with full-page and verbatim accounts of the
cross-examination and the summing up. Accordingly, I see no reason why
such papers as relate to the trial should not be released. Geoffrey
Robertson said that Lord Parker, the then Lord Chief Justice—not
the trial judge—had suppressed a transcript of the trial. Is
that right? If so, under what power did he do
so<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T11:09:23"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My Lords, I was not around in 1964 to
read the <I>Times</I><I> </I>but I shall certainly look it up in the
archives. Turning to the specific question, the issue remains that full
transcripts are not automatically created and certainly, as I said in
my earlier Answer, that is the case here. Six files are held by the
National Archives relating to the Stephen Ward trial; five of these are
open to the public, so there is partial availability. One file is
closed. The closed file does not contain a full transcript of the
hearing. However, it contains partial records of some elements of the
hearing, including evidence given by individuals from the box. These
records contain sensitive information about living individuals and also
unsubstantiated allegations and it would be inappropriate to release
those records at this

noble Lord, Lord Freud, and Mr Iain Duncan Smith have joined the London
Mutual Credit Union. It is open to all Members and the staff of both
Houses to join that union. Part of the problem, as the noble Lord well
knows, is that most credit unions are locally based and for other
departments—such as the Home Office or DWP, with employees
scattered all the way across the country—the cost of joining
employees into a very large number of credit unions is rather

much nudging is going on to get departments to take up this very big

going on but, as the noble Lord will know, there are employee-based
contributions to credit unions and employer-provided contributions to
credit unions. The Government are aware that it is not without cost to
run an employer-based set of contributions, particularly, again, if you

we are both speaking—a conference designed to promote
partnerships between independent and state schools. As he said, the
independent sector has a long history of increasing social mobility
through bursaryships, scholarships and collaboration. In 2013, it
provided more than £300 million worth of assistance, benefiting 
<?notus-xml column=347?>40,000 children, and we absolutely applaud this. However, our priority
is to invest our resources in making sure that all state schools
provide an excellent education for their pupils, which in the end will
be the greatest means of achieving much higher levels of social
mobility, which I know all noble Lords wish to see. Our reforms are
particularly focused on poorer children through, for instance, our

they use their offices in the European Union to make sure that all

not confident that the African Union actually has the capacity to deal
with the situation, much as it is on the ground. I hope the Minister

be one of the things we will be considering. The situation that we are
facing at the moment means that we have to deal with the immediate
violence. The whole point of having the transitional appointments of
the president and prime minister, both of whom resigned only last week,
was to enable a process to take place in which there would be elections
within 18 months of April last year. Unfortunately, the violence has
not stopped under the transitional government. There are expected to be
further elections for a further transitional government within the next
14 days and then further elections will take place with a process
behind them for political discussions. It may well be that at that
stage, it will be right for the UK to be involved in the stabilisation
work.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Motion">

sanctions on Peers who have been found to be in breach of the Code of
Conduct. That is always a difficult and unpleasant business. There are
currently only two sanctions available to the House. Peers
found in breach of the Code of Conduct can be required to apologise.
The other sanction available to the House is that of suspension. The
House does not have the power to expel and, without primary
legislation, it cannot give itself that power.</hs_para>

suspension is severely constrained by the fact that a suspension
expires at the end of the
Parliament<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T11:38:56"></hs_TimeCode> in
which it is imposed. This can give rise to major unfairnesses.
Behaviour which the House feels warrants a lengthy suspension may be
subject to a relatively short period of a few weeks if it is imposed
towards the end of a Parliament. The situation could well arise where
behaviour that was a serious breach of the Code of Conduct resulted in
an effective suspension for a shorter time than a much less serious
breach of the Code of Conduct, merely due to the stage in the
Parliament when the sanction was

Committee<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T11:39:53"></hs_TimeCode> was of
the view that such an outcome would be unfair. The House
Committee was also of the view that it would be helpful to have some
alternative sanctions which fall short of full suspension but are
greater than an apology. The remedy proposed by the House Committee is
the introduction of two new sanctions. The first sanction would prevent
Peers from claiming any financial support by way of expenses or
allowances from the House. The second sanction would prevent Peers from
using the facilities of the House.
Neither<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T11:41:02"></hs_TimeCode> of these
sanctions would prevent the Peer from taking part in the proceedings of
the House in the Chamber or its committees. These sanctions could be
used in addition to suspension from the House or as an alternative to
suspension. Unlike suspension, the sanctions could be applied for a
period extending beyond the end of a Parliament. They would be applied
for a fixed period and therefore are not equivalent to expulsion. They
would not be
retrospective<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T11:41:13"></hs_TimeCode>.

appropriate sanctions, and it would be for the House as a whole to

Hennessy of Nympsfield (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, this may strike you
as a genuinely perverse opening remark, but I truly regret the need for
this morning’s debate. Why is this? It is because I wish we
lived in a well managed state, praised for the quality and delivery of
its public services, admired for its ability to complete grand projects
on time and within budget, overseen by a Whitehall where—the odd
emotional spasm apart—the crucial relationships between
Ministers and officials were always and everywhere in good repair. I
fear that these tests are not universally

there is no need to succumb to excessive pessimism nor to unleash a
relentless cataract of anxiety or criticism. There is still a lustrous
quality to our great tradition of non-politically partisan public
service, transferable from one Government to the next along with its
perpetual duty of speaking truth unto power; of telling Ministers what
they need to know rather than what they wish to hear. As a country, we
also possess a considerable, usable past in the history of our conduct
of central government. Public service has always attracted capable and
well motivated people and it still does. However, each generation has a
duty to revisit the traditional verities afresh; to test old models and
established practices against new needs and, quite rightly, ever more
stretching delivery requirements, while facing up to examples where
performance has not risen to the level of
events<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T11:47:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

time—48 years—since a Government commissioned a wide-lens
review of the Civil Service when Harold Wilson and his Chancellor, Jim
Callaghan, set up the Fulton inquiry in 1966. The Fulton story is not
an entirely happy one but it is not for reprising this morning, save to
note a serious flaw in its remit when Mr Wilson steered the committee
away from the crucial, central question of relationships between
Ministers and civil servants. It is this terrain upon which I would
like to descend first in today’s

relationships, which make up what I would call the governing marriage
between temporary Ministers and permanent officials, depend upon
confident Secretaries of State and confident civil servants in candid
symbiosis, raising the quality of each others’ game. The
relationship rests on a three-way deal. The deal is the product of two
key enquiries—the Gladstone-commissioned Northcote-Trevelyan
report of 1854 and the Lloyd George-commissioned Haldane report of
1918—plus a good deal of practical, everyday experience of
working our constitution by Whitehall generations past. Deal one is
non-political civil servants speaking truth unto power in private. Deal
two is reciprocal: in return for such candour, Secretaries of State
carry the can in public, even if things have gone wrong in places over
which Ministers did not have direct control. Deal three is a valuable,
high level of 
<?notus-xml column=355?>continuity within the state thanks to the career Civil Service
transferring between Administrations without a clean sweep of top
posts, as happens in the United

triple deal has been under stress for a good while now due to a number
of largely post-Fulton developments. The first has been the arrival of
special advisers in some quantity. Although a valuable and vitalising
factor in many ways, this has complicated the old-style governing
marriage and, in some unfortunate instances, has injected poison into
it. The second is the truly welcome development of departments
shadowing House of Commons Select Committees since 1979, which has
brought senior civil servants into a public and parliamentary limelight
experienced previously only by accounting officers appearing before the
Public Accounts Committee. This has altered for ever the old calculus
of official accountability to
Parliament<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T11:50:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

I am struck by the scratchiness in some, but by no means all, current
Whitehall departments between the partners to the governing marriage to
the point where there are suggestions that elements of the old deals
are but Victorian relics that clutter up the path to more effective and
efficient government. It is genuinely ironic that, with the ink
scarcely dry on the sections of the Constitutional Reform and
Governance Act 2010 enshrining at last the 1854 Northcote-Trevelyan
tenets, one should hear whispers in Whitehall that if less dramatic
reform measures fail, the 2010 Act should be amended to allow
Secretaries of State to have the predominant say in who will be their
Permanent Secretaries, a process known in the shorthand as ministerial

high a level of consensus as possible. To achieve this, much care and
forethought is required, which brings me to another question that has
exercised Parliament over the past year: the need for a very

“gains” are: the renationalisation of the Royal Mail; the
abolition of the bedroom tax; and a reduction in corporation tax. None
of those things is within the responsibility of the Scottish
Government. This is a manifesto in a document paid for by the taxpayer,
written by civil servants and costing £800,000. In common with
everybody else in Scotland, I got a leaflet through my letterbox, paid

precedent. I believe that upholding the Civil Service’s code of
conduct is a priority if we are to maintain the integrity of our

the roles of head of the Civil Service and the Cabinet Secretary and to
diminish both offices in the process. This goes to the heart of what is

we are moving to a relationship where the public sector acts more and
more as a commissioner of services, with the private sector as a

the skills for that task. That will mean the Civil Service embracing
greater transparency, underpinned by freedom of information. It is
increasingly going to need the skill sets to manage contracts with the
private sector in a way that gives the taxpayer high performance and
value for money. It will need a capacity to procure and manage highly
complex information-technology

the Northcote-Trevelyan reforms that cemented into our governance the
concept of a Civil Service that is politically neutral and selected on
merit. In the search for efficiency and technical competence, we must
not lose either the ethos of public service or the political neutrality

with the noble Lord, Lord Hennessy, and the other speakers that
something is wrong in the current working of our government, and in
particular in the relationship between civil servants and politicians.
A symptom of that, in my experience, is an unprecedented spate of
recrimination against named civil servants, made worse by the fact that
much of it has been through unattributable, backstairs
briefings.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000121" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0001.htm#14011662000121">Another
factor, not referred to by previous speakers, is the alarming turnover
in the senior ranks of the Civil Service. Every department but one has
had a change of Permanent Secretary since 2010: five have had three
Permanent Secretaries in that time; and the Department for Transport
had no fewer than four Permanent Secretaries between May 2010 and July
2012, which was when the debacle over the west coast main line took
place. Paradoxically, the Government’s proposal for five-year
fixed-term contracts for Permanent Secretaries would lengthen their
tenure, not shorten it.</hs_para>

long overdue. So, too, is a thorough review of the roles and
responsibilities of Ministers in Parliament when it comes to their

that is impressive—it is, of course, always exposed to one-way
criticism—but 
<?notus-xml column=364?>we should be willing to support and champion our Civil Service and civil

be open to learning the lessons of it. In looking at reform, we should
be live to the balance between policy and delivery, and perhaps it is
not yet in the right place. In the private sector, the focus is clearly
on the latter. It does not have to be the best plan, but to succeed it

there is one thing that is certain about the future of the Civil
Service, it is that it will always be needed but that different
Governments will want different things from it from their predecessors.
The Thatcher and Major Governments wanted different things from the
Civil Service from the Wilson and Callaghan Governments. When Mr Blair
came to power, he inherited a Civil Service that lacked the skills and
people that it needed to tackle the large increase in public spending
and the issue of delivery. The Civil Service must always retain the
capacity to change—to adapt to the needs of the
times—while remaining true to itself. To do that, it needs to
operate within a sophisticated, complex political deal which everyone
subscribes to and understands. It is no secret, as the noble Lord, Lord
Hennessy, rightly outlined, that there are problems with that deal now.
I regret very much to have to say it. It is partly to do with problems
of capability—the management of large projects, as the PAC has
very roundly illustrated—but also problems with the
constitutional framework, the role of Ministers in the appointment of
Permanent Secretaries, the large ministerial offices, and the
accountability of civil servants and Ministers to Parliament, and the
problem of the 
<?notus-xml column=365?>large number of Permanent Secretaries leaving over the past few years
fills me with considerable dismay. It is crucial for the Civil Service,
for us, for Parliament and for the public that the service should go on

am convinced that the Public Administration Select Committee’s
report, which is a devastating critique, is the right way to go: we
need a parliamentary commission. I congratulate the committee on what
it has produced. I think it will become a classic of its kind. However,
it needs to be agreed between the parties. It cannot be done by the
Government of the day. The Civil Service is not a subject for
unilateral experiment by people in power. It has to be done with
cross-party support and analysis, and it needs to be a truthful
analysis—good management and good politics do not always
coincide. The framework within which the service operates and the
standards by which it is judged must take that into account. It needs
good Ministers as well as good civil servants. All these things need to
be taken together and a current Government, whatever Government, are
not in a position to reach those judgments. I support the
need for a parliamentary commission but it must respect what
is bedrock: the non-political nature of the service and selection on
merit. Provided they are secured, there is a great deal of room for
original thought. It needs to be done now and the Government are
missing a real opportunity if they fail to grasp that, as they seem

I want to say is that the vast majority of people with whom I have
worked over the past 30 or 40 years have been committed, determined,
able, politically neutral and very often courageous in ways by which,
when I started, I was rather surprised. I shall not forget visiting
Baghdad and seeing a dozen government department representatives living

tasks. Many of the reforms now under way are necessary, indeed
essential—procurement, delivery and focusing on the skills
needed for the 21st century, which must include language skills if we
are to pay our way in the world. My noble friend Lord Wilson says,

advisers, creating a sort of cabinet for each Minister. When I
mentioned to a senior and highly respected French civil servant
recently that the Government were thinking of going down that road, he
blanched, looked horrified and said, “Do not put a layer of
25 year-old political appointees in between the professional
expertise of the Civil Service and its Ministers”. Perhaps that

also, like others, worry about the move towards a more political say in

regarded as the choice of one Government or Minister, he or she will
inevitably be regarded with suspicion by the next Minister or

Secretaries with larger numbers of political advisers will inevitably
erode the principle of neutrality of the Civil Service, which remains

main argument, I will make two points. First, over the Christmas
Recess, I read <I>The Blunders of our Governments</I> by Anthony King
and Ivor Crewe. The blunders are to be laid almost wholly at the door
of Ministers and not civil servants. That should be said, and it is
made clear in the book. Secondly, the noble Lord, Lord Jay of Ewelme,
referred to the courageous attitude of many civil servants, and I am
sure that he is right. However, today, a lot of senior civil servants
seem a great deal more reluctant to speak truth unto power, in the
sense of warning Ministers frankly that their proposals will not only
fail to achieve their objectives but may well prove harmful. I believe
that that is a major duty of civil servants and they should not
hesitate to exercise it for fear of the impact on their careers. That
has been a fear in recent years. Unchallenged “group
think” can lead to serious risk of
failure.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000156" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0001.htm#14011662000156">Finally
I come to my main argument, following the points of others about the
appointment of Permanent Secretaries. A year ago, I described in the

Peter Carey from the Department of 
<?notus-xml column=367?>Industry. Sir Brian Hayes proved a great success. I did not appoint; I

One thing was clear: there was locked up among them an institutional

words that are slightly old-fashioned and in danger of being lost in
that relationship. One is “leadership”, and we should
remember that leadership has to be given both to them and by
them—by Ministers and by the Permanent Secretary. The other is
“loyalty”. Loyalty is absolutely crucial, and loyalty in

seem to have a flickering of the problem when they call for joined-up

there is no sign of that. Writing a definitive textbook on modern
British government is a near impossibility these days that would
severely tax the powers of the noble Lords, Lords Hennessy and Lord
Norton. As Bernard Jenkin from PASC and the FDA have recommended, and
as many noble Lords have endorsed today, there is now an urgent need
for a comprehensive strategic review of the role and functioning of the

Turnbull (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, is the criticism of the Civil
Service coming from Ministers, Parliament and think tanks justified? Of
course, the Civil Service can, and should, raise its performance, but
the big picture is that since 1997 it has contracted by 13% and expects
to be 20% smaller by 2015. It is handling a rising caseload with less
money so its productivity has been significantly increased and many
services have been improved by digital delivery. Other countries see

Armstrong of Ilminster (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, my noble friend
Lord Hennessy of Nympsfield has been taking a keen interest in the
Civil Service, its activities and personnel, for nearly 50 years. That
interest has become steadily more benign and supportive over the years.
We all mellow with age. At least we can be grateful to him for raising
the subject and giving us an opportunity to debate it. With time being

Service has to be nimble and versatile enough to keep pace with the
implications of the social and technological changes and challenges
that occur and will continue to occur. Its role has always been, and
will continue to be, not so much to advise about what policies should
be pursued—that is a matter for political and ministerial
judgment and decision—as to advise on how the policies chosen by
Ministers can be put optimally into effect, and then to put them into
effect.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000177" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0001.htm#14011662000177">Civil
servants are expected to discharge their duties with honesty,
integrity, impartiality and objectivity. These have been the guiding
values of the Civil Service, as my noble friend Lord Hennessy reminded
us, for a century and a half. In 2010, they were given statutory
expression and force. Like motherhood and apple pie, 
<?notus-xml column=371?>no one seriously contests them. However, we seem to feel a need
constantly to parade and reassert them, and to write statutes, codes
and regulations to try to ensure that they continue to be applied in
every aspect of management. That seems to reflect a lack of confidence
in their being properly
observed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000178" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0001.htm#14011662000178">The
development of elaborate statements of principle, codes and
regulations makes me uneasy. There have to be arrangements for
disciplining those who transgress, but I should prefer a world in
which, as a general rule, the civil servant is the guardian of his own
integrity and relies on his own professional conscience and sense of
values. It is better that a civil servant should say to himself,
“Ought I to be doing this?”, or, “Ought I to be
doing this in this way?”, than that he should say to himself,
“Can I fit this within the rules and
regulations”—or, worse still, “Can I stretch the

the end, this is a matter, as noble Lords have already said, of mutual

Waldegrave of North Hill (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, it seems to me
that there are two separate issues here. First, there is the constant
process of change and modernisation that the Civil Service, like any
other organisation, needs. Some of the things that the Government are
proposing seem to be sensible—on project management and IT, for
example. They get some of them wrong: it was a grave mistake to
separate the Cabinet Secretary from the Head of the Civil Service. I
know that in the past there were different ways of doing this, but by
far the best is if the most powerful adviser to the Prime Minister is
also the man who understands appointments and promotions within 
<?notus-xml column=372?>the service. The abolition of the Sunningdale college, without its

ordinary things that go on. Government Ministers and heads of the Civil

number of things that such a commission should look at, taking account
of everything, including the defence posture of the country for the

Lord<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T12:51:57"></hs_TimeCode> Scott, but

and thought about that run into our fundamental, unwritten
constitutional principles, which we are calling today, in shorthand

represents promotion by merit, independence from political influence,

which the conflict between Normington, the Civil Service Commission and
the Government is going, although the commission has got itself into an
odd position there, as my noble friend Lord Jenkin of Roding, said. Sir
Peter Kemp went to his grave saying that I had sacked him. I had not
sacked him, but I had a consultation with the noble Lord, Lord Butler,
and we agreed that Sir Peter was not the man to be in charge of that
particular department at that particular time. It is possible for these
things to be done properly if you have the right structures. However,
if we get into a situation in which there is a conflict between a
commission that is becoming rule-bound and Ministers
who—particularly if the commission is headed by distinguished
former civil servants—see it as something of an insiders’
club, we are in difficulty.</hs_para>

look quickly, not at a parliamentary commission—here, I am with
the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull—but at an independent commission
in which there might be distinguished lawyers, and others, to look at
whether our defences against the attacks on the two fundamental
principles are real. We are running into danger, and I want a quick
six-month or year-long inquiry into whether in the modern world we have
enough defences for those fundamental pillars—after all, the
Civil Service Commission is charged with looking not at Haldane but
only at Northcote-Trevelyan. That inquiry might lead to recommendations
for a new kind of Civil Service commission, which may well be
necessary. We need to move more quickly; the situation is more urgent
than the noble Lord, Lord Hennessy, argued—mellowed though he

outstanding. That duty is to express my gratitude and admiration for
the quantity and quality of advice and help given to me and the
institution for which I worked for 22 years. I was lucky enough to have
a job that required daily communication with the Civil Service and
also, of course, with the Diplomatic Service at various levels. I was
then, and remain, a staunch admirer of these public servants, from the
mandarins at the top—by whom I am surrounded today—right
through the ranks. The patience and friendliness with which advice and
help were always given were matched only by its
quality<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T12:55:43"></hs_TimeCode>. To put
it bluntly, I could not have done my job without
it<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T12:55:47"></hs_TimeCode>. I soon

debate, however, is about the future of the Civil Service, not its
past—and still less about my past. Most Governments seem to
arrive in office with the avowed intent of not being “in thrall
to their civil servants”. After an initial stand-off, they
usually work their way through this phase and arrive at a satisfactory
relationship, making the most—rather than the least—of
those whose job it is to help them. Just now, however, it seems that
this relationship is about to undergo a period of fierce pressure, with
an onrushing tide of reforms and an increasing prevalence of special
advisers separately and together challenging the traditional role of
the Civil Service. To my mind, it is undesirable for the engineers of
change or their special advisers to become the creators of policy
rather than the sources of specialist advice—the role for which
their jobs were

devout hope for the future of the Civil Service is that it retains its
position as the hub around which the wheel of government turns, and not
just an adjunct to be used or blamed at the last resort. I know it has
not quite come to that yet, but I believe we should guard very
carefully against it. A review along the lines outlined by the noble

between now and the 1980s, of course, is that there is a breakdown in

ensure that there is ongoing, incremental improvement in the
effectiveness of the Civil Service. That is what the Government are now
effectively trying to do in things such as delivery and improving the
skills and the quality of advice that the service gives. At the end of

there is the question of accountability. At the end of the day, the

job because they are doing their job properly. A good Minister will
want to hear all the arguments before taking a decision; otherwise the
Minister is in danger of taking the wrong decision. Therefore, I am
totally opposed to any weakening of the present position where the
Secretary of State cannot appoint the Permanent

Norton of Louth (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, am delighted that
the noble Lord, Lord Hennessy, has secured this important and timely
debate. In the time available, I want to make two points. First, I very
much endorse the recommendation of the Public Administration Select
Committee for a commission on the Civil Service. That case is well made
in its report. The Government’s <I>Civil Service
</I><I>R</I><I>eform </I><I>P</I><I>lan </I>focuses on making the Civil
Service more effective both in service delivery and in offering policy
advice. As I said in evidence to the Public Administration Committee,
it takes a narrow and one-dimensional view of the relationship between
Ministers and civil
servants<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T13:01:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000197" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0001.htm#14011662000197">Ministers
depend on good civil servants. Conversely, civil servants rely on good
Ministers, and Parliament relies on Ministers and officials who
understand their responsibilities to Parliament. The system relies on
an understanding of these relationships, but the basis on which this
rests is being eroded. It is being eroded as a 
<?notus-xml column=375?>consequence of the turnover in senior civil servants
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T13:02:01"></hs_TimeCode>and the lack of
turnover in the party in government. Some politicians have become
senior Ministers with no prior experience of government. Turnover in
the senior Civil Service takes out the administrative experience and
specialisation that offsets the fact that both civil servants and
Ministers are
generalists<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T13:01:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000198" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0001.htm#14011662000198">This
makes the case for a major review and one that puts the
Civil Service within the context of our system of government and not
simply as some discrete managerial entity. Ministers see civil servants
as part of the problem without acknowledging that they too are part of
the problem. For that reason, the decision on how to address the
problem should not be left to
government<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T13:01:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000199" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0001.htm#14011662000199">That
brings me to my second point. The Government have rejected the proposal
for a commission. That, combined with my preceding point, means that it
is up to Parliament to take ownership of the process. I disagree with
the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, and my noble friend Lord Waldegrave: on
practical grounds we will not get an independent commission. If the
Government decline to support a Joint Committee, it is up to this House
to establish an ad hoc committee on the Civil Service. In response to
my noble friend Lord Waldegrave, that would time limit the actual
inquiry.</hs_para>

Donaghy (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord
Hennessy, for introducing this debate and echo the concerns of others
that the ingredients for improving efficiency and effectiveness in the
Civil Service are not even provided at present. I was a member and
former acting chair of the Committee on Standards in Public Life. We
did a considerable amount of work on the role of the Civil Service and
the importance of its independence. I wish that I had more time to say

as chair of ACAS, I was responsible for promoting good employment

is extremely important to be aware of the distinction between good
employment relations and Civil Service independence, and not confuse
the two. When I arrived at ACAS—and its staff were Civil
Service-related—it was clear that there was a need for a major
reorganisation to recognise the changes in the world of work. This was
a big project that involved the staff and was achieved with consent. It
took time. If you are going to get the best out of staff, you need to
inspire and motivate. Even within the term of one government, there can
be between two and eight changes of Minister and junior Minister, all
with different priorities. A new Minister comes in and says,
“Why are we wasting taxpayers’ money on this?”.
The Civil Service has to 
<?notus-xml column=376?>be able to show the origin of the project, usually the Minister's own
predecessor, so accountability is extremely
important<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T13:05:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000204" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0001.htm#14011662000204">Ministers
with perhaps only one or two years of office before them naturally want
to get things done. If they see Civil Service caution as an obstacle,
they are tempted to be surrounded by their own creatures. Of course,
there are Ministers with experience who have been managers. Too often,
however, our leaders come from a much narrower background and have
absolutely no experience of management or transparent appointment
procedures. To extend political appointments will only make a bad
situation worse. I only hope that there will be a code of conduct to
ensure transparency of appointment and pay. If the limit for Civil
Service commissioners’ approval remains as high as
£84,000, it will miss the point. Some of these prime ministerial
wannabes will do it for nothing and will come from a background where
they can afford to. While I accept that project management in
government does not have a great record, let us be clear: it can happen
even when a non-civil servant is drafted in from top business. The MoD

O'Donnell (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I should like to add my thanks
to the noble Lord, Lord Hennessy, as the noble Lord, Lord Armstrong,
said, in his long journey from the dark side. I also thank both Houses
of Parliament for passing the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act,
which, I have to say, civil servants advised Ministers to do about 150
years before they finally did it. Pace is something we need to think
about<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T13:07:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000207" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0001.htm#14011662000207">If
we are thinking about the pace of change, we should think about what
has happened in the past three years. The Civil Service has downsized
by about 75,000. It has managed an effective coalition Government,
which has not been done before. It has had to deal with cuts in real
pay, pensions, redundancy terms and promotion prospects. Yet throughout
all of that, morale has gone up. Engagement scores for the Civil
Service show an increase of two percentage points. Trust levels, as the
noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, said, have gone up by six percentage points
at a time when, as we know, trust in the political system is not
exactly strong. I put it to the House that if the Civil Service were a
private sector company, the Harvard Business Schools of this world
would be doing case studies on it, and we should applaud that
success<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T13:08:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000208" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0001.htm#14011662000208">However,
let us not hark on the past but talk about the future. What are the
challenges for the future? We are in a period of austerity until 2015
and beyond, or is it infinity and beyond—who knows? Can we carry
on? Yes, we have skills shortages in the Civil Service in areas such as
commissioning, financial management and project management. I commend
the noble Lord, Lord Browne, for the work that he has been doing on
some of these areas. The innovation, of which we need 
<?notus-xml column=377?>more in the role of non-executive directors, has been fantastic. They
have been incredibly helpful in departments and in bringing home to
civil servants and Ministers the business skills that we need to
deliver these big projects. That is very
good.</hs_para>

broader set of skills if we are to look at the reforms for the
challenges of government—and I stress government—for the
next few years. It is going to be all about things such as behavioural
public policy and sorting out how we measure success. In health, we
have quality-adjusted life years. For the whole of government, we will
need well-being years. Those are things to come. We need a broader
range of skills, including those of psychologists and multidisciplinary
people. We need more risk-taking, as I have said. If we are to get
risk-taking right, we will have to stop the emphasis on ex-post Spanish
Inquisitions and do a lot more on ex-ante appraisal of projects before
they come to us<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T13:09:53"></hs_TimeCode>.
Parliament should be demanding more information. We should have
something like an office of taxpayer responsibility which, building on
the OBR, would look at these projects and give you evidence to show
what the risks are. Where is the evidence base? Too often we have what
I call the Bachelors’ approach to policy. Do noble Lords
remember that Bachelors’ hit “I Believe”?
Ministers come in with very strong beliefs and you say, “Very
good, Minister, let’s test them. Let’s have a bit of
evidence. Let’s have a randomised control trial”. They
say, “No, too slow”. We need all of

I strongly support more experts. Of the top 200, 41% were externally
recruited in the first place. They should not be experts in telling the
Minister who appointed them how brilliant the Minister’s ideas
are. They should be genuine experts, based on meritocratic principles.
If we think about the future of government, we should analyse
government. You cannot just analyse the Civil Service. If you are going
to have a commission, make it on government and about Ministers and
Civil Service together. It would be a nonsense to do one half of the

Kerr of Kinlochard (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I am uneasy about
extended ministerial offices. There is a risk that we get the worst of
all possible worlds. In America, we see the dangers of hiatuses on a
change of Government. In France, the danger is that the cabinet system
means that policy-making is separated from the expertise of the
department as a whole. I am uneasy about surrounding the Minister with
more people whose tenure is dependent on the king’s smile. We do
not need more courtiers. If the Minister wants sycophants, he gets
special advisers: we have plenty of them already. As has been said, in
his policy-making meetings he should want honesty. He should want
people who know what they are talking about. The turnover numbers in
the Civil Service are very scary now. The expertise may not be as great
as it should be. I am struck by the fact that the Treasury wastage rate
was 28% in 2010 and 22% in 2011: 50% over the two years of a great
financial crisis. That cannot be right. It suggests that something is

apolitical Civil Service, I am struck by the point made by the noble
Lord, Lord

government money and time in producing a political manifesto. I am
uneasy about the exclusion of civil servants from policy-making if one
goes down the EMO route. The Minister who does not want his policy
subjected to the most rigorous internal dialectic should not be in
office. The artificial distinction that is drawn between policy-making
and delivery is a false dichotomy. There is no such thing as a good
policy that cannot be well delivered. That is a bad policy. You need to
have, in the room, as you decide, the people who will be responsible
for delivery. Even if you have, in your head, already decided what the
policy will be, it is crucial that you pretend to take account of the
arguments being advanced. You listen to their talk of pitfalls and
precedents and things that could go wrong, and you make them feel that
they were present at the creation. It is really important to loyalty

one symptom, the quality and preparation of legislation has been

Select Committees. The problem is the attempt to move away from the
simple criterion of excellence in recruitment and promotion towards
diversity, the aim of which is to make the Civil Service reflect more

let me start by saying that, of all the contributions made so far by
noble Lords, I agreed most with that of the noble Lord, Lord Armstrong.
It seems to me that at the heart of the current problem is a lack of
ministerial responsibility and acceptance by Ministers of that
responsibility in their dealings with the Civil Service and agencies
under their remits. The creeping way in which that has come into
government under all parties over recent years is at the heart of the
current problem, which is about the independence of the Civil Service,
the accountability of Ministers and their taking responsibility for
mistakes and
decisions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000222" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0001.htm#14011662000222">Without
a strong and independent Civil Service, and without Ministers who are
willing to listen and to change when change is necessary, our system of
government makes mistakes and
fails<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T13:20:11"></hs_TimeCode>. When
Ministers are strong and issue clear directions, civil servants know
where they stand and are perfectly capable of carrying out the
instructions and policies. That was certainly my experience in
government, and I think it should be at the core of where we move to in
the
future<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T13:20:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

point that I want to make is that, in the Government’s document
on Civil Service reform published in 2012, there is almost no mention
whatever of the relationship between central government and the
devolved Governments in the skilling and development of the Civil
Service and the spreading of knowledge within the service across the
different levels of

level of interchange between devolved government civil servants and
central government civil servants in this country has almost ground to
a halt. That is to the detriment of the devolved Governments, because
the civil servants who work in the devolved Administrations no longer
have experience of working in the Treasury, at UKRep—rather than
the Scottish Government’s office in Brussels—or in a
whole range of other central government offices where they can work
with people from other departments. Civil servants working in UK
government departments no longer have any knowledge of the education
service in Scotland or the health service in Wales or, indeed, all
those other departments that are now the sole and autonomous
responsibility of the devolved
Governments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000225" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0001.htm#14011662000225">It
seems to me that the issue of interchange between civil servants
working in the devolved Governments and civil servants working at the
centre needs to be tackled. It has been ignored through an abdication
of responsibility by successive Secretaries of State for the Cabinet
Office and by Ministers in the devolved Administrations over the past
decade or so. It is time that that was tackled, and tackled

to the first time that I was exposed to what might be the collective
noun for Permanent Secretaries—I do not know whether it is a
perfection or a permanence—at the spring conference in
Sunningdale in 1987. The noble Lord, Lord Armstrong, will remember it
because he presided over it just before he handed over to the noble
Lord, Lord Butler, and it was just before the election. Every Permanent
Secretary there had written his briefs for the right-hand drawer and
the left-hand drawer and was in an enormously relaxed mood. We had a
debate about the future Government and the role of the Civil Service,
and there was a wonderful feeling of confidence and so

20 years of working with civil servants at senior levels or, in some
cases, in quangos having civil servants working for me. I developed
enormous respect and admiration for the skills, intellect and
dedication of those civil servants. When I was asked to become the
chairman of what is now the Senior Salaries Review Body, Lord Plowden,
who was my predecessor, said to me, “My
boy,”—because I was so much younger than
him—“you must realise that this is the ultimate poison
pill”. I was slightly comforted because earlier I had taken on
another job in the private sector, but I went to a friend to ask his
advice. 
<?notus-xml column=381?>He said, “If you take that job on, you must be even stupider or
very much braver than I know you to be”. Anyway, I survived and

what so many speakers have said. What we have had in the Civil Service
is what I would call the “four
I’s”—independence, integrity, impartiality and I
have forgotten the last one but it is in much the same vein. I also
agree with what was said by the noble Lords, Lord Jenkin of Roding and
Lord Luce, that in the service provided by Permanent Secretaries and
senior civil servants there has to be courage and a certain robustness
in order to be prepared to challenge Ministers on their chosen policies
along with an ability to convert those policies into legislation and
systems that work. So I am entirely in favour of what the noble Lord,
Lord Hennessy, has said. The values were referred to by the noble Lord,
Lord Wilson of Dinton, as the bedrock. I would describe them as the
gold standard of values: a public service ethic and the wish to do good
for the country, along with a desire for fairness. These values have, I
think, been
eroded<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T13:25:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

referring to one more point. Sir Hayden Phillips wrote an article about
the Civil Service for the <I>Times</I> in which he used the term
“shared enterprise” in the partnership between Ministers
and their Permanent Secretaries. I think that that has been eroded. All
I know is that in the private sector, unless there is confidence
between the non-executive chairman and the chief executive and there is
a working relationship, the right answers will not be produced. That is
what is lacking, and I support the fact that there needs to be a major
look at the Civil Service.</hs_para>

Prashar (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, thank the noble Lord, Lord
Hennessy, for securing this debate, and I agree with most of what he
said. As the custodians of Civil Service values, the Civil Service
Commissioners operate where operational issues and propriety issues
interact. My experience as the First Civil Service Commissioner from
2000 to 2005 convinced me that any reform of the Civil Service must be
tested against the principles, values and conventions which have guided
the Civil Service for several
decades<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T13:26:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Civil Service started in the 1980s, but it has been piecemeal and
predominantly managerial. In the 1980s and 1990s, fears arose that
those piecemeal reforms might undermine or erode the values of the
Civil Service and weaken the conventions which act as checks
and balances within our unwritten constitution. Publication of the
Civil Service Code in 1995 and putting the Civil Service Commission on
to a statutory footing in 2010 were testaments to that
fear.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000233" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0001.htm#14011662000233">The
current proposals with regard to the relationship between Ministers and
top civil servants, ministerial involvement in senior appointments and
extended ministerial offices have aroused similar fears. That is
because, in my view, these proposals underplay the significant
functions carried out by the Civil Service within our constitutional
arrangements—functions such as helping to ensure that the
Government of the day act with propriety, supporting Ministers in the 
<?notus-xml column=382?>management of decision-making and providing objective advice; that is,

seen many of the consequences that have resulted from defective
decision-making, partly due to a lack of capability in the Civil
Service, which of course needs to be addressed, but also due in part to
the weak application of these principles. In December 2013 Sir Alan

this issue is not new. In 2003, the former Prime Minister the right

that the IPPR report, <I>Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil

believe that the time is right for a comprehensive and strategic review
of the nature, role and purpose of the Civil Service, as recommended by
the Public Administration Select Committee. Any commission that is set
up should look not just at the Civil Service but at the role of
Ministers as well. As the noble Lord, Lord Hennessy, said, the Civil
Service is a national asset and is not owned by the Government of the
day but held in trust for the next Administration. I urge the
Government to change their mind and set up an independent commission
for the sake of the future of the Civil Service and for the health of

debate, marred only by the time constraints under which we all have to
speak. I warmly congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Hennessy, on the
splendid and spirited way in which he introduced the debate. All those

troubles me about the Civil Service is its increased politicisation. I
believe that that is due, mainly, to the enormous growth in the number
of so-called special advisers. When I first became a Member of
Parliament in 1970, I had the good fortune to be asked in the July of
that year to become a Parliamentary Private Secretary in the Department
of Health and Social Security. It was one department covering all those
areas, with only four Ministers: a Secretary of State, a Minister of
State in this House and two Under-Secretaries. I saw at first hand how
the 
<?notus-xml column=383?>effective working—and it was an effective working—of a
splendid department, under Sir Keith Joseph, depended so much on the
trust that existed between the civil servants and the Ministers. Trust
is the essential hallmark of a good Civil Service and a good Civil

talk a lot in this place about free speech, a free Parliament, and we
are right to do so. However, at the base of it all, if we are to have a
properly functioning democracy, we need those who are imbued by an
ideal of public service, who are themselves following a vocation to
public service and who are bringing their integrity and their ability
to making sure that our country works properly. What has happened over
recent years was illustrated for me in 1995, when I called on a
colleague who was a Secretary of State to discuss some matters. I was
met by a young man who was excessively polite and extremely welcoming.
The Secretary of State came in and said “Have you been talking
to …” and mentioned his name. I said yes and asked him,
“What exactly is his job?”. “Oh, he’s my
special adviser”. I said “Oh yes, how old is he?”.
“He is 23”. I said “What on earth can he specially

party stuff may be important, but it should never get in the way of the

grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Hennessy, for his initiative in
arranging this debate and I am happy to add to his already mammoth
score. There have been quite a number of claims
recently—sometimes from Ministers—that civil servants in
government departments have not properly pursued the policy that their
Ministers have laid down and are being insufficiently supportive of
their department’s work. I do not share that view at

some noble Lords may recall, I was, at the time, one of the very few
people to have been catapulted into the Civil Service from outside to
become a Permanent Secretary. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord
Armstrong, and the noble Lord, Lord Butler, will remember the occasion.
However, whatever the circumstances may have been concerning that
particular appointment, it gave me the huge privilege—I still
regard it as a huge privilege—of joining the Civil Service at
the top and seeing and learning for myself how the system operated.
When I joined the MoD 30 years ago, I had experienced its workings only
from the outside and shared the prejudices of many people in relation
to civil servants that, fundamentally, they did not work very hard and
were inadequately aware of the world outside of their somewhat

recall that not long after the start of the Blair government, one or
two Ministers were complaining that their staff did not brief them
adequately on the actions that they should take going forward and
simply presented to them a number of options without a recommendation.
If I recall correctly, it was the noble Lord, Lord Cunningham, who, on
leaving office himself, commented sagely that that was indeed the
proper role for civil servants—to present options to their
Ministers and then it was for Ministers, at the end of the day, to take
the decision. He was, of course, absolutely

Civil Service is, happily, not politicised. It is made up of people who

work hard for relatively modest reward to serve their country to the

put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Hennessy, for this
debate—the future of the Civil Service—we can build on
the excellent ethos that has been built up over so many years. I am
certainly of the view that we tamper with it at our

Sutherland of Houndwood (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, we had a splendid
opening to this debate and that has been carried through, I
congratulate my noble friend Lord Hennessy on that. A number of years
ago when I was serving what I suppose was, in a university context, an
apprenticeship for this kind of thing, I was the junior member of a
senate and had to sit on an appointment panel for a very senior
administrative post—university registrar, I think. We were wise
and we brought in someone from the Civil Service to help—which
is the reverse of the process that we have been complaining about
today—as it was an administrative post. He started his questions
by looking the first candidate in the eye and saying, “You are
evil, but you are
necessary”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000249" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0001.htm#14011662000249">I
have pondered that ever since and, on the whole, have come down on the
“necessary” side, especially in the present company. That
was a lesson, and I have to say that any civil servant who was feeling
a little bruised in the run-up to this debate might take a turn sitting
in front of a senate of academics. I say to them, what you are
experiencing now<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T13:37:45"></hs_TimeCode>

I run out of time, there are two comments that I will make
straightaway. One is that wherever I travel in the world where there is
still evidence of the influence of the British Civil Service system, it
is a benign influence. Where it is wholly absent, you can tell. By
whatever measure you use, this is a benign influence.
Secondly—and I should say that I do not think that it 
<?notus-xml column=385?>is all the fault of the politicians, because we do run the risk of
moving in that direction and saying that they are to blame and this
perfect Rolls-Royce model is trundling on—I want to focus my
remarks for my remaining minute or so on something that has not been
discussed in this debate: namely, the place of quangos. They sit
roughly between the Civil Service operating as it does and the special
advisers brought in to do the jobs that they seem to do.</hs_para>

came to light in my experience when I was chairing a commission looking
at the national tests debacle for schools in 2008, when thousands of
schoolchildren did not receive their results on time. The essence of
it, eventually, was that there was a quango running this. The internal
processes of that quango had failed and the procurement process, though
it ticked all the boxes, was not adequate. I have spoken about this
before in the House. Also, the lines of communication between the Civil
Service, the Department for Education and the quango were
messy<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T12:54:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000252" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0001.htm#14011662000252">The
plan was to deal with the problem of devolving power to a quango by
putting observers on the quango and all its subcommittees. It did not
work. The observers did not have defined instructions or roles. They
did not know, for example, whether they were reporting everything that
happened to the Permanent Secretary or not. The members of the quango
thought, “Well, we have observers from the DfE sitting here;
surely what we are doing is all right”. There was, of course, a
real problem and a collapse: a process that spent potentially
£150 million of government money collapsed. I ask that, if there
is a move towards having a much wider debate, the role of
quangos—their powers and their responsibility and accountability
to the department—should be sorted out very clearly, especially
for those bright young people who go in as observers and do not quite
know what they are

the role of politicians should not be overlooked, as the noble Lord,
Lord Norton, and other noble Lords emphasised today. The service does
not work in a vacuum but as part of what the noble Lord, Lord Hennessy,
calls, “the governing marriage” between temporary
Ministers and permanent officials. Sadly, most of the bundle of reports
concentrates only on the Civil Service, omitting what Ministers might
do differently to make it more effective—whether in the
complexity of laws or procedures, the lack of devolution or our

has been acknowledged, our Civil Service is admired around the world.
It is politically impartial, with core values of integrity, propriety

loyalty from one Government to the next. However, that does not mean
that there is no need for change. In a fast-changing world, with new
technologies and new forms of service delivery, the Civil Service
itself wants to change, to meet the increasing demands of government
and the higher expectations of the public. That means addressing skills
gaps in procurement, accountability and performance management, the
integration of corporate functions and better delivery of major

avoiding what the noble Lord, Lord Hennessy, calls the

not regret the need for this debate and I was rather puzzled that the

to me that it is exactly the job of this House to debate the principles
of government to see where we think government may be going wrong. We
are, in effect, the institutional memory—though some of us can
remember rather more than others. In dealing with a number of papers
over the past 10 days, I have been very struck by how the institutional
memory does not go back much beyond about 1990; however, mine does, so
I was able to say, “No, the problem did not begin then”.

young academic, in 1977 I published a study of Whitehall’s
management of Britain’s international relations and then got
caught up in a government review, the Berrill report, of much the same
thing. I vividly remember being carpeted in the Paris embassy by Sir
Nicholas Henderson, who thought that I was a dangerous radical
suggesting all sorts of things that would undermine Her
Majesty’s Diplomatic Service—and, indeed, the Diplomatic
Service saw off the Berrill report pretty firmly. That was a mistake.
It is part of the problem that we have with the absence of language
skills across the Civil Service at present that
we did not think, as the Berrill commission and others like me were
saying, that we needed to spread those skills across the Department of
Trade and Industry and other departments. The internationalisation of
government is one of the revolutions that we have been running through
since
then.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000264" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0002.htm#14011662000264">Over the
past 30 or 40 years, Whitehall and the British Government as a whole
have had to cope with a whole series of changes. I have mentioned
internationalisation, but we have also seen the gradual centralisation
of the delivery of public services—first across the country and
then with the partial reversal of that in the establishment of the
devolved Governments—which has left England as the most
centralised country in the advanced industrialised world. I hope that
what the coalition Government is now doing with city deals is beginning
to reverse that. That will have implications for the central Civil
Service.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000265" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0002.htm#14011662000265">The
expansion of public services, particularly the provision of welfare and

the past 20 years, there has also been the growth of outsourcing and
contract management. The move away from lifetime employment has been a
matter not just for the Civil Service but for our entire economy and
society. It has been recognised that the accumulation of skills from
shifts in post in your career helps you on your way to reaching
positions of responsibility at the top—particularly, the need to
acquire management skills, which the Civil Service has been much
concerned
about.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000267" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0002.htm#14011662000267">Of
course, there is also now the digital revolution. The Government have
been behind the private sector in moving from paper to digital
exchange, but I am happy to say that through the Cabinet
Office—Francis Maude and others—they are doing their
utmost to catch up. One of the most effective pieces of insourcing in
which this Government have been engaged is the creation of the
Government Digital Service. This is made up of a number of bright
outsiders who hate

has also been the revolution of the coalition Government, to which the
Civil Service has had to adapt. In my experience, a number of civil
servants have adapted extremely well to the tactful ways in which
Ministers of two different parties have to be treated. There has been a
need for adaptation while, as a number of people have argued, sticking
to the core principles of
Northcote-Trevelyan.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000269" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0002.htm#14011662000269">On
the concept of civil servants following the national interest, we no
longer talk about them as being “servants of the Crown”

on the economic right, by the growth of public-choice economics and by
the philosophies of Ayn Rand which have come across the Atlantic, but I
think that all of us here would hold to the idea that service to the
state and the concept of public service are important parts of what

Civil Service in terms of diversity and gender. It is encouraging how
many bright young women there are coming up in the Civil Service. I
think that eight of the 36 Permanent Secretary posts are now held by
women—that is not enough; it was rather more two years
ago—and we hope that it will again be rather more in a few
years’ time. There is real diversity across the sector. When I
travel to other countries, it seems to me that at every embassy that I
visit the economic counsellor is of south Asian extraction. Lots of
bright people, men and women, are coming through the Civil Service.
That is one of the achievements in particular of the Blair Government

the issue of a parliamentary commission, the Government are not
persuaded of the need for a vast commission. The noble Lord, Lord

past. When he was probably still at school, I was a junior adviser to
the Crowther-Hunt Royal Commission on the Constitution. If he has the

the question of the relationship among Ministers, civil servants and
Parliament. The noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, talked about the role of
junior Ministers and how many we may need, which is a rather

that has changed over the past 40 years is the relationship between
Parliament and civil servants. Parliamentary inquiries by my honourable

politicisation of the Civil Service, which a number of noble Lords have
touched on and expressed concern about. In my experience over the past
three and a half years, I have found special advisers, both those
within the Deputy Prime Minister’s Office and those working for
Conservative Secretaries of State, to be extremely helpful in easing
the relations between the coalition partners and in assisting private
offices in the division of work between what is entirely administrative
and what becomes political. Perhaps it would be appropriate for a
parliamentary committee to look at the expansion of special advisers
but I certainly would give evidence in favour of their usefulness in
the scene. Whether or not the expanded ministerial office will be that
different from what one saw in Gordon Brown’s private office,
for example, where the spads were very much part of the office, I am
not entirely sure. Again, we should recognise that practice has already
evolved and will evolve

has also been concern about the question of choice in Permanent
Secretary appointments. We have been round this many times before. I am
old enough to remember as a student the great spat between Richard
Crossman and his Permanent Secretary. Since then, a number of
Secretaries of State—Jack Straw and others—have insisted
that they have in effect chosen their Permanent Secretaries. This is an
area in which it seems that the recent suggestion that the Prime
Minister should have the ultimate say on the appointment of a Permanent
Secretary is an acceptable move in this evolving set of

some senior officials. I had my ear chewed off by a bright young civil

his guiding principles in 1989: inclusion, by making sure no one is
left behind demographically or geographically; freedom and
transparency, by making sure that consumers understand the quid pro quo
with the handful of big companies whose services they mainly use
without obvious charge; and openness, by making sure no Government can
control access and content. This is tested every day. Just this

friend who is determined not to be excluded. He has combated
bereavement and loneliness, kept mentally active and even, perhaps,
deferred or diminished the onset of mental illness by becoming
internet-proficient. In the UK today, there are 10 million
people over 65, and by 2050 there will be more than 20 million. Some
11% of one-person households over state pensionable age had internet
access in 2000; today it is more than 40%. However, as the noble
Baroness pointed out, there are still around 6 million pensioners who
have never used the internet. Seventy-five per cent of people in the UK
who are over 75 consider themselves lonely. My 94 year-old friend would
never consider himself lonely. For him, the internet is infinitely
flexible. Online book groups, staying in touch with friends via e-mail
and texts, Skype calls and downloading music and videos keep him alert
and interested in the world outside. A Dutch survey confirms that
people who feel lonely are significantly more likely to develop
clinical dementia than those who have no such feelings.</hs_para>

the internet empowers them. They are starting small businesses, going

to play a musical instrument. Recent research suggests that video games
help keep brains alert and improve cognitive function and hand-eye
co-ordination. The gaming industry is now looking to develop more video
games specifically tailored for older people. Dr Gary Small,

unfamiliar tablets and phones, will encourage even more of them to use
it to the full. This morning, my 94 year-old friend had the last word.
He sent me a message inviting me to join him on LinkedIn. I have no
doubt that, although physically frail, his astute, inquiring and agile

the world wide web—the internet—presents an enormous
range of benefits and challenges. It is all pervasive, as the noble

positive benefits but perhaps some of the biggest challenges that the
Government face are things such as cybersecurity. Everything now rests
on the web or the internet in one way or the other. Keeping that
information safe is a big challenge. Only yesterday, we saw a
horrifying use of the internet in child abuse and paedophilia. Young
children in the Philippines were being used to gratify the obscene
needs of some people scattered around the world. We have to look at all
aspects of that. There is the question of taxing the companies which
make enormous profits on the internet and the world wide web in a way
that does not hamper growth but makes sure that they make a real
contribution to the economies that they benefit from. Equality of
access is another point to which the noble Baroness drew to our
attention. There is still a digital divide when it comes to speed of
access and, for some, a generational divide. We need to do more to
encourage the older generation to participate, as the noble Lord, Lord
Chadlington, said in his contribution, although I think that as each
successive generation comes along, they will be more able to do that,
and the younger generation to be internet savvy. I agree with the noble

clinicians to access information where and when they need it, which is
ever more important in a world where, for example, there are now more
than 6,000 different disease entities. It also enables them to consult
colleagues. Organisations such as the Swinfen Charitable Trust, run by
the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, and his wife, allow clinicians in even
the most remote and isolated locations in the world to consult a
network of clinicians in every discipline. The web also helps meet
patients’ demand for information and
empowerment. For example, there are 27 million views of NHS
Choices a month and 1 million patient reviews of services on
the site. It also allows for the remote monitoring of patients where,
with the whole system demonstrator, the NHS leads the world in terms of
evidence-based use of this technology at significant scale. There is
even patient self-treatment. There is an excellent programme called
“Beating the Blues”, which is designed to do exactly what
its name implies, and I wonder whether this is the first
internet-delivered treatment available on NHS prescription. If so, I am
sure there will be many more.</hs_para>

progress in health has not, perhaps, been as a fast as one might have
expected because behaviour change is slow in health and redesign
involves many other aspects of health systems. This is problematic but
not necessarily always a bad thing. It is important that, in a subject
as crucial as people’s health, evidence of impact and

conclude on a point where we need national and international
co-ordination. I am privileged to be one of the Global
eHealth ambassadors, in a programme chaired by Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
It exists to promote telemedicine and e-health globally. It sees
e-health as a means of transforming healthcare delivery to make it
economically and socially much more sustainable. It campaigns for some
standardisation of systems and methodologies in e-health to ensure that
data can be properly shared and that every clinician can judge the
reliability and effectiveness of the electronic tools they
are offered. We need a global framework for this. This is very
ambitious but much of the infrastructure to sustain that
transformation already exists. The programme gives an example of one of
those wonderful internet facts. It asserts that there are now more cell
phones in Africa than toothbrushes. I am not sure that we can verify
this assertion but we have known for years that toothbrushes
are essential for health and we now know that cell phones and the world
wide web are even more
essential.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_16_PT_1/B47A8EC80AA08E7784652B516B3FAEAD82916F5B" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 16 January 2014">Thursday,

experience of being a university teacher that when students writing an

tell—the information just did not fit with the main argument

that the web is so wonderful at making available needs interpretation.

world wide web is that you can now hold it in the palm of your hand,
and, with one finger—or two thumbs, if you are more dextrous
than me—control the web and have the information come to you.
That raises huge questions about how we help people interpret all the
information, temptation and possibilities. My simple question is: what
is the role of a Government concerned about human rights and human
welfare in trying to give people a hinterland and some tools, with
allies—which allies the Government would recognise is another
question—so that there is a big picture to help people
interpret? People talk about giving parental control. That is a
technical solution, but parents and others need a kind of hinterland; a

millions suffer on the wrong side of the digital divide, for reasons of

disability-related factors. Disabled people who are currently offline

comments on higher education and the advent of MOOCs. MOOCs are not a

running the LSE about 15 years ago, we all thought that the

that situation. Now these courses are being adopted by the elite
American universities: Harvard, MIT and Stanford. They promise to be

their armoury. In this country we lag behind. The Open University is in

sociologists call the “compulsion of

the added value of having been to a campus-based university. However,

to their own technology myopia. There are many more to come. In the

start with some amazingly good news. Ten days ago, on 6 January, 1
million teachers shared lesson plans and ideas with each other across
the web on this one day at the beginning of term. Not only did that
possibility not exist at all in 2008, but that degree of co-operation
would have been unimaginable during the six years that I worked with
the Department of Education not that long ago. Quite extraordinary
things are taking place but, as has been said, the digital world is
both a creator and, potentially, a destroyer of jobs, even of lives. I
do not believe that that is fully understood by government or business.
In their own ways, both the noble Baroness, Lady Kidron, and the noble
Lord, Lord Giddens, are right: there are extraordinary opportunities
and great dangers. Jaron Lanier’s book, <I>Who Owns the
Future?</I>, unblinkingly sets out these challenges. He, like Sir Tim

year—is that 183 billion e-mails are sent every day.
At the outset, had we had the wit to place a 1p levy on each
e-mail—these are unaudited figures—that would generate
today £730 billion worldwide. That figure is 29 times
the total amount spent by the United Nations and all its agencies each
year. It is more than the global aspiration for development and climate
change mitigation recommended by the UN. Last year, the need of UNICEF,
of which I was UK president, was £1.7 billion, of which only 46%
is currently funded. This tiny 1p levy could totally change the
landscape of aid and the opportunities for multinational support
worldwide.</hs_para>

and technology, captured brilliantly by the noble Baroness, Lady

seconds which once would have taken days; pictures and news can be
shared instantly with friends and family; grandparents can Skype their
loved ones in Australia; anyone can set up shop, or start a business,
for next to nothing; and individuals are free to express their
political and other passions, convictions and beliefs, as never before,
unmediated. Events can be broadcast that repressive states once covered

changes that have taken place in education have been breathtaking, not
least for adults who benefit in terms of lifelong learning. I think,
for instance, of the work of the Royal College of Music, on whose
council I sit, and I declare an interest accordingly. One of the
hallmarks of the RCM’s wonderful teaching is the virtuoso master
class. Each year 4,500 people attend them, but by making them available
online, a much bigger audience can participate. Consider this: in the
past three months alone, more than 60,000 people have watched one of
those master classes, more than had attended all master classes in

resource to teach people the basics of music theory. So far, it has
delivered more than 200,000 lessons to more than 50,000 students in 50
countries. That is the great egalitarian, inclusive side of the

media is another area where change has been dramatic, and I declare my
interest as director of the Telegraph Media Group. While some suggest
that the internet is destroying the media, the truth is the opposite
for innovative and enterprising companies because of the new audiences
that the web provides. The <I>Telegraph</I> was the first paper to get
a website, back in 1994, but at that time its audience was limited to
those who read newspapers in the UK. Twenty-five years on, audiences
are global, and when people want authoritative news analysis, it is
trusted news brands to which they turn. During the London Olympics, the

are seeing strong growth in online audiences. Three regional
publishers, including the owners of the <I>Scotsman</I>, the
<I>Northern Echo</I> and the <I>Manchester Evening News</I> passed 10
million monthly online readers last year, a massive figure, considering

<?notus-xml column=414?>the geographical limits on their print circulation. Of course,
newspapers still face huge challenges in this age of the internet:
protecting copyright, as the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley of Knighton,
said; monetising digital content; and adapting business models. Gaining
a global audience also means attracting global competition. Such a
period of transition is proving to be painful for many in publishing
but it is change that is absolutely essential for survival. For those
who are succeeding, the internet is taking the UK’s iconic
newspaper and magazine titles and turning them into global media
brands.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000422" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0002.htm#14011662000422">I
conclude with this point in praise of the web: with so much content
from so many publishers, the vast majority of them individuals, being
provided in so many jurisdictions, any attempt to censor the web
through legal or statutory regulation is ultimately doomed to failure.
This point is vital to any debate about press regulation, which is dear
to my heart, but which was, ironically, completely ignored during the
Leveson inquiry, which was an analogue inquiry for our digital world.
What the web, in all its glorious anarchy, has done is to make any form
of statutory press control futile in an online age. As someone who
believes passionately in freedom of expression, that is one of many

pollution is now predicted in many urban areas: it was used in Beijing
and used in London. This can be predicted right down to street levels.
If you look at the number 73 bus, it will tell you that if you have
breathing difficulties, get a message from your doctor and then you get
this information. But this information—I have been talking about
it and everybody has been talking about it—is essentially
one-way information in terms of technical information. Now, however, we
have the possibility of people providing information back. There is a
fascinating example from Manila, which was able to deal with floods in
a way that we could perhaps learn about in the UK. People there have
mobile phones and send back information in the form of a
colour—yellow, red or green—as to whether the water has
reached their ankles, their knees, their thighs or their shoulders.
This goes to a central centre, which can see where all the water is
travelling in terms of height; it then runs its computer programs hour
by hour and tells people whether to get out or to stay put. This is
what is called the “web 2.0”—this business of much

involvement of amateurs has been traditional in sciences such as
botany, but the scope for citizen scientists is now much wider.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T15:31:41"></hs_TimeCode> my subject of
astronomy, for instance, there is so much data that the professionals
cannot scrutinise them fully. It is now possible for eagle-eyed
amateurs to access archives and themselves discover new planets or
galaxies. Likewise, large datasets in genetics, healthcare and
environmental science can be accessed anywhere. This openness can
promote the progress of science, the understanding of it and trust in
it<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T15:32:13"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T15:32:29"></hs_TimeCode>.

Here I fully agree with the noble Lord, Lord Giddens. The web may
thankfully have a disruptive and benign effect on some unsatisfactory 
<?notus-xml column=416?>features of formal education, especially higher education. It will offer
access to an ever-growing menu of outstanding courses—star
lecturers and teachers will have a global reach. Traditional

OU’s Openlearn website, much prepared jointly with the BBC. In
the United States, two organisations, edX and Coursera, disseminate
MOOC courses developed by leading universities. The OU has set up a
similar system called FutureLearn. I think all UK universities should

Lady Lane-Fox, was an inspiring one. I hope it is widely disseminated.
The first thing I would like to do is to echo her call on the
Government to find a way of recognising the 25th anniversary of Sir Tim
Berners-Lee’s invention. This is, after all, the country that
invented the industrial revolution, the second one that changed mankind
out of all shape following the agricultural revolution 10,000 years
ago. Sir Tim Berners-Lee’s step is another giant step on the
road for this country and we ought to recognise it as much as other
countries do, where you often see public memorials to him even before
he is dead, which is quite an achievement. I congratulate him again on
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T15:35:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

this moves very fast. I started my blog as a Member of Parliament in
the early part of this century. There were just three of us who did it.
I then moved it here to the House of Lords under “Lords of the
Blog” and it is still going, but I slipped off the edge a bit
and I need to reinvent myself. One of the beauties of the world wide
web and the internet is that you can actually reinvent yourself. As
someone said earlier, you actually can stimulate your own mind in doing
so, although I might need the assistance of the noble Lord’s 94

the way everyone works. We do not talk enough about how it will change
this place and the way we do politics. The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood,
touched on that point. We really have not thought that through. I give
a simple example: the argument about security and privacy, which came
to the fore with the revelations about the interception of messages.
The Bill that we passed five or six years ago was out of date
technologically before it received Royal Assent. Many of the Acts of
Parliament that we 
<?notus-xml column=417?>enact now are also technologically out of date. We have to find a way
for Parliament to modify laws as we move on. We have tended over the
years to have a system where we simply added amendments or changes or a
new Act every five, 10 or 15 years. The speed of change is so great,
however, that on anything involving technology, we get left
behind<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T15:36:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000436" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0002.htm#14011662000436">My
last message is to the political parties. I am no longer involved in
drawing up manifestos, thank heavens, but all the parties need to have
a very clear statement about science and technology in their manifestos
for the next election, particularly on how they are going to approach
the privacy and security of the world wide web and the internet. It is
profoundly important. There are very exciting possibilities here. We
really can change the way we do politics and involve people in the
political process much more effectively than we have done in the past.
It is not easy to work out how to do this, but we need to respond to
how people are thinking about things and how we can create politics out
of ideas and movements rather than just carry on with political parties

group that is excluded from access to the internet by way of government
policy. I am not asking the Government to change the policy, but to
modify it in relation to some within that group. Its members are part

prisoners are excluded from the internet. We imprison more people than
any other nation in Europe and our prisons are full to capacity, with
more than 85,000 prisoners, but the policy is not working. More than
70% of prisoners reoffend within the first year of release, and major
factors concerning reconviction are a lack of education and training,
and the inability to gain employment.</hs_para>

have been high-profile cases where Twitter has been used to intimidate
people. I am an admirer of a small charity called the Cybersmile
Foundation, which started in 2010. It offers advice to victims.
Organisations like Cybersmile and charities like BeatBullying,
ChildLine and Kidscape have an important role to play in this. I urge

can find a way of sharing information relevant to their interests and
to their members and fellow citizens is an important aspect of what it
does. At the same time, it is also universal, in that you have access
anywhere in the world where you can get a connection—although
that is not always possible, even in
Britain.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000481" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0002.htm#14011662000481">The
web also has a different way of focusing things. We have millions of
communities, we all have multiple identities and those identities can
be reflected on the web though our languages, our hobbies and our
different natures. It allows those with shared interests to exchange
resources in a way that has not been possible before. That is helped,
of course, by search engines. Information has always existed; it has
always been in repositories and difficult to access but now it is
available. It is of variable quality, as we have heard, but it
certainly is there if you can find

links, both in real time and in a parallel way, across things. Many
noble Lords will understand that if they have young children or
grandchildren. My children seem to enjoy in a relaxing
moment—although they say that they are working—lying on a

e-mailing while watching television and possibly reading something on

Moynihan (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I am very glad to have the
opportunity to raise this important topic. There is no doubt that China
shocked both its neighbours and the international community when, last
November, it announced its highly controversial decision to create an
ADIZ beyond its territorial airspace in the skies above the
Senkaku/Diaoyu islands in the East China Sea. Those shock-waves are
still reverberating around the region and beyond, and I believe it is
essential for British interests that we adopt a clear position when
assessing the significance of China’s abrupt unilateral action.
In particular, China promised emergency defence measures in the case of
non-compliance and an intent to establish more of these zones in the
future.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000527" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0003.htm#14011662000527">In
this latest escalation, Beijing insists that the ADIZ was drawn with no
specific country in mind, but it seems highly likely that it was
intended as a rebuke to the Japanese Government for their private
purchase of three of the islands in September 2012—a move that
gave rise to anti-Japan protests across China and caused concern among
Japan’s allies. Since then, Chinese coastguard vessels have
repeatedly asserted an operational presence in the territorial seas
around the islands, raising the spectre of a new Sino-Japanese conflict
and sparking fears of tit-for-tat retaliatory measures spreading
volatility and uncertainty across the
region.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000528" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0003.htm#14011662000528">Of
course, ADIZs are hardly uncommon in the region and have been used to
political ends in the past, but no other country in the region extends
its ADIZ to cover disputed territory that it does not control.
Following the announcement, the United States expressed its
“deep concern”, as did the EU. Does the Minister agree
that incorporating the skies over the Senkaku/ Diaoyu islands within
its alert zone is, at best, a significant misjudgment on China’s
part and that, beyond the present war of words, it will increase the
likelihood of further escalation, creating fertile conditions for a
serious incident in the region as a
result?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000529" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0003.htm#14011662000529">This
particular dispute in the East China Sea has attracted much attention
because of the potential for war between the region’s biggest
economies. However, as this House well knows, the resource-rich South
China Sea is the subject of a number of equally contentious territorial
disputes between China and its neighbours, particularly the Philippines
and Vietnam. Worryingly, clashes in the South and East China Seas 
<?notus-xml column=433?>have risen significantly over the past two years, with Japan, the
Philippines and Vietnam all accusing China of a more aggressive posture
over disputed territories and
waters.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000530" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0003.htm#14011662000530">It
would cause international outrage if China were to create an ADIZ over
the whole South China Sea, but this has not stopped Beijing from
choosing to provoke its neighbours, most particularly in its decision
to use an image of the highly controversial “nine-dash
line” in Chinese passports in 2012. A Chinese ADIZ in the north
of the South China Sea would be particularly sensitive, especially if
it overlapped with Vietnam’s ADIZ and included the disputed
Paracel
Islands.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000531" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0003.htm#14011662000531">Of<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T16:34:13"></hs_TimeCode>

the Sino-Japanese wars and the occupation of Manchuria, the
relationships in the region are deep, complex and historically
multilayered. The China-Japan relationship is at the very core of this
inextricable enmeshing of old rivalries, wars, antagonism and
competition. Memories of Japan’s early 20th century
empire-building are still raw within the region—thus the Chinese
reaction to Prime Minister Abe’s recent visit to the Yasukuni
shrine. China’s past empire, too, is surely heavy and emotive
historical baggage for today’s Chinese leaders to carry as they
contemplate the future regional
hierarchy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000534" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0003.htm#14011662000534">Beijing
has argued that its latest move is no more than legitimate defence.
However, the Chinese concept of defence is notoriously broad.
Officially, all Chinese security policies and uses of force since 1949
have been defensive, this being the most recent case of
China defending Chinese territory. However, in recent years in
particular, Beijing has seemed unwilling to recognise that, in the eyes
of its neighbours, Chinese defence might appear indistinguishable from
Chinese
aggression.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000535" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0003.htm#14011662000535">It
is, of course, the law of unintended consequences that we fear: stoking
simmering tensions and raising the temperature for short-term political

necessarily individually wants to start a shooting war, but because
accidents happen.</hs_para>

a time when the security balance of the region is changing. The present
poor state of relations between Japan and China is certainly a catalyst
for that change, if not a cause. In the face of sharp criticism from
China, Japan is increasingly moving away from its post-war pacifist
stance. Last month, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe approved a new five-year
defence spending plan that calls for the acquisition of drones, jet
fighters, destroyers and amphibious assault vehicles to bolster the
nation’s armed forces. Prime Minister Abe described the spending
plan as “proactive pacifism”, but—significantly,
given Japan’s traditionally pacifist public—with a
substantial measure of popular support, it continues a trend of
reversing a decade of military cuts to counter China’s rapid
military build-up and the relative decline of American influence.

security, under the new draft strategy, Japan

of the new spending will go towards strengthening Japan’s
ability to monitor and defend the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands among others,
and will include more early-warning aircraft stationed in Okinawa and
the purchase of unarmed surveillance drones. China’s efforts to
pursue a more proactive diplomacy with its neighbours, in quiet
rejection of Deng Xiaoping’s famous low-key approach to foreign
affairs, saw Beijing hold a major conference on peripheral diplomacy
last September. Ironically, it was at this conference, intended to
demonstrate the leadership’s wish to promote a stable regional
environment for China’s future development, that final approval
was reportedly given to the long-held objective of establishing the
East China Sea ADIZ and reinforcing China’s claim to disputed

Japan.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000540" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0003.htm#14011662000540">It

We can and should use our very effective diplomacy and soft power to
act as an influence multiplier in support of stability and to help to

encompass a workable code of conduct to avoid a new

remarks today would not be complete without some thoughts on where this

economic and political power and influence to Asia. It seems to me that
the tectonic plates of geopolitics are shifting and that the
rearrangement of the post-war settlement in the wider Pacific Rim
ultimately lies ahead of us. As we know, China is rapidly and
profoundly changing. China’s rise inevitably challenges the

issue of the Chinese ADIZ, while pressing, is a jigsaw puzzle piece in
a much bigger picture. With China’s rise, the dynamics of the
region are changing, and it remains to be seen who will win and who
will lose in this global shift of power and influence in the
Asia-Pacific region. Will we see a change from a US-led regional
security system to a Chinese-led one, and who will decide? The extent

its region China remains a solitary rising power, facing potentially
insurmountable domestic challenges and currently encircled by US
military bases and allies. There is still a major risk of mutual
misunderstanding, miscalculation and strategic non-comprehension

should be to help diffuse that trust deficit when we can. I look
forward to hearing the Minister’s thoughts on whether she

Falkner of Margravine (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate my
noble friend Lord Moynihan on securing this debate. I am afraid that he
pipped me to the post, as I very much wanted to initiate a debate on
the same subject. My noble friend said a great deal in his brief speech
and I will not repeat many of the points. However, there are two or
three that I want to emphasise.</hs_para>

remember the centenary of the Great War it is important to reflect that
it is issues that are unforeseen that have the ability to impact on our
own preoccupations and interests, however far off they may seem. My
noble friend has laid out the background and history of the current
stand-off, but there are two or three things I want to draw out in my
intervention.</hs_para>

by China of an air defence identification zone in the East China Sea is
not of itself remarkable—one should acknowledge that several of
the neighbouring countries in the region have one—what is
notable is China’s timing and the content and nature of its
announcement. Japan’s own air defence identification zone was
announced well ahead of implementation and as part of a transparent
process with consultation. China did so without any of those criteria
in place beforehand. Moreover, requiring aircraft whose destination is
not Chinese territory to comply with its requirements is out of the
ordinary. It is provocative in that it covers territory that is
internationally recognised as being controlled by a foreign
power—in this case,
Japan.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000548" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0003.htm#14011662000548">One of
the things we are learning about the new and rising China is that the
art of diplomacy is not its forte on this matter. Let us hope that
rational geostrategic calculation is. I read with interest the Foreign
Secretary’s response to these heightened tensions between China
and Japan over the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands in the other place only a few
weeks ago. His view was that the UK saw it as a regional issue to be
resolved regionally. While the UK itself may not wish to comment on the
dispute publicly, it undoubtedly has a stake in what happens there.
China is a United Nations permanent five member. Another of our fellow
P5 members and a United Kingdom ally—the United
States—has a security treaty with Japan, among other east Asian
countries. A rising of tensions between China and Japan cannot affect
us as mere bystanders, and I know will be a subject of great concern in
government and
beyond<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T16:45:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000549" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0003.htm#14011662000549">In
assessing the provocations and counterprovocations that have taken
place between China and its neighbours recently, one has to note a
fundamental difference. Japan is a democracy. As such, it cannot
control all the actions of its citizens in a way that China can and
does. China appears to have been prompted to set up the air defence
identification zone in this manner as a retaliatory step aimed at the
2012 decision by the Japanese Government to buy three Senkaku/Diaoyu
islands from their private owner. Japan, faced with a situation where a
right-wing nationalist, Mr Ishihara, the former mayor of Tokyo, was
threatening to purchase the islands, chose to take greater control over
events by buying them for the state. A reasonable interpretation one
can put on this action by the state was that it was acting to prevent
escalation of the situation by a nationalist, but nevertheless elected,
politician<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T16:49:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000550" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0003.htm#14011662000550">This
is not to say that the Japanese Government themselves do not provoke.
Visits by the Prime Minister to the Yasukuni shrine last month,
particularly, it seems, calculated to insult China and South Korea, was
misjudged, as the noble Lord said. However much we may wish that the
Japanese Government did not set out to be insensitive, ultimately we
have to accept that it is for the people of Japan to pass judgment on
their leaders’ decisions—a luxury not afforded to Chinese
citizens. Thus it is somewhat easier to comprehend Japanese actions
than it is
Chinese.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000551" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0003.htm#14011662000551">Turning<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T16:47:03"></hs_TimeCode>
to the implications of the air defence identification zone, I have to
agree with RUSI’s assessment that China’s motives there
are probably to establish a quasi legal basis for boosting its
sovereignty claims to 
<?notus-xml column=437?>the Senkaku. Changing the facts on the ground, as the Israelis famously
demonstrate, or, in this case, the “lines on the map”, to
underpin its long-term claims, can result in success. However, if China
sought to test the US “Pacific pivot”, then the immediate
deployment of B-52 bombers to fly through the ADIZ must have answered
its
question.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000552" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0003.htm#14011662000552">Another
long-term effect of this sudden expansion of Chinese power is the
change in Japan’s calculations in its own geostrategic
imperatives. One cannot see it as accidental that Japan announced its
first ever national security strategy just weeks after the declaration
by China of its ADIZ in the East China Sea. The strategy, with its
stated aim to make a more “proactive contribution to
peace”, refers generally to more complex and grave national
security challenges that Japan faces, but also comments specifically on
China’s attempts to change the status quo through coercion. So
we will have a five-year military build-up on Japan’s part. More
destroyers, more submarines and more F-15s might all be seen as a
positive contribution to its security and may, indeed, be welcome in
Washington, facing its own budget cuts, as one American ally starts
shouldering a greater part of its defence burden, but it surely should
not be seen as comfortable in China. An arms race is seldom an end in
itself, as history has taught
us.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000553" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0003.htm#14011662000553">Some noble
Lords might have seen “Newsnight” a few days ago on the
vexed issue of these islands. We had the spectacle of Jeremy Paxman
interviewing the Japanese ambassador for a few minutes, then walking
eight whole steps across the studio floor to sit in another chair and
interview the Chinese ambassador about the same issue. The questions
overlapped. Why blame one another? Why not go to international
arbitration over the islands? Why not solve it multilaterally? Are you
trying to solve it bilaterally? The question we viewers were asking
each other was: if two senior diplomats could not even sit in the same
group of chairs in a television studio, how on earth can any sensible
solution be found to this
matter?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000554" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0003.htm#14011662000554">The
United Kingdom is often criticised over its dispute in the Falkland
Islands, particularly as it is a United Nations Security Council
member. However, the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands dispute is not analogous.
We may hold a referendum but there are no people to vote on these
uninhabited bits of rock. It is, therefore, sad to see that China,
while rightfully wanting us to respect its proud imperial past, its
ancient culture and its breathtaking advancement now, cannot submit, as
a great power, to international arbitration so that a resolution to its
disputes with its neighbours might be found. One can only hope that it
will be able to do so in time. Meanwhile we must all hope that
restraint will be the path that both China and her neighbours will

Wilson of Tillyorn (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, it is very useful that
the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, has drawn attention to this issue,
including all the complexities that lie behind it and all the dangers
that may lie ahead. In a timed debate in your Lordships’ House,
it is rather strange to find oneself allocated a longish period of time
in which to speak and, with permission, I hope not to use all that
time. Perhaps I may use this 
<?notus-xml column=438?>issue to draw out some rather broader lessons. The noble Lord, Lord
Moynihan, referred to all the disputes that have occurred over many
years in the East China Sea and the South China Sea, particularly the
latter with, for years, Chinese maps drawing a line right round the
outer edges of the South China Sea, so creating disputed territory with
Vietnam, with the Philippines, with Malaysia and in a very small way
with
Burma<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T16:51:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that long period of dispute is that, despite clashes and indeed some
loss of life, there have been no major conflicts. Many years ago, noble
Lords may remember that there was a very acute dispute over two islands
just off the coast of mainland China: Quemoy or Kinmen and Matsu. They
may also remember that, for some 20 years after the crisis had passed,
there was a tacit agreement between the two sides that shells, most of
which contained propaganda leaflets, would be fired only on odd days of
the week, and on even days of the week no shells would be fired and
they could carry out their agricultural
activities<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T16:52:42"></hs_TimeCode>. The
key to that was that it was a play, a Peking opera, in which everyone
knew the script, and that avoided the danger.</hs_para>

more recently we have had the phenomenon of China’s growing
military and naval power. I suggest that some of that is going in a
helpful direction. I cite the Chinese involvement in the Gulf of Aden,
which is a very interesting development in the anti-piracy campaigns
off the coast of Somaliland, or China’s involvement with the
United Nations peacekeeping operations, or humanitarian assistance. All
of that has been very valuable. However, it is difficult to try to
incorporate that into the existing world
order.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000558" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0003.htm#14011662000558">It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T15:53:26"></hs_TimeCode>
is very clear, as mentioned by both noble Lords who have spoken, that
China is now a very rapidly growing economic power—indeed, far
more rapidly growing economically than militarily. As the noble Lord,
Lord Moynihan, said, a shifting of the tectonic plates is going on and
there is nothing more dangerous in history than a shifting of the
plates, when an unsatisfied power or a power that feels that is has
lost out over the past hundred years reasserts itself and comes into
conflict with the then existing world order. Many of the arrangements
in the existing world order, of course, pre-date the time when China
re-emerged onto the international stage. It was a time when China was
inward looking. It may be that we need to be aware of this, and
sometimes make adjustments in these international arrangements, to
incorporate the present power of China and encourage it to play a major
but, if possible, benevolent role in world affairs. That may require a
hard
effort<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T16:54:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Matsu, and the almost “Peking opera” arrangement whereby
you fired on one day but not the next. The danger is that now people
will not necessarily know the script. They did then, but if they do not
know it now, the dangers are very great. It is therefore important for
us to build up the interrelationships we have with China in strategic
and military affairs, both diplomatically and between armed forces. Of
course, it is the Americans who will play the major part in that, but
we, too, can play a role, and I hope we will hear from the Minister
that we are 
<?notus-xml column=439?>playing a role in that area, which will be an important element in how

cannot pretend that we are major players. The United States is the
major player and will go on being the major player. Equally, we cannot
shut our eyes to what is happening and to the potential dangers. What
we can do—again, I hope that the Minister can confirm what we
are doing—is build up our connections with China. I am thinking
not just of commercial connections but of the way in which young people
go for education from China to here—and, equally, from here to
China. Thus can long-term relationships be built. I am also thinking of
the building up of things such as the Chinese legal system, which that

to hear from the Minister what conversations took place during that

problem. Not only are there disputes in the East and South China Seas
but there is a territorial claim involving Arunachal Pradesh in

our closest relationships in the Far East in all sorts of ways.
However, I do not think that Japan has necessarily been completely
correct in the way it has sometimes dealt with this. The purchase of
the islands, which in some ways may have provoked this dispute, was
perhaps not done in the best way that it could have been. There was
surely going to be some sort of Chinese reaction. Japan has altered its

the Chinese people, with all the atrocities that happened at that time.

towards encirclement. This is clearly something it sees as a problem in
relation to its own national security. Of course, we would look at that

not meet any officials who say anything that has not been agreed

Triesman (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I join others in thanking the
noble Lord, Lord Moynihan. Before I say anything else, I want to say
how much I appreciated the overview provided by the noble Lord, Lord
Wilson of Tillyorn, which was obviously drawn from huge experience.
When we talk about China and this region, it is important to get a
sense of the breadth of history, and I appreciated
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T17:05:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000572" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0003.htm#14011662000572">This
is a helpful opportunity to debate what may be a very significant issue
for regional and world stability in the area or what may be slightly
less harmful than that—unhelpful posturing on the part of a
number of regional players. What it certainly does do is raise the
question of how these matters are being played out, as the Asian
century kicks off, and the importance of the United States in trying to
deal with those strategic
changes<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T17:06:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000573" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0003.htm#14011662000573">Any
review of the maps—and I have tried—shows the complexity
of the overlapping air defence identification zones around Japan and in
the East China Sea. China, as we have acknowledged, is in no sense the
first. Half of the area of China’s new zone overlaps with the
Japanese zone in the East China Sea, and that zone was introduced
shortly after World War II during the United States occupation. It
overlaps to a smaller extent with the South Korean and Taiwanese zones.
The South Korean zone was created as long ago as 1951. All of the zones
impose some requirements, although it is plain that the Chinese
initiative goes far wider than the requirements that are seen in other
zones<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T17:06:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000574" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0003.htm#14011662000574">Since
1950, there has been, as the Chinese Government are reasonable in
pointing out, a joint United States and Canadian zone, but it is also
true that the United States does not apply its procedures to any
foreign aircraft that have no intention of entering its airspace. That
is a big difference, and the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, was quite
right to remind us of that and of the absence of
consultation<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T17:07:22"></hs_TimeCode>.
The United States on this basis does not accept the right of any
coastal nation to apply ADIZ procedures to any foreign aircraft not
intending to enter that airspace, and nor do
we<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T17:07:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000575" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0003.htm#14011662000575">There
is an overlap and there are competing zones with different procedures.
That would be confusing and risky enough, but the issue is made much
more confusing by the fact that some others, including Russia and
China, do not recognise the Japanese zone at all. Historically, the
Japanese have unilaterally on occasions increased their zone.</hs_para>

the volume of commercial airline flights and multiple routes—a
factor that accompanies the growth of the economies in the
region—the confusion and risk are considerably multiplied by any
attempt to act on the zone procedures rather than, as I suspect may be
the case, to use them as popular and populist rhetoric. Of course, the
problem with populist rhetoric 
<?notus-xml column=442?>is precisely that it is popular. Consequently, each movement of aircraft
or ships, in particular of military vehicles, ignites a popular demand
for action to see off those insulting national prestige.</hs_para>

is a climate in which the protagonists tend to test one
another’s resolve. As soon as China announced its air defence
zone in November, the United States, as we know, sent military assets
through the zone. Chinese fighter jets shadowed the military aircraft
and vessels shadowed vessels patrolling in the disputed waters.
Japan’s leading newspaper reported that the Chinese intention is
to expand their zone further until it gets more or less to the Japanese
shore<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T17:09:11"></hs_TimeCode>. There are
close passes of shipping and there are fighters shadowing other
fighters and
bombers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000578" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0003.htm#14011662000578">My
difficulty in understanding what these regional neighbours see as the
advantage in the increasingly bellicose language is that, if it is
essentially rhetoric, all it does is destabilise the region without any
obvious sensible purpose. Still less easy is it to understand the
benefit of close brushes of a military kind, and there is no
conceivable benefit in threatening to interfere with normal air
traffic.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000579" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0003.htm#14011662000579">I
take some marginal comfort from the fact that those threatening each
other tend to be very disciplined nations with highly disciplined
forces. They are probably not too liable to have accidents, but the
issue must still be important enough for the international institutions
to try to lower the temperature. Efforts in this direction are very
important. There is too much at risk in destabilising the whole of
Asia, which is otherwise stable in many respects. The region is
productive and is overcoming poverty in many countries, aside from
under the barbaric regime in North Korea. However, there are a number
of instabilities at a top level. India and China are not in the most
productive phase of their relationship and, as has been mentioned, the
same is true of Japan and
China.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000580" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0003.htm#14011662000580">Those
are dangers where I think we could have an
impact<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T17:10:35"></hs_TimeCode>. I
venture to suggest cautiously that there may be things we could do to
help, even if the United Kingdom’s influence is, in a general
sense, relatively small. First, all the nations in the region need to
moderate their language. I was looking at some of the language of the
Japanese defence Minister, Onodera, which is not conducive to the
likelihood of people talking to each other in more moderate terms. They
also need to start to ratchet down the nationalistic, somewhat
paranoid, descriptions of what is happening, which have a big impact on
populations. All parties are showing renewed nationalism and there is a
very strong case for seeing whether we, who have considerable
experience in this area, might be able to assist in developing a
hotline which would allow those who may come into conflict in those
areas—particularly at sea—to deal with it. I can say at
first hand that we took up this issue, as a nation, in the upper
Persian Gulf. In a sense, that is obvious and mechanical, but it is
entirely
practical<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T17:11:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000581" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0003.htm#14011662000581">Secondly,
would it not be sensible if the critique of China, which is very clear
and has been expressed by most nations in the region, were thought
through in a little more detail? It is as if China were completely
unique. The Chinese may have gone further on declared 
<?notus-xml column=443?>procedures, but they are entitled to ask why they are the only people
with zones of this kind about which any questions are asked at all. We
should ask whether that is likely to be productive. The noble Lord,
Lord Moynihan is quite right to emphasise the differences this time,
but there are wider histories and wider issues in which we might have a
moderating
effect<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T17:12:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14011662000582" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0003.htm#14011662000582">Thirdly, all nations in
the region must think more deeply about the offence caused by some of
their leaders, particularly the genuinely distressing actions of the
Japanese Prime Minister. It is distressing to see any Prime Minister
visiting, honouring and sharing the history of notorious war criminals
who perpetrated terrible crimes against the Chinese people. Were there
to be an equivalent event in Europe, there would be an outcry. It would
not be
tolerated<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T17:13:11"></hs_TimeCode>. The
noble Lord, Lord Teverson, is 100% correct that it is right to raise
this issue with friends in Japan, precisely because they are friends. I
will put down for the record that, before he left, my noble friend Lord
West told me that the Sixth Fleet has in fact vanished but only because
it is now the Seventh
Fleet<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T17:13:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000583" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0003.htm#14011662000583">Fourthly,
we all know that this crisis and chronic dispute about a group of
islands claimed by at least three nations needs to be dealt with. These
uninhabited, uninhabitable rocks, known by different names in each of
the three countries, are the prizes in this dispute. Perhaps this is
because everybody understands they may anchor rights to gas, oil and
fishery resources. China’s interest has plainly been awakened by
the possibility of these assets coming into
play<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T17:14:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

couple of our universities—this may be of particular interest to
the noble Lord, Lord Wilson, because I am going to talk about
Cambridge—specialise in the legal analysis of and
recommendations for borders and lines of demarcation. They have a
remarkable history. I first saw this work at first hand in difficult
circumstances in Africa, and I acknowledge that not all of the issues
that were raised have yet been concluded, but we and, for that matter,
Cambridge University have no interest in sovereignty issues and we have
no axes to grind in the area. There is therefore a real possibility of
soft diplomacy being employed in that kind of
circumstance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011662000586" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-0003.htm#14011662000586">I
think that we could offer to get into exercises which, while of course
they would not lead to commitments to the United Nations on the part of
those countries in accepting the results, could result in tensions
being reduced when efforts were made. The breathing space is almost
always welcomed at the United Nations because it allows for the
exploration of many alternatives, and studies are usually valuable and
instructive for whatever the final outcomes may be. I believe that that
is a useful sort of soft power. It does give rise to diffusion, and
even were it to be rejected, it would be seen as a sincere and serious
offer in the

is home to the world’s second and third largest
economies—China and Japan. In 2012, together they accounted for
20% of global GDP and their economies are heavily dependent on each
other, with around 20% of Japan’s imports coming from China,
while Japan is China’s biggest source of foreign investment. As
my noble friend Lord Moynihan rightly pointed out, there are numerous
opportunities for the UK in the region. The UK is therefore committed
to supporting the continued economic growth of the region and promoting
the regional security and stability which underlie that. This was
illustrated by my right honourable friend the Prime Minister leading
the largest ever delegation to China last month, which followed a

develop its military capabilities. We welcome Chinese maritime
activities such as its involvement with counterpiracy in the Horn of
Africa and its growing role in international peacekeeping. We encourage

others in the region have concerns about an increasingly self-confident
China which they see as using its vast economic power and other forms
of leverage to gain the upper hand in territorial disputes. We have
seen this recently by the regional reaction to China’s
establishment in November of the air defence identification zone over
the East China Sea, the subject of today’s debate. I shall
comment now on that specific issue. My noble friend Lord Moynihan asked
about the UK’s view on the ADIZ. While the UK does not take a
position on underlying sovereignty issues, we have a clear interest in
maintaining the freedom of navigation and overflight. The legitimate
use of airspace is essential for security, stability and prosperity.
Actions that bring, or appear to bring, these rights into question are
not conducive to finding lasting solutions to the differences that
exist in east Asia. The UK therefore fully supports the EU statement,
which notes with concern China’s establishment of an East China
Sea air defence identification zone. It heightens tension in the region
and raises the risk of escalation.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T17:20:35"></hs_TimeCode> have
encouraged and will continue to encourage China and its neighbours to
pursue through diplomatic means regional policies that ensure
stability, diffuse tensions and resolve the dispute constructively

maritime issues and those relating to disaster relief. The EU hosted a

Eaton (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, Bradford is a unique and

chosen to speak today is an indication that I am not the only Member of
this House with a passionate interest in this metropolitan district. I

today<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T13:00:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000003">The
view of Bradford from those who do not know it first hand is coloured
by a range of clichés and negative media stereotypes, many of
which are anachronistic and often caricatured. However, of course the
true picture of Bradford is more complex, more nuanced and certainly
more positive than these stereotypes would have you
believe<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T13:00:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

fourth largest metropolitan district in England after Birmingham, Leeds
and Sheffield. It is home to half a million people, a place
characterised by diversity, huge contrasts in geography, wealth and
built environment, communities of many cultures and ethnicities, and a
place which typifies the complex range of socioeconomic, environmental
and political problems and opportunities, which is the stuff of
contemporary public
policy<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T13:01:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

visitors and is perhaps unique among metropolitan districts is that
two-thirds of the district is rural. The city of Bradford’s
urban and cosmopolitan qualities contrast with, and complement those
of, a number of vibrant towns and a host of Pennine villages.
Furthermore, this diverse human settlement is set within a spectacular
Yorkshire landscape of upland moors, wooded valleys and productive
farmland. This multifaceted environment provides the public bodies
within the district with distinct and complex planning and delivery
challenges when attempting to balance the conflicting needs and
interests of the economy, the environment and communities.</hs_para>

is 12 years since the inner-city riots with which we are often still
associated. In that time, our local economy has waxed and waned in line
with national economic cycles, although underlying and positive
structural changes have begun to take root. It is also noteworthy that
during this period community relations have been mostly good and have
improved, despite a dynamic picture of inward migration. The presence
of many other, smaller communities and the growth of mixed ethnicity is
resulting in one of the most diverse and cosmopolitan communities
outside
London<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T13:02:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

of the few places where relations between different faith communities
are such that the Council of Mosques has provided financial support to
the Jewish community to enable it to complete major repairs to the
synagogue. The development of good community relations is supported and
enhanced by groups such as the charity Near Neighbours—I declare
my interest as chairman—which works at grass-roots level,
encouraging people from different ethnic groups to share in community
activity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000008">Bradford’s
population is now 524,600, and its growth is forecast to continue,
reaching 640,000 by 2033. However, along with this dynamic population
change, the district has significant economic inequalities. Eleven per
cent of the population is in the most affluent decile and 40% is in the
least affluent decile of the United
Kingdom.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000009">Bradford
is a big economy, creating £8.3 billion of added value to the
UK, forming the eighth largest economy in England and amounting to a
fifth of West Yorkshire’s businesses and output. It has
strengths across a range of sectors. The council and its business
partners have agreed to promote it as “The Producer
City”, providing a distinctive economic identity for Bradford
based on real strengths in key industries and businesses across the
district’s
economy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000010">Bradford
has a low-wage, low-skills economy, and over the next 10 years the
working-age population of the district is projected to rise by 2,000
people per year. This population growth is driving a real need for jobs
growth. To maintain current employment rates of 64.9%, an additional
10,000 people will have to find employment by 2021. Improving education
and skills levels is essential to future
prosperity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000011">The
council is working with a range of business partners on the Get
Bradford Working programme, investing in apprenticeships, skills
development and the creation of industrial centres of excellence, all
of which are paying dividends. We are seeing major companies now
repaying this growing confidence by investing in major
developments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000012">The
Government are currently consulting on a West Yorkshire combined
authority, which Bradford wishes to see progress. Work has now begun on
the long-awaited £260 million Westfield shopping centre, and
with the formation of the new private sector-led Producer City board
there is increasing momentum for a significant upturn in the economy.
Government support for Bradford’s economic ambition, and the
work of the new Producer City board with the Leeds city region LEP,
will be crucial. I therefore urge the Minister to extend
Bradford’s city centre growth zone from December 2014 to March
2017. I also urge her to commit to a meeting with the Producer City
board this year to explore what further support the Government might be
able to offer Bradford’s economy, in particular the development
of its engineering
capacity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000013">Given
the significant population growth in the Bradford district and the
clear potential for significant economic growth, it is both surprising
and disappointing that the key rail route through Bradford has not been
included in the Government’s provisional plans for
electrification between 2014 and 2019. Electrifying this route, which
links Bradford with Leeds and 
<?notus-xml column=179?>Manchester and also provides a major commuter link with the towns along
the Calder valley, would have a range of benefits for the wider region
as well as for Bradford. These would include unlocking economic
potential, reducing congestion on the M62 motorway and decongesting
other major routes, and would also make a major contribution to carbon
reduction. This line connects 2.5 million residents to Leeds, Bradford
and Manchester, three of the UK’s largest
cities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000014">Education
standards in Bradford have historically been low, and this has held the
district back economically. However, over the past decade and recently
in particular, improvements in attainment have accelerated. The
excellent partnership approach which includes community and faith
schools, academies and free schools working together and challenging
each other, has been praised and recognised by Sir Michael Wilshaw,
head of
Ofsted.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000015">A
considerable number of Roma families move to and settle in the Bradford
district. Over 6,800 Slovakians and Czech Roma have established
themselves in the district since 2000. Many of the migrants come to the
district with low levels of educational attainment and little
experience in the formal employment sector, along with huge health
issues and large families. They therefore require extensive support to
integrate. Levels of turbulence in these communities, due to
instability of employment, have an impact on schools and other
services. A national Roma integration strategy would enable the
Government to influence the policy towards Roma in their countries of
origin, as well as their integration in places such as Bradford. I urge
the Minister to consider working with Bradford to develop an effective
Roma integration
strategy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000016">I
hope the Minister will appreciate from the contributions she will hear
today that there is a commitment from people and organisations in
Bradford to use every opportunity to address the challenges facing them
in a positive way. The requests I have made of Her Majesty’s
Government would provide a very welcome helping

Patel of Bradford (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I begin by
congratulating the noble Baroness, Lady Eaton, on providing the
opportunity for us to focus our attention on the city of Bradford. It
is very fitting that she has tabled this debate given her tireless
years of service to Bradford, as a local councillor and then as leader
of that council for a number of years. I also look forward to the
maiden speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of

place. I came to live in the city at the age of one when my parents
migrated to the UK from east Africa, so I have grown up in Bradford, I
went to school there, and I have worked for most of my professional
life there. Most importantly, I have life-long friends in Bradford and
am proud to call it home. The city has had its ups and downs. To be
brutally honest, the past few decades have not been kind to this once
hugely prosperous city. It should be remembered that we were once the
wool capital of the world: no more. The decline in that industry,
however, is only part of the story.</hs_para>

Lady Eaton, said, we have also suffered from negative media
stereotypes. The burning of Salman Rushdie’s book in the late
1980s still haunts us. Racial tensions, which resulted in two major
disturbances, led Bradford to being described as a city of segregated
ethnic communities living “parallel lives”. No, these and
other such stories have not helped us. However, we have worked hard to
rise above this negativity, not only as a major and growing centre for
manufacturing, with over 25,000 employees in that sector, but as a
tourist destination. Besides the fact that we are blessed with
beautiful and rugged rural areas, we became the first UNESCO City of
Film with attractions such as the National Media Museum, Bradford City
Park, the Alhambra Theatre and Cartwright Hall. Without doubt, Bradford
also deserves the title of curry capital of the UK. Most recently, all
our diverse communities came together, in a show of solidarity and
cohesion, to give the English Defence League its marching orders when
it had planned another of its disruptive marches in our city. That
shows how far we have come.</hs_para>

so much. The economic climate over the past few decades has hit us
hard, especially these past three or four years, by bringing us some of
the most severe cuts to local authority spending and severely impacting
our growth and redevelopment. High unemployment continues to be a
persistent issue, especially for the growing population of young people
who have also suffered from what were low, but are now thankfully
improving, levels of educational attainment. We continue to have some
of the most deprived areas in the country, with high rates of child
poverty and infant mortality, and not surprisingly the gap between rich
and poor is even greater. All these issues, coupled with the rise in
fuel poverty and the number of food banks and stubbornly high levels of
poor physical and mental health, pose many challenges for the
city’s already stretched public
services.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000022">This
is where the social capital of local people has been, and continues to
be, key in tackling many of these issues. Many local people are already
active in addressing these challenges. In fact, more than 20% of
Bradford’s residents are engaged in volunteering, community
groups or civic roles. Much of this crucial work is channelled through
committed and hard-working voluntary sector services. I am proud to be
patron of a number of these: for example, the Bradford Court Chaplaincy
Service, the first multi-faith volunteer court service in the country;
the Bridge project, which works with those misusing substances; Sharing
Voices, a multi-ethnic mental health and well-being service; the Equity
Partnership, which works with LGBT communities across the Yorkshire
region; and Bradford Cyrenians, which for 40 years has been delivering
services to homeless people. But they and others like them are
struggling to keep delivering these invaluable
services.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000023">We
all know that it is the small local agency, often supported by
volunteers, which gives back to the local economy by creating jobs and
providing local solutions to help those who are the most vulnerable
find support while maintaining their independence. The local authority
in Bradford has, to its credit, been innovative and creative with its
support for these independent sector providers, but innovation and
creativity can only go so 
<?notus-xml column=181?>far when you have had your budget cut ruthlessly and disproportionately.
In view of the Government’s desire to promote localism and the
concept of the big society, what further support are the Minister and
the Government able to give to the city of Bradford to keep our crucial
voluntary sector services delivering, developing and going?</hs_para>

have been firms of solicitors in Bradford—of national

there were five building societies based in what is now the

debate is about opportunities and constraints. One opportunity which is
coming is HS2. Would you believe that it terminates in Leeds? One leg
goes to Manchester and the north-west, one leg to Leeds. Compare and
contrast: the Manchester terminus is to be parallel to Manchester
Piccadilly station, and there is a spur which will enable trains to get
to Manchester Airport, Liverpool, Runcorn, Warrington, Preston, et
cetera. On the Yorkshire side we are to have a hammerhead terminal in
Leeds that will not connect with Leeds City station. It will mean
legging it somewhere between a quarter-mile and a half-mile from the
London train. I do not believe that this is good for Bradford, and
neither is it good for the rest of West Yorkshire, whether it is
Halifax, Huddersfield, Keighley, Skipton, Harrogate or Wakefield. There
is a danger, if it goes ahead, that the railway system will be
ossified, so that there can never be through routes. This is important:
it would mean an incredible constraint on connectivity in West
Yorkshire, and it is something that government can do something
about.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_16_PT_1/921277519F0892BF2E663EB17D432E997EB1EE3E" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 16 January 2014">Thursday,

the last census, 84% of people in Bradford considered their level of
well-being to be good or very good. That is 3% ahead of the national
average, which is not surprising—Bradford is in
“God’s own county” of Yorkshire. The statistics
show the resilience of the people of Bradford. Bradford does not need
pity, it needs positive commitment. Bradford is often spoken about from
a distance, or as an illustration of certain national problems. The
church, however, has a different perspective, an insider perspective.
In 2005 the churches in Bradford set up an organisation called Bradford
Churches for Dialogue and Diversity, to help bring together the
different communities to learn from and share with each other. The
government-funded Near Neighbours programme has provided small grants
to many local projects. One of these brought together Muslims,
Christians and Jews in a Muslim majority neighbourhood to share meals.
This led to the Muslim community helping a local synagogue raise funds
to repair a leaking roof. This is about restoring not just the fabric
of a building but the fabric of a neighbourhood, of civil
society.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000031">Bradford<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T13:19:13"></hs_TimeCode>

contains some of the finest and most compelling visual material to be
found anywhere in the world, such as the oldest known surviving
negative, John Logie Baird’s original television apparatus and
the camera that made the earliest moving pictures in Britain. The
museum is the reason why Bradford received City of Film status from
UNESCO. According to Bradford Council, it has an economic impact of
£24 million a year, and it does particularly well in attracting

all this, in the summer of 2013 there was real doubt about the future

aid to all the national museums, the Science Museum Group was asked by
the DCMS to model further cuts of 5%, 10% and 15% for the 2015-16
spending review. The director of the Science Museum made it clear that
if the cuts were at either of the two higher levels, one of the museums
in the north of England—Bradford, the National Railway Museum in
York or the Manchester Museum of Science and Industry—would have
to close. Most media comment centred on Bradford as the most likely
candidate.</hs_para>

reaction was immense. There was a public rally at the museum on 8 June
and a public meeting at Bradford’s city hall on 11 June, chaired
by the leader of the council. At the media museum’s 30th
birthday celebrations over the following weekend, 1,000 visitors
expressed their support, many with birthday cards. There was an
Adjournment debate in the Commons and a Select Committee inquiry. On 26
June came the welcome news that the cut would not be 10% or 15% but 5%.

stay open.</hs_para>

to Bradford. Provided that more support is forthcoming from bodies such
as the city council, the University of Bradford, Bradford College,

Scott of Needham Market (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, the Committee may
be wondering why a woman from deepest Suffolk is speaking in a debate
on Bradford. The answer lies in the genes: my father was a Bradford man
and, thanks to the wonderful work of the West Yorkshire Archive
Service, I know that generations of my ancestors, going back over 300
years, came from the area around Bradford, Leeds, Halifax and
Huddersfield. These towns were part of the backbone of the industrial
revolution, and in the case of my ancestors it was the textile industry
that occupied them. In my ancestry are wool combers, sorters, cloth
dressers, weavers, dyers, spinners, carders, warp dressers and weft
men, and this continued right up to the death of my uncle in the early
1970s. During the 1940s and 1950s, these jobs were done increasingly by
immigrants from the Indian subcontinent who were prepared to tolerate
the low wages and poor conditions in the industry. By the 1970s and
1980, instead of the people coming to the jobs, the jobs went to the
people—most of the textile and garment industry moved to the Far
East, where labour was
cheap<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T13:35:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000054">I
mention that because there is growing evidence that we should be
rethinking all this. The textile industry can now be almost totally
automated; fewer people are required, and those who are required are
highly skilled. Every process, from design to manufacture and
packaging, can be computerised and automated. Digital connections mean
that small start-up businesses can almost instantly be connected to
markets, research and suppliers from right across the
globe<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T13:35:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000055">The
competitive advantage of cheap labour does not necessarily exist
anymore. If noble Lords are not convinced, I can point to Apple and
General Electric, both of which are bringing their manufacturing
capability back to the United States. Reshoring, the opposite of
offshoring, is a growing reality, and I can point noble Lords to the
recent work by our colleague, the noble Lord, Lord Giddens. In the
textile industry, Jaeger has restarted UK production, having ceased in
2000. The fact is that wages in Asia have risen while they have
stagnated in Europe and the US. The head of a company manufacturing
household textiles in both  
<?notus-xml column=187?>the UK and China recently commented that it is his UK plant that is more
productive, due to the highly skilled workforce and the fluctuations in

costs are going up all the time, which makes reshoring increasingly
viable. Producing closer to the markets also has the advantage of
shortening order times, giving a flexibility that many big retailers
particularly welcome. Customers and businesses are becoming more aware
of sustainability arguments and the ethical considerations, which were
so graphically highlighted by the terrible loss of life in the garment
factory in Bangladesh. The UK is currently still uncompetitive in cheap
mass-produced markets but has a big advantage in

its importance is being taken seriously. The Government have a role in
promotional activities, helping start-ups and ensuring that capital,

initiative. Even the national media sometimes take note. I was struck
by a story that I read before Christmas, which has also been mentioned
by the noble Baroness and the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of
York, about the town’s last remaining synagogue, a grade II
listed 
<?notus-xml column=188?>building that a year ago was leaking badly and in danger of being sold
off, which would have forced the small congregation to travel the 10
miles to Leeds to worship. Yet, one year on, the Bradford reform
synagogue’s future is looking more secure because of the
intervention of Bradford’s Muslim community. Some of its most
influential members helped the synagogue’s chairman to mount a
successful lottery bid, and that money will now help renovate the
building. Thanks to the relationships formed through their fundraising
effort, the communities now do other things together. Once renovated,
the synagogue plans to open for school visits throughout the
week.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000061">I, too,

the briefings we have received and the contributions made today, we can
be optimistic about the city’s well-being in the future. Under
the strong leadership of Labour’s Councillor David Green,
Bradford has a council that is working towards the vision of a place
that is prosperous, creative, diverse and inclusive, and it is
delivering this by working with partners and citizens. As we have heard

challenges are made more difficult by the draconian and
disproportionate cut in funding it has endured.</hs_para>

one<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T13:44:29"></hs_TimeCode> of the tasks
of government, whatever the overall level of the local government

the two years ending in March 2013, should funding have fallen by over
twice as much in Bradford as the average fall for the 10 least-deprived
authorities? The council has responded to this by operating in new
ways, commissioning services locally from a range of providers,
including local businesses and community and voluntary organisations.
The Joseph Rowntree Foundation report on the Bradford Social Future

funding can make a real difference to engaging local people

their communities and how they want their area to grow and develop.
That is a far more effective way to help local areas thrive than for

the further details of the schemes are currently being worked out. My

those transport matters, the city deal provided a £1 billion
fund to improve public transport, outside of heavy rail and the
highways network. Beyond that there is a further £1 billion for
capital funds via the local enterprise partnership and the local growth

go back to the city deal and the decisions of local leaders as to their
priorities. The other area was education and skills, which are of
course vital not just to give every child the best chance in life to

cornerstone of the city deal is a commitment that every young person in

volunteering or work experience. It is important for me to emphasise
that in response to the comments of the most reverend Primate the
Archbishop of York. The aim is to create 20,000 new opportunities,
which will tackle the problem of young people not in education,
employment or training. The Department for Education is also working
closely with Bradford local authority, schools and the dioceses to
improve school performance. There are now 25 academies open, with
another nine in development, helping to drive improvement in some
schools with the lowest performance. I was also pleased to hear what
the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, said, about the work happening with
the University of Bradford. Much is going on in that area. We must
ensure that Bradford has a highly skilled workforce and that the young

McKenzie, referred to the local government finance settlement. Our
approach to local government finance means change in the way that
central government works with local authorities, freeing them from
dependence on central grants and requiring them to meet centrally
imposed targets, but of course the Government still protect those
councils which are more dependent on government grant. It is worth
noting that Bradford still has a spending power of £2,350 per

the greater demands on services in that

making to improve the delivery of its services and to save money,

authorities. I point to one specific different approach to local
government financing, which I think answers one of the points made by
the most reverend Primate about the desperate need of some families.
That is the troubled families programme. That is one way in which we

Trees (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, in my 45 years as a veterinary
surgeon I have witnessed the abattoir slaughter of many animals with
and without stunning, but when I first witnessed slaughter without
stunning it was profoundly disturbing. The animal staggered from its
killing crate, blood gushing from the neck wound, and it did not
collapse into unconsciousness for some considerable time. It is that
experience and others since that have caused me to bring this

initially to cover the legal framework surrounding the slaughter of
animals—and I am going to concentrate on cattle and sheep. The
legal framework is straightforward. In abattoirs, the death of animals
is due to exsanguination following severance of the major blood vessels
in the neck. It is illegal in the UK and throughout the EU to do that
without first rendering animals insensible by stunning—except
that that requirement for pre-stunning is exempted for those of Muslim
and Jewish faiths to produce either respectively halal meat or kosher
meat by
shechita<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T14:03:38"></hs_TimeCode>. I

a doubt, during my almost twenty years as a vet, I have never witnessed
anything as horrific as Shechita slaughter. That horror lives fresh in
my mind today and having been raised and now living in a Kosher home I
do not and never have eaten a piece of Kosher meat since the day I
witnessed this barbaric practice. Indeed I have seen much suffering and
many severe injuries in the animals I have treated over the years, but
nothing comes close to the unnecessary and brutal suffering that these
animals experience at the very end of their
lives”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="14011665000402" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000402">Note

recognise that both the great faiths in question have serious concerns
for animal welfare. I also make it quite clear that I defend and
respect the freedom of expression of all groups, religious or
non-religious, within reasonable limits acceptable to our society.
Nevertheless, it is my contention that unnecessary suffering is being
caused to a very substantial number of animals by slaughter without
stunning. I want to address this under three headings: inconsistency,
injury and insult.</hs_para>

inconsistency, we rightly pride ourselves here in Britain on our animal
welfare regulations and our humaneness. Recently, it has been made an
offence to dock a puppy dog’s tail. That is something that
involved a snip with a pair of scissors which, on a week-old pup,
evoked at most a slight yelp. We have made that illegal—and I am
happy with that law—yet we allow adult animals to have their
throats cut without rendering them unconscious first. Is that a
consistent approach to humaneness?</hs_para>

tissue injury. The Farm Animal Welfare Council, in its report of 2003,
considered the whole issue of slaughter without stunning in great
detail. Considering the injury to the neck involved in throat-cutting,
the council noted that this involved the incision of skin, muscle,
trachea, oesophagus, both jugular veins, both carotid arteries, major
nerve trunks and several other nerves. It concluded that,</hs_para>

on to refer to evidence of the time taken to lose brain responsiveness
in different species following the neck cut. It noted that in sheep it
was five to 10 seconds; in adult cattle, with excellent technique, it
was a minimum of 22 to 40 seconds; and  
<?notus-xml column=195?>in calves it was 10 to 120 seconds. Twenty seconds is a long time if you
are suffering pain. The FAWC report—and remember that this is
the Government’s independent advisory
committee—recommended in its 2003 report that,</hs_parafo>

this I mean tissue damage and particularly the induction of
pain—I mean a biological insult. Determining the perception of
pain can be very difficult, I acknowledge, but some recent research has
been done on calves in New Zealand which I would argue provides strong
evidence that pain is perceived by a neck cut and that stunning
abrogates that. In this work, electrophysiological measurements were
taken of brain signals, for which there was supportive evidence of
their being associated with pain. A neck cut without pre-stunning
caused pain signals lasting for up to two minutes. Such signals did not
occur when stunning was used before the neck cut. Finally, if the neck
cut was made and then animals were stunned, the pain signals occurring
after the cut were immediately abolished. Every attempt was made in
this work to mimic slaughter without stunning but true shechita could
not be performed because, ironically, the animals had to be gently
anaesthetised to conform to experimental animal laws and thus could not
pass for human consumption, as shechita demands. So I would argue that
it is likely that severe pain is caused by slaughter without stunning,
albeit for a relatively short period, but perhaps for as much as two
minutes in
cattle.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000101">How
many animals are involved in slaughter without stunning? The latest
available survey by the Food Standards Agency, in 2011, indicates that
approximately 70,000 cattle are slaughtered in the UK each year without
stunning, mainly by shechita, and that about 1.5 million sheep are
despatched without stunning, mainly for halal consumption. I should
point out that the majority of sheep that are killed for halal purposes
in the UK are pre-stunned, but that still leaves the significant
minority of 1.5 million that I have referred to. Thus I contend that,
given the nature of the biological insult and the numbers involved,
slaughter without stunning is a major, if not the major animal welfare
issue in the United Kingdom today. A further important fact is that
much of the meat from non-stunned slaughter goes into the food chain
for mainstream consumers. I suggest that consumers can justifiably
expect to be informed if the normal legally required form of humane
slaughter has not been
used.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000102">All the
independent welfare bodies advocate stunning before
slaughter—FAWC, the British Veterinary Association, the
Federation of Veterinarians of Europe, the RSPCA and the Humane
Slaughter Association—and furthermore, the food-quality
assurance schemes such as red tractor and the Soil Association do not
permit non-stun slaughter. In Europe, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland and
Iceland have disallowed non-stun slaughter, and New Zealand does not
permit the non-stun abattoir slaughter of mammals. Significantly, New
Zealand exports large amounts of sheep meat that has been reversibly
stunned and certified as halal to Muslim communities in Asia and the
Middle East.</hs_para>

I sincerely ask the Muslim and Jewish communities and their leaders to
reflect and consider whether ancient practices, for which there were
good reasons many hundreds of years ago, are necessary today. There are
non-lethal, non-invasive methods of stunning, and even if there is
disagreement on the extent or duration of pain perception, is it not
time to adopt stunning to preclude the possibility of unnecessary
suffering—as some Muslim food authorities have

he—if his department does not do so already—will enter
into constructive, friendly dialogues with the Muslim and Jewish
communities to see if there is not some consensus or way of going
forward as outlined by the noble Lord, Lord Trees. I realise that this
may be a particular problem for the Jewish authorities. I must say at
this point how much I commend the Muslim community for having so many
of its animals slaughtered with pre-stunning. That is a great
development and I am happy to pay public tribute to that

given that we may not get complete consensus, will my noble friend look
at the possibility of stunning immediately after the cut is made, which
would obviate some of the suffering? Finally, I take particular
exception that a lot of meat that is not used for the religious
communities comes on to the market without being labelled. If we are to

of the problems with this issue is that there is no central authority
for halal meat. The rules vary around the world, so it cannot be
policed. All New Zealand lamb entering the UK is classified as halal.
It is all pre-stunned before slaughter. There is not a problem. Over my
years as a Minister in MAFF and Defra, and as the FSA chair, I visited
dozens of abattoirs. The FSA is only responsible for the enforcement of
animal welfare regulations as a contractor to Defra, as the Minister
will make clear. It is not a food safety issue.</hs_para>

want to elaborate a bit on the figures given by the noble Lord, Lord
Trees, with a one-week survey from September 2011 which was in an open
board paper of May 2012. Some 43,000 cattle were slaughtered, 1,700
halal, 84% of which were pre-stunned; 307,000 sheep and goats were
slaughtered, 154,000 halal, 81% pre-stunned; and 16 million chickens
were slaughtered, 4.7 million halal, 88% pre-stunned. I have
not got time to give the Jewish figures. So the non-stunned totals for
halal and Jewish that one week were 3% of the cattle, 10% of the sheep
and 4% of the poultry. They are very small numbers of non-stunned
animals. The trouble is that too much of the extra goes into the
general food chain and customers are not aware. The simple
answer to this is labelling. Consumers have the right to know the
method of slaughter, and that should be a given, in my
view<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T14:16:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

case made by the noble Lord, Lord Trees, and the evidence that he
outlined that slaughter by throat-cutting without pre-stunning is
absolutely unacceptable in animal welfare terms. However, like other
speakers, time is short, and therefore the important issue for me today

animals slaughtered in the UK without pre-stunning, as the noble Lord,

Jewish method of slaughter, shechita, requires animals not to be
stunned before slaughter. Recent data collected by the EU Dialrel
project show that 100% of the animals and birds slaughtered by the UK
abattoirs service for the production of kosher meat were slaughtered
without prior stunning. At four establishments, 1,314, or 3%, of cattle
and calves were slaughtered by the Jewish shechita method, with 10% of
these stunned immediately after bleeding. Does that mean they are still
alive after bleeding? These figures were published by the Food
Standards Agency in 2012. The National Animal Welfare Advisory
Committee of New Zealand recommended a dispensation for kosher
slaughter in 2001, but the new code does not allow any exemptions.
Among the countries which have banned shechita are Iceland, Norway and
Sweden. I hope the Jewish community will see the light—that the
animals which give us so much need respect when they have to
die.</hs_para><hs_time UID="14011665000444" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000444">2.21

due to interruption of the blood supply to the brain, which is
immediate and has been measured. The problem with EEG

gassing them. We shoot stags and pheasants. We decapitate rabbits.
Millions of lobsters have their claws bound and are thrown into boiling
water where they thrash for a long time. Chickens and turkeys are swept
through an electrically charged water bath and then are immersed in

religion. I am sure that Rabbi Sacks—the noble Lord, Lord
Sacks—will say a little about kosher meat in that respect. As
other speakers have said, and as the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, has
just made clear, the number of animals slaughtered for kosher meat
without stunning is very small indeed.</hs_para>

declare an interest, having been for 22 years until recently the chair
of the Rabbinical Commission for the Licensing of Shochetim, the body
responsible for the supervision of every act of animal killing done in
this country under Jewish law. This body exists because for us animal
welfare is a matter of high religious principle, which we take with the
utmost seriousness. This is why we insist on long years of training,
spiritual as well as practical, before anyone can be qualified to kill
animals. In Britain, every shochet is licensed, every licence needs
annual renewal, and their work is regularly supervised and
reviewed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000154" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000154">Shechita<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T14:44:33"></hs_TimeCode>
itself, the act of animal killing, is designed to minimise animal pain.
The animal must be killed by a single cut with an instrument of
surgical sharpness, and in the absence of anything that might impede
its smooth and swift motion. The cut achieves three things: it stuns,
kills and exsanguinates in a single act. We believe that this is the
most humane, or a most humane method of animal slaughter. Quite apart
from the fact that other methods are not permitted by Jewish law, we
have doubts about their effectiveness. Pre-stunning by captive bolt, as
your Lordships have heard, often fails at the first attempt. According
to the European Food Safety Authority’s report in 2004, the
failure of penetrating and non-penetrating captive bolts affects around
10 million animals, causing the animal grave
distress.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000155">In<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T14:44:33"></hs_TimeCode>
Britain, some 3 million cows annually are affected by these failures,
compared to the 20,000 cows killed annually by shechita. The pain
caused to animals by the use of pre-stunning methods vastly outweighs
that caused by shechita, even were it the case that shechita did cause
extra moments of pain. However, we are not convinced that such is the
case. The failure rates of pre-stunning, and the inconclusive and
highly challenged nature of some of the experimental studies done in
this field, should give us pause. Therefore, if a case is made for
labelling meat to indicate how the animal was killed, this must apply
to all methods of slaughter, not just to some. I hope therefore that
the Jewish community will continue to work with the Government to
ensure that shechita continues to the highest standards of concern for
the welfare of animals, which should rightly be the concern of us
all.</hs_para><hs_time UID="14011665000452" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000452">2.42

very seriously. The public rightly expect the Government to ensure that

regards the legal factors, Council Regulation 1099/2009 provides for
the protection of animals at the time of slaughter and came into effect

requires religious slaughter to take place only in an approved

is a matter of personal choice. Those who choose to eat meat expect
animals to be treated humanely when they are slaughtered. This is
reflected in both EU and domestic legislation, which require that
animals are spared any avoidable pain, distress or suffering both when
they are handled and at the time of slaughter. As the noble Lord, Lord
Trees, said, the Farm Animal Welfare Council’s 2003 report on
the welfare of farmed animals at slaughter proposed that non-stun
slaughter should be banned on the basis that it caused unnecessary
suffering. That view needs to be balanced against the rights of the
Jewish and Muslim communities to eat meat prepared in accordance with
their religious beliefs. To insist on pre-stun slaughter would also
effectively deny Jews and Muslims access to meat slaughtered in this

the Government would prefer to see all animals stunned before

stunned. As noble Lords have mentioned, some halal meat comes from
animals that are stunned before

with noble Lords who have made the point that consumers should have the
information to make an informed choice. It has to be said that there
are some practical difficulties in identifying the method of slaughter
for all meat from the point of source to the point of consumption, so
the European Commission, which is well aware of our view, has
commissioned a study on the labelling of meat from non-stunned animals.

fewer, better and clearer

from ideas developed by individuals and by private companies. When
government has sought to take a direct hand in business, the results
have often been disappointing. But government can and must provide a
sound macroeconomic framework, sensible policies on tax and regulation,
sound legal, competitive and educational structures and a good
transport system. If policies in these areas are unwise, business finds
it much harder to succeed. Enterprise and industry is also the source
of the wealth on which ultimately everything else depends. That basic
fact is sometimes overlooked. Schools, health, defence and welfare are
important, but the resources available are dependent on the wealth that
the business sector
creates.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000176" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000176">I

with tax and regulation. As regards macroeconomics, the Chancellor has
adopted the right strategy in rebalancing Britain away from reliance on
debt and deficit. The deficit is declining rapidly as a proportion of

new jobs have been created in the private sector since

excellent news that WPP, the advertising giant, has returned from
Dublin to London. I welcome the new regime for taxing companies’
overseas operations and the Patent Box. They will help us to keep here

in their own proposed regulations. However, the cumulative effect,

further burden. Often, our regulators are judge, jury, scribe and

of 55,000 new homes will come forward. Thousands of jobs have been
created, some with small contractors as far away as County Down. It is
a model project, to my mind, with the cost shared equally between

home in Wiltshire, I had to go to the local cafe to do business last
summer because of broadband problems. The Government are investing
£500 million with matching funding from local authorities and
BT. These are huge sums, so why cannot we require a basic level of
connectivity everywhere by 2015? What about an official map, perhaps

I turn to education. International competitiveness depends on
education, and it is a scandal that in the latest OECD tables, our best
place was at number 21. The Secretary of State is doing many good
things, with free schools a fine innovation—we just need more of
them. So are the new academies, such as the London Academy of
Excellence at Newham, which sends more children to Oxbridge than some
famous private schools. I hope that the Minister will update us on
examples of business involvement in education that can really inspire
others, such as our studio schools and university technical

concerned about the way that Britain is being left behind. We need to
improve education across the board and stop it being a postcode

worrying PISA scores. I would allow more grammar schools to
expand.</hs_para>

any event, I think that streaming should be the norm in our schools, as
it also helps innovative teaching to be used in the slower streams. By
recognising that children have different skills and strengths, more
streaming could also give a boost to vocational training. Let us learn
from Germany, where trades are learnt from sitting alongside
experienced master craftsmen and engineers, and where employers have a
big role in course design. The scale of apprenticeships under this
Government and across the economy is a story that we should celebrate
but work to improve yet further. Rolls-Royce had 318 apprentices in
2012, and this year, Tesco had
4,127.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000189" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000189">I
have one final point, and it is a warning. Looking back at the run of
general elections, one sees parties vying to promise short-term
measures that crack down on business and do disproportionate damage.
There have been recent unfortunate examples. We must avoid this
temptation: the effect will be to hurt our international
competitiveness, our reputation and our country. We must promote
enterprise and the competitiveness of British business. I look forward

of the Government’s role in making business competitive is
essentially passive: keep corporation taxes down, do not over-regulate
and do not impose unreasonable bureaucracy. I have no quarrel with
this: competitive taxation and sensible regulation are essential in a
modern economy. In Britain we have outstanding finance and services
companies that rely on these principles. However, this is a minimum,
not a maximum, strategy for being competitive. To go further, we must
actively support the creation of a strong product base in a wide range
of sectors. We cannot rely just on banking or on our aerospace
industry, because the global market is changing. The Prime Minister
found this to be so in China. Economies such as China and India know
their consumers are very attractive to global businesses.
Understandably, they want to keep more of the value of their growing
markets in their
economies.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000192" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000192">What<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T15:11:32"></hs_TimeCode>
does that mean for Britain? In population terms, we are a relatively
small country. For our businesses to grow they must succeed in export
markets as well as at home. The first step to achieving this is a
competitive exchange rate. For many years, British exports were
strangled by high sterling, and we must not let that happen again. The
Bank of England has a major role to play by not rapidly increasing
interest rates. Stable 
<?notus-xml column=211?>exchange rates clear the way for government to help create an innovation
framework that helps businesses develop their product base. This is the
key to sustainable growth. For proof, look at the export data by
region. In most of Britain, exports were flat in 2013, but in the West
Midlands exports were up a staggering 14%. Why? It cannot be the
exchange rate, or tax rates, or regulation. No, the reason is that one
company, Jaguar Land Rover, is enjoying huge success, now accounting
for almost a quarter of all British exports to
China<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T15:12:41"></hs_TimeCode>. This is
no accident. When the global market was in crisis, JLR spent billions
of pounds on researching innovative new products. It spends £100
million a year in my place on R&amp;D. Now it is reaping the rewards.
Naturally, the companies which export so successfully will need to
build factories in their biggest markets. Crucially, however, the
benefits of this expansion will also be felt at
home.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000193" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000193">How<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T15:13:11"></hs_TimeCode>
can we spread this success more widely? First, we must help more
businesses invest in Britain for the long term. We are beginning to do
this with the UK Business Bank. However, compared to our competitors
our help is insignificant: less than 1% of the assets of the German
KfW. It is no wonder that German investment in both R&amp;D and fixed
capital is far higher than ours. The Business Bank must be greatly
expanded. Secondly, we must encourage industry sectors to work together
to identify the scientific challenges that will shape global markets,
and fund the R&amp;D that will solve them. The UK Automotive Council
shows how this can work, developing research road maps and
co-ordinating investment in areas such as battery technology. This is
especially vital in building our supply chain, so that the success of a
single company also supports broader
growth<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T15:14:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000194" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000194">Next,
we must increase investment in workforce training and skills. The best
people to identify the skills needed in the economy are businesses and
workers themselves, not government. I welcome the approach of Vince
Cable in encouraging apprenticeships and employer-led skills training.
We have a university technical college because the noble Lord, Lord
Baker, asked me to set it up. Within a year, we had 200 students
joining us, long before it had even started. However, this must not be
a free lunch for businesses. The quid pro quo must be greater business
funding for skills training. A return to the training levy system would
be supported in many sectors, as it would remove free
riders.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000195" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000195">Finally,
if you want to attract investment, do not get in the way of businesses
hiring talented people. The current visa policy is, if not causing a
problem, creating a sentiment that Britain does not welcome talent. If
we want to be competitive, we must encourage the best and brightest to
come to Britain. British business has invested in the automotive sector
to create innovative products, skilled people and efficient processes.
That sector was in the dumps five years ago but, as a result of that
investment, it is succeeding in the global market. Our challenge is to
increase the number of industries where this is happening and to spread
growth down the supply chain. This will take time and it is a task for
many Governments, not just the current one, but the prize is surely
worth the
effort.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_16_PT_1/8E3DECB0EFD5B824317C690E2665122339ABC834" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 16 January 2014">Thursday,

Green of Hurstpierpoint (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I join in
thanking my noble friend Lady Neville-Rolfe for tabling this important
debate. International competitiveness is a function of many things, as
we would all recognise: there is tax, regulation, infrastructure,
education and the skill base. The two previous speakers have covered
those. I want to focus on why it is so important for UK business to
enhance its international competitiveness and on some of the
implications of success in the international arena for policy and
action by both government and business.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14011665000198" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000198">First, on why it is so
important, I draw attention to the balance of payments. The current
account deficit in 2012 was nearly 4% of GDP. That is a substantial
deterioration on 2011, although that is partly—but only
partly—the result of a fall in profitability on outward
investment, which may be an aberration. The broader truth is that we
have had a weak balance of payments position for the working careers of
us all in this Room, and that trade has recovered only rather modestly
since the 25% or so devaluation of sterling which happened five or six
years ago. That is perhaps the slowest recovery ever, or at any rate
since the war. The first decade of this millennium was the worst in
terms of balance of payments and recent numbers show that we are, to
say the very least, not yet out of the woods.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14011665000199" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000199">Why does this matter?
Time was when a market fundamentalism had it that it did not really
matter what the balance of payments did because the market was
self-regulating and self-stabilising, and whatever current trade
position we had, the market would take care of it and make the
appropriate adjustments seamlessly. We now know that that is not true.
Indeed, there is some reason to fear that future devaluations of
sterling will be less effective than they have historically been
because there is a rising share of imports in exports. About 70% of the
value of some of our major exported manufacturing products is now in
fact in imported components, which of course blunts the effect of any
sterling
devaluation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000200" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000200">Even
more fundamentally, a weak and weakening trade position is a drag on
growth. We all know that we need to rebalance the economy to shift it
away from the old growth model, which depended too much on the domestic
consumer taking on debt to drive growth. We know that we need to find
other sources of growth and that means stronger investment
performance—another story—but also, importantly, a
stronger trade performance, because that way lies sustainable
growth.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14011665000201" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000201">That
is the macroeconomic perspective. The microeconomic perspective is that
international involvement is clearly good for companies. There is
compelling evidence from both government surveys and academic and
private sector surveys that companies which get into the export markets
become materially more productive and efficient than those which do
not, and that those effects are very quick. Unfortunately, the evidence
is that fewer British companies are engaged internationally than is the
case with our natural competitors. For the sake of discussion, I will
treat those as being Germany, France, Italy and such countries. 
<?notus-xml column=213?>A challenge for both the Government and the business community is to
encourage and support more companies to get into the international
arena: first, because we need it from the balance of payments
perspective; and, secondly, because it is good for their productivity
and we thereby strengthen the backbone of the whole economy.</hs_para>

to encourage and support this? There is the role of the Government
themselves of course, and we have already talked about the importance
of the tax and regulatory framework. I want to dwell briefly on the
role of trade promotion. I might be regarded as parti pris in so
saying, but I think that the role of UKTI and UKEF is important. The
key themes of work in progress in both cases are obvious to us
all—more private sector experience in their leadership, more
ability to operate flexibly and to market their services to British
companies up and down the land, and adequate budgetary resourcing. Can
the Minister assure us that the work that has been put in hand over the
last two to three years will be continued? This is, I might add, a
marathon and not a sprint. We need to continue it, not merely through
the next spending review, but probably for the next 10 to 20 years, if
we are to put this

this is a national challenge. Even if the Government get everything
right, and we score the Government 10 out of 10 on all criteria, there
is a job for business in this, and in particular, an important role for
overseas business groups and chambers. In recent months, we have begun
to work with the chambers overseas to upgrade their activities. My
impression, from my previous role, is that there is a growing
recognition among them of the importance of this, and a growing
readiness to step up to the plate. Again, I invite the Minister to
confirm that the work that has been put in hand will continue, because
as I say, this is a marathon and we have to keep this up, probably for
a generation.</hs_para>

April 1990, I took on a new responsibility running a newspaper
business—a very cyclical business. The English economy was just
tipping into the property recession at that time. Within six months,
the profits of that company halved. In the subsequent six months, 50%
of the rest disappeared. It is an experience seared in my mind. It took
more than five years before we rebuilt that business. Once your market
goes, you concentrate on cost-cutting to remain viable. You push back
on marketing and investment. It takes time for consumers and suppliers
to regain their confidence. Then it takes time for the business to have
the confidence to invest and retrain and recruit staff to take
advantage of the pick-up, and build on its competitive
advantages.</hs_para>

of the problems at the moment is that although we have rising

fragile,

the sustainable growth which builds on our competitive advantages in

international trade. This is where the Government have to concentrate
on improving the underlying business environment, through their
industrial strategy. They have to adopt a strategic approach to
championing key sectors in the UK, where their competitive advantage
gives them possibilities of advances and future opportunities for
growth in international markets. It represents a once-in-a-generation
opportunity to use the pressures of the recession, and business
desperate to recover, to achieve the changes we need.</hs_para>

We have seen in the past year the success of the Olympics—the
construction firms and the supply chain companies who are benefiting
from the reputations gained in that very successful enterprise. It is a
remarkable case study that our motor industry has been transformed in
the last 20 years, building—announced only this week—1.5
million cars last year, and set for 2 million by 2017. In the next two
months, our creative industries, through our film makers—the
British producer of “12 Years a Slave” and the technical
specialists on “Gravity”—are almost certainly
going to be honoured as world beaters. There are 1.7 million jobs in
that sector, which is 5.2% of our economy—also announced this
week. It is beyond belief, and I cannot quite understand it, that this
is not one of the key sectors in the Government’s industrial

my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T15:27:10"></hs_TimeCode> noble friend
for giving us a chance today to hear some outstanding speeches. I am
afraid that I am well down the list, so, as far as industry is
concerned, I am very much the tail-end Charlie. However, I take
enormous pride in the fact that, 52 years ago, I started my commercial
career as a apprentice chartered accountant in Rolls-Royce in Glasgow.
Then, in 1962, there was—and indeed there still is—a
strong shipbuilding industry on the Clyde in Glasgow. One of the first
jobs that I did as an apprentice accountant was to go to a colossal
steel company in Motherwell and to a seal fabrication company. Alas,
that was 52 years ago. Things have, sadly, moved on from that
particular
aspect<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T15:28:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000215" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000215">However,
in the great city of Glasgow, what have we got? We still have the
brains and the industry, including Rolls-Royce. Another firm very much
involved in high technology, which the noble Lord spoke about, is Barr
&amp; Stroud. It is in defence and makes superb aiming and technical
equipment. There is also the Weir Group. Wherever there may be problems
with energy pipelines, you will find the Weir Group. Where is it based?
It is in Glasgow. It is involved not just in the defensive aspect; it
is aggressive in developing ideas throughout the
world<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T15:28:50"></hs_TimeCode>. These are
all enormous, worldwide successes in different sectors, but I take some
pride as a humble accountant in the fact that, defensively, they are
all carefully watched by the accountants. I believe that we have good
accountants in Scotland, but they keep their feet firmly on the ground
of what you can afford. That is definitely
crucial<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T15:29:19"></hs_TimeCode>. I look
at accounts and finance as a being a first-class defence in that
particular

the early 1970s, I found myself spending more and more time in your

January 1977, we discussed something called patents. I said, “Oh
yes, that is very interesting”, but I then discovered that you
had to be a lawyer or a scientist to have any clue about it. I am
neither. However, thanks to wonderful advice from your
Lordships’ House and from the pharmaceutical industry, I gained
undying admiration for that industry in the United 
<?notus-xml column=216?>Kingdom, which I believe is a world leader. It is a subject of enormous
pride and a colossal success in the UK. Looking at the competition all
over the world, one or two of these enormous pharmaceutical enterprises
in the United Kingdom have perhaps contracted but they have appeared in
other areas. That is very much the lesson that my noble friend gave:
where there has been a reduction in employment in some areas—for
example, the public sector—there has been an improvement in
other jobs, whatever the ratio may be, and we see that in the
pharmaceutical
industry<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T15:30:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

aspects are relevant to the industry. One is something called the
Patent Box, which I think my noble friend referred to. That involves
finance and is most important, and I am sure that my noble friend Lord
Younger will be able to reply on that. On the second aspect, I have a
question. The Minister does not need to reply to me today but can he
please ensure that the pharmaceutical industry is kept up to speed with

someone who is involved with manufacturing industry, I am keenly aware
of the fragility of this current upturn. In the automotive sector, for
example, we have seen recent international success for the UK plants of
Jaguar Land Rover and Nissan, yet for most other car plants, market
conditions remain challenging. The fourth, fifth and sixth biggest car
manufacturers are producing 30% fewer cars than before the financial
crisis, and although we are now buying as many cars as we did before
the recession, only one in every seven cars sold in Britain is made
here. Even for those that can sell their products in this sector,
skilled engineers are hard to find, and working capital to fund growth
remains difficult to
secure.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000224" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000224">Behind
the big car-producing household names lies a supply chain of component
manufacturers and service providers upon which the car makers rely and
which provide the majority of jobs and income on which our
manufacturing regions depend. Most of these businesses have been unable
or unwilling to risk investing in new 
<?notus-xml column=217?>productive capacity in the past few years. They are now feeling more
confident to invest, but how are they going to find the capital and
skilled labour to allow them to do this?</hs_para>

the Government’s efforts, the commercial banking sector in the
UK has continued to shrink its loan books, and what is available
remains difficult to access. I welcome the initiative of the Government
in setting up the British Business Bank, and wish the recently
appointed chairman every success in investing the £1.25 billion
that the Government have set aside, but this may be too little, too
late. Germany’s KfW, on which I believe the British Business
Bank is based, invested more than €17 billion in
Germany’s Mittelstand companies in the first nine months of 2013
alone. If we are to compete in international markets, the Government
and financial sector need to work together now to provide easily
accessible funding solutions to support investment in our economy. Tax
incentives for lease finance providers, coupled with enhanced
investment allowances for manufacturers, could and should be
considered.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000226" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000226">We
must also support our manufacturers in the training, development and
availability of skilled labour at all levels, from shop-floor
technicians through qualified engineers to senior managers. This must
be a true partnership between government, academia and manufacturers.
We need to ensure that a significant part of our higher education

commerce, and that involves local
communities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000227" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000227">The

experience is rather more mixed and modest, but I have started several
engineering businesses, and at one time I could say that I was the

the war, to make a new electric delivery vehicle to sell to companies

me<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T15:38:06"></hs_TimeCode>.
Unfortunately, we were pioneering too early and in a dreadful
recession, and I had to shut that business down. The business was
indeed helped by BIS, but that was not what broke it. The reason why we
started such a pioneering business in the Midlands was the depth of
skills there and the enthusiasm of local businesses to help a small

I saw the new electric van in Tesco livery, it was a thrill. It was not
government encouragement or help that made us want to start the
business. I believe that the most important thing that the Government
can do to help British business is to reduce tax. The way in which
entrepreneurs want help is by cutting the costs of doing business, the
regulations on health and safety and the regulations on human resources
that sap the little energy left in the mind of an entrepreneur after he
has concentrated on satisfying his customers.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T14:44:24"></hs_TimeCode>Reducing tax is
exactly what this Government are doing, and it is exactly the right
thing to do. They may be doing so of necessity, because in this age of
international trade it really is impossible to identify exactly where a
profit is made and therefore where tax should be levied. Is it made by
exploiting the patent or capitalising on the brand? It is quite
reasonable to have a dozen different opinions on the implications of
the same
facts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000234" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000234">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T15:44:28"></hs_TimeCode>
best solution is to lower the tax rate to the point where it is not
economic for the taxpayer to argue. I am not sure that 21% is low
enough, but it is certainly a start and every little helps. We often
underestimate just how beneficial tax cuts can be. There were
encouraging signs of progress on this at the Autumn Statement 2013,
with some preliminary work done on the dynamic modelling of corporation
tax cuts. They were much more beneficial than static calculations had
suggested. The Treasury and HMRC should be commended for finally
undertaking this task. The model should now be published in full so
that improvements can be
made.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000235" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000235">When<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T15:44:28"></hs_TimeCode>
I was a struggling entrepreneur, my wish was for smaller government,
not better or more frequent free advice. My wish was for simpler tax
laws, and now that I have the enormous fun of joining your
Lordships’ House I am sure that tax legislation would be
improved immensely if it were subject to the wisdom that is endemic
here. The advantage to British business of your Lordships’
scrutiny of tax laws would be immense. If someone could actually read
them before they were legislated, that would be an enormous advantage.
The noble Baroness has called for debate on the direct measures that
the Government are taking to promote entrepreneurship. The best single
measures are to reduce Government expenditure and to reduce and
simplify
taxes.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_16_PT_1/1FC8C03D09416F0FF7C1B17DEA228953E13411F2" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 16 January 2014">Thursday,

the noble Baroness. She mentioned the Patent Box, and we ought to claim
a bit of the credit for that for the previous Government, whose idea it
was.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000238" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000238">However<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T15:44:28"></hs_TimeCode>,
I stumbled a bit when she confessed her desire to increase the number
of grammar schools. As an ex-grammar school student myself, I must
admit that the quality
of<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T15:42:35"></hs_TimeCode> my education
was good, but I do not think that in the 21st century that is really
the answer to our problems. We are far more likely to succeed with the
model of university technical colleges which the noble Lord, Lord
Baker, has been proselytising, if we are serious about inspiring the
next generation of young people to get involved in craft and
engineering. That seems to me to be a much more important way forward
than trying to reintroduce grammar
schools.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000239" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000239">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T15:44:28"></hs_TimeCode>
noble Baroness also made the point about job creation, and one public
sector job lost and four new jobs in the private sector. Of course we
welcome the expansion of jobs in the private sector, but with some of
them there is a price to be paid. A significant number are not
full-time jobs but part-time jobs, and they do not actually fulfil the
requirements of many people who need a full-time job. I do not quarrel
with the expansion of jobs in the private sector, but we ought to get
it into
perspective.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000240" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000240">Similarly<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T15:44:28"></hs_TimeCode>,
there is the question of the importance of education and
apprenticeships. Of course, I applaud the work of the Government in
building on our rejuvenation of what was in fact a dying apprenticeship
scheme. My only problem with the current approach is that there is
sometimes a desire to quote numbers. However, many of them, as we found
out from examination, are adult apprenticeships which are really
reskilling rather than being real apprenticeships. For me, with 1
million young people unemployed, the real focus ought to be on the age
ranges of 16 to 24 and 16 to
18.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000241" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000241">As has
been said, a number of companies are doing well in recruiting
apprentices—names such as Jaguar, Range Rover and Rolls-Royce.
Yes, they are success stories, but far more worrying is the fact that
still at best 8% of British companies have apprentices—that is
the real nub of the problem, if we are serious about improving our
skills—and still only one-third of FTSE 100 companies have
apprentices. We have a long way to go in promoting that. There are
still too many companies that believe that training is some other
company’s problem, not theirs.</hs_para>

not been mentioned in this debate that interest me. One is the quality
of management. We still have some way to go. I forget the exact figures
from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, but it was
something like one in five managers having any training. So if we are
serious about addressing the quality of the products and on
productivity itself, then surely that is one of the things that the
Government need to focus on: improving the quality of
managing.</hs_para>

cannot help reflecting on another issue that no doubt impacts on
Britain’s ability to export, and that is the cost of energy. We
are all struggling with how we are going to deal with fracking and
shale gas but I do not believe that we can ignore it. Look at what has
happened in the States: the impact of low energy costs is not
insignificant. I do not want to spoil the debate by focusing on the
negative but a number of contributors today have indicated that we are
not doing as well as we should be. The noble Lord, Lord Green, said, in
relation to the nature of the recovery, that it was fragile. There is
still a worry that the level of debts and the housing bubble are not
really what we seek to do. If we are talking about sustainable growth
then surely it does not matter which party you are a member of, but the
latest figures are still worrying.</hs_para>

look forward to hearing from the Minister whether he thinks
that—I conclude on this—the biggest constraint that
businesses have with regard to expanding and exporting is the thorny
question of credit finance. A number of noble Lords have pointed out
that the current efforts by the Government have not remedied this
problem, but the latest proposal for a small-owned business bank itself
may not be sufficient. I think it was the noble Lord, Lord Paul, who
drew our attention to the German model. Whichever model we create, we
must ensure that it delivers on what British businesses, especially
small businesses, require, and that is reasonable rates of credit and
finance<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T15:48:01"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T15:47:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="14011665000463" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000463"><I><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T15:47:52"></hs_TimeCode></I>3.47

my remarks I will outline the measures that we are taking to meet our
aspiration that the UK is seen as the best country in the world in
which to do business. There is of course much to say on both enterprise
and competitiveness, so I will focus only on some key areas; that is,
improving access to finance, equipping people with the right skills,
increasing our exports and simplifying both taxation and

the Government’s growth and business plan for UK plc is set out
in our industrial strategy. As part of this, we are implementing 11
sector strategies in partnership with business. My noble friend Lord
Stoneham highlighted the importance of focusing on specific sectors. I
am co-chairman of one of the sector councils—the Professional
and Business Services Council. This is the UK’s largest economic
sector, accounting for 12% of UK employment and 11% of gross value
added.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000248" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000248">We have
been working on some exciting projects. The Government have invested,
in partnership with industry, approximately £2 billion in the
Aerospace Technology Institute and, as my noble friend Lord Stoneham
mentioned, £1 billion in the automotive Advanced Propulsion
Centre. The first projects for both will be launched later this year.
We have also 
<?notus-xml column=221?>earmarked £600 million for eight technologies where the UK has
the potential to be a world leader; we have announced a new £100
million employer ownership fund to co-finance investment in skills in

committed to ensuring that businesses can access the finance that they

together the management of existing government loan guarantee and

Lordships will be aware that apprenticeship numbers continue to rise as
we make it easier for employers to take on an apprentice. The noble
Lord, Lord Bhattacharyya, and my noble friend Lady Neville-Rolfe,
highlighted the importance of skills and education, as did the noble
Lord, Lord Young of Norwood Green. We are equipping people with the
skills that employers want—for example, 2.5 million adult

turn to exports. First, I pay tribute to my noble friend Lord Green, a
tireless advocate for UK businesses. He recently vice-chaired the World
Trade Organisation summit in Bali. The outcome of the summit is the
first global trade deal in 20 years. It will add £100 billion to
the global economy and will provide £1 billion of benefit to UK

noble friend also encouraged UKTI to focus support on those sectors
most important to the UK—for example, helping AugustaWestland to
win a £1 billion helicopter contract with the Norwegian air
force and safeguarding 3,000 jobs in Yeovil. It is also working with
British chambers to deliver a one-stop shop of support services to UK

<?notus-xml column=222?>reassure him that that very good work will continue and will be built on
to achieve the challenging targets that he himself set and which are
still the bedrock of what UKTI must achieve. For example, I understand
that UKTI is on target to assist 50,000 businesses by the end of
2014-15, and it is making a major contribution towards achieving the

set out to reduce tax and provide a stable tax environment to encourage
investment. We will be reducing corporation tax to 20% by 2015, which

Patent Box, which my noble friend Lord Lyell mentioned, provides a 10%
rate of corporation tax with the full benefits being phased in over
five years, starting last April. It has already been widely welcomed by
businesses and by representative bodies, including the CBI, and is
expected to benefit up to 5,000 companies including SMEs. R&amp;D tax
relief helped to support over £11.9 billion of R&amp;D
expenditure in around 12,000 companies in 2011-12, and we have built on
the success of this scheme.</hs_para>

to the UK, including WPP and AON, and companies which plan to invest
more in research and manufacturing facilities in this country, such as
GSK and AstraZeneca. I do agree with my noble friend Lord Lyell that
pharmaceuticals are indeed a key sector in the UK, and, by the way, it
was good to have a plug from him for the city of Dundee. He also raised
the point about the importance of patents and education, and I can
reassure my noble friend that as Minister for Intellectual Property,
the communication of the importance of protecting IP is very high on my
agenda. Last year, for example, the Intellectual Property Office
contacted 25,000 businesses. The Patent Box helped secure an investment

Borwick raised the issue of tax, and I agree with him that the wish for
simpler tax laws is very high on our list. I am sure that tax
legislation would be improved if it were subject to the wisdom which is
endemic here in this Chamber. The Government’s aim is for a tax
system that is simple to understand and easy to comply with, and we
have taken action to modernise and simplify the tax system. The
Government established the Office of Tax Simplification in July 2010 to
provide independent advice on simplifying the tax system, and have
acted on a range of its recommendations—for example, a new cash
basis for calculating tax in April 2013 for up to 3 million of the
smaller self-employed businesses, and investing £200 million to

languages are important; we really must take that for granted in
today’s debate. Suffice it to say that in the 21st century,
knowing English is vital but knowing only English is a serious
drawback. Primary school is the place to start making sure that pupils
in the UK are on the front
foot.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000268" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000268">I

starting in September with a blank sheet of paper. Some 97% of primary
schools already offer some language teaching and there is some
excellent practice in several parts of the country. However, the latest
data from the Language Trends survey indicate a wide variation in
practice. Many schools treat their provision as a very lightweight
introduction to a new 
<?notus-xml column=225?>language and concentrate solely on oral skills. Around one-third of
schools say that their neither monitor nor assess pupils’
progress. Schools are not confident about the more rigorous aspects of
language teaching.</hs_para>

that need urgent attention from the Government if the new policy is to
be a success overall, not just in small patches. I will address each of
them in turn. They are guidance, support and training; teacher supply;
measuring progress and continuity; capitalising on home languages; and
the role of
Ofsted.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000271" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000271">First,
the survey reveals a high level of dependence on outside support.
However, there are real problems with schools’ access to that
support and training. Official guidance barely exists. The new
documentation for schools has only three pages outlining the purpose of
study, attainment targets and subject content in modern languages. That
compares with 88 pages for English. Surely that sends a message to
schools about the level of importance attached to studying a foreign
language.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000272" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000272">The
DfE says that schools should seek advice and support in preparation for
key stage 2 languages, but does not actually provide any support or
indeed guidance on how to find it. What is being done, and what more
can be done, to ensure that schools have access to the support and
training that they need? In particular, will the Government facilitate
training for the new programme of study? Without further guidance on
the intended outcomes of key stage 2 languages, it is also very
difficult to know how much time to give to the subject in the
timetable. England provides one of the lowest amounts of teaching time
to modern languages in both primary and secondary schools of all the
OECD countries. The current typical offer is one 30-minute lesson a
week, and while that might be valuable in itself it is unlikely to lead
to any measurable level of competence by the end of key stage
2.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000273" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000273">The second
big issue is teacher supply. How will the Government ensure that enough
primary school teachers are trained to teach a language, bearing in
mind that this becomes compulsory in only a few months’ time?
What opportunities will there be for teachers to spend time in a
country where the language they are teaching is spoken? Given the
shortage of suitably trained teachers, what advice will the Government
be giving to schools on the use of unqualified speakers of a given
language who, perhaps with the appropriate training, might assist
schools with their language
provision?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000274" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000274">The Minister might be
interested in the case study of the Al-Noor primary school, an
independent Muslim school in east London hoping to become voluntary
aided. The pupils, none of whom are native Arabic speakers, start to
learn Arabic in reception class and by year 6 have reached a level
judged to be equivalent to GCSE. The teacher is not a native Arabic
speaker either, although he is an experienced teacher and teacher
trainer. However, he does not have QTS because the assessment-only
route to QTS is not available, as I understand it, in languages. Is
there any modification of the QTS process that the Government could
make to improve the supply of qualified language teachers?</hs_para>

third issue is measuring progress and achieving continuity. There is
currently no guidance on the level to be achieved at the end of key
stage 2 or how it is to be measured. Other countries use the Common
European Framework of Reference, or a version thereof, which is adapted
to measure the progress of young children. Without a national system of
measurement, there is a danger that schools will adopt a minimalist
approach that will not provide a secure or consistent enough basis for
secondary schools to build on in the same way as they do for maths,
English and science. Without this, year 7 pupils will all too often
find themselves starting from scratch again in languages, which leads
to boredom, demoralisation and a reluctance to continue languages after
key stage 3. Will the Government therefore introduce a formal
assessment measure? Will they set a defined level of achievement for
pupils to reach at the end of key stage
2?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000276" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000276">The
Language Trends survey revealed that 60% of primary schools have no
contacts on languages with their local secondary schools. The issue of
continuity is often just dismissed as too complex to deal with, yet the
national curriculum requires that key stage 3 should build on key stage
2. The need for a proper system to record pupil progress and pass this
information on to secondary schools is key to the success of language
teaching at key stage 2 and, indeed, throughout statutory
schooling.</hs_para>

Government ensure that a national recording mechanism is introduced to
facilitate information transfer and also to provide data that would
enable local, national and international comparisons to be made? The
London Borough of Hackney and other school partnerships offer one
example of an approach to achieving continuity, by having all schools,
both primary and secondary, agree on which language is taught at key
stage 2. Will the Government provide a strong steer to encourage
schools to work together in this
way?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000278" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000278">The
fourth issue that I flagged up is the value of home languages. One in
six primary school pupils does not have English as their first
language. We should recognise this linguistic capital as a significant
asset. The Government’s decision to remove the list of seven
languages allows primary schools the freedom to develop home languages
as well as to introduce a new one. The challenge is how to recognise
and accredit home languages now that the Asset system has been
withdrawn. What will the department can do to make the Government more
aware of the potential importance of the rich range of languages spoken
in the UK for economic growth, national security and international
diplomacy? Without the Asset scheme, how do the Government intend to
support and develop higher levels of literacy in home and community
languages?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000279" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0001.htm#14011665000279">Lastly,
I want to say a few words about the importance of Ofsted inspections,
which will play a critical role in measuring the successful
implementation of this policy, as well as encouraging primary schools
to take the reform seriously. To what extent will the inspection of
language provision be part of Ofsted inspections from September 2014,
and will the Minister assure noble Lords that full account of the new
policy on key stage 2 languages will be taken in inspection visits and
that it will form a part of all inspection reports?</hs_para>

forgotten what I learnt there. I listened to the marvellous and very
encouraging comments made by the noble Baroness, Lady Coussins, about
rigour in language tuition. The noble Lord, Lord Aberdare, and I will

the expert advice that she has produced today, together with her
commitment, drive and enthusiasm in beating the drum for something
which appears not to be of enormous importance for school curricula,
especially at an early stage: primary school, or when moving on to
secondary school. I am afraid I am a bit lost with what the noble

probably the majority language of communication. If the Minister has

a personal basis—if the noble Baroness will forgive me
this—when I was at the University of Oxford, I often had an
essay crisis in the middle of the night. BBC Radio 2 went off air at
midnight, but one did not worry—there were stations that could
be listened to for 24 hours out of 24. On long wave, one had French
radio. I was able to take all four French channels, and I am delighted
that they have improved my communication. I then came to learn about

240 million people, of whom 130 million did not

that their professions, business, trade and finance will be improved,

difference opinion remains between her and me on the decision over key
stage 4 modern foreign languages but, having been guiding the ship of
the Department for Education when that decision was taken, I have
naturally taken an ongoing interest in this, which is I why wanted to
make a contribution to the debate today.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T16:17:14"></hs_TimeCode> think that the

very much welcome the Government’s decision on this; it is a
good thing now to make modern foreign languages mandatory in primary
schools. I welcome that and wish them well, and I hope that we can work
together to bring about success. That was a decision that I faced over
a decade ago, and I decided not to go ahead with it. However, coupled
with the decision not to have mandatory foreign languages at key stage
4 was the decision to move the subject in time to primary schools and
make it compulsory at key stages 1 and 2—never to leave it
floating as being compulsory only at key stage 3, which I regret. I do
not think it was the wrong decision not to make it compulsory way back
in 2002—I am not sure that we had the resourcing within the
nation and the education system to do so—but there are certainly
lessons to be learnt about what has gone on in the decade since. It is
those that I want to spend two or three minutes talking about now, and
I have two or three questions to finish off

went wrong? What would we do differently if we had to start again?
First, giving the school system 10 years to enact something was far too
long. School leavers or class teachers who were there at that point
would not be there 10 years later, so there was no lever to give a
sense of urgency to make primary schools get on with it. Secondly,
although ring-fenced money was given to modern foreign languages
teaching at the start of the process, it was put into the general
school 
<?notus-xml column=229?>budget around 2006—not under my leadership but under later
leadership, That was a mistake. It took the lever away again from
encouraging primary schools to teach modern foreign languages. Thirdly,
we never solved the problem of there being sufficiently highly
qualified teachers in the primary sector. However, there were some
things that went well, which is why 97% of the schools at least have a
modern foreign language specialist.</hs_para>

Government bearing these points in mind as they go forward with this
task. First, we made great use of the specialist language schools,
which are not there now. Those provided a core of partnership that is
badly needed if primary schools are to make a go of it. They cannot do
it alone; they need partnerships to join and leadership somewhere in
the education system, because it might not be there in their own
school. Secondly, we had co-ordination by the local education
authority, which is no longer a player in the game. I am not sure where
the co-ordination will now come from. Thirdly, we had designated
advanced skills teachers who played a leadership role. There are some
things that I would do differently but some things did have an effect,
as we can see a decade later.</hs_para>

Minister on this occasion are these. First, I found it quite difficult
to find out the number of primary ITT-model foreign-language places for
next year. Does he have those figures? I attempted to look them up but
could not find them. Secondly, is partnership not absolutely key? There
should be partnership with key stage 3 in the secondary schools to
which those schools’ children are likely to go, partnership with
other language speakers in the wider community and partnership with
expertise wherever it might exist, whether in local colleges and
universities or in neighbouring primary and specialist schools. The
Government have not gone for a system of organisation where they force
partnership on schools. I am worried about how schools will voluntarily
make these partnerships, and make them effectively. That came out of
points 5A and 5B in the consultation process which the Government have
just taken forward. That was the most raised issue and I am not sure
what the Government’s response to it
is.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000292" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0002.htm#14011665000292">My last
point is on pedagogy. We all want it to happen but making it happen
will depend on the quality of teaching in each and every one of our
primary schools and for each and every one of their pupils. What is the
Minister doing to improve pedagogy and teacher quality in modern
foreign languages? However, I wish the Government well with this. It is
long overdue and I regret the gap that has happened, but it gives us a

Garden of Frognal (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, thank the noble
Baroness, Lady Coussins, for initiating this debate and join in the
tributes to her tireless work on behalf of languages. For those of us
with a keen interest in modern languages, it has been encouraging to
see the increased enthusiasm generated by public and private sector
organisations, as well as such respected bodies as the British Academy
and the Chartered 
<?notus-xml column=230?>Institute of Linguists, which have helped to inform and persuade the
Government of the importance to this country of speaking languages
other than English.</hs_para>

international world where technology has revolutionised the speed and
range of communication. It brings together the multilingual nations of
the world and the UK will be the poorer economically, culturally and
socially if we cannot participate in languages other than our own. We
saw a serious decline in the study of languages, which accelerated when
the previous Government decided to remove the requirement for a
language beyond the age of 14. The EBacc has helped to reverse the
trend at key stage 4 with a healthy increase in GCSE entries in 2013,
which we hope will be sustained. However, the decline at school led to
a decline in university language study and, consequently, in those
opting to become language teachers. Secondary schools are experiencing
a shortage of skilled and enthusiastic linguists, and primary schools
will have to compete if they are to fulfil their remit to interest
children in languages at a young age.</hs_para>

an impressive 91% of the responses to the Government’s
consultation agreed with the introduction of languages at key stage 2.
It is widely recognised that the earlier a child learns a second
language, the easier it is for them to absorb that language as a
natural development at a time of life when so much else is being newly
learnt. Breaking the barrier of one foreign language makes other
languages more accessible. If there is such agreement over why this
should be done, we need to look at how it could be done successfully,
and the noble Baroness, Lady Coussins, outlined some of the issues
there. It would not be appropriate to expect primary teachers to
acquire language skills overnight that were not previously required.
They are hard-working and hard-pressed enough in giving young children
the best start to their education, so creative measures are called for
to bring the fun and excitement of languages into primary
schools.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14011665000296" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0002.htm#14011665000296">When
the previous Government were encouraging primary languages, imaginative
materials were developed under the key stage 2 framework for languages.
Children were encouraged to explore the new language collaboratively
through games, songs and rhymes, and to show what they had learnt
through simple conversations, role-plays and short performances. At
school in France when I was eight we had to learn something by heart
every evening, be it a fable de La Fontaine, some grammar rules or
little known aspects of French history. Reciting these back was one of
the few bits of fun in an otherwise humourless school, and many of
those have actually stayed with me today—some more useful than
others, I have to say. Learning songs and rhymes helps to develop
children’s working memory, which is another essential tool in

suggestion is to mirror the British Academy’s language
assistants programme, which provides classroom placements in 14
countries overseas for English speakers with at least two years of
higher education. Are there similar programmes to attract language
assistants from 
<?notus-xml column=231?>overseas into our schools here? Student native speakers would bring
currency and youth into lessons and marry their fluency with the
teaching skills of the class teacher. Are the Government able to
provide schools with advice on such

connected source of support can come from embassies. A few years ago
the German, French and Spanish ambassadors clubbed together to offer
their backing to the then Government to revitalise interest and
proficiency in their languages. This time round, when the range of
languages was being debated, representatives from the Japanese embassy
were anxious to ensure that Japanese should not be ruled out as one of
the permissible primary languages. Along with that representation came
offers to support the teaching of Japanese. They and other nationals
succeeded in increasing the range of languages. What discussions have
been held with London embassies to enlist their collaboration in
promoting their native languages within the

schoolchildren are no strangers to technology. I hope the Government
are also supporting the development of imaginative programmes geared to
younger children to help them to master languages through
computer-based games and activities. Our aim should be to inspire the
next generation to see languages as the route to better global
communication, more rewarding careers and a better quality of

idea—initiated, I think, by Lord Dearing—of the language
ladder seems to have disappeared through the floorboards. It is
essential to have a way of assessing the progress of children at key
stage 2, and this framework would provide that because it is adaptable
to the earlier stages. More than that, it is also something that
teachers themselves should be very much encouraged to make use of to
upgrade their own language skills, or even to start at the beginning
and treat learning a language like learning a musical instrument, where
you have the associated board and examinations at various stages; it
does not matter what age you are—you can take grade 1 when you
are eight or 80. Such a framework is essential before we embark on the
very welcome return of languages to key stage
2.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000302" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0002.htm#14011665000302">I have
three questions for the Minister, all of which I think have been asked
before in one form or another. First, are the Government planning for
the department to set up some sort of crash courses for serving
teachers in order to add a specific qualification in the teaching of
languages to their existing qualifications?</hs_para>

importantly, are the Government minded to set up short training
courses, preferably in-school, for bilingual non-teachers who could
then act as peripatetic teachers in groups of schools? Of course, this
entails what has already been mentioned: the need for collaboration
between schools in an area. Primary and secondary schools should act as
a collaborative group, and peripatetic teachers could 
<?notus-xml column=232?>therefore teach in both secondary and primary schools. Having a native
speaker who has trained as a teacher, however briefly, would be an
enormous advantage. I wonder if the Government have any ideas to set
this up—immediately, really, because September is not so far
away.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000304" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0002.htm#14011665000304">That
leads to my third question: how are we going to break away from the
domination of French as the most-taught language in primary schools? I
have nothing against the French language—or rather, I have some
things against it, although I am not anti-French—but the
predominance of French is a purely historical matter that should be
remedied in the 21st century. I hope that making use of native speakers
of a variety of different languages would be extremely

morning I asked someone who has lots to do with corresponding and
communicating in foreign languages which two languages he would choose
as the most useful to be taught at key stage 2. He said that his heart
told him French—because he loves French—but his head told
him Mandarin and Spanish. We ought to widen the range of languages
taught and make use of all the skills that there are. As we know, many
languages are spoken in this country at present. Mandarin is taught
quite widely, but mainly in private schools at present, and we do not
want it to be a skill that is confined to people who have been to
private schools. I would be grateful if the Minister could answer those

noble Baroness, Lady Morris, mentioned the decision that was taken in
2004. That was preceded by a Nuffield report on the teaching of
languages, which had pointed out very clearly that in most foreign
countries children were introduced to a foreign language at the age of
six or seven and that on the whole this was recommended as a more
effective way of teaching foreign languages. She mentioned the
trade-off, that key stage 4 would be dropped, which was done very
reluctantly on the part of some members of the Opposition at that time.
Many of us fought hard against it and have regretted that decision ever
since.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000308" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0002.htm#14011665000308">The
relatively slow development within the primary sector has been
described, but by 2010 well over half of primary schools offered some
teaching in modern foreign languages. Today, as we have heard, the
figure is 97%. The Ofsted report in January 2011, <I>Modern Languages:
Achievement and Challenge</I>, pointed to the achievements of primary
schools: approximately two-thirds of the schools visited were rated
either good or outstanding in this area, especially in listening and
responding, as distinct from reading and writing, in the foreign
languages. That picks up the point about rigour that the noble
Baroness, Lady Coussins, mentioned. What comes above all through from
the report is the enthusiasm of the seven to 11 year-olds for their
language studies and the diverse and imaginative approaches of
teaching<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T16:33:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that stood out from that Ofsted report was the importance of the
competence of teachers. Some larger primary schools recruited language
specialists themselves while others used part-time assistants,
sometimes linking with the local secondary school and sharing their
assistant. Ofsted noted that, generally speaking, schools that had
access to native speakers achieved more highly than those that did not,
although the imaginative use of DVDs and video facilities, linking up
with partner schools and using the internet, e-mail and even Skype
links substituted for
this<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T16:33:51"></hs_TimeCode> on

NUT also emphasised the importance of teacher competence and the need
to ensure sufficient time and resources for the training of teachers.
Given the importance that Ofsted placed on the role of native speakers,
there might be more of a role for training UK-based native speakers to
help in schools—many French and German people are longstanding
residents in the UK—as teaching assistants supplementing
classroom teachers rather than substituting for them, but providing a
very important link as a native speaker in helping with the teaching.
It has always struck me that we send a great many young people overseas
with as little as six weeks’ training to teach English as a
foreign language. Why should we not reverse that and train some of our
very competent native speakers in this country to do the same in our
own
schools<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T16:34:49"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000311" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0002.htm#14011665000311">The
NUT also emphasised the importance of links with local secondary
schools, which the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, and others have also
spoken about. The new national curriculum gives schools considerable
leeway to decide what language to teach and how to teach it. However,
if the idea is to encourage young people to pursue modern foreign
languages later in their studies, it is vital not to demotivate them at
key stage 3. Nothing is more demotivating than having to go all over
again, often painfully slowly, the elementary stages of language
teaching when it has already been covered at your primary
school<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T16:35:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

successful experiments in primary teaching have come from the linking
up of what were the specialist secondary language colleges with the
feeder primary schools. Sometimes they sent their staff out to help
with the training of teachers and with developing the courses in those
primary schools. How far is the Minister’s department
encouraging primaries and secondaries to work together in local cluster
groups, as I gather happened in Hackney—I think the noble
Baroness, Lady Coussins, mentioned this—to achieve a smooth
transition from one stage to
another?</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_16_PT_1/809FCF8D361C0DBB13344443F3FE741DE7D21BEB" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 16 January 2014">Thursday,

congratulate the Government on making foreign language learning
compulsory at key stage 2, with Latin and Ancient Greek included among

have an enormous capacity for learning 
<?notus-xml column=234?>languages. My own granddaughter, aged just five, who lives in Moscow, is
the most fluent Russian speaker—in fact the only one—of
all four members of her family, having spent some two years in a

languages, especially Latin, are particularly helpful in learning about
how languages work. I can think of no better way of getting to grips
with grammar—as the noble Lord, Lord Lyell, and I
experienced—and Latin is directly relevant to the study of a
whole group of modern European languages, so many of whose words and
idioms derive from it. Beyond that, Latin and Greek can open a window
into a much wider realm of literature, history, drama, law, philosophy,
science and culture. They can combine well with other languages at
primary level, each feeding off and reinforcing the
others.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000316" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0002.htm#14011665000316">There
are excellent materials available for teaching Latin at this level. The
Minimus course, developed by Barbara Bell of the Primary Latin Project,
has sold more than 130,000 copies and is widely and successfully used
in schools teaching Latin to seven to 10 year-olds. It features a Roman
family living near Hadrian’s Wall, including their slaves, a cat
and a mouse, Minimus. The resources available include books, games,
songs, a musical, comic strips, animations, finger puppets and more.
Minimus is even on Twitter, although I imagine he should squeak rather
than tweet.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14011665000317" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0002.htm#14011665000317">I
am encouraged by the fact that there seems to be growing enthusiasm
among schools—including state schools—to offer classical
language teaching, which has for too long been seen as the preserve
mainly of independent schools. This has been very much down to the
efforts of private organisations such as Friends of Classics, Classics
for All, the Primary Latin Project, the Iris Project, the Mayor of
London’s Love Latin scheme, Classics in Communities and others.
These offer encouragement, support and resources, including financial,
to schools wanting to try teaching Latin or
Greek.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000318" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0002.htm#14011665000318">One
project, started with a grant from Classics for All, has sought to
introduce and embed Latin into a cluster of schools in North Walsham in
Norfolk. This has employed four teachers, working with other suitable
adults, to deliver the Minimus course at the primary schools. A
further, important part of the project seeks to enable students from
the primaries to continue with Latin up to GCSE level at the secondary
school. The project has now spread to two other
clusters.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000319" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0002.htm#14011665000319">There
is much good work going on, but projects like these face some
challenges, which I hope the Minister may seek to address. First,
children studying Latin, let alone Greek, at primary level have only a
one in four chance of being able to continue at secondary level. Again,
excellent resources are available, notably from the Cambridge School
Classics Project. Both Latin and Greek can count towards the EBacc
qualification at key stage 4 but there is something of a black hole at
key stage 3. Secondary schools cannot offer Latin as a language within
the key stage 3 national curriculum, only as an option outside
it<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T16:39:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000320" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0002.htm#14011665000320">Secondly,
not enough new teachers are being trained to deliver Latin and other
classical subjects, and there is little or no government support for
training such 
<?notus-xml column=235?>teachers. Much teacher training has to be carried out by volunteers. The
Norfolk project has had to make use of retired teachers, teaching
assistants, governors, parents and others with suitable basic skills,
as well as existing staff, including teachers of modern foreign
languages. I hope the Minister is willing to look into ways of working
with the classics community to tackle these issues. Perhaps he, or an
appropriate ministerial colleague, might consider meeting some of the
leading promoters of Latin teaching in primary schools to understand
the challenges they face and to explore ways of meeting them, in order
to ensure that the welcome inclusion of classical languages in the
mandatory language teaching programme achieves the success it
deserves<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T16:40:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="14011665000471" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0002.htm#14011665000471">4.40

Jones of Whitchurch (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I am also extremely
grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Coussins, for tabling this debate
today and add my thanks for her continuing commitment to making foreign
language teaching in schools a success. As she said, this is a very
timely debate, which allows us to be updated on the progress being made
in implementing the key stage 2 proposals. As I think has been said,
the noble Baroness has, quite rightly, identified the main challenges
which still lie
ahead.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000322" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0002.htm#14011665000322">First,
I should state from the outset that we support the principle that
foreign language teaching should be compulsory at key stage 2. Our
record of producing young people and adults fluent in other languages
over the years has been rather woeful. England continues to be ranked
the worst country in Europe for the level of acquisition of foreign
languages among teenagers. We have a long way to go, but we need to get
the detail right. It may be that a 10-year run-in was too long, as my
noble friend Lady Morris suggested, but conversely it seems that we are
working to a rather tight timetable here for the implementation of the
policy by September 2014. The Government have tried to make a virtue
out of having a hands-off approach to schools, but on this occasion I
hope the Minister would acknowledge that help is needed on this issue
given the scale of the challenge ahead. I hope he is able to reassure
us that steps are being taken by the department to roll the policy out
successfully rather than leaving schools to do it all
alone.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000323" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0002.htm#14011665000323">Secondly,
as has been said, there continues to be a concern about the lack of
staff expertise. Arguably, teaching a foreign language badly is worse
than not teaching it at all at this level. For example, nearly a
quarter of primary schools have no member of staff with a language
qualification higher than GCSE. For many, that qualification was taken
many years ago or, indeed, could be in a different language to the one
they are now being asked to teach. Therefore there are challenges with
the skills of the teaching pool. Arguably, that challenge—the
language skills of existing teachers—is not something that will
easily be met by September 2014. I hope the Minister can clarify how
quality teaching will be assured and whether a national audit of the
skills is being carried out. Do we have a sense of the scale of the
problem, and how is the department addressing that issue?</hs_para>

rather thorny issue of the choice of languages to be taught. When we
debated the language order in Grand Committee which set the scene for
these changes last year, I made it clear that we opposed the narrow
range of languages which the Government intended to prescribe, and was
therefore pleased when that that element of the proposal was dropped.
At the time I was unhappy on the basis that having a restricted list of
languages would prevent us from benefiting from schools being able to
adopt the languages predominant in their local community and to take
advantage of that. For example, I was for many years a school governor
in a part of Kennington which became known as Little Portugal because
of the cluster of Portuguese shops and restaurants and, eventually, the
large number of the families that came to live there. It made sense for
that school to have Portuguese as its adopted second language. Indeed,
the Portuguese embassy used to visit the school regularly and help with
the language teaching there. In retrospect, that was a good model upon
which we should
build.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000325" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0002.htm#14011665000325">However<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T16:49:28"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T16:49:28"></hs_TimeCode>,
it is clear that to have a
successful<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T16:44:37"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T16:44:37"></hs_TimeCode>
foreign language strategy we must have high levels of collaboration
between primary and secondary school language teachers, particularly if
we accept that a variety of languages will be taught at key stage 2.
This has been said by a number of noble Lords this afternoon. That,
again, is a challenge for the Government, and once again those strong
interschool links require not only extra encouragement but extra
resources. I would be interested to hear from the Minister what he is
doing to encourage that
collaboration<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T16:45:14"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T16:45:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000326" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0002.htm#14011665000326">Finally<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T16:45:18"></hs_TimeCode>,
there is the issue of the content of the primary language learning. The
best language teaching I have witnessed makes the language come alive,
encouraging children to communicate, perhaps imperfectly in the first
instance, and to play games. The noble Baroness,
Lady<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T16:45:23"></hs_TimeCode> Garden,
quite rightly stressed this, and gave some exciting examples about the
importance of enjoyment at that level. I argue that grammar ought to
come later. I am concerned at the messages from the department that
seem to concentrate too much on learning grammar and not enough on that
initial speaking and
communicating.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000327" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0002.htm#14011665000327">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T16:49:28"></hs_TimeCode>
hope that we can agree that we are all aiming for the same outcome
here, which is to raise the game of foreign language teaching at
primary and secondary level, and to develop more young people who are
able to communicate effectively on the global stage. I look forward to

Lady<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T16:46:22"></hs_TimeCode> Coussins,
for securing this important debate and for her insightful speech. I
know how passionate she is on the subject, as she was today, and I
thank all noble Lords for their valuable contributions. The noble

her questions, but I will have a jolly good try. My noble friend

Government are determined to put languages back at the heart of our
education system, and to make sure that every young person in the
country enjoys a rich and rewarding language education. The earlier
children become comfortable and confident speaking another language,
the more quickly they become fluent and the more likely they are to do
well as they move into secondary education and continue with languages
at GCSE and, we hope, beyond. That is why, from next September,
children will start to learn languages much earlier in their school
career, from the age of
seven.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000330" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0002.htm#14011665000330">As<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T16:49:28"></hs_TimeCode>
the 2012 Language Trends survey indicated, 97% of primary schools
already teach at least one modern foreign language, and 83% are
confident that they will be able to meet the statutory requirement from
September 2014. I understand that the 2013 survey results will be
available in the spring, and I hope that they will show further
progress in this regard. Schools are not alone; there are many
classroom resources freely available to support the delivery of high
quality languages teaching in several languages, as well as many highly
qualified teachers and languages experts who are willing to support
primary schools with the introduction of the new curriculum. This is
where the support should come from, not from additional guidance or
prescription from central
government.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000331" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0002.htm#14011665000331">We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T16:49:28"></hs_TimeCode>
want primary schools to concentrate substantially on teaching a single
language from the age of seven right through to 11. This will give
pupils four years of study in which to develop their listening,
speaking, reading and writing skills to a high level. It will give them
time and space to reach a decent level of fluency early on, giving them
confidence that they are good at languages and encouraging them to
continue with the subject for longer. It will also increase their
confidence and capability, if and when they start to learn a new
language at secondary level. We are not prescribing details of
assessment outside English and maths. Schools should decide these for
themselves, although they will need to demonstrate them to Ofsted, and
I will come to that in a
minute.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000332" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0002.htm#14011665000332">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T16:49:28"></hs_TimeCode>
noble Baroness,
Lady<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T16:46:22"></hs_TimeCode> Coussins,
raised the issue of the amount of time spent on teaching languages at
primary level. The Languages Trends survey showed that slightly over
half of primary schools offered between 30 and 45 minutes a week, with
around a quarter offering an hour. That is a good basis on which to
build, although decisions about timetabling are, of course, for
schools. We also strongly encourage primary and secondary schools in a
local area to work together to offer the same languages, helping pupils
to move smoothly between schools. Obviously this can help pupils
greatly, and I shall say a bit more about that in a moment.</hs_para>

resources. Schools are already starting to prepare for the change of
course, and there is a lot of support out there for them. Last year,
the National College for Teaching and Leadership facilitated an expert
group, now working independently, chaired by a leading primary head
teacher. The group has 
<?notus-xml column=238?>been meeting to develop signposting of high-quality teaching resources
to support initial teacher trainers as schools prepare for the
introduction of key stage 2 languages. They are providing links to
resources, courses, qualifications and people that the primary sector
can use to support the introduction at key stage 2 from 2014, to be
hosted on the website of the Association for Language Learning. We are
considering the group’s recommendations carefully as we prepare
for the implementation of the new national curriculum from September
this
year<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T16:50:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000334" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0002.htm#14011665000334">Organisations
such as the Association for Language Learning and the Network for
Languages are offering training to support the new languages
curriculum. Another source of support comes from embassies and cultural
institutions from many countries. My noble friend Lady Garden asked
about the involvement of embassies. We have been enlisting their
collaboration in promoting their native languages within the
curriculum. The cultural section of the French Embassy, the Goethe
Institut, the Spanish Consejeria and the Japan Foundation are already
offering schools specialist support to help them teach these languages
effectively. The Institute of Education’s Confucius Institute is
working in partnership with HSBC to expand the teaching of Mandarin
Chinese in primary
schools<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T16:51:21"></hs_TimeCode>. This is
the kind of innovation and collaboration that we want to encourage in
schools, and I hope that those resources will become more widely used
by teachers in future.</hs_para>

continuing professional development for teachers focuses on empowering
schools to take the lead in the training and development of teachers
and creating more opportunities for peer-to-peer training. The national
network of teaching school alliances that we are creating will further
build the capacity of schools to follow this approach, including in
languages. Many schools are already doing this successfully. For
example, Penrice Community College in Cornwall is working with primary
school teachers in the Peninsula Teaching School Partnership to improve
their confidence in using the spoken language in the classroom through
French improvement sessions incorporating phonics. St Cuthbert’s
Roman Catholic Primary School in Durham, part of the Together to
Succeed teaching school alliance, has used different teaching models
with different groups of pupils to identify how best to teach reading
and writing in French. Such arrangements are not something that we can
dictate from Whitehall and Westminster; they need to be sorted out at a
local level. In our view, decisions relating to teachers’
professional development rightly rest with schools, individual teachers
and head teachers, as they are in the best position to make judgments
about relative spending priorities and
requirements<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T16:52:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Garden asked about language assistants. The DfE provides just over
£500,000 a year to the British Council to fund the Language
Assistants scheme. As she mentioned, this covers places for UK
undergraduates and recent graduates to teach English in schools and
universities overseas, but also supports placements for foreign
undergraduates and graduates in UK schools teaching their native
language. Approximately 660,000 pupils in English schools are taught by
about 1,400 foreign language assistants each year. The noble Baroness
also asked about imaginative 
<?notus-xml column=239?>materials that were developed under the key stage 2 framework. We are
aware of these materials. They are very popular, and there is nothing
to stop schools using
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000337" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0002.htm#14011665000337">Ofsted
inspections, which the noble Baroness, Lady Coussins, referred to, are
not subject-specific but ensure that the school curriculum is broad and
balanced and that it meets the needs of all pupils. When foreign
languages become compulsory from September, Ofsted inspections will
consider them within this overall context, and guidance will be amended
to reflect this.</hs_para>

chief inspector made a speech yesterday in which he dwelt at some
length on the point that in future, Ofsted will be looking to schools
to demonstrate that they have in place effective assessment methodology
in relation to pupils’ progress annually. This is a very
significant step in enhancing the accountability of schools, and we
look forward to them using this in relation to
languages.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000339" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0002.htm#14011665000339">The
noble Lady, Baroness Warnock, raised the issue of the range of
languages taught at primary level and the predominance of French. She
will be pleased to hear that under this Government, Spanish has
increased 41% at GCSE and we have substantial moves in place to expand
Mandarin teaching. The Institute of Education’s Confucius
Institute is leading the way. The British Council is also working with
Hanban to increase the demand for Mandarin teaching in schools and to
address supply—for example, by increasing the provision of
Chinese language
assistants<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T16:54:58"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T16:54:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000340" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0002.htm#14011665000340">I
turn to home languages, in response to the point made by the noble
Baroness, Lady Coussins. Teaching home languages can be included,
although we would not want this to be at the expense of providing those
pupils with an opening to languages and cultures other than their
own<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T16:55:18"></hs_TimeCode>. The noble
Baroness, Lady Sharp, asked about classroom assistants. She had the
fantastic idea of bringing in native speakers to support language
teaching and learning in the classroom. In our view, it is important to
be able to draw on a wide range of people to do this, even if they do
not have qualified teacher

noble Lord, Lord Aberdare, raised the issue of classics, which I know
is very dear to his heart. I reassure him that from 2014-15 we have
more than doubled the level of bursary that teacher trainees in
classical languages will receive to match the amount that trainees in
modern foreign languages get—up to £20,000 for a trainee
with a first-class degree. As he mentioned, Classics for All is
receiving £250,000 from the London Schools Excellence Fund. He
also asked about a meeting to discuss the creation of more language
teachers and training. I will suggest this to my honourable friend Liz
Truss, who has responsibility for that area, to see whether she would
like to meet.</hs_para>

spoke about pupils learning languages earlier, the importance of
co-operation between primary and secondary schools, and working
together in partnership. There is a bigger issue here. We have a big
focus on GCSE results but, as we all know, in all subjects, not just
languages, the grounding that pupils get in primary school is so
important to enable them to go on to get those GCSEs. We are very keen
on 
<?notus-xml column=240?>teaching school alliances, which I have mentioned—primaries and
secondaries working in collaboration, and primaries working together.
We are seeing a number of primary schools, which are often at a
sub-critical mass, coming together and working in groups of
academies—we have incentives to encourage them to do
this—or secondary academies working with their feeder primaries.
We believe that this development will be very
productive<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T16:57:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000343" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0002.htm#14011665000343">I
am extremely grateful to all noble Lords, including the noble Baroness,
Lady Morris, for her comments about what we are doing, and the noble

languages earlier, concentrating on fluency and confidence, raising
standards at secondary level and encouraging greater take-up at GCSE
and beyond—as our EBacc policy is already achieving—we
aim to end England’s disastrous language drought, and to prepare
the next generation to go out into the world with confidence and to

the right honourable Paul Goggins, Labour Member of Parliament for
Manchester Wythenshawe, felt deeply. He spoke extensively in Committee
on the Mesothelioma Bill. He, and the Conservative Member of
Parliament, Tracey Crouch, tabled amendments on Report, based on the
amendments narrowly defeated in your Lordships’ House, which
would have created a small levy to fund mesothelioma research. Just
before the Christmas Recess, he and I once again beat a path to see
Ministers to raise the plight of victims of mesothelioma. It was one of
the last things that Paul did. After a massive stroke, which robbed him
of life, and which robbed Parliament of a good and principled man, Paul
was buried earlier today. Our thoughts are with his

House of Lords debate, in which the House rejected the LASPO CFA
reforms as sufficient to justify imposing legal costs on mesothelioma
sufferers. When I tested the opinion of your Lordships’ House,
noble Lords rejected the Government’s proposal that CFA reforms

refer the Minister to the recent Legal Ombudsman’s report on
no-win no-fee agreements, stating that there is evidence of some
lawyers failing to make clear the financial risks of conditional fee
agreements and trying to pass on the risk to customers. That is
precisely the situation your Lordships feared, and would not tolerate
dying mesothelioma sufferers facing. That is why, on two occasions, we
defeated those proposals and agreement was reached to have a review.
However, as Mr Goggins and I made clear to the noble Lord, Lord
McNally, there has been no review worthy of the name. The Government
have simply restated their original
argument.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="14011665000350" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0002.htm#14011665000350">The
crucial point is that any scheme should deliver no less favourable
compensation than is presently provided. Victims deserve nothing less.
I hope that the Minister will comment on this. During our ministerial
meeting, we linked this question to that of research because if cures
and causes were identified, such issues would be otiose. In any event,
investment in mesothelioma is in its own right desperately needed. The
UK has the highest rate of the disease in the world. The annual number
of mesothelioma deaths in the UK has nearly quadrupled in the last 30
years.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14011665000351" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0002.htm#14011665000351">As I
argued during the proceedings on the Mesothelioma Bill, it cannot be in
anybody’s interests, not least that of the insurance companies,
to pay out vast sums of money in compensation and to generate the full
panoply of schemes, reviews, fees, CFAs and litigation, if causes and
cures for mesothelioma could be identified. That is why, under the
auspices of the British Lung Foundation, to which I pay great tribute,
and with the assistance of the Department of Health, a handful of
enlightened insurance companies—AXA, Aviva, RSA and
Zurich—have been generously funding some of the research.
However, as we know, that money has come to an end. A statutory scheme
with a 
<?notus-xml column=242?>small levy on all companies would be both fairer and, perhaps more
importantly, a sustained source of funds for
research.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000352" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0002.htm#14011665000352">With
this very small level of funding, the results have been impressive. New
researchers from other areas of therapy have started to take an
interest in mesothelioma, bringing with them new expertise and
insights. Europe’s first mesothelioma tissue bank, which I think
we will hear more about from the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, has been
created to collect and store biological tissue from mesothelioma
patients for use in research, and work is being funded to identify the
genetic architecture of the disease. The evidence demonstrates beyond
doubt that investment in mesothelioma is worth while. However, all the
original funding has now been allocated and we look forward to hearing
from the Minister what new funding will be forthcoming to continue this
work.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14011665000353" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0002.htm#14011665000353">A
sustainable, reliable voluntary agreement involving all or most of the
150 firms with an active interest in the employers’ liability
insurance market would be difficult and impractical. It is for that
reason that the Government will ultimately have to intervene in order
to make this funding compulsory and fair, so that it is spread across
the entire industry. I was particularly concerned to hear a defensive

that is not the case. During the debates in the Commons, Paul Goggins

Borwick (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I declare my interest as a
trustee of the British Lung Foundation. Lung diseases are predominantly
diseases of the poor because they are often associated with tobacco.
Because of this association, there is a strange guilt attached to lung
disease, and so the level of research generally into lung diseases is
very low.</hs_para>

subject that is correlated with workmen who dealt with asbestos in the
construction or shipbuilding industry at a time when it was regarded as
a safe, reliable fire protection. We now know that it is a killer. Like
Jimmy Savile, that which was presented by the BBC as safe and cuddly
turns out in reality to be a monster. It is very difficult to raise
money for lung research because of this guilt complex and, as a result,
the BLF has a turnover of about £6 million per annum, which is
tiny in comparison with that of the British Heart Foundation. I am
afraid that the British Government seem to have been affected by this
as much as others. It is only recently that the Government have been
working hard to help with fundraising for research into this, and of
course they have been doing so against a background of a dreadful
recession. It is hard to raise funding at this time.</hs_para>

cancer, a disease that 40 years ago was seen as being just as fatal as
mesothelioma is now, the prospects have been transformed by good
research and by attracting the best researchers into working on that
subject, and the same could be done for lung disease. Normally I
believe that the private sector will always be better than the
Government at achieving almost anything, and I should pay tribute to
the four insurance companies which funded the first three years of the
research push. They are Axa, Aviva, Royal Sun Alliance and
Zurich—heroes all. However, the insurance industry is beset by
the problem of free riders—those who gain the benefit without
picking up any of the cost. Notably this has happened in the car
insurance industry, and even with modern number plate recognition the
cost of uninsured drivers in accidents is an enormous burden on the
price of motor insurance. Is that not structurally similar to the cost
of insurance companies not contributing to the research fund for
mesothelioma?</hs_para>

lung disease is the guilt implied by the reaction of so many people.
Even if people choose to smoke or do not have the ability to give up an
addiction, no such criticism should possibly be made of mesothelioma
patients. The sad thing is that Governments in the past have generally
not treated the subject of lung disease with the importance or priority
that other diseases have achieved. I do not want to criticise past
Governments, but I will say that the general level of research into
lung disease is much less than into other diseases. Of course, I
applaud the work that the Minister has been doing in trying to
negotiate more funds. The Government certainly believe that they are
enlightened—even the whole source of enlightenment—so can
I suggest that lung disease is a cracking good place to prove

the need to place funding for research on an adequate and sustainable
basis should be incontestable, as we have heard over and again in your
Lordships’ House and in the other place, and we have heard it
again here today. This is a dreadful disease that inflicts terrible
suffering on thousands of people and into which research is
significantly underfunded in comparison with other
cancers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000368" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0002.htm#14011665000368">My
second point is that the Government need to act more vigorously to
ensure that funding for research is put on an adequate and sustainable
basis. There is no good reason for them not to do so. If the problem
remains the quality of research proposed, as the noble Earl has
suggested in the past—and, as he is well aware, that is
disputed, as we have heard again today—then the Government need
to do whatever is necessary to raise the quality of those proposals. I
suggest that the single most important action they could take is to
increase the sums of money available for research. It is hard to see
how that would not
work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000369" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0002.htm#14011665000369">If
Ministers are tempted into further inaction by arguments about the
problems of hypothecation, they should not be: those arguments are
misplaced. As we heard from the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, in the debate
last year, that pass was sold when funding was first accepted in
universities and other research institutions from non-governmental
sources. I am not aware that accepting such funding has resulted in any
dilution of the quality of
research.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000370" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0002.htm#14011665000370">If
the problem is shortage of funds—although the noble Earl has
insisted in the past that it is not—then that, too, needs to be
addressed. As the noble Lord, Lord Alton, has pointed out, the Minister
in the other place has said that to ask the insurance industry to pony
up more funding would disrupt the exhaustively negotiated agreement
which was the basis of the Mesothelioma Bill. Is that really the case?
Quite apart from the continuing moral responsibility of the insurance
industry as a whole—leaving aside the notable exceptions that we
have already heard about—the sum of money to significantly
improve the research effort on a sustainable basis is a tiny fraction
of the overall amounts involved and an even tinier fraction of the sums
that insurers should have paid to sufferers over the years but have
evaded doing so. For example, £3 million a year would double the
amount currently donated by the private and voluntary sectors. Do the
Government seriously think that a levy producing £3 million a
year would so 
<?notus-xml column=246?>distress the insurance industry, which pays out £187
million a day to its customers—more than £68 billion a
year—that the industry would walk out of the agreement or think
that its fundamentals were disrupted in any
way?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000371" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0002.htm#14011665000371">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T17:17:15"></hs_TimeCode>
ask the Minister to look ahead 10 years and ask himself how it will
look to historians if the Government do not find a way around all the
objections, no doubt spelled out in his brief today, to making real and
quick progress on this matter so that they can agree the reasonable
requests that have been made in the other place, and indeed here, by
all who have spoken on this issue in the past year or so. How will it
look if the Government fail to engineer the relatively small sums of
money needed and so condemn thousands to avoidable pain and suffering?
I am afraid that the longer the Government delay in finding a solution,
the harsher will be the judgment of
history.</hs_para><hs_time UID="14011665000476" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0002.htm#14011665000476">5.17

their families but also the NHS, the DWP and the insurers. For this, we
need ongoing work such as the research by the Sanger Institute, with
two American groups, to identify the role that genes play in this
disease. This could be the first stage in finding a cure, through
chimeric antigen receptor cell engineering, a process in which T-cells

interested parties in research funding, particularly Cancer Research UK
and the Medical Research Council, to have a conference of experts and
those parties interested in mesothelioma research to determine how a
national co-operative effort could be taken forward. I wonder whether
any of those undertakings have indeed happened or in what timeframe it

situation in which mesothelioma research finds itself is nothing new.
At many times, and for many other diseases, there has been recognition
that a new strategic research focus needs to be developed at national
level. I would argue that with the National Institute for Health
Research now well established and in place in the NHS in England, we
are uniquely positioned to take forward a strategic approach, not only
to building research capacity but in ensuring collaboration across
those groups devoted at the moment to mesothelioma research and other
groups who have technologies and interests—we have heard
peripheral examples of the management of acute myeloid
leukaemia—so that they are brought together with some strategic
focus and direction.

addition, we now have across the NHS in England well established
academic health science networks, 15 of which cover the entire country.
I declare my interest as chairman elect of University College London
Partners. I wonder whether opportunities might be brought to bear for
promoting research and collaboration between academic institutions, the
NHS and industry, which are at the core of the purpose of the academic
health science networks. Those 15 networks would then be asked to see
how they might contribute, through their participant organisations, in
a national research effort to promote further understanding and a more

We have the highest rate of the disease in the world, and a similar

that the funding for mesothelioma research lags far, far behind; it is
only about one-tenth, from the figures that I have seen. If it is true
that every single week an average of 20 tradespeople in the UK die from
diseases such as this which are linked to exposure to asbestos during

industry to establish a sustainable research funding scheme. It is
self-evident to me that more and sustainable funding will attract

chorus of praise for the noble Lord,
Lord<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T17:25:57"></hs_TimeCode> Alton, not
only for initiating this debate but for all his extraordinary work
around this issue. In the debate on the Bill in the Commons, it was
said quite frequently that research into mesothelioma has a Cinderella
status in terms of research funding. It is worth asking why that is so.
It may reflect some generic issues, but I think that there are some
specific
ones.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000389" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0002.htm#14011665000389">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T17:29:33"></hs_TimeCode>
best way to consider this is not to be too parochial about it but to
look around the world. When one does this, as I did in my admittedly
amateur way, one finds exactly the same pattern in the European
countries, in the United States, in Canada and in Australia. That
suggests that we are dealing with a deeply structural problem, which
has some specific features connected to this disease. Thus, for
example, in the United States, according to the figures that I have,
the National Cancer Institute until recently invested only 0.01% of its
annual budget in research into mesothelioma. That suggests that there
might be a powerful cluster of reasons that is producing this
marginality in research terms. There are four of
them<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T17:30:14"></hs_TimeCode>, which I
will briefly
describe.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000390" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0002.htm#14011665000390">First,
because of industry resistance—we all know the long history of
that—most attention has been focused on reparation and legal
wrangles. In so far as the disease is known at all to the wider public,
it is mainly due to that history rather than to its own
characteristics. Secondly, by its very nature it affects mainly working
people, who do not have the political clout of the more affluent.
Thirdly, in industrial societies, although not on a global level, it
can be seen as an illness that will fade away naturally because
asbestos is no longer used in industry and most of it has been disposed
of, so it could be said to have a kind of natural life cycle. Fourthly,
because of those things, the alleviation of suffering is often seen as
important rather than the creation of research in a direct and
systematic way into the disease that produces that
suffering<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T17:31:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

forgive me for being academic and didactic about this, there are three
policy implications of what I have described, which I would like the
Minister to ponder and perhaps respond to. First, if we are to get more
money spent on research—and there will be a need for public
backing for that—the Government should consider spending more on
a public awareness campaign about mesothelioma to ensure that it is
understood as a structural disease in its own right and that it is
disentangled from the legal histories that have so dominated its past.
That has happened with lung cancer and smoking; the same thing should
happen with
mesothelioma<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T17:32:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000392" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0002.htm#14011665000392">Secondly,
I feel strongly that the objective research should not be just to
control symptoms but to search for a cure, as the noble Lord, Lord
Avebury, mentioned. I checked some of the treatments in the United
States and the debates about them; as I say, I am an amateur in respect
of those treatments, but they seem pretty promising. Some new
treatments have been admitted to the FDA’s fast-track programme
in the US, including gene therapy, which was mentioned, immunotherapy
and so on. We should look for a cure for this illness.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14011665000393" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0002.htm#14011665000393">Thirdly<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T17:33:52"></hs_TimeCode>,
the most powerful reason for supporting research is not just that many
thousands of people are still affected by mesothelioma and will die
from it. As we know, thousands of people will do so, but there are even
more powerful reasons than that to support research. A prime reason is
that we<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T17:33:41"></hs_TimeCode> need
research into pathologies of environmental origin. We should remember
that only 40 years ago or so asbestos was thought of as the miracle
substance. We live in a world in which we ingest, breathe in and are in
contact with thousands of substances that have never existed before. It
takes about 40 years for mesothelioma to come out; a variety of other
consequential diseases might be stored up there. There is therefore a
great public interest in this, which stretches well beyond mesothelioma
itself. I would appreciate a response from the Minister to those three
questions<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T17:33:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_16_PT_1/96E82F2E3A15983E8C19AB8001C1390EDA53A2BB" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 16 January 2014">Thursday,

importance of not letting up in our fight for mesothelioma sufferers

school friend, Peter Wolfe, told me that he had been diagnosed with the
condition, despite never having worked in any industry that could have
triggered the
disease.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011665000396" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0002.htm#14011665000396">We
have been reminded of the estimated 50,000 people who may die over the
next 30 years unless adequate treatments are found, and I suspect that
this could be an underestimate. In Wales, cases of mesothelioma have
risen sharply over the past 20 years. Whereas 23 cases were
reported in 1990, by 2008 that number had jumped to 90, and according
to Cancer Research UK, the latest estimate is about 109 new cases
annually. That is partly because of Wales’s industrial
legacy<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T17:35:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

dangers for younger generations too. Some 85% of schools in Wales
contain asbestos, compared to some 75% of schools across the UK. Almost
400,000 children and young people in Wales are exposed to the risks of
this deadly material. The Cwmcarn High School is a case in point: it
was forced to close in October 2012 after a survey found that pupils
and staff were at risk from airborne particles of amosite asbestos.
Responsibility for the management of asbestos in schools rests with the
Welsh Government, but that of research rests primarily in the hands of
the UK Government. As has been said, investment in such research is
woefully inadequate. According to the National Cancer Research
Institute, £400,000 was invested in mesothelioma research by its
partners in 2011, compared with £5 million for myeloma and
£5.5million on melanoma—two cancers with similar fatality

agreement in place over the past three years with the four leading

research levy would nullify the deal reached by the Government, because
the industry claims that a voluntary agreement with all 150 firms would

Lords, and supporters of the Bill across all parties in the other place
during last week’s Third Reading, have stressed our moral
obligation on this issue in this country and internationally, as my
noble friend Lord Giddens has underlined today. I also pay tribute to
the vital contribution and role of Paul Goggins. I did not know him
personally but certainly was fully aware of his work and reputation in
my party, and of the respect in which he was held across Parliament.
Now that the Bill has passed, I also pay tribute to the work of the
British Lung Foundation and the campaigners, trade unions, MPs and
Peers who have been lobbying for many years for justice for victims of
this terrible disease. The BLF carer support project, in conjunction
with Carers UK, is also developing vital support networks for carers
and their families. It deserves special mention and
recognition.</hs_para>

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Earl
Howe) (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble
Lord, Lord Alton, for having tabled this debate. Mesothelioma is, as we
have heard, a terrible and devastating condition. There is no cure and
uncertainties remain about the best available approaches to diagnosis,
treatment and care. It is therefore completely right and appropriate
that mesothelioma research has been discussed a number of times, both
here in your Lordships’ House and in the House of
Commons.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011678000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0002.htm#14011678000014">Funding
is, of course, needed for further research to be carried out. The four
largest insurance companies have previously made a donation of
£3 million between them, and this is supporting valuable
research into the disease. A higher level of funding has come from
government—through the Medical Research Council and the National
Institute for Health Research. Together, these funders spent more than
£2.2 million in
2012-13.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011678000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0002.htm#14011678000015">The
MRC is supporting ongoing research relating to mesothelioma at the MRC
Toxicology Unit and is also funding two current fellowships. The NIHR
is funding two projects in mesothelioma through its Research for
Patient Benefit programme, and its clinical research network is
recruiting patients to a total of eight studies, including industry
trials. The NIHR funds 14 experimental cancer medicine centres across
England with joint funding from Cancer Research UK, and these centres
have four studies focused on
mesothelioma.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011678000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0002.htm#14011678000016">However,
as I have said previously, the issue holding back progress into
research into mesothelioma is not—as a number of noble Lords
have intimated—a lack of funding but the lack of sufficient
research applications. I want to clarify and stress that the work
currently being funded is of high quality, and that is consequent upon
high-quality applications.</hs_para>

we promised to set up a partnership to bring together patients, carers
and clinicians to identify what the research priorities are. This is
now well under way and a formal launch event took place successfully
last month. It is supported and guided by the James Lind Alliance,
which is a non-profit initiative overseen by the NIHR Evaluation,
Trials and Studies Coordinating Centre. The partnership has a steering
group of 16 people, comprising six patient/carer

next stage is a survey asking patients, families and healthcare
professionals for their unanswered questions about mesothelioma
treatment. The partnership will then prioritise the questions that
these groups agree are the most important and the end result will be a
top-10 list of mesothelioma questions for researchers to answer. The
partnership plans to have the list ready by the end of this year, when
it will be disseminated, and work will begin with the NIHR to turn the
priorities into fundable research

the NIHR Research Design Service will be able to help prospective
applicants develop competitive research proposals. This service is well
established and has 10 regional bases across England. It supports
researchers to develop and design high-quality proposals for submission
to the NIHR itself and to other national, peer-reviewed funding
competitions for applied health or social care research. The service
provides expert advice to researchers on all aspects of preparing grant
applications in these fields, including advice on research methodology,

we have made a commitment to convene a meeting of leading researchers
to discuss and develop new proposals for studies. Initiatives like this
are one reason why it is so valuable to have the National Cancer
Research Institute, the NCRI, which enables the major funders of cancer
research to work in strategic partnership. I can report that NCRI
officials held a meeting with clinical research leads yesterday, 15
January, to develop plans for bringing researchers together, and a
representative from the British Lung Foundation also participated. The
outcome was encouraging: the NCRI will be organising a mesothelioma
workshop in the early summer with the aim of encouraging competitive
grant applications in the field of mesothelioma. This will cover the
full spectrum of basic, translational and clinical
research.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011678000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-gc0002.htm#14011678000023">Several
noble Lords have—not unnaturally—spoken of a need for an
ongoing role for the insurance industry in funding mesothelioma

high-quality mesothelioma research proposals, we are also encouraging
insurers to provide further funding. My honourable friend the Minister
for Disabled People, Mike Penning, has met the Association of British
Insurers, and following that meeting I have written to the
association’s director general, Otto Thoresen. I am pleased to
say that he has confirmed in a reply today that a further

requested that the Commission report to Agriculture Council on the

China.</hs_para>

considered the future of the dairy sector following the end of quotas
in 2015. Many Member States argued that while they were not calling for
the return of quotas, they did see the case for some

on producer returns. I urged the EU not to move back towards market
management, but to leave producers to take advantage
of growing global demand for
dairy products.</hs_para>

presented a paper highlighting the problems faced by the EU rice sector
with significant increases of duty free imports from some countries,
particularly Cambodia and Burma. Italy suggested it might be time to
consider safeguard measures. The Commission assured the Council that it
monitored the EU rice sector, but noted that the EU was not
self-sufficient in rice, and it would be premature to consider
safeguard
measures.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011657000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140116-wms0001.htm#14011657000030"><I>Nutrition

Italian delegation introduced a paper expressing concerns about the
UK’s voluntary front of pack nutrition labelling. They cited
concerns over: disruption to the internal market, consumer confusion
and incompatibility with European quality schemes. My Hon Friend
clarified the UK’s position: the scheme was voluntary and
experience over eight years of similar colour coded schemes by most
domestic retailers had not caused any disruption to the internal
market. However seventeen Member States supported Italy. The Commission
in its response made clear that such voluntary schemes were left to the
discretion of individual Member States and that it would take action in
any cases where the internal market did become seriously disrupted. The
Commission reported that it had received assurances from the UK about
the voluntary nature of the scheme and its monitoring
arrangements.</hs_para>

Council took note of the Presidency’s progress report on the
five elements of the smarter rules for safer food package. Member
States intervened on a variety of issues in the package: a positive
list of plant products allowed in order to give greater protection
against imports of pests; concerns over the introduction of fees in the
controls package; concerns with the high number of delegated acts and
the value of merging separate pieces of legislation.</hs_para>

Commission updated the Council on negotiations with Russia on the
export of plants and plant products from the EU. Russia had
phytosanitary concerns and blocked imports of some plant products.
Russia was, at the same time, insisting that the EU accept imports
of some Russian products which the EU had
phytosanitary  
<?notus-xml column=12?>concerns about. The Commission would continue with the negotiations,
being “cautiously optimistic” that the export ban would
be lifted in the near
