banks to explain clearly to customers, free of charge, how their PPI
redress offer has been calculated. The FCA is actively monitoring banks
to ensure that they are complying with this requirement. If a bank has
not provided this information, or it is not clearly presented, the
consumer can bring a complaint against the bank and, if it is not
resolved, raise a complaint with the Financial Ombudsman

James of Blackheath (Con):</Member></B> I thank the noble Lord for that
Answer, but will he take it into account that the banks got off on the
wrong foot with the repayment programme by refusing to write a letter
to everybody telling them that they owed them some money? It was left
to customers to initiate their own claim and there is no certainty that
many have not slipped through the net. The noble Lord’s Answer
does not allow for the possibility that there are a great many people

reassure the noble Lord that the Government have acted in this area.
During last year’s passage of the banking reform Act, we gave
the claims management regulator the power to impose penalties on claims
management companies which make speculative claims. We are also giving
the regulator more enforcement staff and requiring claims management

necessarily inappropriate. Some are. Many people have used claims
management companies because they did not feel confident going through
the process themselves. I accept that there has been abuse. The key
thing we have done is to give the regulator power to crack down on
firms which make speculative claims to the banks when there is no
justification for it.</hs_para>

the point made by the noble Lord, Lord James, which was that
individuals have to apply to the banks for restitution of PPI claims
rather than the

off the hook. The banks have paid out almost £13 billion in
respect of PPI claims, which is about 70% of the total we think is
payable, and a lot more claims are in the pipeline. The concern raised
by the noble Lord in his Question relates primarily to the way in which
the detailed amounts were calculated and the extent to which
individuals can understand those calculations from the material that
they receive from the

Davies of Oldham (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Lord will
recall that in 2011 the chief executive of Barclays said that the
period of remorse and apology should now be over. Since then we have
had this scandal, described by the noble Lords, Lord James and Lord
Wrigglesworth, as breathtaking and utterly unacceptable. We have Lloyds
Bank, which is still being funded from the public purse, in the middle
of it. Since 2011, we have had the rigging of LIBOR and we have had
RBS, another publicly supported bank, handing out massive bonuses while
declaring a pre-tax loss. When are the Government really going to get
tough with the banks and make sure that the Vickers reforms are
honoured in spirit and in
practice<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T14:42:49"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

Newby:</Member></B> I think that the noble Lord must have been
somewhere else in recent months because I seem to remember spending
many days over last autumn in your Lordships’ House putting
through, under the banking reform Bill, the tougher new approval regime
for senior bankers, instituting the new criminal offence of reckless
misconduct and more generally looking at ways of vetting the
suitability of bank staff to a greater extent. The legal framework
within which the banks operate moving forward is substantially
different from that in place when this Government came into office, and
it will make it much more difficult, although not impossible, for many
of the problems we have seen in the past to recur. It will be much
easier for the regulators to take effective action if they think it is
necessary to do
so<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T14:43:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Elystan-Morgan (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, it is not for the claimant
to put his or her claim forward, but for the banks to justify the
holding of moneys to which they are in no way entitled. If the banks
know that to be the case, are they not deliberately withholding those
funds from their rightful owners? If they do not 
<?notus-xml column=4?>know, although in most cases and with few exceptions they should know,
that puts them constructively in a position of trust with regard to the

20% of trade is done online and those companies pay no

measures that we introduced were born out of listening to businesses,
and measures have been introduced that support them to grow the economy
without adding any extra burdens on other taxpayers. I make two points.
Online retailers do, of course, still pay taxes, including business
rates, on the properties that they use to facilitate their businesses.
As to the business rate system itself, as my noble friend will know, my
right honourable friend the Chancellor keeps all taxes under review. He
is certainly looking at the administration of business rates and this

have also changed the law so that local authorities are able to
introduce their own discounts, and since April this year central

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My noble friend comes to this issue
with great experience and has been a long-standing campaigner in this
regard. She raises the issue of administration charges on leases. Some
leases contain covenants for the recovery of legal costs, which is a
slightly different issue from the recovery of costs as service charges.
I understand there have been calls for the Government to consider the
feasibility of creating a provision to prevent the recovery of
administration charges, similar to the protection over service charges
already provided under Section 20C of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985.
We understand the concern that this topic provokes but, as I am sure my
noble friend will agree, we need to look at this very carefully and
consult quite widely before deciding on any action that can be taken in

some interest in a leasehold flat. The former cap of £500 on
costs has been removed, as the Minister has said, and the Church
Commissioners, of all people, recently persuaded the court that a
default judgment over service charges allowed them to forfeit a lease.
Furthermore, in another case, a landlord recovered from two pensioners
£40,000—not £500—as an administrative
charge in a dispute over service charges. Is it not time that the

the Government have already taken forward the issue of legal costs in
relation to service

for in the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985, which allows a
leaseholder to seek for those service charges—if the landlord is
claiming that—to be voided. He also raised the point about the
£500 fee. Normally in tribunal cases, we have found that parties
pay their own costs, and it is rare for costs to be awarded in the
property chamber itself. Only where the tribunal considers that a party

even to take your case to the tribunal and you have to pay further
costs all the way. Can we at least be assured that if, as the noble
Lord says, it is not possible to limit it in some cases, the costs will
not be charged to all the tenants, as is now the case, instead of just

which, interestingly, appears to be roughly evenly divided? Does he
agree that the assumption of a virtually equal division of the benefits

the US now enjoys, thanks to its access to abundant supplies of cheap

attention to TTIP, the US-EU agreement, which will indeed bring
substantial benefits. I believe that the UK is expected to gain around
£10 billion a year, which is about £400 for every family
in the UK, the US is expected to gain about £80 billion and the
EU about £100 billion, so there are very substantial gains. In

would be no certainty that any of the free trade agreements would
actually continue. While the UK is a significant economy in its own
right—and that is important—these agreements take many
years to negotiate. Even assuming that we could renegotiate them, we
would not have the leverage that the EU has, as the single largest
trading bloc in the world, to make such agreements. Therefore, I think
that it would be very difficult to replicate them, particularly within

point in raising those countries. There has been a lot of focus on the
most developed nations, 
<?notus-xml column=9?>but we also have an obligation to continue to push the economic
partnership agreements that we have been trying to make with Caribbean
and African countries. However, I would stress that there was a major
breakthrough with the WTO agreements. The WTO agreement to aid trade
facilitation is worth around £100 billion to the world economy
as a whole and the vast majority of that will go to developing nations,
which I think is to be welcomed. Certainly the UK will continue to push

that the TTIP will bring a lot of benefit to consumers. When you get a

prices will come down and consumers will have more choice, not just in
the UK or the EU but in the US as well. Certainly, we feel it is very
important—Her Majesty’s Government have done a number of
pieces of good work on this—to highlight the benefits that free

his enthusiasm for it is there, albeit that I recognise that not
everyone in the American political system feels that way. However, we

alternative energy sources in the UK, which will hopefully act to
balance some of that. With that in mind, I was delighted to see the
comments from the Prime Minister about looking for alternative energy
sources. The UK, which is already an energy producer through

Hardie (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, this amendment seeks to extend the
legislation requirements introduced by Clause 1 to all lobbyists who
are engaged in that activity on a professional basis. If the amendment
is agreed, incidental amendments will be required, but these can be
included at Third Reading. I do not intend to rehearse my observations
at Second Reading or in Committee but will set out my reasons for this

Explanatory Notes to the Bill state that the main purpose of the
provisions in the Bill on lobbying is to ensure that people know whose
interests are being represented by consultant lobbyists who make
representations to government. To that end, Clause 1 requires that
those carrying on the business of consultant lobbyists must register.
They cannot operate unless they are entered in the register.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T15:10:22"></hs_TimeCode> agree that
lobbying undertaken in an open, transparent and responsible manner is
integral to our democratic system, but it should be regulated to

any public perception that,</hs_para>

registration system proposed in the Bill will not dispel that public
perception. It is limited in scope and is confined to those businesses
above the VAT threshold which are involved in lobbying as consultants
for others. It does not apply to lobbyists employed by those firms of
consultant lobbyists, nor does it apply to national or multinational
companies or organisations which seek to exert influence on the
Government and choose to do so by using in-house
lobbyists<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T15:11:35"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T15:11:38"></hs_TimeCode>.
The public want to know who is engaged in lobbying the
Government and are not interested in whether the lobbying is undertaken
by consultants or in-house lobbyists. In short, the decision to
restrict registration to consultancies is fundamentally
flawed<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T15:11:59"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T15:11:55"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T15:11:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011310000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0001.htm#14011310000067">The
desire to include in the provisions in-house lobbyists is not academic.
They represent about 80% of the lobbying industry. Moreover, the
statutory register would replace the current voluntary register
operated by the Public Relations Consultants Association, which is the
professional body that represents United Kingdom PR consultants,
in-house communication teams and
individuals<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T15:12:31"></hs_TimeCode>.
Those who have chosen to register with PRCA include the largest
consultancies in the industry as well as the in-house teams of various
organisations. Registration in the voluntary register requires members
to update their entries about staff and clients on a quarterly basis
and to sign up to the PRCA’s code of ethical conduct, which is
supported by rigorous disciplinary
structures<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T15:13:03"></hs_TimeCode>. It
is appropriate that there should be a statutory register, assuming that
it is supported by enforceable codes of conduct—a matter to
which we may return in later
amendments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011310000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0001.htm#14011310000068">However<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T15:13:23"></hs_TimeCode>,
it is unlikely that the voluntary register will survive after the
introduction of a statutory scheme and, in any event, it might be
confusing and undesirable to have more than one register. The existing
provisions would have the effect of removing from the public domain
information that already exists about certain in-house lobbyists.
Rather than concealing such 
<?notus-xml column=13?>information, it would be more appropriate to extend it to those
lobbyists who have not already registered on a voluntary

invite your Lordships to support this amendment for a number of
reasons. First, it will increase transparency of lobbying. Secondly, it
will give the public greater confidence in the political system by
affording them greater powers of scrutiny of lobbying activity than is
offered by the Bill. Thirdly, it will ensure that they are not denied
information about the activities carried out by the vast majority of
lobbyists in this country represented by those employed by large
national and multinational companies representing the energy sector,
alcohol, tobacco and gaming industries and many other activities
affecting people’s lives. It is only right that the public can
judge the extent to which government policy has been influenced by
lobbying activities and the extent of such activities. The consequences
for the public are the same, whether lobbying is by a consultancy firm
or by in-house
lobbyists<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T15:15:07"></hs_TimeCode>.

Norton of Louth (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I will speak briefly,
simply because my Amendment 136 is grouped with the other two in this
grouping. My amendment is slightly different from the others, and
signals what we will need to do if some of the amendments we are
discussing this afternoon are not accepted. My amendment seeks to
change the title of the Bill. As it stands, it is Transparency of
Lobbying, but the Bill does not enhance transparency and it
is not actually about lobbying. It is about lobbyists; it is about
status, not about activity. There is a mismatch between the Short Title
and the Long Title. The Long Title makes clear what the Bill is about:
it is about the registration of lobbyists; it is not about transparency
of lobbying. As I say, this is really to signal later debates, but
unless the Bill is changed quite substantially, we will have to amend
the title to bring it into line with what the Bill actually
contains<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T15:16:24"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T15:16:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Campbell-Savours (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I want to speak for less
than a minute; I spoke at some length on this matter in Committee. The
Bill is deceiving the public. The public expect the matter of the
registration of lobbyists to be dealt with in this legislation.
However, Parliament is now considering a Bill which excludes the vast
majority of people in the industry. I object and I hope that the
amendment of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hardie, is accepted by
the
House.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011310000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0001.htm#14011310000072"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Hayter of Kentish Town" PimsId="5755" UID="14011310000697" xid="2032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0001.htm#14011310000697">Baroness
Hayter of Kentish Town (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I also support
Amendments 1 and 11. I hope that I will not also have to support the
amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Norton, as we hope that we
will have made the changes that will make supporting it unnecessary.
Amendment 1 also stands in the name of my noble friend Lady Royall and
myself. It is already clear that establishing a register only of
consultant firms would add nothing to the existing voluntary register.
It would omit hundreds of employers—the 
<?notus-xml column=14?>in-house, public bodies, charities and, perhaps most importantly, trade
associations—as well as more than 1,000 individuals who work in
this

have heard the Government boast about being part of the Open Government
Partnership, and Ministers say that the public should be able to see
who is lobbying Ministers. However, as we know, the Bill will not do
that. It will only tell us the companies for which, for example, Bell
Pottinger has had direct contact with a Minister over the past quarter.
It will not name the individual lobbyists concerned, nor will it
identify the company on whose behalf that meeting took place. So if a
lobbying company met a Minister, for example, on behalf of a defence
company, we still would not know that. In the hypothetical Bell
Pottinger case, it has, according to <I>Marketing Week</I>, some
900 clients; so we would only know that Bell Pottinger was
meeting somebody on behalf of one of those 900 clients but
not which one it
was<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T15:18:44"></hs_TimeCode>. If the
Minister, instead of meeting a consultant, met the actual defence
company itself, or its trade association, that would not appear on the

is very different from the United States where, we understand, Mr
Cameron’s election guru, Jim Messina, has just taken up a job

gambling. That will all be declared, but in the UK, there will be no
record of such lobbying by organisations such as the Association of
British Bookmakers, despite the public interest in knowing who is
lobbying the Government, in this case, on
gambling<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T15:19:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011310000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0001.htm#14011310000075">According
to today’s <I>Daily Mail</I>, the Chancellor took the boss of
one of the world’s biggest makers of betting machines on his

declare because it would be doing that lobbying direct. It is
interesting that the Rank Organisation discloses far more than the Bill
actually asks. It has decided to set out the spending that it makes in
its government and regulatory affairs work—for example,
£115,000 to Luther Pendragon, Ernst &amp; Young and FTI and
another £88,000 in membership fees to three trade organisations:
the Bingo Association, National Casino, and the Remote Gambling

am afraid that the Bill is rather a damp squib and, unless we amend it,

will still not have a list of their staff so that

the debate on Part 2, the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, who is not
currently in her place, warned us of the danger to our democracy of
American-style lobbyists, and indeed her autobiography, which I
recommend, draws on her wide experience of that side of the Atlantic.
She talks of the powers of lobbyists there and the extraordinary
influence of organisations such as the American Association of Retired
Persons, the National Rifle Association and the American Israel
Political Action Committee. As she and your Lordships’ House
must know, though, none of those or their UK equivalents would have to
be registered under the Bill—nor the British Insurance
Brokers’ Association; the Building Society Association; Philip
Morris; FOREST; the nuclear industry; One Hub or None, which is in
favour of Heathrow’s expansion; the CBI; the TUC; or the drinks
industry, despite 130-odd meetings with civil servants to resist
minimum unit pricing.</hs_para>

the Bill, particularly this clause, if it does nothing to shed light on
what goes on behind closed doors in Whitehall? For the sake of
democracy and good governance, we need to see who is lobbying whom and
about what. The register should cover the act of lobbying—the
status, I think the noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, said—not
the type of lobbyist, otherwise this is open to abuse. If an issue
becomes very sensitive, you can simply have the lobbyists who have been
working for an agency become directly in-house and put on the payroll
of a particular company at that time, and then none of their activity
will have to be registered. Or a small lobbyist could simply work
part-time for 10 clients and be paid directly by them, and then we
would know nothing about them.</hs_para>

the Government have made clear throughout the passage of the Bill, our
proposals for a register are designed to address the specific problem
that we have identified. One of the things that gave rise to complaints
in the media was that when consultant lobbyists were lobbying, people
did not know who their clients were. That is the issue which the Bill
addresses. It is not always clear whose interests are represented by
consultant lobbyists when they meet Ministers and Permanent
Secretaries. The context is that this Government have for the first
time made it clear to the public exactly 
<?notus-xml column=17?>who Ministers and Permanent Secretaries are meeting. The Political and
Constitutional Reform Committee’s report on the
Government’s initial proposals for a statutory register of
lobbyists made clear that identifying the problem that the register is
intended to address is critical if successful regulation is to be
achieved<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T15:28:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that there are those who consider the focus of the proposed register
too narrow—I am aware that these criticisms have been
made—we have yet to see a clear articulation of the problem that
would be addressed by expanding the scope to all so-called professional
lobbyists. The point has been made about in-house lobbyists. It is
quite clear whose interests are represented by an in-house professional
lobbyist: it is the person who employs him or her. If you are an
in-house lobbyist for the Scotch Whisky Association—I am not
sure if that association has in-house lobbyists, but let us assume that
it does—it does not take a genius to work out that if you are
lobbying a Minister or Permanent Secretary, those are the interests
that you would be representing. If you are an in-house lobbyist for one
of the utilities and you meet a Minister or Permanent Secretary, it
does not take a huge leap of the imagination to guess that you are
representing the interests of the organisation which employs you. I
cannot honestly see what is added by creating a list of people and
their employers. If I have missed the point, I am more than happy to

11 would require consultant lobbying firms to disclose the names of all
who undertake consultant lobbying activity on their behalf. The
Government do not consider that such a requirement is either necessary
or appropriate. The Bill requires the publication of the clients of
consultant lobbyists, and the existing meeting publication scheme
publishes both the persons Ministers and Permanent Secretaries meet as
well as the body or firm that employs them. Transparency of who a
consultant lobbyist is is therefore achieved on that information alone.
To require the 
<?notus-xml column=19?>disclosure of the names of every private individual who is employed by a
consultant lobbying firm would raise issues of proportionality and
justification when the disclosure of such names provides no greater
transparency, because we will know what the group, organisation or

noble friend’s amendment would revise the title of the Bill so
that it referred to the registration of consultant lobbyists rather

suggest that the provisions outlined in Part 1 of the Bill will not
enhance the transparency of lobbying. He will not be surprised to learn
that I respectfully disagree. This Government have done more than any
before to enhance the transparency of government and decision-making,
and these provisions will extend that transparency. We are the first
Government to proactively and regularly publish details about
Ministers’ and Permanent Secretaries’ meetings with
external organisations, and we do so alongside a huge amount of open
data regarding departmental spending and procurement. We are
recognised as international leaders in open government and we continue

makes, and we ought to get better at the speediness with which we make
this information available, but we will improve the access to and
presentation of those data, including by improving the consistency of
presentation and titling. We will also ensure greater consistency in
the content of departmental reporting, particularly on including the
subject of meetings. Finally, we will ensure that the gov.uk

implications of those improvements are that: rather than having to
visit a number of different sites or pages, all information will be
accessed via one easily located page of gov.uk; the consistency of
those data will be improved so that the transparency reports can be
more easily located via search functions; and the subject of the
meetings will be set out more helpfully—for example, rather than
describing them as “introductory” or
“catch-up” meetings, the detail of the meeting discussion
will be outlined. Therefore, if, for example, my right honourable
friend the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change was meeting
someone, the subject would include not just energy policy but things
such as fracking.</hs_para>

Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> My Lords, I hear the point that the
noble and learned Lord is making. As I think my noble friend indicated,
if the register is anything like the Canadian register you may have
difficulty finding out who it is. However, more importantly, the
transparency part of it comes in because of what Ministers would be
obliged to put in their scheme. There is an ethics and propriety
department in the Cabinet Office. I assure the noble and learned Lord
and your Lordships’ House that when we submit our returns that
department can get back to us. If we just put “Mr Michael
Clancy” and there is no indication of who he is, we will be
pushed to elaborate on
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T15:50:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011310000130" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0001.htm#14011310000130">The
noble Baroness said that, if a defence contractor was involved, we
would not necessarily know that. In fact, under the publication scheme,
the company’s name would have to be given. If that company was a
defence contractor and the meeting was about the provisions of the
Defence Bill that is before your Lordships’ House, such
information would be far more relevant, transparent and informative for
the public than just giving the name of an employee of that particular
company. Therefore, I ask the noble and learned Lord to consider
whether his amendment advances transparency at all, given what I have
indicated that the Government are willing to do, and whether it would
lead to considerable uncertainty. Indeed, if it took the
matter as far as the Canadian experience, it could, through an overload
of information, be even less effective in promoting the transparency
that we both wish to

Hardie:</Member></B> I am grateful to noble Lords for their
contributions to this short debate and to those who have spoken in
support of the amendment. As regards the noble and learned
Lord’s criticism that the amendment does not include a
definition of professional lobbyists, I would say two things. First, is
not that definition self-evident from the words “professional
lobbyists”? Is it not a similar situation to that of a solicitor
who is a lawyer performing legal services as either an
employer—a principal—or as an employee? Equally, is not a
professional lobbyist someone who lobbies as part of his profession as
either a principal or as an employee? As regards the noble and learned
Lord’s difficulties with the definition, what efforts have the
Government made since the very full debate we had in Committee to try
to come up with a definition? If that is a difficulty for the
Government and this amendment is carried, perhaps they could put in a
definition, although I do not think that is
necessary<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T15:49:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011310000132" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0001.htm#14011310000132"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Wallace of Tankerness" PimsId="5278" UID="14011310000726" xid="1977" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0001.htm#14011310000726">Lord
Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> The noble and learned Lord asks a
fair question. The answer is that that is not the scheme that the
Government have been following. We did not think that we needed to
produce a definition of professional lobbyists. I ask him to reflect on
the fact that if the managing director of a large drinks manufacturer
were to meet the Secretary of State on a particular issue—for
example, minimum unit pricing—I do not think that one would
consider that person to be 
<?notus-xml column=23?>a lobbyist. Why should it matter that the name of a lower-ranking
official in a company who lobbies on behalf of the company is in the
public domain but not that of the managing director, when the
information that the public want relates to the latter? I have said
that we are willing to give that information, because a Minister would
have to say that he had met the managing director of company X to
discuss minimum unit pricing. Surely that is a much better route to
transparency than putting the name of a much lower-ranking official
than the managing
director.</hs_para>

but it is not an alternative: it is not either disclosure by the
Minister or registration. The transparency arises from the combination
of the disclosure by the Minister and the registration, and the ability
of the public to cross-reference the two to see precisely on whose
behalf the lobbyist is speaking.</hs_para>

Although it currently operates the voluntary register, it sees the
benefit in having a statutory register provided that that register
covers all in-house lobbyists as well. As I said earlier, some of the
register already includes entries relating to in-house lobbyists. The
noble and learned Lord also referred to charges, but there are already
charges on the existing voluntary register. In all the circumstances, I
wish to test the opinion of the

Hardie:</Member></B> My Lords, this amendment reflects a similar
amendment to that which was debated in Committee, along with other
amendments, including an amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord
Campbell-Savours. The Bill regulates lobbying activities only where the
object of the lobbying is a Minister of the Crown, a Permanent
Secretary, a Second Permanent Secretary or a person serving in the
government offices listed in Part 3 of Schedule 1. Again, I do not
intend to repeat what I said in Committee, but it is my respectful
submission to your Lordships that the class is too restrictive, as was
observed by many noble Lords both at Second Reading and in Committee.
There seemed to be a general consensus across the Committee that the
persons listed would not be the first port of call for lobbyists, who
would probably concentrate on political advisers, Parliamentary Private
Secretaries and more junior civil servants before approaching Permanent
Secretaries, Second Permanent Secretaries and Ministers. Indeed, in the
very helpful contribution made by my noble friend Lord Armstrong of
Ilminster, who is not in his place, it appears unlikely that Permanent
Secretaries will be lobbied if the noble Lord’s own considerable
experience is taken into account.</hs_para>

would focus on the channel for reaching the Minister and that channel
would include a political adviser, a Parliamentary Private Secretary or
civil servants below the level specified in the Bill. It is clear that
the Bill will be of little effect if it confines communications to
those currently specified in it and does not focus on those people more
likely to be the object of lobbying activity. If lobbying is confined
to the more effective targets and the Minister is not directly lobbied,
there will be no requirement for registration, not even by the
restrictive category of consultant lobbyist. Such a result is contrary
to the stated desire and the desirable intention of transparency that
underpins Part 1 of the Bill.</hs_parafo>

intervention at col. 149, the number of such civil servants is
irrelevant. What is at issue is the identification of the class of
persons the lobbying of whom will require registration. That class has
to be sufficiently wide to make lobbying transparent.</hs_para>

view of the discussion in Committee, it is disappointing that the
Government have not come forward with their own amendment to improve

remedy that omission. Without this amendment, the Bill will fail in its
objective of increasing the transparency of lobbying Government. It
will further undermine public confidence in our political system

Tyler:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 3, in my name and that of my
noble friend, is grouped with the amendment just moved by the noble and
learned Lord. As has already been made very clear this afternoon, the
key issue is not the role, title or job description of the people who
take part in the activity of lobbying but the activity itself. That is
absolutely critical. I have a lot of sympathy with my noble friend Lord
Norton, who, in his usual way, has put his finger right on that point.
That is why I thought that it was extremely important to have the
statement from my noble and learned friend Lord Wallace of Tankerness a
few minutes ago about the nature, character, efficiency and accuracy of
the register of meetings with those who are taking decisions, or making
proposals to Parliament, on behalf of the
Government.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011310000142" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0001.htm#14011310000142">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T16:15:03"></hs_TimeCode>
should say in parentheses, in welcoming back my noble friend Lord
Wallace of Saltaire, that way back at Second Reading, let alone in
Committee, he expressed a lot of interest in the proposals that we were
making from these Benches about improving the status of the record of
meetings that was introduced for the first 
<?notus-xml column=28?>time—for which the Government should get credit—in the
past few years. As I said in that earlier debate, I am not so worried
about who the lobbyists are but am very worried that we know who they
lobby, what they lobby about and when. The very full statement made by
my noble and learned friend Lord Wallace of Tankerness a few minutes
ago goes a very long way to meeting that anxiety. We have made it clear
at every stage of the Bill that, for us, that is the core issue. The
proactive publication of data on ministerial meetings by the Government
makes a potentially huge difference. That is what transparency should
be all
about<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T16:12:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

important that that record should indicate when the meeting with
in-house lobbyists takes place. Whether they are the managing director
of a whisky firm, or a lowly employee of any other firm, it is the
subject matter of the meeting, when it happened and with whom that is
of considerable importance. I agree with my noble and learned friend
and I am delighted that the House agreed too, a few minutes ago, that
simply extending the register into a sort of enormous directory, like a
telephone directory, with every lobbyist in the land, whether from a
church, charity or voluntary organisation, would not really seem to be
anything more than disguising the wood for the
trees<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T16:13:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011310000144" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0001.htm#14011310000144">Amendment
3 deals very specifically, and only, with the issue of special
advisers. Many in your Lordships’ House have had enormous
responsibility in the Civil Service. What is
unusual about a special adviser is that he or she of course is not
responsible to the head of the department: he or she is not a full-time
employed member of the Civil Service, and their first loyalty and
responsibility is to the political master for whom they work. The
special adviser’s responsibility is to the Secretary of State,
or other ministerial politician, and his or her relationship is with
them. It is therefore our view that this is the one major exception
that should be tackled, either in this Bill or in some other way,
because these are special people—special advisers are, by
definition, outwith the normal hierarchy of responsibility to the
Permanent Secretary in the
department<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T16:14:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011310000145" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0001.htm#14011310000145">The
principle in the Bill is that if the consultant gains access to or
influences a Minister on behalf of a client, the public should know who
they and their clients are. However, anyone who has been in this
building for any length of time or who has lobbied knows perfectly well
that influencing a Minister does not necessarily mean seeing them
yourself. There is sometimes an even better way: to meet the
Minister’s special adviser. Spads have a rather unfair bad
reputation in the press. Many will remember Clare Short’s
description of them as living “in the dark”. I think that
was about a particularly period in the previous Government, perhaps,
and it may not be appropriate for all periods of recent history. That
epithet then led to a thought-provoking analysis of the role of special
advisers in a book of the same name by the respected academic
Dr Andrew Blick. In my limited experience of being on the
Government side of the House in the past three years and therefore
having spads in my own party, it does not feel as though many now live
in the dark. We see them all the time. They are helpful, they are
influential; in many cases persuading a spad is the first step to
persuading a Minister.</hs_para>

part of their job: to meet outside groups. It is very proper and very
effective—a proper role that they should undertake. Perhaps it
is a better one than a civil servant in the normal hierarchy. Ministers
have only a certain amount of time and sometimes it is the right
judgment to ask a senior adviser to see someone first, sound them out
and explain the Government’s thinking—there is absolutely
nothing wrong with that. However, these meetings with outside groups
are important and details of them, like the ministerial meetings which
were so fully referred to earlier, should be transparent.</hs_para>

take today to make that point in this House is to say that in this Bill
those consultants who lobby spads should have to register, just as if
they were meeting Ministers. It would then follow, of course, that
although this is outside the immediate scope of the Bill, for this to
be meaningful spads would also need to publish all their meetings with
all lobbyists, whether they be consultant lobbyists or in-house, just
as Ministers do. I very much hope that when we look in detail at the
record of meetings in future to see how these can be improved and made
even more influential and transparent, my noble friends on the Front
Bench will acknowledge that this would be an important step to
take.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011310000148" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0001.htm#14011310000148">This is
not in any way intended to malign spads or imply that anything they do
is wrong. It is the opposite. It says that what they do is useful and,
on many occasions, necessary, but keeping any aspect of it hidden feeds
a largely unnecessary suspicion that they are up to no good. I referred
at earlier stages of the Bill to the fact that two of the big lobbying
scandals in this Parliament have involved close advisers to Ministers
rather than Ministers themselves, and that resignations
resulted.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14011310000149" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0001.htm#14011310000149">For
example, the Murdoch empire recognised these facts of life very early
on. We should too. Both scandals would probably never have got to this
stage had encounters between close ministerial advisers and outside
groups been a matter of public record. It is therefore as much in the
Government’s interests as in the public interest—surely
the two should fit hand in glove anyway—for this information to
be freely available. I quoted before and I shall quote again. The Prime

Norton of Louth:</Member></B> My Lords, briefly I support the comments
of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hardie, and those of my noble
friend Lord Tyler. I also associate myself with my noble
friend’s comments about special advisers. He is absolutely
right. This Bill is flawed in two major respects. First, political
consultants rarely lobby directly. They advise clients and the clients
do the lobbying. That point was well made in the other place, not least
by those who have direct experience of the lobbying
industry.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011310000151" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0001.htm#14011310000151">The
second flaw is that when they do lobby, they rarely lobby Ministers or
Permanent Secretaries directly. We know that from the debates in this
House from those who have served as Ministers and Permanent 
<?notus-xml column=30?>Secretaries. The amendment before us goes at least some way to
addressing that second problem. The Bill remains flawed and we want to
look at that later in more fundamental respects, but at least this
amendment would try to make a bad Bill less

Williams of Crosby (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I strongly support my
noble friend’s amendment and that put forward so effectively by
the noble and learned Lord on the Cross Benches. Having been a
Minister, I want to say a few words about what in my view is the
absolutely vital importance of including special advisers in this Bill.
I would add to that the first three ranks of the Civil Service, by
which I mean under-secretary, deputy secretary and Permanent
Secretary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011310000153" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0001.htm#14011310000153">I
find it very puzzling that the specific rank of civil servant mentioned
in the Bill is that of Permanent Secretary. I can think of almost
nobody less likely to be open to exploitation by lobbyists. To be a
Permanent Secretary, you have to be somebody of outstanding integrity,
whose honour cannot be doubted, who will be respected in his or her own
department and who sets the quality and standards of that department.
You are, frankly, the last woman or man to be likely to fall for the
more dodgy approaches of some slightly dodgy lobbyists. In fact, it is
close to inconceivable that this particular person is likely to be open
to temptations of a kind that all of us would eschew.</hs_para>

the Government to include the first three levels because, as has been
very rightly said, the much more tempting position is that of people
near but not at the top. For example, I was for some years on the
Government’s Advisory Committee on Business Appointments. We
looked consistently at what the gap should be between a senior civil
servant leaving his or her department and being free to take up other
employment afterwards. Members of this House will know that certain
departments have very close links with the private sector and that,
therefore, their officials carry with them a level of expertise that is
quite exceptional. They are indeed very attractive recruits to private
business because obviously they have a great deal of experience and
knowledge.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011310000155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0001.htm#14011310000155">Generally
speaking, in the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments,
consideration is given to how wide the gap should be between leaving
one’s employment as a civil servant and joining a private
industry with which one may previously have had some kind of
relationship. It is extremely tempting, obviously, for somebody to join
a private sector business when they have a great deal of knowledge that
would be useful to that business, but the longer the gap the less
useful that knowledge may be. It is therefore strange, to say the
least, that the level of seniority in the Civil Service that makes an
individual so attractive to major industries that have close relations
with a certain department should not be covered by this Bill.</hs_para>

we should limit that practice as much as possible. I quite agree with
my noble and learned friend Lord Wallace of Tankerness, but it is no
good having what he called a laundry list or a telephone list of names.
Deputy and under-secretaries are very limited in number and
particularly attractive to those who want their expertise. I do not
doubt that both sides behave with full honour but I also think that 
<?notus-xml column=31?>lobbyists will be very attracted to people in that situation, and
therefore it would be strange if the Bill did not cover that particular
group of civil
servants.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011310000157" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0001.htm#14011310000157">When
I first became a Minister the number of special advisers was extremely
closely controlled. According to Prime Minister Wilson, the absolute
maximum number of special advisers any Minister, however senior, could
have was two. They had to be shown to be knowledgeable about the kinds
of organisations with which that Minister would interact; for example,
in my own case as Minister of State for Education and Science, it was
very clear that the special advisers I needed had to be able to show
expert knowledge and evidence of science, universities or the education
of children in schools. The two I had were both eminently well suited
in that way. But the general attitude towards special advisers was very
limited. They were experts, they were there to advise, but they were
not there to substitute.</hs_para>

over the years. There are now many more special advisers than there
were. There have been one or two worrying cases where a special adviser
has taken upon himself or herself responsibility for something that
clearly should belong to the Minister. My noble friend Lord Tyler gave
an example. Some of your Lordships may remember the famous occasion
when a special adviser told her Minister that it was a good time to
issue bad news and crises were ideal because they meant that the bad
news was hidden by the interest of the media in other issues. I do not
want to push that very far, but there are certainly a few
cases—not many—where special advisers have behaved as if
they were autonomous, and beyond what seems to be either the wishes or
the desires of the Minister concerned. Some people may remember that
the previous Prime Minister, Mr Gordon Brown, had difficulties with at
least one of his special advisers, which did not do him or his
reputation any great good, despite the fact that he is undoubtedly a
man of integrity and honour
himself.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011310000159" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0001.htm#14011310000159">Quite
straightforwardly, that means there is a very strong case indeed for
recognising that special advisers are, as the noble and learned Lord,
Lord Hardie, and my noble friend said, something of a highway to a
Minister. They are the quickest route to his personal information; they
are probably closer to him than anyone else in his department, with the
possible exception of his PPS. Often, they are also people who have
their own agendas, and those agendas may not invariably be the same as

special advisers should be held accountable. Indeed I would go further
and say that it is crucial that they should be held accountable, and
that this Bill takes congnisance of the relationship between a Minister

adviser.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011310000160" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0001.htm#14011310000160">Therefore

want to tell a story of an incident that I experienced in 1999 on a
train coming from my former constituency of Workington to London. To my
side in the carriage was the Member of Parliament for Blackpool and
opposite were two young men who were on their way to London, and we
struck up a conversation. They told us that they were going to London
to lobby in the department on the need to introduce new gambling
legislation. As Labour MPs, we had absolutely no idea that discussions
were going on in the department about gambling and gambling
legislation. That was in 1999—some 14 years ago. Those two young
men were going to meet the special adviser in the department concerned.
I was very interested and asked them how they had made contact. They
explained that they had done so at a political level, locally to start
with, and had then been referred to the special adviser. There was no
need as far as they were concerned to see Ministers.</hs_para>

that particular case, the embryo of the debate had started with access
from the industry directly to political advisers in the department. The
discussion would then permeate within the department between, as has
just been said, civil servants and the special advisers, to the
exclusion of Parliament and individual Members of Parliament. I find
that deeply troubling. One of the reasons why I want special advisers
to be included in the Bill is that I want that process to become more
transparent, so that individual Members of Parliament can at least see
what is happening 
<?notus-xml column=34?>within a department, what influences are being brought to bear and the
dangers that might arise. If those special advisers then organise
meetings between various groups and Ministers without Members of
Parliament being aware of the scale of the lobbying going on—I
know that I am making a very subtle point—it is at that point
that Members of Parliament need to know that such relationships are
being forged. That is why I strongly support the amendment proposed by
the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, and I hope that we have the opportunity to
vote on
it.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-13?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_13_PT_1/89FDFA1157779B68DA76B33C4A069A04B9E12BB5" __version__="1.8"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 13 January 2014">Monday,

current structure is indeed rather peculiar: lobbyists or lobbyist
consultants are to register themselves and report those whom they
represent, but we will find out whom they lobby only by an indirect
process of interrogating a list of external meetings of all kinds that
Ministers and Permanent Secretaries have attended. The case for this
amendment is that lobbying takes place with a much wider group of
people, which in a typical department would be about five or six
individuals. I was a Permanent Secretary for 11 years in three
departments and I do not think I ever had a conversation with a
lobbyist as defined in this Bill. The lobbying always took place with
officials who were working on the policy or were experts on the subject
or were working on a Bill
team.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011310000174" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0001.htm#14011310000174">Should

The logic of this Bill is that we extend the requirement to assemble
and publish a list of external meetings—of course, these are not
only meetings with lobbyists—to a very much wider group. In my
view, there would be a lot of dead-weight cost in this: most of those
contacts are part of the regular and desirable interchange between
government and industry. In the White Paper that launched this whole
process, it was
stated:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="14011310000203" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0001.htm#14011310000203">“The

U-turn on the question of minimum unit pricing. It was a comment from
the Minister for Public Health on the “Today” programme

on policy. The case has already been well made but I make no apology
for returning to the News International lobbyist Fred Michel, whose
case proves quite how large the loopholes in the Bill are. He was
summoned to the Leveson trial after DCMS released 164 pages of e-mails

point to the fact that the limits that the Government have put in the

In Committee I asked the Government to look at the least bureaucratic
way of extending the scope of those lobbied, but they do not seem to
have taken the opportunity to find a solution. We can provide the
Minister with two solutions. No doubt the Minister will be aware that
on the website data.gov.uk, the meetings between special advisers and
newspapers editors, proprietors and executives are already published,
so there is no convincing argument why that cannot be extended. The
other solution may have been provided by the noble Lord, Lord Norton of

details of his own meetings, publishes information about the meetings
of civil servants and special advisers in his department.</hs_para>

Royall of Blaisdon:</Member></B> I should like to raise two issues.
First, nobody is suggesting that all meetings with all civil servants
should be included—I have some sympathy with what the noble
Baroness, Lady Williams, said—only meetings with lobbyists.
Secondly, the Minister has not answered the point made earlier in
Committee, I think, or the suggestion made by the noble Lord, Lord
Norton of Louth, that when publishing details of his or her own
meetings, Ministers should also publish information about the meetings
of civil servants and special advisers in his or her department. That
seems a very unbureaucratic way of addressing the

that they are not asking to include all civil servants’ meetings
with everyone, but the amendment does say all civil servants, although
I admit that she says that it would cover any lobbyist who met civil
servants. As for Ministers’ reporting regime, we have said that
Ministers will report the people with whom they have had meetings
whether they are lobbyists or non-lobbyists. To further subdivide that
would be a considerable burden on 450,000 civil servants. I do not
believe that it would add to the transparency that we have tried to
enhance and improve by what we have already done as a Government, some
of which has been unprecedented. I think that the noble and learned

Hardie:</Member></B> I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord. The
point that I am seeking to make in this amendment is that one has to go
back to the definition in Clause 2. In the terms of that definition, it
is people who fall within the category of persons carrying on the
business of consultant lobbying who have to register under Clause 1.
Clause 2(1)(a) states that they are required to register if, in

amendment is to highlight that the narrow definition of people to whom

worthless because, as has been clear from the contributions across the
House, these people are not just lobbying Ministers. To get round that,

the noble and learned Lord is making about the requirement to register
if you are making communications with these people. It may be that that
would bring more names on to the register—I simply do not
know—but to enhance transparency, the complement to such an
extension would be the introduction of meeting reporting obligations on
these public officials. Otherwise you have a list of names of
consultant lobbyists and their clients but there is nothing there to
which you can then relate them. It becomes fully meaningful only if you
have that complementary extension of the scheme. On the amendment, I
sought to make the point that that would be a huge burden and one that
would not be consistent with efficiency in government; nor indeed would
it be proportionate to improving

very narrow point that was made by my noble friend Lady Royall of
Blaisdon. She asked a very simple question: why should a Minister, in
his or her registration, not register the activity of that
Minister’s individual political adviser? That political adviser
is working on behalf of that Minister. No doubt the noble Lord, as a
Minister, has political advisers of his own. In the event that they
meet lobbyists from outside, they are meeting them on his behalf. Why
should not he, in his registration, refer to those
meetings<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T16:55:50"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011321000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0001.htm#14011321000007"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Wallace of Tankerness" PimsId="5278" UID="14011321000973" xid="1977" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0001.htm#14011321000973">Lord

Leader of your Lordships’ House I did not have a special

although she has said that if she could get a diary secretary it might
be a bonus. We take the view, as I indicated earlier, that it is the
Ministers who are making the decisions. On that basis, we believe that
it is communications with Ministers—and not just meetings, as

is very good to take points from us all. I sympathise with the point he
makes about the scale of the increase in the number of people who would
be involved if Amendment 2 was agreed, and the potential enormous cost
as a result. However, that does not apply to Amendment 3, as has been
made clear on all sides of the House. The very specific nature of the
character, responsibility and role of special advisers—I think
the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, said that there are 98 of
them—would not require a great increase in the amount of
information to be given by government in terms of both the record of
meetings and who, as  
<?notus-xml column=40?>regards lobbyists, meets them. Can he give an undertaking that between
now and Third Reading he will look very hard—in sympathy with
the views that have been expressed on all sides of the House—at
the practicalities of including special advisers? In terms of both the
meetings they have and the nature of the people who they meet, there is
broad support right across the House for their being exceptional. They
are indeed, as their title states, special. In those circumstances I
hope that my noble friend is prepared to look again at that

to achieve policy X, that consultant lobbyist must register. If that
consultant lobbyist only lobbies the special adviser, who then advises
the Minister, who decides to implement policy X, they do not have to
register. The second point is on civil servants. Does he think that
lobbyists will lobby any passing civil servant as opposed to those

Hardie:</Member></B> I am grateful to noble Lords on all sides of the
House for their support for the amendment. I realise that the noble
Lords, Lord Tyler and Lord Turnbull, suggest that the matter should be
confined to special advisers. However, as I said in Committee, when I
was in practice at the Scottish Bar I was standing junior counsel to
the City of Edinburgh district council, and then, latterly, senior
counsel—and it was clear from my experience there that it was
not the senior director of administration or the director of planning
who was the subject of contact by people seeking to influence policy.
The contact was with the local authority officials—in this
context, the civil servants—who were concerned with the
formulation of policy. It strikes me that to exclude the very
policymakers, whether civil servants or special advisers, makes
nonsense of the registration process. I therefore beg to test the
opinion of the

4, 5 and 6 clarify, and provide greater consistency to, terminology
used in relation to the recipients of the lobbying communications and
the communications themselves. The minor amendment, Amendment 6, which
clarifies the term “Minister of the Crown”, does not, in
the context of the Bill, capture the corporate bodies of the Defence
Council and the Board of Trade. As Clause 2 makes clear, the
communications that the register is intended to capture are those that
are,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="14011321000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0001.htm#14011321000084">“made

definition in the Ministers of the Crown Act 1975 includes
the Defence Council and the Board of Trade. Both these entities,
however, are corporate bodies with which it is not possible to make
personal communications. As such, these amendments remove those bodies
from the definition and, in doing so, provide further clarity regarding
the communications that fall within the scope of consultant
lobbying.</hs_parafo>

they make lobbying communications as an employee in the course of a
business carried on by their employer. The amendment therefore
clarifies that in-house lobbyists are not captured by the Part 1
provisions, and that it is a consultant lobbying firm rather than its
employees that are required to register in respect of any lobbying
activity. As Ministers have made clear—indeed, as we have
already debated—the register is designed to address the problem
that it is not always clear whose interests are represented by
consultant lobbyists.</hs_parafo>

9 provides, first, that where an individual makes a communication in
the course of the business of another, then both the individual and
that other business or person make that communication. As such, the
amendment ensures that the client on whose behalf consultant lobbying
communications are made is always declared on the register even if that
communication is undertaken by a subcontractor that the consultant
lobbying firm has engaged. The amendment also provides that if the
individual happens to be an employee—as opposed to a contractor,
for example—then the employee is not to be regarded as making
the communication on behalf of their employer but, rather, only on
behalf of their employer’s client, reflecting the fact that
in-house lobbyists and employees of consultant lobbying firms are not
required to register.</hs_para>

18, 20 and 21 ensure consistency in the language used in the provisions
relating to the cancellation of an information notice or the variation

19 clarifies that any individual, not just employees, can commit the
offence of carrying on the business of consultant lobbying while
unregistered if they and/or their organisation are unregistered. The
amendment will remove any ambiguity as to whether the provisions apply
to individuals who undertake consultant lobbying in the course of a
business but are not employees of that consultant lobbying
business—for example, contractors. It will therefore ensure that
the application of the provisions in this respect is absolutely
clear.</hs_para>

24 has been tabled to clarify that the charges associated with
registration will be set to ensure that the sums received offset the
total costs of the registrar’s activities. Treasury guidance
requires that if a charging regime recoups costs other than those
directly associated with the service provided—in
this instance, the keeping of the register—then the
position should be made explicitly clear to Parliament. This amendment
reiterates that the charges provided for in Clause 22 will be set to
recover the total cost of the registrar’s activities, including

27 is tabled to fulfil the Government’s commitment to implement
the recommendations of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform
Committee in relation to Part 1. The Government, as ever,
are grateful to the committee for its thoughtful consideration of the
delegated powers in Part 1 and have accepted its recommendations in
relation to this part in their entirety. The amendment alters the
part to require that regulations under Clause
4(5) or Clause 5(4), the first regulations to be made under Clauses
11(3) and 17(3), and any regulation which amends or modifies the
provisions of the part, must be made by the affirmative procedure. As a
result, Parliament will be provided with the opportunity to undertake
detailed scrutiny of any regulations made under the powers in these

a democracy whose citizens enjoy universal suffrage from the age of 20.
There are elections for the President and the legislature every four

diplomatic relations with a number of countries, including the United

made clear throughout the debates on this part of the Bill, the
statutory register of consultant lobbyists is designed to address a
specific problem—that it is not always clear whose interests are
represented by consultant lobbyists. Our objective is to ensure
increased transparency without disrupting in any way the fluency of the

decisions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011321000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0002.htm#14011321000036">It
is not, nor has it been, the Government’s intention to attempt
to regulate comprehensively all those who communicate with government,

transparency groups, we have concluded that the most effective option
is to provide for a statutory link between the statutory register and
the industry-hosted voluntary codes of conduct. As such, Amendments 12,
15 and 16 will require consultant lobbyists to state in their register
entries whether or not they subscribe to a publicly available code of
conduct in relation to their lobbying activity and, if so, where a copy
of the code can be accessed. Such a provision will enhance both the
transparency and the scrutiny of registered lobbyists, and the
Government hope that the measure will therefore be welcomed.</hs_para>

Hayter of Kentish Town:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 13 stands in
my name and that of my noble friend Lady Royall. I shall also speak to
Amendments 14 and 23. This Bill should be about raising standards
within the lobbying industry, not least to provide reassurance for the
public about the behaviour of lobbyists. While we therefore welcome the
Government’s amendments, which build on the arguments that we
made in Committee—because they at least recognise the existence
of a code of conduct—it is extremely regrettable that the
Government have not gone one step further and made it a requirement for
registered lobbyists to undertake to abide by a code of
conduct<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T17:42:58"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T17:42:58"></hs_TimeCode>.
Without something which makes a code of conduct obligatory, there will
be absolutely no qualification as to who can get on to the register.
Yet once someone is on a register, they will put it on the bottom of
their headed notepaper and it will look as though there is some sort of
approval for being on that register. That, of course, will not be the
case.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011321000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0002.htm#14011321000042">I
raised this question in Committee and as a result, the noble Lord, Lord
Wallace of Saltaire, kindly wrote and clarified to me that even if
someone was convicted under the Bribery Act, that would not prohibit
them registering as a consultant lobbyist. As the noble Lord wrote in
the letter, the register is not an accreditation system and anyone on
it will not be considered to be “approved”. In other
words, regrettably, this does nothing about raising standards or
changing behaviour and nothing about giving assurance to the public
that the lobbying of their elected Government is legitimate and above
board.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011321000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0002.htm#14011321000043">Without
any such a requirement to comply with a code, it will also be
impossible to remove even the worst offenders from the
register—the “slightly dodgy” lobbyists which were
described by the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, in the earlier debate.

voluntary adherence to a code a requirement.</hs_para>

Tyler:</Member></B> My Lords, in Committee I moved an amendment to deal
with the linkage between the registration process and existing codes of
conduct in the lobbying industry. I warmly welcome the movement that
the Government have now undertaken. If I recall rightly, we were given
encouraging noises on that particular point in Committee. Therefore I
very much support Amendments 12, 15 and 16. I shall listen with

23 is, almost by definition, premature. I want to see how this works. I
do not want to put more responsibilities on the statutory register than
it can easily undertake at the outset. The noble Baroness was quite
right to talk about the future. In this particular case, we legislate
for the future when it arrives, rather than put more responsibilities
on the registrar at this stage. I will listen with interest to what my
noble and learned friend has to say about Amendments 13 and 14, to see

Campbell-Savours:</Member></B> My Lords, as I understand the present
arrangement—and I am only going by memory from what was said in
Committee—the Public Relations Consultants Association already
has a code of conduct. If it is correct that the professional
organisations may over the longer term actually wind up—and in
the period between Committee and Report we were led to believe that
this is the case—then I presume that no code of conduct will
necessarily apply. That is unless the Government introduce a model code
on the basis that my noble friend on the Front Bench has just argued
for. I asked the Minister in what circumstances an organisation that
registered would not wish to introduce a code of conduct. I presume
that during the consultation to which the Minister referred when he
moved his amendment, they made clear what those circumstances would be.
I wonder if we can be told what Ministers were told. There must be some
explanation for why they resist. If there is an
explanation—perhaps it is in the written brief or
something—maybe we could see it prior to Third Reading. I simply
cannot understand what they are objecting to, and we need to know
during the course of the debate what it
is<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T17:48:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011321000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0002.htm#14011321000048"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Hardie" PimsId="835" UID="14011321000998" xid="1255" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0002.htm#14011321000998">Lord
Hardie:</Member></B> Perhaps I can answer the noble Lord, Lord
Campbell-Savours. In the debate about the first amendment today, I
referred to how the PRCA requires people who sign up to the voluntary
register to sign up to the code of conduct, which has strong
enforcement of regulations or provisions. My point earlier was that if
that disappears and there is to be a statutory register in place, it
would be appropriate that we have something which is at least as good,
not something that detracts from the current
position.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011321000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0002.htm#14011321000049"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T17:49:33"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Wallace of Tankerness" PimsId="5278" UID="14011321000999" xid="1977" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0002.htm#14011321000999">Lord
Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> My Lords, I appreciate the welcome
given to the government amendments by the noble Baroness, Lady Hayter,
and my noble friend Lord Tyler. As I indicated, we listened carefully
to the debate in Committee. We have responded by tabling these
amendments, which will require consultant lobbyists to state in their
register entries whether they subscribe to a publicly available code of
conduct in relation to their lobbying activity and, if so, where a copy
of the code can be accessed.</hs_para>

Opposition’s amendments, spoken to by the noble Baroness, Lady
Hayter, would require that lobbyists declare on their
register entry which publicly available code of conduct they subscribe
to, implicitly requiring such a subscription in order to register. The 
<?notus-xml column=55?>Government are not persuaded that the amendment is appropriate.
Moreover, there is no provision that would require compliance with such
codes or provide for enforcement.</hs_para>

objective of the Part 1 provisions is to enhance transparency and
scrutiny. We are not seeking to regulate behaviour. The noble Baroness
mentioned the exchanges she had in Committee with my noble friend Lord
Wallace of Saltaire about lobbyists who breach the Bribery Act. Of
course, breaches of the Bribery Act are punishable by unlimited fines
and up to 10 years’ imprisonment, or both. The Government do not
consider it appropriate for a Bill to contain separate sanctions in
addition to those already included in the Bribery Act, which are
clearly very substantial indeed. It is quite proper that the Bribery
Act includes serious and proportionate sanctions but it would not be
appropriate for the transparency Bill to duplicate those sanctions. The
Government considered the option of including a penalty whereby a
person could be removed from the register but concluded that imposing a
limitless prohibition on someone conducting their profession was too
extreme a
penalty.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011321000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0002.htm#14011321000052">Requiring
lobbyists to declare whether they subscribe to a code will expose those
who do not abide by the ethical principles that are so essential to the
integrity of the industry. It is not the Government’s intention,
however, to introduce a high-regulation regime whereby the registrar is
responsible for monitoring and enforcing subscription to, and
compliance with, codes of conduct. The Opposition also suggest that the
registrar should be responsible for publishing a code of conduct. As my
noble friend indicated, that is premature. The Government’s
amendments are intended to complement the existing self-regulatory
regime, not to replace or undermine it.</hs_para>

codes and the proposed register, which it recognises will enhance the
existing self-regulatory regime. That was the feedback we got during
the consultation. I heard the noble Lord’s inquiry but I am not

the latter course is taken, the consequence is that the
person—although of course we may be talking about a
company—who is operating the business of a consultant lobbyist,
once he has been removed from the register, can no longer operate as a
consultant lobbyist. Clearly, that will have implications for not only
the business itself but its

this measure has implications for the criminal law. Clause 12 provides
that it is a criminal offence to act as a consultant lobbyist if you
are not registered: once you are removed you can no longer act as a
consultant lobbyist, but if you choose to do so it will be an offence.

if an employee of the company is not told that their registration has
been removed, he or she will be guilty of an offence. It is strict
liability; there is no statutory defence for the employee in that
situation, so the consequences for the person and for the employees are
quite significant. This decision to deregister a person is at the
instigation of the registrar, if he has reasonable grounds for
suspecting that they are no longer trading or what have you. There is
no right of appeal against that. I am suggesting that there ought to be
a right of appeal to the tribunal. There is a tribunal in existence in
terms of the provision. If the employee accepts that he or she should
be deregistered, there is no issue; but if he considers that the
registrar has made a mistake, that would enable an aggrieved employee
to have the right of appeal.</hs_parafo>

Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble and
learned Lord for his amendment. It might be helpful if in response I
indicate the Government’s thinking on sanctions and appeals.
When considering the most appropriate sanctions in respect of
non-compliance with the register, Ministers did consider the option of
removing a person from the register, thereby prohibiting them or the
company from continuing to operate as a lobbyist. We concluded,
however, that such a sanction would represent a disproportionate
penalty as it would essentially take away their livelihood. There are
very few industries where, unless one is imprisoned, one is prevented
from carrying out one’s professional activities if one has made
errors in the course of doing so, and the Government are not persuaded
that the lobbying industry should be singled out for such treatment.
The sanctions regime that we have designed is therefore a proportionate
one, designed to provide appropriate deterrent against, and punishment
for, non-compliance with the provisions of the register.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14011321000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0002.htm#14011321000066">Clause
6(6) does, however—as the noble and learned Lord has pointed
out—provide the registrar with the ability to remove a person
from the register. That provision is not drafted as a sanction, but
rather as an administrative housekeeping measure to enable the
registrar to maintain the accessibility and relevance of the register.
The registrar may, for example, wish to remove individuals who have
retired, passed away, chosen a change of career, or who work for a
company that has been wound up. The noble and learned Lord’s
amendment would enable a person to appeal against the
registrar’s decision to remove them from the register, as under
Clause
6(6).</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011321000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0002.htm#14011321000067">We
do not envisage that the registrar would remove any person from the
register unless they were confident that the person no longer engaged,
or no longer wished to engage in future, in consultant lobbying. I take
the noble and learned Lord’s point that there are potential
criminal sanctions attached to it. Obviously, as a former distinguished
Lord Advocate, he will know that there is a discretion. Indeed, Clause
12(9) indicates that proceedings for an offence under this part in
England and Wales may only be instituted by, or with the consent of,
the Director of Public Prosecutions, and in Northern by or with the
consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern
Ireland.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011321000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0002.htm#14011321000068">Therefore,
if a person was to find that they had been wrongly removed, if they
wished to object, they could immediately advise the registrar that they
were still living, or that they had not given up consultant lobbying,
and accordingly the registrar could reregister that person without the
need for an appeal and without any difficulty. If they remained
dissatisfied in spite of the fact that they could prove that they were
still living and consulting, it would be possible to judicially review
a decision, although that is very unlikely given the much simpler
course of reregistering.</hs_para>

important point is that this is not intended as a sanction or a
penalty, but rather one of administration where the company or the
individual is no longer 
<?notus-xml column=59?>believed to be performing the role of consultant lobbyist. Therefore in
those circumstances, if a person becomes aware of that and wishes to
challenge it, the best and most simple thing to do is to ask to be
reregistered rather than to go to some expense in seeking an appeal to
a tribunal.</hs_para>

Norton of Louth:</Member></B> My Lords, my amendment gets, I think, to
the heart of Part 1 of the Bill. The purported purpose of Part 1, as we
have heard, is embodied in the first three words of the title
“Transparency of Lobbying”. The problem, or rather
problems, is that Part 1 does not deliver transparency—it adds
little, if anything, to what is already known—and it is not
concerned primarily with lobbying. It covers lobbyists rather than
lobbying. It registers those who engage in the activity, or rather some
of those who engage in the activity, but does not enlighten us as to
the particular activity. We may know who some of the lobbyists are, but
not necessarily what they are doing in respect of individual measures.
As<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T18:08:23"></hs_TimeCode> has been
argued throughout the stages of this Bill it will not capture the
totality of those who are professional lobbyists. Indeed, given the
exemptions, it will catch very few. Precisely how many is a matter for
conjecture as the Government admit they do not know. The Bill
introduces a new bureaucracy for the purpose of registration but
achieves nothing substantial in terms of enhancing the transparency of
lobbying.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011326000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0002.htm#14011326000002">My
amendment is designed to ensure that the Bill does what it says on the
tin, or rather what it says in the title. It shifts the emphasis from
those who lobby to those who are lobbied. It is also comprehensive. By
requiring Ministers at the time they make a statement 
<?notus-xml column=61?>on policy or any of the matters listed in Clause 2 to publish details of
those who lobbied them on the matter, one ensures public awareness of
who has sought to influence the outcome. Any representation made to
anyone in the department would be within the scope of the provision,
thus ensuring that those lobbying are not able to avoid their activity
being made public. It would capture lobbying, whether direct to the
Minister or indirect through someone else in the department. It would
not matter whether the lobbyist was a consultant lobbyist, an in-house
lobbyist or a part-time lobbyist: all would be caught by the provisions
of the
clause<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T18:10:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011326000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0002.htm#14011326000003">The
clause therefore delivers transparency of lobbying. The principal case
for the amendment is compelling. What are the arguments against? In
Committee, the Minister argued that the objection was essentially
practical. I do not accept that; I do not think that it is impractical.
Under my amendment, transparency would be achieved through developing
existing practices. There is already the quarterly publication of
details of ministerial meetings. Ensuring publication of details of
those who have lobbied at the point of a policy statement is thus not a
paradigmatic departure from what is done already. As my noble friend
Lord Tyler explained in Committee, it is achievable. Much information
is already published, but it is a case, as he said, of being hidden in
plain sight. As he went on to
say:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="14011326000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0002.htm#14011326000085">“Indeed,
by the time that department does publish that information, the
influence that has been exerted over important legislation might have
come and gone, right through Parliament. There is simply no opportunity
to see what has happened … a simple and searchable central
database for all their meeting data would mean that we could take the
sting out of the calls, here and elsewhere, for an enormous lobbying
register. We would have immediate access”.—[<I>Official

mentioned, his office managed to draw together material from different

“Transparency of Lobbying”, when, as I have said, it does
not deliver transparency and it is not about lobbying. If the
Government are serious about delivering on what the Bill says in the

Campbell-Savours:</Member></B> My Lords, about five or six years ago, I
sat on a pre-legislative scrutiny committee dealing with the
bribery and corruption Bill. During consideration of the draft Bill,
there was a realisation within the committee that the
Government were going into the issue from completely
the wrong position. That was the view right across the
committee. I always remember the civil servants sitting at the back of
the committee wriggling in their seats as they saw their case being
destroyed along with all the work that they had done
in the production of the Bill. I tell that story
because I believe that that is precisely what would have
happened here if this Bill had gone into pre-legislative
scrutiny. If it had done so, a very different approach would have been
taken and I think that there would have been agreement on
the way forward across the House. We would not have been going down
this particular route; we would have taken the route set out by the
noble Lord, Lord Norton, in moving this amendment. His is the right
approach. The approach that the Government are taking is the wrong
approach. His solution is cheaper; it is more efficient; it provides
for a greater level of transparency; and it is what the public have
expected of Ministers in the introduction of legislation. In the end,
we will probably end up where the noble Lord is starting when we find,
particularly in the light of the previous amendment, that there are
problems in the way in which the system is operating. I know at this
late stage that we will not see a change in the minds of Ministers, but
I am really sorry that they missed a cue given by the noble Lord, Lord
Norton of Louth, when he moved his amendment in Committee and gave the
Government the opportunity of at least changing their
approach<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T18:16:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

my noble friend, I deeply regret that this Bill was not subject to
pre-legislative scrutiny. I still do not see the urgency for this Bill.
It would have been better if pre-legislative scrutiny had been
undertaken now and we could have adopted the Bill in the next Session.
Notwithstanding that, I strongly support this amendment from the noble
Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, which, as he said, would enhance
transparency. The Government have moved today in terms of improving the
reporting in ministerial diaries of when lobbying takes place, but that
is still a very narrow measure. This amendment is so clever but so
simple in that all it does is develop existing procedures. It is not
about a new bureaucratic mechanism; it is a very simple means of moving
forward. I hope that, even at this late stage, the Minister will
consider either adopting this amendment or coming back at Third Reading
with the Government’s own. That would not only hold the
Government in good stead but improve the governance of our
parliamentary system and of

Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend
Lord Norton for moving his new clause, which would require the
Government to publish alongside any statement on a matter of policy,
legislation or a contract or grant records of any oral or written
communication directed to a Minister, the Minister’s
Parliamentary Private Secretary or special adviser, and any
departmental civil servants concerned with that matter. This is an
issue in which my noble friend has long taken an interest. His

this is a simple proposition, although I certainly think it is an
intriguing one. However, at a time when we seek to ensure more
efficient and effective government, one should pause to reflect that a
statutory requirement that every oral or written communication received
by every civil servant, special adviser, Parliamentary Private
Secretary or Minister be recorded, collated and published in parallel
with any relevant statement is not as easy and simple as was perhaps
suggested.</hs_para>

only would the system impose a considerable bureaucratic burden on the
public sector but one would wish to consider whether it would lead in
turn to an information overload. Publishing information in relation to
a very small public policy statement may well have some merit, but the
volume of information that the Government would be likely to be
required to publish in relation to, let us say, the Budget, the Autumn
Statement or the Queen’s Speech could be so overwhelming that
any transparency value would be undermined by the inaccessibility and

taken exceptional steps to publicise information about decision-making,

about the Government moving towards greater provision of information.
However, I disagree with him on all the other points. I am inclined to
ask, “What price transparency?”. I am not persuaded by
the argument that, “Oh dear, this is all too much
trouble”. The body of policymakers is a relatively small number
of people who would actually be affected. The Minister seems to
envisage some great body of civil servants that would be brought within
this provision—they would not. It is doable and it is a
fundamental point of principle. We have to go down that route. Either
we are going to have transparency or we are not really going to do very
much at all as far as this Bill is concerned. This is absolutely
fundamental to Part 1 and this is the last chance we have to get it in

give some brief context to those who are new to this subject, we have
moved from Part 1 of the Bill to Part 3, which is concerned with trade
union administration. It seeks to strengthen the public supervision of
union membership records, with a duty on unions to produce a membership
audit certificate annually. Unions with more than 10,000 members would
have additionally to appoint an assurer—a new term to me in
public life—whose job would be to check the veracity of union
records. Perhaps this is a precedent, and perhaps we could do with
assurers to be appointed to check some companies’ tax affairs
from time to time.</hs_para>

is union membership being singled out? Are there are a lot of
complaints? Is there widespread public concern? Is there a lobby around
to say that there are some scandals in this area? Let us have a look at
the facts: between 2000 and 2004, the last time that any records were
taken, six complaints had been received by the certification officer,
and there has been only one since, which is current. Is there public
pressure for this intrusion into internal union affairs? No one knows
who has been asking for it because the Government have never been able
to provide any information about that.</hs_para>

be the product of a fevered imagination, convinced that it is quite
legitimate to pile a load of red tape on to unions when generally the
policy is against red tape and overregulation. In today’s
Conservative Party it does not actually seem necessary to have a reason
to make union lives more expensive and complex; it is almost a reflex
action that they wish to perform from time to time.</hs_para>

the expense and trouble that this part of the Bill is likely to cause.
The measures have only one parallel in the EU: in Malta, in connection 
<?notus-xml column=69?>with a specific circumstance of rivalry between unions, a public

only where there is a substantial public interest. Where is the

Younger of Leckie (Con):</Member></B> Before I address the amendments I
would like to say a few words about blacklisting, which was
raised by the noble Lords, Lord Monks and Lord Morris, and my noble
friend Lady Williams, because at each stage of this Bill we have sought
to emphasise how seriously this Government take any allegations of
blacklisting. The Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act
1992 makes it unlawful to refuse to employ a person because they are a
member or not a member of a trade union or because they refuse to join
or leave a trade union. This position was strengthened in 2010, when in
response to the Consulting Association blacklist uncovered in 2009, the
Government introduced anti-blacklisting regulations and increased the
penalties for unlawful processing of data. Data controllers can now be
fined up to £500,000 for serious
offences<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T18:59:40"></hs_TimeCode>. There
have been several allegations of new evidence of blacklisting to date,
but no evidence of this practice recurring. The Scottish Affairs Select
Committee and Information Commissioner are both currently investigating
the potential for ongoing offences, and the Government continue to take
a close interest in this issue. Therefore, the provisions that we are
considering today do not increase the risk of blacklisting, because of
the protections in place around the treatment of membership
data<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T19:00:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="14011326000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0002.htm#14011326000095">7

assurance that the confidentiality of union membership data will be
protected. That is entirely understandable. Information about who is a
union member is sensitive, as the noble Lords, Lord Monks and Lord
Morris, have already eloquently pointed out, and it is right that it
should be protected. However, existing data protection rules are
sufficient for those purposes. I hope to be able to explain how the
data will be protected and to reassure noble Lords that their concerns
are
unfounded<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T19:00:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011326000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0002.htm#14011326000045">I
will begin by speaking to Amendments 28A, 28B and 28C, which are all
concerned with the protections around the way the assurer handles
membership data. Amendment 28A would place on the assurer a duty of
confidentiality to the union and its members, and would require the
assurer to comply with the union’s obligations in the Data
Protection Act. Amendment 28B would prevent the appointment
or reappointment of an assurer in the case of a breach of the
union’s confidentiality, of its statutory duties or of its terms
of appointment, or where there are reasonable circumstances not to
appoint. Amendment 28C states that the assurer must comply with the
Data Protection Act. Amendment 28D seeks to prevent the disclosure of
member data in any circumstances, except with their consent or where
required as part of criminal
proceedings<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T19:01:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

those amendments is already achieved by the Bill and the application of
the Data Protection Act. I will explain that. The Bill explicitly
states that the assurer will owe a duty of confidentiality to the
union, which will be incorporated into the assurer’s
appointment. Breach of that duty would mean that the union would have a
remedy for breach of contract. The union may also choose, if it wishes,
to include additional protections as part of its contract with the
assurer. In addition, the assurer must comply with the Data Protection
Act, because in performing their statutory functions they will be a
data controller. Should the assurer breach data protection rules, the
union may engage the Information Commissioner, who enforces the Data
Protection Act. The Information Commissioner has a range of powers at
his disposal, including imposing a fine of up to £500,000.
Finally, the assurer is prohibited in the Bill from disclosing member
data unless in specific permitted circumstances. Noble Lords also
raised the issue of whether an assurer who breaches their obligations
should be prevented from reappointment. I am happy to confirm that that
is entirely within the control of the union. The Secretary of State
will set out in an order who is qualified to be an assurer, but who the
union chooses from that list is entirely at its discretion. If, for any
reason, the union has doubts about the assurer’s suitability,
including their handling of sensitive member data, it can pass a
resolution to remove the assurer on agreement of the
members<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T19:03:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011326000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0002.htm#14011326000047">On
Amendment 28D, the intention seems to be to prevent the disclosure of
member data in any circumstances except with member consent or where
required as part of criminal proceedings. That would in practice
prohibit a certification officer, inspector or assurer having the
necessary access to the register, as they would be unable to identify
the member in order to seek their consent. It would defeat the
Government’s policy intention of giving assurance of union
compliance with the duties to maintain a membership
register<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T19:03:53"></hs_TimeCode>. We
believe that this amendment is unnecessary. The existing contractual
and statutory arrangements surrounding use of membership data will be
sufficient to ensure that membership data are protected.</hs_para>

explained the protections with regard to the assurer and will now say
something about the protections with regard to the treatment of
membership data by the certification officer and the inspector. As part
of that I will therefore deal with Amendments 31, 31A and
32<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T19:04:23"></hs_TimeCode>. Amendment 31
would remove the explicit statement that the certification officer may
require an explanation of documents from the assurer. In practice, that
may interfere with the effective application of the new enforcement
regime. It may be important for the certification officer to engage
with the assurer in a particular case in order to make an informed
assessment of a union’s compliance with Section 24 of TULRCA.
Amendment 31A deals with the appointed inspector and seems intended to
ensure that there are appropriate protections to ensure that they
handle sensitive membership data properly. I reassure noble Lords that
a range of safeguards are already in place to achieve that. That
includes, for example, that first of all, the certification officer
will have discretion to appoint an inspector as he does currently for
inspectors of a 
<?notus-xml column=75?>union’s financial affairs. It will be for the certification
officer to ensure that he appoints someone capable of fulfilling their
responsibilities. Secondly, the inspector will owe a duty of
confidentiality to the certification officer. Should the inspector
breach that duty, it will be for the certification officer to decide
the appropriate remedy, considering the circumstances and severity of
the breach. A third party appointed as an inspector is likely to be
someone in a professional firm. It would seem unnecessarily restrictive
to require that the certification officer could never appoint that firm
again, no matter what had happened to the individual concerned. A
further example is that if the appointed inspector—or any other
individual, for that matter—has breached data protection rules,
they will be liable to the Information Commissioner taking action,
including imposing a fine of up to
£500,000<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T19:06:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

intention of Amendment 32 is to obtain explicit, cast-iron assurance
that sensitive union member data will be adequately protected under the
new investigatory powers introduced by the Bill. The amendment intends
to prohibit the disclosure of data to third parties, but there is
already provision in law to prevent the disclosure of documents to
third parties, except as necessary for the performance of functions set
out in the Bill, where the member consents or, of course, for criminal
proceedings. In any event, as I have already explained, member data
will be well protected by both existing and new legal safeguards. The
assurer will owe a contractual duty of confidentiality to the union, as
stipulated in the Bill. The Data Protection Act will also continue to
apply whenever the assurer, certification officer or inspector handle
union membership data, because in doing so they will be data
controllers. Furthermore, the certification officer is obliged to act
in concordance with the European Convention on Human Rights, which
includes the individual’s right to privacy. We are confident
that the certification officer is well placed to deal with sensitive
data, and I can reassure noble Lords that the Government will not have
access to member data through those
provisions<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T19:07:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

changes the heading to new Section 24B. We do not think that that would
have a substantive effect, but have assumed that the intention is that
provisions relating to the appointment of the assurer would not be
enforceable. We will come to the role of the assurer in the next group
of amendments, but it is key to the achievement of the
Government’s policy
objective<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T19:08:02"></hs_TimeCode>. I
understand the desire to ensure that the Bill poses no risk to the
confidentiality of union membership, and I have been listening this
afternoon. I am sure that there are adequate safeguards in current data
protection legislation and introduced by the Bill, to ensure that not
only the assurer but also the certification officer and the
certification officer’s inspector properly protect the
confidentiality of union member

noble Lord, Lord Monks, questioned why the legislation is needed,
because the certification officer has had only a limited number of
complaints. However, the current statute does not automatically provide
assurance that the register is up to date for all members. The
certification officer can investigate only in response to a complaint,
and then only, as I mentioned in 
<?notus-xml column=76?>Committee, in response to a complaint from a union member. Not all
members will be proactive about checking the register. A member who
checks it may not see the register in its entirety. In any case, they
cannot know whether the names and addresses of other members are
accurate. Members cannot tell whether the register is accurate in
recording all new joiners and leavers. We believe that those measures
are an appropriate way to give greater confidence to union members and,
importantly, to the public, so that unions know who their members are
and can contact
them<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T19:09:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011326000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0002.htm#14011326000052">The
noble Lord, Lord Martin of Springburn, raised concerns because there
has been some misuse of sensitive data by some public authorities. I
assure him that the certification officer is subject to duties under
the Human Rights Act 1998 to comply with the European Convention on
Human Rights, including a person’s right to his private and
family life and his correspondence. We are confident that the
certification officer is well placed to deal with sensitive data. One

noble Lord, Lord Morris of Handsworth, stated that unions were more
harshly regulated than other organisations. Noble Lords are sometimes
fond of drawing analogies between trade unions and other membership
organisations, but trade unions are unique in both purpose and design.
They are explicitly defined by legislation, and in practice regulation
is tailored to each type of organisation, to fit its role and function.
Again, we believe that these measures are appropriate to the function
of trade unions. I therefore ask noble Lords not to press their

going to be busying themselves around the union world. There is quite a
cast list of people for unions to deal with. First there is the
certification officer, whom they are used to dealing with, but now he
has extra powers. Then there is the new assurer, who is unique in
British public life. Nobody else has an assurer. No political party has
an assurer. Do we have assurers to check the electoral roles in some
inner city areas? Of course we do not. People do their best, and we get

that it will all have passed through the hands of the certification

of the problems with this debate is that the Committee stage was

in this particular issue. This is perhaps the best attended debate that
we have had. I hope that people who are listening with an open

Whitty (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 29 would deal with the
problem that was alluded to in the previous debate. A number of my
noble friends referred to the new office of assurer and queried why we
needed it, what exactly the role of the officeholder would be and
suggested that it was an additional level of red tape and bureaucracy
for trade union administration. In replying to the previous debate, the
Minister did not address this point but rather sought to reassure the
House in relation to confidentiality. However, in seeking to leave out
Clause 37, my amendment suggests that there is no point whatever in
inventing this new role. The oversight of trade union administration is
clearly in the hands of the certification officer, and has been so for
many
years<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011326000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0002.htm#14011326000061">The
Government may feel that the certification officer needs new
powers—they are contained in the Bill to a limited
extent—or that he needs new resources to carry out his job, but
the relevant apparatus for doing that is already in place. They have
invented a new officer without defining that officer’s
qualifications, which will be defined in technical regulations at a
later stage. The Minister referred to a list from which
trade unions could choose but, presumably, the list is drawn up by the
Government. The House does not have before it the qualifications that
are required for someone to be on the list, the details of how you get
on to it or what professional standards the assurer should
meet<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011326000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0002.htm#14011326000062">As
my noble friend Lord Lea asked, why is no other body in society having
an assurer imposed upon it? No reason has been given for that by the
Minister so far; perhaps he will do so when he replies to this debate.
The only reason given in the impact assessment for not moving entirely
down this road is because, as he says, assurers are an important part
of society and the public and union members need to be assured that
their membership records are in order. As far as the rest of society is
concerned—I include in that employers and the
Government—clearly the membership records of a union are most
important at times of possible industrial strife. The list of members
taking part in a ballot on a potential industrial dispute must accord
with the union membership covered by the issue under dispute. There are
reams of case law in that area, so the assurer has not been invented in
order to monitor strike ballots more rigorously as that issue is
already
covered<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011326000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0002.htm#14011326000063">The
full union membership list, excluding members’ personal details,
is an important document when union elections are held. We need to
ensure that internal elections are proper and fair, that members who
are given a vote in those elections have the right to vote in them and
that everybody who falls into that category has a vote. However, that
issue is also covered in 
<?notus-xml column=81?>existing legislation and there are already complaint mechanisms and
potentially draconian sanctions for a union which breaches those rules.
Therefore, I see no reason to invent another
officer<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011326000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0002.htm#14011326000064">Unions,
through their own rules and through legislation more generally, are
already required to audit their financial records. A significant part
of those financial records comprises the receipt of membership dues and
the recording of those receipts. The auditor of a trade union already
has to do that. The oversight of that process is already there with the
certification officer, who has substantial powers to
intervene<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T19:29:57"></hs_TimeCode>. Where
in this does the assurer rest? He is not an auditor, a lawyer or an
officer of the certification office. No standards of professional
attainment exist for such a creature. In the previous debate, the
Minister failed to reply to my noble friends Lord Lea and Lord Morris
of Handsworth as to why such a person was

29 deletes the whole reference to the assurer. There would have to be
other consequential amendments but the simplest and cleanest way to
deal with it is to delete the whole of Clause 37. The other toughening
up of the requirements on unions to keep a membership list is there,
and the powers of the certification officer would remain. However, the
role of this specious, unnecessary and, to use a House of Lords’
term, otiose officer is not spelt out in anything that the Minister has
yet said or in any of the documentation that we have received. I
therefore think that it would be more sensible for the Government,
instead of engaging in the creation of more layers of red tape in this
area, just to drop the idea of this new level of bureaucracy and to let
the existing requirements and the existing regulator perform their
jobs—if necessary, to tighter standards than they previously
consider that they have done. To do so probably would require the
certification officer to have more resources, which I am sure the
Government have in mind, but it would be cheaper to give those
resources to the certification officer than to invent a whole new and
unnecessary profession. I therefore hope that the Government could
either give us more cogent reasons than they have so far given as to
why the assurer has been invented or that they will take the issue away

other amendment in this group basically deals with the powers of the
certification officer and when they require documentation from the

“if” the certification officer considers it necessary
after receipt of a complaint. Otherwise, it is a very open-ended power
to require a lot of very delicate documentation. The trigger for
requiring that additional documentation needs to be the receipt of a

do with red tape. My noble friend Lord Monks reminded us that, not only
because of Christmas and the new year but also because of the pause, we
are between Parts 1 and 2 of the Bill, and now are dealing with Part 3.
It is all rather confusing. There is overkill of all these
lists of people who have some sort of role. We mentioned the electoral
roll and how 80% might be up to date. I think that 50% would be a very
good score for a candidate examined on this set-up even when it has
been a year in use. It is quite remarkable. I will not go through the

times to be to cut out red tape. If this is not red tape, what is it?

25% turnover in membership could theoretically be entirely out of date

something like that. That is where I suggest the figure of 80% comes
from; there is always churn going on. There is then a huge leap of
logic, and the word “proportionate” in this context
strikes me as astonishing. It is straight out of <I>Alice in

what we have described as the problem with churn, how can they make it

simply to look at the bigger picture in relation to unions. The noble
Lord, Lord Lea, needs to be reminded that unions with 10,000 members or
fewer will be self-certificating. We are looking at those unions who
have large membership lists. Many colleagues of the noble
Lord—certainly in Committee—acknowledged that it is a
challenge to keep membership lists up to date. This is why—in a

believe that the membership audit certificate will be credible for
larger unions only if it is independent, and this is because larger
unions often represent workers across a range of different job types
and employers. They have complicated branch structures—I am sure
that the noble Lord, Lord Lea, would agree with that. They often have
different IT systems and there may be greater time delays for updating
information. A union official or rep would not, therefore, have the
same credibility as an independent expert in assuring that the systems
used across the entire union are fit for purpose. This is the essence

37 requires trade unions with more than 10,000 members to appoint a

assurer, the union’s system—and please note this word

register is satisfactory to comply with the duties in Section 24. This
is analogous with the regime in place for financial reporting, where
all unions are required to appoint an independent auditor to approve
their accounts. An assurer has the right to access the membership
register and other relevant documents at all reasonable times, and to
require information and explanations from the union. This is necessary
for the assurers to be able to meet their duties and carry out their
functions. However, as I mentioned in a previous debate, they will be

37 also provides an order-making power for the Secretary of State to
set out who is qualified to be an assurer. A person is not qualified if
their independence is questionable, or if the union believes that they
would not carry out their duties competently. An officer or employee of
a union, or their partners or employers, may not perform the role of
assurer for that union. In order to carry out their duties, the assurer
is likely to want to understand how records are compiled and
maintained. This could include looking at whether the union has
mechanisms in place to ensure that it collects and records data
accurately from new members, reminds members to keep their addresses up
to date, and updates the register promptly once changes are notified.
Unions will set out in their individual rules the provisions for
appointing and removing an assurer, although certain provisions will
have effect, notwithstanding this flexibility. The union retains
ultimate control, however, because it can always remove an assurer from
office by passing a resolution. As I have explained, Clause 37 is
crucial to the credibility and effectiveness of the reporting regime
introduced by the Bill in order to demonstrate the unions’
compliance with their existing duty to maintain an up-to-date register

30. This would alter Clause 38 to make the certification

the amendment is difficult to follow, as there is no explanation of
what would constitute such a complaint. The intended change seeks to
undermine the key policy objective of Part 3 of the Bill, which is to
give union members, employers and the public greater assurance that
unions are complying with their existing duties to keep an up-to-date

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> It is certainly not to confuse, my
Lords. As I explained, the role of the assurer is to provide that
element of credibility which is not there at present. The assurer will
also be working closely with the union and a contract will be drawn up
with the union, notwithstanding the core powers that the assurer must
have. That is why we believe this is necessary, in particular for the
larger unions with 10,000 members and
above.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011332000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0002.htm#14011332000018">The
current statute does not provide an assurance of the union’s
compliance as there is no sufficient enforcement mechanism. The Bill
addresses this shortcoming by allowing the certification officer to
investigate instances of possible non-compliance where there is good
reason to do so. The certification officer will require access to the
register and other relevant documents in order to determine whether a
union is diligent in maintaining a register that is up to date so far
as is reasonably practicable. The current system relies on individual
members making formal complaints to the certification officer before he
can investigate. As members can have no way of knowing the state of the
register as a whole, the route for the certification officer to
determine whether a union is compliant with its statutory obligations
is not that effective to ensure that the existing duties are complied
with. There may be a good reason for the certification officer to
investigate a union’s compliance with the overarching duties
even in the absence of a complaint including, for example, where a
membership audit certificate has not been provided by the union or it
is unsatisfactory.</hs_para>

problem, and this is an important point to make bearing in mind the
comments that were made earlier by the noble Lords, Lord Whitty and
Lord Monks. The access to and handling of union data is a concern that
has occupied a great deal of time and debate. The Government understand
the sensitivity of union membership data and agree with the importance
of protecting them. However, for the reasons discussed at length
previously, I reassure noble Lords that this amendment is unnecessary.
Membership data will be well protected by both the existing and new
legal safeguards. The assurer will owe a contractual 
<?notus-xml column=87?>duty of confidentiality to the union as set out in the Bill. The
assurer, the certification officer and the inspector will be subject to
the obligations of the Data Protection Act whenever they handle union
membership data. Furthermore, the certification officer is obliged to

policy objective. However, it is not clear to me what the policy
objective of the whole of Part 3 is, and in particular the invention of
this new category of assurer. I am glad that there is to be a
consultation on it, but I do not see that anything is likely to emerge
at the end of that consultation which could not be written into the
terms of the annual audited return from the trade unions, whereby the
external auditor would be required to certify that their membership
system complied with the requirements. Why we have to invent a whole
new structure is creating grave suspicion among the unions. The whole
of Part 3 is very difficult to understand, but its effect will be a
significant cost on union administration. The creation of an
intermediate level between them and the certification officer is bound
to increase distrust, and there is a suspicion that the

not about tightening up on strike ballots. It is not about assurances

the likelihood of conflict between them and their regulator. I do not
think that that is in the interests of trade union members and I 
<?notus-xml column=88?>cannot see that it is in the interests of wider society. The suspicion
therefore has to be that other sinister motives are involved
here—that the Government wish to impose someone right in the
heart of the administration of the trade unions, someone employed or
contracted theoretically by the trade unions but who is actually a
different type of person. I do not want to go too far down the paranoid

say that I am still in a state of some mystery about exactly what it is
supposed to do, other than give trade unions a provocative prod, and it
is certainly doing that. For the Government to act in this way without
any clear justification for doing so other than through some sense of
confidence and assurance—for whom, I am not sure—is a

through the speeches and points that have been made already. This
amendment seeks to ease the regulatory burden by extending the period
before the Act is brought into force. The Minister has learnt about
union administrative procedures. To change the rules, which would have
to be done to allow the assurer access to this kind of information, is
a time-consuming, complicated and expensive prospect. The kind of costs
we are talking about are those for a union with, say, 1 million members
that holds a rules revision conference every two or three years of
1,000 delegates. If, because of the timing, a union has to 
<?notus-xml column=89?>hold a special conference, that will cost another £500,000. The
Government’s estimate that the cost to unions collectively will
be around £460,000 pales into insignificance against the costs
of union conferences and
administration<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T19:59:24"></hs_TimeCode>.

emphasise that there does not seem to be any great urgency about the

There are no current, or indeed historical, problems screaming for

would very much help unions, which would obviously have to comply with
the law, if they had adequate time to prepare the necessary changes to
their rules without the need to have special conferences and rules
revision processes that are exceptional rather than in their mainstream
work. It would be cost effective, economical and practical, and would
minimise some—not enough but at least some—of the red
tape that has been dolloped on the administrations of trade unions.

digestion that avoids unnecessary costs and administrative

and finally, no doubt the Government and the certification officer will

Stevenson of Balmacara:</Member></B> My Lords, I have never in my long
life met a Conservative member of a trade union. It is very nice to be
introduced to one and to hear him speak. It has been very evident from
the speeches we have heard, both in this small debate and previously,
that if the Bill is to progress and be brought into law it must operate
with the best chance of 
<?notus-xml column=91?>success otherwise it will not have been worth a candle doing it. As my
noble friend Lord Monks said in an earlier intervention, the right way
to do this is to give the unions—particularly the larger
unions—adequate time to comply with the Act in a way that is
cost effective, economical and practical, but also from their point of
view. Unions are, after all, independent self-governing bodies. As the
noble Lord, Lord Balfe, said, they rightly have procedures for making
complex changes in their constitutions and it will be necessary, as the
Bill recognises, that the unions will make some changes through rules
conferences and the like. This is not to say in any sense that there is
not anything wrong with what is currently in the Bill, but I detect in
some of the comments made that we are still not absolutely clear about
how the procedures will operate and the timescales that will be on and
that will interfere a little bit with
transparency.</hs_para>

up on what has just been said, I get to 17 months from the comments

that a union whose reporting year ends on a fiscal basis—that
is, 31 March—would not need to submit a report for the year
ending 31 March until the end of August 2015, which I think is
17 months if I do my maths correctly. However, a union that
reports on a calendar-year basis would have a little more time. It
would not have to submit its report for the year ending 31 December
2015 until the end of May 2016.</hs_parafo>

to be both defined and appointed, that suggests that it would be
sensible to have one further round of discussions before it is
finalised. Will the Minister consider having a short meeting with me
and a few colleagues to try to run over this so that we can get some
absolute clarity on it? Thereafter, we can all work together, not in

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 33A
could delay commencement of the provisions in Part 3, as they would not
come into effect until the certification officer knows that all trade
unions with more than 10,000 members have changed their rules to
provide for the appointment and removal of an assurer. I know that
noble Lords have been concerned that unions should have sufficient time
to prepare for these new arrangements. In particular, we have been told
that many unions do not routinely have an opportunity to make rule
changes—I think the 
<?notus-xml column=92?>noble Lord, Lord Monks, alluded to that earlier. I am happy to offer
reassurance to the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, and other noble Lords
that unions will have the time that they need. They will have at least
17 months to comply from the point at which the legislation
takes effect, because the provisions will not apply
retrospectively.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011332000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0002.htm#14011332000040">Unions<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T20:16:26"></hs_TimeCode>
will be required to submit a membership audit certificate alongside
their annual return for the first full reporting year after the changes
become law. The 17 months is the combination of the 12-month reporting
period plus the five months that is allowed after that period to submit
the annual return. The earliest that the provisions will take effect is
October this year, which would depend on Parliament granting Royal
Assent next month. That being the case, unions would have a minimum of
25 months from Royal Assent. In practice, many unions will have much
longer.</hs_para>

the legislation to take effect in October 2014, a union with a calendar

the most straightforward of timetables to set out and I would be very
happy to meet the noble Lords, Lord Stevenson and Lord Monks, and any
other noble Lords to clarify the timings and state why we think this

take this opportunity to warmly welcome the noble Lord, Lord Balfe, and
the experience that he brings on union matters, something I mentioned
earlier in respect of the noble Lord, Lord Monks; it is only fair to
acknowledge the experience that the noble Lord, Lord Balfe, has as
well. I have had some discussions with him, at his request, on the
question of whether the £10,000 threshold is set at the right
level. Our primary objective is to supply assurance to union members,
and to the wider public, about the existing statutory requirement to
maintain an up-to-date register of members. The requirement to maintain
a register applies to all unions, no matter what size. However, at the
same time, the Government do not want to unnecessarily prohibit the
creation of trade unions or undermine their ability to operate. We
believe that it is possible for a union to be confident in the accuracy
of all its records where its membership is small. We also believe that
the wider public will think it reasonable that special provision is
made for the smaller union and accept that where numbers are smaller it
is reasonable to rely on the union’s own
assessment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011332000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0002.htm#14011332000043">Self<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T20:16:26"></hs_TimeCode>-certification
means a union officer assuring that every individual record is up to
date, so far as is reasonably practicable. We think that this is
achievable for unions with 10,000 members or fewer, but it becomes much
more challenging where there are more members than that, which was part
of the debate that we had 
<?notus-xml column=93?>earlier. The union official would have to be confident of the position
and union members and the wider public would have to have trust that
this was reasonable—a point, again, that I made earlier. By
contrast, independent assurance focuses on whether the system in place
for monitoring records is satisfactory, as opposed to making a
statement about the accuracy of individual records. I therefore believe
that this amendment is unnecessary and I ask the noble Lord to withdraw

on the Bill. This is a consolidation Bill which brings together and
modernises the law relating to co-operatives and community benefit
societies, and other societies registered or treated as registered
under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965, with amendments
to give effect to recommendations of the Law Commission and the
Scottish Law
Commission.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011332000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0002.htm#14011332000047">As
a consolidation Bill, the Bill aims to remove ambiguities but does not
seek to introduce any new policy or make substantial changes to law. It
is still, however, an important step in reducing legal
complexity for new and existing societies. In
January 2012, the Prime Minister announced that, in support of the
co-operative movement, the legislation dealing
with co-operatives and other mutual societies would be
consolidated into one co-operatives Bill. This Bill represents the
Government’s delivery of that commitment.</hs_para>

their clear importance to the diversity and strength of the UK economy,

of the Government’s continued efforts to simplify and modernise
legislation, the Law Commissions made a number of recommendations for
modifications which have been incorporated into the Bill. For example,
the language regarding the conditions for registration as a community
benefit society has proved problematic. The Bill now clarifies this
position and provides that a society may be registered as a community
benefit society only if it is shown to the Financial Conduct
Authority’s satisfaction that the society’s business is
being, or is intended to be, conducted for the benefit of the
community.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011332000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0002.htm#14011332000050">The
Law Commissions also identified areas where some of the language used
in the legislation was unnecessarily complicated. For example, there is
no reason to distinguish between documents in electronic format and
those in other forms. The approach has been harmonised in the Bill,
with relevant sections applying to all of a society’s business
correspondence and other business documentation in any form. The Bill
has been warmly welcomed by sector trade bodies, particularly
Co-operatives

modernise industrial and provident society legislation by commencing
various sections of the Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies

package of measures in support of co-operative societies through
secondary legislation, and the consolidation Bill takes account of
these measures. These are due to come into force in August 2014 and
are: first, increasing the cap on the amount of withdrawable share
capital that an individual can put into a society, which will increase
from £20,000 to £100,000; secondly, allowing for troubled

to which the FCA will prioritise looking at IPSs. The FCA is committed
to maintaining the registration requirements of being a bona fide
co-operative or community benefit society. One of the measures that the
Government will bring forward will give the FCA additional powers to
investigate these societies for irregular activities, as well as
disqualifying directors where appropriate. There has been a long-held
view that the FSA has devoted very little attention to this sector, but
there is a logic in the regulators putting in more effort to make sure
that, as the sector grows both in size and prominence, it is

a sector which the FCA certainly cannot afford to ignore.</hs_para>

noble Lord, Lord Tunnicliffe, very kindly welcomed the Bill. One
advantage of consolidation Bills is that if you do attempt to read
them, the first parts—until it gets into the
schedules—are often a much better read than what preceded them.
This is a consolidation Bill albeit with the Law Commission’s
drafting amendments to clarify various ambiguities. Why, he asks, are
we consolidating in this area rather than in a lot of others? We have
been very keen as a Government to simplify and develop the law in this
area. It has been a bit of a patchwork quilt. There has been a long
tradition that mutuals legislation is introduced as private
Member’s legislation, and more than with other types of
legislation, little pockets of provision have developed over the
decades. As the sector grew, however, it needed legislation that was
commensurate to its new
status.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011332000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0003.htm#14011332000074">There
will be other consolidation Bills in due course. The challenge is, as
much as anything else, around resources. Sadly, this Government are no
less keen than their predecessor to produce a large volume of
legislation; and sadly, from the parliamentary counsel’s point
of view, there are limited resources. The other challenge, as always,
is to consolidate at a time when there are often new changes which are
sometimes difficult to provide for legislatively. However, the whole
process of consolidation is an important one in terms of keeping the
law up to date and useable. The Government are committed to maintaining
that
approach.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011332000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-0003.htm#14011332000075">I am

before I speak directly to the subject of the amendment tabled in my

debate last Wednesday while we were still considering amendments to
Clause 24 and Schedule 14. I will start by acknowledging the
points made in Wednesday’s debate about the need to ensure that
statutory mechanisms to amend schemes are used with care. We have not

sets out the key limits on the scope of the changes under the override,
but much of the detail that deals with this, including how the extent
of the changes is limited, will be set out in the technical regulations
that we have been working on with trustees, scheme managers, the
actuary profession and pension lawyers. We intend the regulations to
set out a methodology and the assumptions that will apply to the
calculation of the lost rebate.</hs_para>

out in the same way how the impact of changes to scheme rules are to be

recovering more than the lost national insurance rebate. We will of

laid. As I said in my letter to

that we do not see use of the override as a default position for
employers. We expect the override to be used by employers only as a
fall-back position where they need to offset the costs resulting from
the end of contracting out and have no options available other than
closing the scheme. As several Lords pointed out, there are
long-standing and established ways in which employers work with
trustees to make changes to schemes when required. The noble Lord, Lord
Browne, when paraphrasing the Pensions Minister, said:</hs_para>

told us that without the override, some of them will have few or no
options available to them because such agreement cannot be reached or
because scheme rules will not allow it. They tell us that this will
force them to close their schemes. Some trustees have told us that
without the override, they will find it difficult to agree changes. We
therefore believe that the override is necessary to avoid schemes being
closed, even though we believe that in most cases employers and
trustees will be able to explore other options. As employers and
trustees can be expected to discuss scheme changes as a matter of
routine, and as it is in their interests to do so, we do not believe
that those discussions would be facilitated by overlaying legislative
requirements concerning the content and time limits of consultation.
That is why we have not provided for
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401139000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#1401139000008">The noble
Lord, Lord Browne, also asked whether the changes had been discussed
with employers and, especially, small businesses concerning the impact
of the increases to national insurance that they and employees will
have to pay on the ending of contracting out. In particular, what would
be the impact of large numbers of employees leaving schemes because of
the increases in contributions? During the development of our policy we
have engaged with a large range of employers, including the British
Chambers of Commerce and the Federation of Small Businesses. Small
businesses expressed no particular concern on the ending of contracting
out. When we consult on our regulations, we will of course ensure that
we gather views from employers of all
sizes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401139000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#1401139000009">I turn
now to scheme members. Notwithstanding the potential for increased
contributions, members of defined benefit schemes will continue to get
good-quality pension provision. Our expectation is that members, as
demonstrated by the low opt-out rates with automatic enrolment, will
choose to remain in their schemes. Our communications strategy will
seek to ensure that both employers and employees are properly supported
through this change and that both parties understand why the changes
are taking place and what options and outcomes are available to
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401139000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#1401139000010">As to
whether the override regulations should follow the negative procedure,
I recognise the desire of the Committee to ensure proper scrutiny of
the regulations. There is just over two years until the end of
contracting 
<?notus-xml column=3?>out. To ensure that employers have adequate time to consult with
actuaries, trustees and members about any potential changes,
regulations need to be finalised as soon as possible. We are working
hard to complete the regulations. However, these are complex provisions
that require us to have extensive discussions with employers and
trustees during and after a consultation period before we can get them

concern is that, with the affirmative procedure, we would not be able
to secure time for a debate in both Houses before the Summer Recess.
This would potentially delay the point at which employers can start to
plan with confidence until October this year, just 18 months before
contracting out ends. So, while recognising that the negative procedure
does not allow Parliament the same level of scrutiny, it will mean that
employers and schemes have longer to consider and consult on any
changes. We believe that, on balance, this is the right
approach.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401139000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#1401139000012">The
noble Lord, Lord Browne, specifically referred to the power in Clause
24(8) to extend the five-year window in which the employer override can
be used. I will make clear that we think it important that there is a
strict time limit on when the override can be used, which is why the
Bill repeals the relevant provisions of Schedule 14 after five years.
We fully expect those employers who wish to employ the override to have
done so by 2021. However, we recognise that, in limited circumstances
and given the complexity of some schemes, some employers may find it
difficult to meet that time limit; for example, if several diverse
employers have to agree on changes to a multi-employer
scheme.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401139000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#1401139000013">We
therefore think it is vital that the time limit can be extended if
absolutely necessary, but we also think that the extension of an
existing time-limit period should not require the affirmative procedure
when using the power would only allow employers otherwise prevented
from using the override to do so. The power does not allow us to alter
the way the override works or to extend its scope—only to extend
the window in which employers can use it. As such, I do not believe the
affirmative procedure would be appropriate. I apologise for the length

Amendment 44 to Schedule 13. As I said when we last met, the abolition
of contracting out is a natural consequence of the implementation of
the single tier. With the ending of the additional state pension, there
will no longer be anything to contract out of. Employers who contract
out of the additional state pension must provide their scheme members
with pension benefits that are broadly equal to, or better than, the
benefits they would have received had they remained contracted in. To
do so, they must satisfy the statutory standard set under Section 12A

situation here. Everyone understands that contracting out has to cease
in this respect, but the way in which it is done is vital. The Minister
referred to the measures for private sector occupational schemes being
tightly constrained by technical regulations. They definitely need to
be tightly constrained because the Bill provides the ability to
override trustees in all circumstances, to avoid any form of
negotiation, and to place the full cost of any replacement of the
contracting-out benefit on the employees. The cost of contracting out
will jeopardise the solvency and therefore the future of many of these
schemes. As we discussed at some length, and as was pointed out by my
noble friend Lord Browne in particular, there is also the question of
statutory protection in some circumstances in certain fairly

to justify doing all this on the basis of a negative resolution

retrospection. The whole principle of pension scheme regulation is that
at any given point, benefits accumulated by an individual until that
point will be frozen, even if changes are made by the trustees, by
statute or whatever. That is not written into Schedule 14, as far as I

the number of people covered by defined benefit schemes had already
reduced from more than 2 million to 1.6 million, and that
the figure was expected to be roughly 0.9 million in a couple of
years’ time. The Government seemed to regard that with some
complacency. Of course changes will have to be made to those schemes,
but it is not right to say that this imposition will have an effect
only on defined benefit schemes, because the lack of trust in the
future for any form of scheme is affected by the way that the

Drake (Lab):</Member></B> I thank the Minister for taking the
opportunity to address some of the issues we were concerned
about—we ran out of time, in effect—in our previous
Committee session. My major concern in this debate has been the
sufficiency of protections when a statutory override is given or is
exercised. It sets a precedent and I am sure that this will not be the
last statutory override we are going to see in the pensions arena over
the next three or four years, given some of the agenda items we know
are coming our

that what is proposed or what we can see is weak. The Minister said
that he expected that the override would be used in exceptional 
<?notus-xml column=6?>circumstances. To an extent that is true, because if the sponsoring
employer does not need, as a requirement of the scheme, to get trustee
consent, there is no need for a statutory override. I had conceded that
point in my opening comment. Of course, there will be a need for
statutory overrides where the scheme’s rules do not allow what
is being proposed on the recoup arrangements, or where trustee
agreement is required and the trustees do not want to give their
consent<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T15:48:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

hope that somehow this consultation will take place and everybody will
act appropriately and only in extremis—having gone through due
process but finding barriers in the way—will the employer be
able to invoke the statutory override. Of course, the Minister has no
idea how employers will behave in practice in individual schemes. One
hopes that they will all consult, but some may be in a hurry and some
may simply see that they are not required to consult or gain trustee
consent. A statutory override is being put in the Bill without, as far
as I can see, an explicit requirement to consult—merely an
expression of hope from the Government that it will take place.

other area about which I remain concerned is the fact that the
regulations will still be subject to
a<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T15:49:38"></hs_TimeCode> negative

employer can recoup, and this would be setting a precedent on a
significant issue. The Minister conceded that these are complex issues,
and that is right. In multi-employer schemes, if the decision is taken
to amend the protected order
status<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T15:50:21"></hs_TimeCode> for
certain employees if there are shared cost arrangements, one can see

have no clear indication from the Government about how they will value
what it is that can be recouped. As I asked when speaking the other
day, is it the net or the gross loss? Will it be crystallised in terms
of the 2016 value of the rebate? These are quite significant issues.
On<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T15:51:11"></hs_TimeCode> one level,
setting out some actuarial assumptions in the regulations may be a good
thing, although we would perhaps want to see the actuarial assumptions
first. But we have no way of seeing them and when we do, the regulation

the negative procedure. In response to my suggestion that there could
possibly be time limits on consultation in order to meet the spirit of
what I aspired to achieve before the constraint of April 2016, 
<?notus-xml column=7?>the Minister said that seemed too prescriptive and asked why one would
want to put constraints on the consultative process. It seemed rather
contradictory to say that one cannot go for negative procedures because
affirmative procedures take too long and could push up against the
efficient way in which employers could adjust in time for April 2016.
If the balance were a trade-off between defined periods or timetabled
periods of consultation with the employers and the opportunity to deal
with the regulation by affirmative procedures, it would be

advantages of anticipating that he would do this—because he was

shall deal somewhat formally with government Amendment 44, which I
accept is a consequential amendment. I have to say—I do not
expect the Minister to engage very fully with this—that reading
the statutory provision which he seeks to amend, the section of the
Pensions Act 2004, I am slightly at a loss to understand why the
amendment is necessary. It makes the precise provision more elegant,
but I am not sure that it changes much of the content. It is genuinely
consequential. Section 258(2)(c)(ii) already contains these words,
although they are further
qualified.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401139000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#1401139000035">In
the more general debate I shall try to be complementary to the points
already made and not go back over the issues that my noble friends have
addressed, although I have some notes here which are similar to some of
their observations. I turn first to the issue of whether it is
appropriate to deal with the regulations anticipated by these
provisions by affirmative procedure in your Lordships’ House and
in the House of Commons, or by negative procedure, and consequently
whether it would be appropriate to deal with the limited issue of the
extension of the period by negative or affirmative procedure. It seems
to me, first, that it is improbable in the extreme, given the way the
Minister has described these regulations in terms of their
comprehensive nature, their complexity, and the difficulty associated
with understanding them, that they will not be debated in some form in
both Houses. It is unlikely that there will not be a desire to engage
with some aspects of them to—at the very least—achieve
some further
clarification.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401139000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#1401139000036">My
second point to the Minister is that it seems to be counterproductive
to the argument that negative procedure is appropriate to go to such
length to explain just how complicated the regulations are. It seems to

<?notus-xml column=8?>me that the more complicated the regulations are, and the more the
primary legislation has to be supplemented by complicated regulations,
the weaker the argument for doing this by negative procedure becomes. I
suspect that that is why, reflecting on the Minister’s words, he
referred again to the issue of parliamentary time. With respect to the
Minister, getting parliamentary time in our current Parliament is the
weakest argument
possible.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401139000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#1401139000037">I am
struck by the number of times the House of Commons rises before what I
consider to be its normal rising time. I do not know whether that is a
function of the fact that the coalition Government have run out of
agreement about what they can legislate on —that may happen; it
is a perfectly natural thing with coalition government—but I am
also struck by how much time is spent in the House of Commons debating
what is now called “Members’ Business”. As far as
your Lordships’ House is concerned, I am struck by the fact that
we are all expecting—and I think we will see—that an
extraordinary amount of time will be found to debate a Private

regulations are debated in the normal way, it seems to indicate an
expectation that there will be no great competition for parliamentary
time between now and the general election. In fact, I go so far as to
suggest that the business managers of the respective Houses may have
difficulty in filling the time they already have, so I do not think the
argument about parliamentary time is all that strong. If the Minister
is to continue to promote the idea that these
regulations—complicated, difficult, comprehensive and
substantial as they are—are still best dealt with by negative
procedure, then, with all due respect, I think he will need better
arguments than those he has already

perhaps I may take advantage of the opportunity to debate these issues

about the denial of their expectations. However, in col. GC
433, when the Minister was discussing the issue of protected persons
under statutory override, he deployed a similar but different argument.
I shall quote it to him, because I am interested in the difference, and
what it actually means. He
said:</hs_parafo><hs_quote UID="1401139000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#1401139000081">“We
also have to factor in that the design of the single tier reforms means
that those with a long history of contracting out will in most cases
build up significantly more state pension. Around 75% of people in the
private sector who pay higher national insurance contributions and
reach state pension age 
<?notus-xml column=9?>during the first two decades following implementation will receive

these different ways of saying the same thing, or were they different

“two decades” in one case and one decade in the other,

national insurance contributions in one while there is a reference to
eventual benefits in the other? It may not be easy for the Minister to
answer that immediately, and I apologise if it is not, but I would be

the issue of protected persons, in col. GC 433, the Minister addressed
my question about the defeated expectation that the decision that the

and that when it was made, Parliament would be informed. But what he
did not say was important. The Pensions Minister in the other place
said at one stage that it would be done in the summer of

fully accept that it is the Government’s intention that this
override power will be used in extremis and that the very existence of
the pension scheme is at risk. I understand that. My noble friend Lady
Drake indicated that that may not necessarily be an approach to the use
of the override that an employer may use; that is a point she made more
strongly than I could. But if either the members of the scheme or the
trustees come to the view that an employer has exceeded the limitations
of the statutory power of the override, how do the trustees or the
members of the scheme challenge the employer? Or is the
Government’s intention—this is one possible
interpretation of the legislation—that there will be no
challenge if the employer holds a certificate from an actuary that
confirms that the employer’s use of the power is compliant with
the 
<?notus-xml column=10?>extent of the statutory power? Is there no method of appeal or challenge
open to them? If there is, is it is expected that the expense of that,

forensic skills in looking at particular bits of legislation in this
area, and I therefore take his warning seriously. What it does is to
remove a defunct reference on which legislation is worded. The default
test is to meet the statutory standard. Actually, the legislation could
work without this particular amendment, but it is confusing to those
applying legislation and would leave an out-of-date reference on the

an unexpected premium for employers. You can have net at the employer

pay taking into account taxation and tax relief—as well as how
you set the figure for NI overall. Individual employers would have been

many people retiring in the early years of the single tier will have
their pension boosted using new-scheme rules. So a woman with 30

turn now to costs. As noble Lords will know, covering basic state
pension gaps through existing class 3 is relatively cheap. A person
paying class 3 to acquire one qualifying year of basic state pension
will get their money back within four years of reaching state pension
age. A different approach is required for class 3A to ensure that the
arrangements do not become a burden for today’s national
insurance contributors. So the costs of class 3A, which will be set by
the Treasury, will be based on actuarially fair terms, in consultation
with the Government Actuary’s Department. In keeping with this,
the cost will be adjusted to reflect the age of the pensioner at the
time they pay class 3A.</hs_para>

Statement there was much excitement among financial journalists, I
recollect. It was hailed as a great deal for consumers by commentators,
many of whom missed crucial words in the small print that it
would be at a broadly actuarial fair rate. My understanding—and
the Minister's explanation confirmed this—is that the price will

have the Government done any work on the likely distributional effects
of this scheme? If this scheme is broadly actuarially fair in pricing
and the proposal is that over time the policy will be broadly
cost-neutral as the briefing paper says, if some people are getting a

Government do not know about the scheme because they have not worked it
out. We know, however, that it will start in October 2015 and that the
Government are minded to run it for 18 months or two years only. I
digress here to point out to the Minister the irony of telling us in
one short unqualified sentence that the affirmative procedure will be
used for the regulations for this in a scheme that is due to start in
October 2015 when he spent a significant amount of his last
contribution to the Committee explaining that it would be very
difficult to find time for affirmative regulations in this Parliament.

do not know the range of prices, but the illustrative price given in
the briefing paper sent to Peers showed a charmingly named couple, Mr

£1,248 to acquire another one pound a week. That would be a
better deal for them than going to the market, said the briefing,
because the extra pension that it would buy would be uprated by CPI and

am not sure whether that was meant to be the price for them to receive
an extra £1 per week each because it seems in the polling
reports that the prices tested were between £300 and £800

this point because the value of polling is of course dependent on the
nature of the questions asked. If the questions that were asked in the
polling were on an expectation that one unit per week would cost
between £300 and £800, and in fact it is likely to cost
£1,248 to acquire, that polling may need to be redone as it will

suggestion is that up to something of the order of £25 per week

£1,248 per £1 per week of pension for the two of them,
that would cost £31,200. Can the Minister tell the Committee
what proportion of pensioners have in excess of £31,200 in
savings? As I explained at the briefing, it would be helpful to have at
least one fixed point of reference to have a debate around because it
is quite difficult to get a handle on just how valuable this is as a

on the polling if the price were £800 to buy an extra £1
per week, it would cost £20,000 to buy £25 per week.
However, only one in five of the small proportion who said that they
would be interested in buying at this price have more than
£20,000 in savings, so even if they bought they could not buy
the maximum. Indeed, three in five of them have less than
£10,000 in savings and investments in total. Of those who are
fairly interested, just over half have £20,000.</hs_para>

numbers. The briefing suggests that 7 million pensioners have enough
savings to enable them to buy class 3A contributions. Can the Minister
clarify this? Does that mean enough savings in total to buy one unit of
class 3A contributions or 25 units, or is it somewhere in
between—and if so, where in between is it? The briefing also
says that the polling suggests that “a small number” of
those 7 million would take it up, as the Minister himself said. Just

be?</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14011316000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#14011316000014">This is
all highly relevant to the costing of the schemes. For the reasons
given by the Minister, there was no point in me looking across the
Autumn Statement or the scorecard for any reference to this policy. It
is not there because there is no figure to be put. I
understand that but given that this provision is coming in during the
next financial year, when and how will Parliament have the opportunity
to scrutinise the detail? We know that it will be by affirmative
resolution and we are pleased about that, for obvious reasons after all
the arguments we made about why the other set of regulations should
similarly be by affirmative resolution, but can the noble Lord give us
some indication as to when he thinks the Government will be able to
secure the valuable parliamentary time to have that debate? If the
scheme is to be broadly cost-neutral over time, it clearly will not be
in the short term. Indeed, as my 
<?notus-xml column=18?>noble friends suggested, this could be viewed as a way of bringing in
revenue in the short term, which the state will then have to pay back
in the next 20 years-plus.</hs_para>

that, overall, 14% to 15% of people are either very or fairly
interested in buying; mostly, they are fairly interested. Let us
average everything for Mr and Mrs Average. Let us suppose that 500,000
or 7% of the 7 million people who the Minister believes will have
enough savings decide to buy class 3A contributions, that on average
they buy about £13 a week extra, which is just over half the
suggested maximum, and let us choose the middle price of £600
for an extra £1. My estimate, which I accept is very rough, is
that this will bring in less than £4 billion in revenue.
Whatever the figure, how will this be scored given that it will have to
be paid back again by the state in pension payments in the decades
ahead? Presumably, this also pushes those billions of pounds into the
DWP AME costs over the years ahead. I do not know whether the Minister

there are the decision points for individuals. Will they get advice on
whether they should buy class 3A contributions? After all, there are
significant considerations for individuals, such as their life
expectancy, which may be significantly affected by where they live in
the United Kingdom; whether they are married or in a civil partnership,
or likely to be so; and what other income or savings they
have—and, therefore, whether it is a good idea, if it may affect
their entitlement to incapability benefits, for example. After all, if
someone with £10,000 in savings decided to spend £4,000
of those in buying another £5 in income, would they not simply
lose that in pension credit and have 40% less of their savings? For all
the reasons that we have discussed, those savings may be necessary at
later stages in their life. Crucially, who would sell this to them? In
the context of the briefing that we received from the Minister’s
team, we were told that engagement between the purchasers of this and
the Government would be through the Treasury. Does that mean that the
Treasury will have certain responsibilities to people who call to
inquire about buying these class 3A contributions? If so, how will they
be
discharged<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T16:51:39"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011319000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#14011319000003">There
are many questions to ask. The Committee will not be surprised if the
Minister cannot answer them all now, because, with respect, he was
unable to answer even any of his own questions on his introductory
remarks. We may have to wait and see about some of the detail. I
understand the reasons for haste; this legislative vehicle is important
for this initiative and, if it proves to be positive, that is a good
thing. But the 
<?notus-xml column=19?>scheme was rushed out in the Autumn Statement and added on to the Bill
when it had gone through another place. We have no costings or details
on price, and no idea how it will be administered—but we still
look forward very much to the Minister’s

Hollis of Heigham:</Member></B> Can I ask a question following on from
my noble friend about the interaction of pension credit, which I was
trying to tease out as he was going along? At the moment, if you have
savings of more than about £40,000, the first £10,000 of
pension credit capital is disregarded for pension credit purposes.
Thereafter, you have the tariff income of £1 for
every £500, which means that if you have savings at the moment
of about £40,000 and you are single—I am not sure how it
would work for a couple, because I do not have the figures in my
head—you would be just about ineligible for pension credit,
because your tariff income would float you above it. But turn that
capital into a pension, given the fairly unattractive rates for annuity
purposes, and I think as a result you would come into pension credit. I
shall try to do some more work on this as the discussion moves on, but,
if I am right, what the Minister will get in upfront savings he will
lose not only in payments in perpetuity while those people live,
through his additional pension, but also the immediate payments he will
have to make in pension credit—because, having disbursed their
capital, they will now come within the pension credit income

of interesting questions, and I shall try to deal with as many as I
can. On the point that the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, raised about
the research and the understanding of the prices, we are clearly
looking at how much the original research needs to be
complemented—and, indeed, we may consider more polling work. The
original testing was based on a stylised scheme, and further work,
playing in the fact that the scheme is secured in national insurance
and state pension, may be
beneficial<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T16:54:54"></hs_TimeCode>. We
will also look to consider qualitative research to find out what sort
of barriers there may be to taking up class 3A contributions, and I
will be happy to provide further details of that research. On the
question raised by the noble Lord, Lord Browne, about whether some of
that research needs to be redone, I think we would say that it needs to
be
complemented.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011319000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#14011319000006">The
example of £1,048 raised by the noble Lord, Lord Browne, was not
the cost of £1 for a 65 year-old; it was illustrative only, and
we are looking to do some more research on the final price. In answer
to questions from both the noble Lords, Lord Browne and Lord McKenzie,
about information and timing, we will provide comprehensive information
and get it quality assured by stakeholders, and we build on the kind of
information we provide for class 3, which noble Lords will be familiar

social security, along with the rule that capital may be treated as

yourself of capital in order to boost income. However, to do so
wilfully in response to a government campaign would be very different
from handing a gift of £10,000 to your grandchild. I think that

question of the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, about what pension
entitlement is necessary, people can have a pension entitlement that
consists of graduated retirement benefit or state pension based on
their own record of national insurance, which is a category A pension,
or one derived from a spouse of civil partner’s record, which is
a category B pension. Proposed new Section 61ZA overrides the rules
that prevent people having an entitlement to more than one pension at a
time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011319000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#14011319000012">On the
question about what we call it, I think that the noble Lord called it a
savings vehicle. We have to be rather careful in our language, which
the noble Lord was good enough to recognise and acknowledge. Class 3A
will be a one-off opportunity for today’s pensioners, with a cap
on the amount of additional pension that can be bought and a limited
window during which applications can be taken. As with other forms of
voluntary national insurance, we do not expect it to be seen as an
investment in a commercial sense. As class 3A is not an investment
product, it does not require regulation by the Financial Conduct
Authority and, therefore, people with defined contribution pension
savings will not be able to get their pension pot refunded in order to
take up class 3A as an alternative to an

Turner of Camden (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, Clause 25
increases the pensionable age to 67. It is a key clause, but I wish to
oppose the question that it should stand part of the Bill, as I hope to
get the Government to think again about it. I know that in legislation
that has an impact on millions of people, as this Bill does, it is
useful to have arrangements that are the same for everyone—the
same benefits and the same retirement age—as that makes things
much easier to administer. The problem with that is that we are not all
the same. Even more important, jobs are not all the same.</hs_para>

I said at Second Reading, some people are happy to work for longer.
They like their jobs and the social aspect of working with others is
important to them. Such people do not look forward to retirement; they
like to go on working if they can. These people are often employed in
administrative jobs, but for others things are very different. Some
industries involve strenuous and often hazardous work—the
construction industry is one such. Those who work in such industries do
work that is necessary for the rest of us. Without them, we would not
have the comfortable lives that we now have. Yet such industries often
have a record of industrial accidents and disease, which we should all
find unacceptable. It may be dangerous for older workers to work with
others in such a working environment. Therefore, an earlier retirement
may well be
necessary<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T17:26:13"></hs_TimeCode>. 

<?notus-xml column=23?>This simply cannot be left to the private sector. We cannot have
legislation that says that all people must work longer before
retiring.</hs_para>

is not only industries that are hazardous where this is a problem.
There are many low-paid workers in dreary jobs who are only too happy
to retire, as long as they have enough money to do so. People who work
in hospital cleaning and dreary jobs of that kind are only too happy to
retire if it is possible for them to do so and to receive reasonable
benefits when they are retired. Such people long to retire. It is not
enough for us to say, “Oh well, you have to work for
longer<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T17:27:01"></hs_TimeCode>”.</hs_para>

the evidence that we are all living longer, but it is not always
sensible to use that as a reason for extending working life—not
for everyone, anyway. We are not alone in thinking this. A number of my
colleagues have tabled amendments to subsequent clauses to seek a
review of retirement ages. I certainly think that that is necessary.
Have the Government thought through what all this means? What is the
impact on people working in particular jobs and their health? What
happens when people live longer? What is the effect on their health?
Therefore, it seems to me that this simple provision in legislation to
ensure that people work for longer is not a good idea. I hope that the
Government will be prepared to look at it again, in the light of some
of the things that have been said both at Second Reading and in

Sherlock (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, as this is the first discussion
of Part 2 of the Bill, it may be worth setting out a couple of
principles from these Benches at the outset. First, we agree with the
principle of raising the state pension age to reflect longevity, as
people are living longer than when the current arrangements were put in
place, largely in post-war reforms. As I indicated at Second Reading,
we also accept the need for periodic reviews of the state pension age,
but we differ from the Government on how best to do that—we will
return to that issue in the discussion of our later
amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T17:28:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

pension age is never easy, and an issue of fairness is always at stake.
There needs to be a balance between the interests of the generations on
the funding of retirement incomes in a pay-as-you-go system, where
today’s taxpayers fund today’s pensions. As we will
discuss in later groups, our view is that having a careful,
evidence-based review before taking any future decisions on changes to
the state pension age is a crucial element of ensuring fairness between
generations.</hs_para>

arguments<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T17:29:33"></hs_TimeCode> made
by my noble friend Lady Turner require careful attention from all of
us. Sometimes fairness also requires at least a consideration of
difference, and my noble friend has highlighted some crucial
differences, particularly in relation to longevity and health. We all
know that life expectancy is increasing, but that fact conceals as much
as it reveals. Mortality rates vary widely, as do morbidity rates.
There is a huge amount of socio-demographic data available to inform
our debate—and I am sure we will hear a great deal of it in the
groups to come—from the Wanless and Marmot reviews to government
figures 
<?notus-xml column=24?>and other outside research. There are also some very interesting data
from the TUC. I will say more on this later, but I do not want to
pre-empt what I think could be a very substantial discussion coming up
shortly.</hs_para>

solutions to these problems. The biggest challenge to the Government is
to address the question of differential mortality and morbidity rates
through urgent attention to public health, but we also need time to
reflect on how best to deal with these questions in relation to the
state pension age. It is our view that the best way to do that is to
ensure that the mechanism for reviewing the state pension age includes
a review panel which has on it representatives of a wide range of
interests in society, including employer and employee representatives
and representatives of different parties and, indeed, our own Cross
Benches. I shall move an amendment later today to that effect, but in
the mean time, I hope very much that the Minister will take the
concerns of my noble friend seriously. I look forward to his

Freud:</Member></B> My Lords, the purpose of Clause 25 is to bring
forward by just over eight years the point at which the state pension
age completes its rise to 67. The latest evidence shows that we are
living longer and, on average, healthier lives than ever before. To
illustrate this point: a man in the UK reaching the age of 65 30 years
ago—in 1983—could expect to spend 14.5 years in
retirement. Today, a man reaching that same age can expect to spend
about 21.5 years in retirement.</hs_para>

Lady Turner, raised the key issue of differential life expectancy. I do
not propose to go into that in great detail at this point because we
will have the opportunity to address that full-on in the next
amendment; so, if she will forgive me, I shall concentrate my remarks
on raising the age to 67.</hs_para>

was informed by the Office for National Statistics’ 2004-based
life expectancy projections. Those projections suggested that a man
aged 67 in 2028 would survive for a further 19.9 years. However, on our
latest understanding, this same man is projected to survive for a
further 21.5 years, fully 1.6 years longer than we thought
when setting the original timetable in the 2007 Act.</hs_para>

that it is only fair that those enjoying the benefits of longer life
expectancy pay a share of the associated costs. Bringing forward the
increase in pensionable age to 66 through provisions in the Pensions
Act 2011 ensured the short-term sustainability of the UK’s state
pension system. Now, the measures contained in this clause to
accelerate the increase to the age of 67, combined with the regular
review mechanism as set out in Clause 26, will help ensure the fairness
and affordability of the system into the medium and long term. The
savings projected to result from this proposal are
significant—some £73 billion in net savings between 2026
and 2036—but not only are there net spending reductions, but
this measure is projected to increase employment rates and boost GDP by
around £100 billion over the same period.</hs_para>

rise to 67 by some eight years will affect around 8 million men and
women born between 6 April 1960 and 5 April 1969: people who are 
<?notus-xml column=25?>now aged between about 44 and 53. As with previous increases in state
pension age, the transition to the higher age will be phased in
gradually: men and women born between 6 April 1960 and 5 March 1961
will have a state pension age of between 66 and 67, and those born
between 6 March 1961 and 5 April 1969 will have a state pension age of
67. Those born after 5 April 1969 will not be affected by
this change because they already have a state pension age of 67 or 68,
or somewhere in between the two, as legislated for in the Pensions
Act 2007. The proposals in this clause mean that the maximum
increase that any individual will experience in their state pension
age, in relation to the Pensions Act 2007, is one year. By starting the
transition to age 67 in 2026, no one who was affected by the Pensions
Act 2011 will have their state pension age changed again by the
measures in this Bill. To help people prepare for the change, we
announced these proposals back in November 2011, giving the first
cohorts affected more than 14 years’
notice.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011329000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#14011329000006">Finally,
noble Lords will be aware that an ageing society is not a phenomenon
unique to the UK. That is why other countries in Europe and beyond are
moving to adjust the age at which retirement benefits become available.
Indeed, even by moving to a state pension age of 67 in 2028, we will
still be behind many other countries—Ireland will get there in
2021, the Netherlands and Australia in 2023, and Denmark and the US in
2027. In bringing forward the rise to a state pension age of 67 we are
ensuring that the system as a whole remains fair between the
generations and sustainable and that we are doing so in a way that is
on a par with elsewhere in the developed world. I beg to move that

all, in my view, highly elitist, and I am delighted that the DWP is not
following the Chancellor’s approach, which is the easy,
mechanistic way, but is seeking appropriate evidence with which to
inform its decisions. This amendment would strengthen the DWP’s

the issues? Some have been touched on by my noble friend Lady Turner.
Most commentators go over the well worn statistics—a year for
every three or four years; the doubling of numbers of those over 85; 
<?notus-xml column=27?>the trebling of centenarians, and so on. They end up with the glib
assumption that we cannot afford it so we must all work longer or, more
specifically, delay drawing our pension to pay for all those—not
us, of course—who in future will linger too long; and if we do
not do this we are destroying the life chances of our children and
grandchildren. That argument is pretty well nonsense. The issue of
affordability is invariably prayed in aid and is, I think,
inappropriately stated—indeed, badly
misstated.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011329000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#14011329000013">The
first point is that half the population growth among the elderly, by
which we are so financially frightened, is a temporary bulge left over
from the baby boomers and will scale down from the 2030s on, at which
point we will have one of the best worker/pensioner support ratios in
Europe. I do not think the Chancellor told us that, if he actually knew
it. The second point is that I remember doing a speech at the Institute
of Directors 18 months or so ago and to a man—as, indeed, they
were—they thought that the state pension age should be 70 and
that they should have the right to dismiss staff at 65. No connection
was made between the two. There is little point in raising the state
pension age if people do not stay in the labour market. It merely means
that they linger longer in the twilight of inadequate working-age
benefits.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011329000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#14011329000014">The
latest statistics I have—the Minister’s may be more
up-to-date—is that some 30% of men have left the labour market
before the state pension age of 65, though the averages are skewed and
in practice it is actually a higher number because some men, and women,
continue working for a couple of years after 65, a subject we debated
when talking about lump sums earlier in Committee. At the moment, that
30% or so of men who leave the labour market early, whether through
unemployment or poor health, are protected. This is a point that is
never raised in any of these discussions and I do not know why, because
it is very relevant. They are protected because they can claim pension
credit on the same terms as women and thus, while pension age remains
unequal, they have, or have had, a level of benefit equivalent to the
state pension topped up by pension credit for up to five years while
they linger in the twilight world between leaving work and pension
credit age. That will disappear as the state pension age is equalised
and poorer men, unable to work but unable officially to retire will
find themselves in a no-man’s land on a low level of benefits
with no top-up by pension credit as the state pension age continues to
rise. As far as I know, no consideration at all has been given to that
by anyone, and it should have been.</hs_para>

point. What matters, therefore, when we consider the cost of state
pensions<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T17:44:23"></hs_TimeCode> is
their percentage of GDP, which over the next 20 years will actually
fall. Why has that not been brought into play as an argument? It
depends also on employment levels and productivity during working
years<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T17:44:43"></hs_TimeCode>; savings
ratios, including pensions, which conventionally are not counted in the
savings ratio—the difference between outgoings and incomings;
rising real incomes, which can buy adequate heating and food, both
before and during retirement; and the ability in the later years of
retirement, the decade of growing disability, to release assets such 
<?notus-xml column=28?>as one’s home. Those are also not counted in the savings
ratio—and there is a big difference between us and Germany. That
could be done by trading down, or equity

beyond the heart/stroke/cancer problems are the falls, due
very often to loose slippers and loose stair carpets,
the fractured hip and the hospitalisation and
institutionalisation that follows, which leads into our third stage of
dependency where we need substantial care. Yes, we are living longer
but—and this is key—that extra longevity is not added to
the first decade of our retirement when we are healthy and can enjoy it

expectancy. I think that it

ever-increasing period of functional disability. The gap between the
two is widening, not narrowing. The problem is getting worse, and the
more that life expectancy rises, the longer the period spent in that
second decade of partial disability. No one ever tells us this. ONS
figures show that it is already the case that the most deprived
one-fifth of men have a healthy life expectancy of only 55 years, 15
years lower than the more affluent. As my noble friend Lady Turner

are where we are now but as we expect to raise the state pension age,
as the Government propose, those considerations should come into play.
Those people do not enter the labour market at the same time and do not
leave it at the same time, so why do we expect that they should draw a
pension at the same time? It is too late for the poor who are in poor
health and may be unnecessarily early for the better off in better
health. Higher-income and higher-educated people such as me will
usually have longer than that first decade of healthy retirement, I
hope. Those who left school at 16 for unskilled jobs, as my noble
friend mentioned, will be lucky to have three or four years of healthy
retirement. Raise the pension retirement age by one year and they will
lose a precious year of those three to four healthy life years. Raise
it by three years and they will move almost immediately from being
officially in the labour market into a retirement cribbed and confined
by growing ill health and disability.</hs_para>

only after 75 that they are less likely to give than to receive. In
other words, and I cannot emphasise this enough—we need it in
the moral equivalent of capital letters—the large inequalities

will receive it, while others of us like me who have additional
retirement income find the value of their state pension increasing? The
DWP rightly recognised all this in its list of factors to be considered
in its White Paper. Well done to it for being spot on, as that was one
of the first papers of which I know that listed it in that way.
However, I have no confidence at all that HMRC will shape its policy
accordingly. That is why these factors really need to be in the

the setting of the pension age. I would have preferred it if the
strategy embodied in the Bill had been preceded by the kind of review
referred to by my noble friend. The reality is as she spelt out. There
has been due consideration and serious assessment of the statistics,
certainly, but a simple and mechanistic relationship has been made
between increased average longevity on the one hand and a Treasury-led

have two amendments in this group that move in much the same way as my
noble friend’s amendments. She has made the case for looking
much more widely when we come to review the pension age next time and
ensuring that we do that by including it in the Bill. The central
problem was also referred to by my noble friend Lady Turner in the
previous amendment: the range of longevity and life experience is still
enormously wide. One of the problems in this House, frankly, is that
most of us have spent most of our lives in relatively comfortable
positions and healthy and salubrious surroundings. In so far as we have
been under pressure, it has probably stimulated our brains to function
for slightly longer than many of our fellow citizens. None of that will
go on forever for any of us but, nevertheless, we are in a fairly
privileged group in that

the other end of the scale, there are people whose whole life has been
in physical and intellectual distress and who have come in their
60s—let alone 67—and sometimes in their 50s to a position
where they cannot sensibly work any longer. This is a minority group,
but it is quite a large minority. It tends to be defined by
occupational background, geographical area and income. All of those
factors need to be taken into account in a much more sophisticated way
in any future review. My noble friend referred to two wards in Norwich
having that differential. We have long said in London that life
expectancy declined if you went from South Kensington across to Mile
End roughly by one year per stop on the District line. This is not an
equal society<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T17:59:42"></hs_TimeCode>,

these amendments ask is that we recognise that change is necessary. We
recognise that there will be another review but at least let us ensure
that our successors, in undertaking that review, looking at these wider
elements. The extra bit in my Amendment 57 is that we should look
specifically at the lowest end of the longevity increase or
achievement, if that is the word, to see whether we need to make
special provision for them in so far as we can define them. That is an
exercise in the future, but this Bill could ensure that it is effective
and undertakes a much wider review of life experience than a direct
correlation between average longevity and the state pension age. I am

Drake:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall speak to Amendments 52, 55 and
58. I acknowledge that increasing the state pension age consistent with
increases in life expectancy is part of delivering a sustainable state
pension system. For the regular reviews of the state 
<?notus-xml column=32?>pension age rules, however, we also need to ensure that a clear and wide
range of relevant factors is considered and that there is clear and
authoritative public presentation of the evidence to inform that
debate, while recognising, of course, that the Government of the day

fairness requires that each generation should enjoy a roughly similar
proportion of adult life in state-supported retirement, and we may well
see newer and higher projections for life expectancy in the future
which will bring huge challenges to how our society operates. For
example, who knows where advances in modern medicine will take us in
terms of life and health expectancy? State pension policy clearly has
to be robust, in the face of not just increasing life expectancy but
major uncertainty about how fast that increase could proceed. However,
I am also concerned that increasing the state pension age should not be
seen as the silver bullet for automatically delivering sustainability
without considering some of the complexities and collateral
consequences which need to be addressed at the same time.</hs_para>

of factors to be considered in the periodic review of the state pension
age. My noble friend Lady Hollis has clearly identified these factors,
and I shall add arguments about why it is important that they are in
the Bill. On average, life expectancy is increasing and yes, on
average, ageing appears to be healthy, but averages do not tell the
whole story. There are major inequalities, as has been articulated.
Life expectancy varies significantly by socioeconomic class and while
it has risen significantly in all social classes, there are widening
absolute inequalities. Lower socioeconomic groups live for fewer years
post-retirement, a smaller percentage of which appears to be free of
sickness or disability, and they are far more likely to leave the
workforce early for health reasons. In part, this reflects differences
in key lifestyle predictors of future health.</hs_para>

that there may be limits to the feasibility of across-the-board
increases in the age of retirement from the workforce, particularly if
the increases are more than proportionate to the increase in life
expectancy of particular socioeconomic groups. Similarly, for those who
are healthy, since the state pension accounts for a larger share of
their total retirement income, this suggests that an increase in the
state pension age would be most likely to induce lower income workers
to work longer and less likely to induce higher income ones.</hs_para>

understand how trends in life expectancy and health by socioeconomic
class will develop in the future. Certainly, figures indicate some
significant differences in life expectancy and healthy life expectancy
between regions. The recent figures, kindly provided, show that there
is a widening gap between local authority areas with the lowest and
highest life expectancies at age 65. Of course, one can speculate on
the causes of these differences—major industrial shocks,
unemployment rates, specific health problems and cultural and
behavioural issues. However, if one looks below age 65, lower
socioeconomic groups are also not participating equally in the
significant reductions in death rates between the ages of 45 and
65<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T18:05:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that the major occupational sources of ill health that played a large
role in previous generations, such as coal mining or heavy industry,
and whose impacts can still be seen in the regional incidence of
unemployment, will decline in importance. Conversely, a pessimist would
stress that the increasing divergence of some lifestyle factors,
continuing differences in working conditions and new labour market
features may offset some of these positive developments. The issue
therefore is whether policy levers can be deployed to mitigate the
disproportionate impact of a rising state pension age on lower
socioeconomic groups.</hs_para>

ages may not be an appropriate response for addressing the significant
differences in morbidity, life expectancy and early departure from the
labour market. However, where differences exist a response is needed.
Simply ignoring them is, in itself, a default public policy response
with potentially negative consequences for many people. Measures need
to target reducing health inequalities but the welfare system needs
also to be sensitive, efficient and protective in supporting those for
whom working longer is problematic because of their class and health.

reasonable level of replacement income but it will be some years before
auto-enrolment delivers the necessary savings levels. We are still only
staging and phasing its introduction. Meanwhile, lower socioeconomic
groups will still be facing a greater likelihood of ill health and
earlier exit from the labour market as they get

extent to which increases in life expectancy are accompanied by
increases in healthy life expectancy, monitoring inequalities between
socioeconomic classes and regions and identifying the implications for
policies associated with the evolving policy for state pension ages
will remain an important part of any review. The key responses should
include a strong focus on health service and occupational health
policies and on the measures to reduce the life expectancy gaps and to
compress morbidity. The long-term aim must be to narrow health
inequalities rather than treating them as permanent barriers. We should
aspire, for example, for the men in Glasgow and Liverpool to have as
good an average life expectancy as the men in Kensington and
Chelsea, or even those in East Dunbartonshire. Policy needs to be
designed to be both equitable and affordable in the face of whatever
rise in life expectancy actually occurs. Higher pension ages are
essential but are not in themselves a sufficient response.</hs_para>

market participation by older workers is, equally, an integral part of
sustainability. Analysis of trends in average age of retiring from the
labour market and in employment rates among older people by gender,
region, occupation and socioeconomic 
<?notus-xml column=34?>class is required to understand the extent to which increases in state
pension age are accompanied by increases in employment. Unless
increases in state pension age are accompanied by higher labour market
participation by older workers, then the effective contribution of
those pension ages to public expenditure pressures will be weakened,
GDP will be lower and other benefit expenditure could well increase.
However, major inequalities in life expectancy and health may make
across-the-board increases in retirement ages unfeasible unless these
differences disappear over
time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011329000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#14011329000044">The
policy of raising the state pension age needs to be accompanied by
measures that facilitate higher labour market participation by older
workers, because barriers certainly exist. Take, for example, the
position of some women. Although women have a higher average life
expectancy than men, the figures also reveal that the gap between them
is narrowing. The gap between women in higher and lower socioeconomic
classes is increasing and women’s participation in the labour
market has reached a plateau, partly because of care requirements and
the cost of care provision, particularly childcare. Older women are
increasingly looking after their elderly parents or grandchildren. An
older woman’s earlier age of retirement from the labour force
may, for example, be the price paid so that her younger daughter or son
can be economically
active.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011329000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#14011329000045">The
cultural biases against older workers are often embedded in personnel
practices and employers’ assumptions. Take training as an
exemplar. The evidence suggests that employer-provided training is
skewed towards younger workers, with an assumption that some workers
are too old to train. Yet the experience of workers in their 50s plays
an important role because beyond the age of 65, participation in the
labour market is driven by participation up to the age of 65. Once
older people exit the workforce, they are much less likely to work
again. The challenges facing business in embracing older workers will
be very real. I recall quite vividly 10 years ago the CBI, anxious
about that challenge, simultaneously arguing for an increase in the
state pension age to 70 but a default retirement age under
discrimination law of nearer 65. I described it at the time as a
five-year gap between loss of employment rights and receipt of pension.
The debate has moved on but that indicates what tensions will be there
as industry responds to increased longevity and increased state pension
age.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011329000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#14011329000046">The
extent to which increases in state pension age are accompanied by
increases in labour market participation will inform government of what
initiatives they need to take, be it tackling discriminatory cultures,
financial incentives for later retirement, incentives to employers to
employ and train older workers, flexible employment practices, cultural
attitudes and health policies and changes to welfare policy and welfare
payments themselves. Whatever decisions are made in response to the
periodic reviews of state pension age, and however much desirable
continuity in policy can be achieved, delivering both a fair and
sustainable pension policy and level of public expenditure will and
should be subject to fully informed debate continuing over time, in the
light of new information on a series of relevant factors becoming
clearly available and systematically
considered.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-13?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_13_PT_1/CD3933B331236AF88F27C2347A767D5936F9E421" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 13 January 2014">Monday,

Stoneham of Droxford (LD):</Member></B> I was not going to intervene,
but there is not as much difference between the two sides of the
Committee on this, as earlier contributions seemed to suggest. I
certainly thought that the remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady Drake,
were right down the line and I was sympathetic to them. Nobody is
suggesting that the Labour Government were wrong to start the debate on
early retirement. Everybody knows that life expectancy is improving and
there are great complexities with inequalities. I would question
whether the inequalities have necessarily got worse. I will come to
that in a moment, but there is also the issue of overriding
affordability.</hs_para>

extended life expectancy is that it almost certainly results in higher
social care costs—and, as we know, higher pension costs. We all
want to see better pensions, and you cannot often have both a lower
retirement age and better pensions. It has to be recognised that you
have to get a balance. We have all seen the extra costs that this
Government have put into pensions through the triple lock. We want to
see that continue into the next Government as well, but that will add
to the overriding
costs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011329000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#14011329000049">I
question the inequality issue. As someone who worked in the mining
industry when there were 250,000 people working in it, having seen the
consequences of early retirement on a lot of those communities and the
effect that it is already having on inequalities and lifetime
expectancy, I would expect to see some improvement, as we have moved
away from older, heavy industries. Another argument was about boring
jobs—and boring jobs in the health service. The boring jobs of
my generation were in the car assembly industry. With improved
technology, anybody organising cleaning jobs should certainly know that
that is one of the most important jobs in the health service. It should
be respected and there should be pride in it, and there are ways and
means of managing that.</hs_para>

further point. You have to have a uniform state pension age and it has
to be an average. There will be difficulties with certain occupations,
but those have to be respected. We already have some occupational
pension schemes that have a lower retirement age because of the
consequences of people working in those sectors.</hs_para>

the categories that we are using here and the factors that will be
included in any review. Those will change over the next 20 years. You
could put in the proportion of people smoking or having bad diets as
factors that should be looked at specifically. In fact, there is a
whole variety of factors and I do not think that the Government are
saying in the Bill that there will not be a variety of factors
considered in these reviews. We all have an interest in reducing the
health inequalities that arise in terms of life expectancy. Under the
Government’s proposals, these factors will be taken into
account, but we are giving people a recognition that this will be done
formally, as part of a set procedure, whenever this is looked at every
six or seven years. This will give some certainly as we go forward. I
doubt whether the differences between us are really very

by briefly responding to the noble Lord, Lord Stoneham. I think I may
have misheard him, and I hope that he will correct me if I did. He said
that inequalities had not got worse, but perhaps I might refer him to
the brief sent out by the DWP on equality in life expectancy and in
healthy life expectancy. It said that while life expectancy has risen
substantially for all social classes, this has resulted in a widening
of inequalities, and that the smallest growth in life expectancy at age
65 was experienced by those in the lower socio-economic groups. What
has been happening is that life expectancy has been rising for all
classes, but because of the differential rate at which it has been
rising, the gap has been widening. In fact the inequality problem is
significant. That is a question for
public<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T18:19:40"></hs_TimeCode> policy to
address<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T18:19:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011329000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#14011329000054">We
have heard today about trying to find a way to do two things: First,
the analysis was made very clear by my noble friends Lady Hollis and
Lord Whitty that people are living longer, but the proportion of years
spent in full health is not keeping track at the same rate. We have
significant inequalities in health within the UK, and significant
variations in mortality and morbidity rates as a result. Also, we have
people who are not able to work safely through to retirement age. Those
are the issues that somehow public policy has to grapple
with.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14011329000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#14011329000055">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T18:21:02"></hs_TimeCode>
fact is that mortality rates start rising slowly when people hit their
mid-50s, and rise significantly from 65 onwards. That has significant
implications for workers and employers. First, we have the
implication—to which a number of noble Lords alluded—of
having an older workforce. There will of course be employees who find,
as my noble friend pointed out, that they cannot work until the state
pension age. I wonder what consideration the Government have given to
the risk that we will see a growing number of people who are recognised
as sick or chronically disabled,
but<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T18:20:52"></hs_TimeCode> are having
to wait so long for their pensions that they end up eating through the
savings that they have set aside for retirement and so move into
retirement without the very nest eggs that we want them to build up.
Has any assessment been made of whether that will be one of the
consequences of the changes to state pension
age<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T18:21:09"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011329000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#14011329000056">Secondly,
what happens to those who know that they are unable to work safely at
67 but cannot retire? We have heard various examples mentioned of
people in different professions. This is not simply a case for those in
unskilled jobs. I would not want to be operated on by a surgeon who
felt that his or her eyesight was no longer up to it, either. The
reality is that a number of people in different roles may find that
they have to<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T18:21:34"></hs_TimeCode>
face up to the fact that they cannot continue in the same role until a
higher retirement age. The real question is whether their differential
experience and resources may give them differential strategies for
dealing with that. One of the questions  
<?notus-xml column=37?>for public policy is how we address the problems of those who do not
have the resources or choices available to them in that
circumstance<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T18:21:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011329000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#14011329000057">Then
there is the question of employers. We know that many employers welcome
the wisdom and experience of older workers, but they have often
expressed concern that older workers may get seriously ill and be off
work for longer periods. I know that the Government have often
reassured them that that is not the case and that older workers do not
take more time off sick than younger ones. Have the Government given
any consideration to whether that is likely to
change<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T18:22:19"></hs_TimeCode> as the
state retirement age increases? Of course, at the moment, people can
choose to work beyond the state retirement age and therefore there must
be an element of self-selection among older workers who carry on
working. As the retirement age increases, people may have no choice but
to continue working, and I am interested to know whether any work has
been done on whether that could make a difference to the composition of
the older
workforce<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T18:22:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011329000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#14011329000058">We
then heard about the issue of inequalities in health in relation to the
fairness test. I read very carefully through the DWP document on
equality in life expectancy and in healthy life expectancy, but in the
end, I almost wrote at the bottom, “Baroness Hollis was
right”. I found it hard to summarise it other than with
something I have heard my noble friend say repeatedly almost ever since
I have known her—one can expect 10 years of healthy
retirement, 10 years of declining health and the rest of
one’s life with significant levels of infirmity and disability.
Yet despite that fact, she has pointed out the tendency of Governments
to put so much store by actuarial information on average life
expectancy. That of course is precisely what the Bill says in bald
terms, whatever assurances we may want to receive about how it will be
done in
practice<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T18:23:32"></hs_TimeCode>. The
point has been made that average life expectancy tells us something,
including quite a bit about how medical advances can keep us alive, but
it does not tell us very much about our health in retirement, or about
differential mortality
rates<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T18:23:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011329000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#14011329000059">We
have heard a huge amount of information about clear socio-economic
differences and the health inequalities that result from them. There is
also clearly still a gender divide. Women still live longer than men,
although the gap is closing. I also note that we are only now seeing a
generation of female pensioners who have worked for most of their lives
as well as raised families. We do not yet know the impact of that on
female longevity—it will be interesting to see

Sherlock:</Member></B> My Lords, in addition to a gender divide, we
have heard that there is a class divide and a geographical divide. To
add to the examples from Glasgow, Liverpool and Norfolk, I offer
Dorset, which I am reliably informed is the place to
live—statistically, you are expected to live longest in the UK.
Women in east Dorset can expect to live nine years longer than women in
Corby—the area with shortest 
<?notus-xml column=38?>life expectancy for women. Men living in east Dorset can expect to live
7.1 years longer than men in Manchester—the area with shortest
life expectancy for men. Then there is the effect of this differential
life expectancy on state retirement incomes. Those living shortest post
retirement, primarily the poorest and least skilled workers, will
obviously receive less in state pension than their better-off
counterparts in Dorset. Women in Corby will get £67,000 less and
men in Manchester will get £53,000 less. And, of course, those
manual workers may well have contributed for longer than those who
spent longer in
education.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011329000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#14011329000061">Where
does all this take us? It does not take us to any straightforward
policy solutions. As I am sure is the case with other noble Lords, many
representations have been made to me on ways in which the Government
should tackle this—that perhaps they should not raise the state
pension age until we have tackled inequalities in health; or that a
variable retirement age should be brought in, taking account of life
expectancy, work pattern or contribution history; or that there should
be flexible retirement proposals or the idea of paying actuarially
adjusted pensions early for those retiring in their 60s but before the
state pension age. It is quite likely that none of these will commend
themselves to the Minister. Given the look on his face, I expect that I
am right in that. However, I am sure the Minister will accept that what
we have heard today is an analysis that suggests that a significant set
of public policy issues needs to be addressed. They are not all pension
issues—a point that my noble friend Lady Drake made
powerfully—but are effectively spillovers from decisions around
the state pension age, which will then impact on public policy-making
in a range of other areas.</hs_para>

not feel able to respond positively to any of those concrete
suggestions on how to deal with this issue, I encourage him at the very
least to go along with the idea of spelling out in the Bill the need to
take account of all these factors, because that would then at least put
the review process for setting the state pension age in the position of
having to tackle all these complicated issues and making some
recommendations to government on which we could all, I hope, place some
store.</hs_para>

Freud:</Member></B> My Lords, the purpose of Clause 26 is to ensure
that every Government consider state pension age in light of the latest
life expectancy projections and other relevant data. The legislation
sets out that a review must be informed by a report from the Government
Actuary on the proportion of adult life spent in retirement and
corresponding implications for state pension age.</hs_para>

pensions as a percentage of GDP raised by the noble Baroness, Lady
Hollis, the single-tier impact assessment shows that even with an SPA
of 67 in 2028 and an SPA of 68 in 2046, the proportion of pensioner
benefit expenditure could rise from under 7% of GDP in 2016 to 9% of

true that life expectancy is different between socio-economic groups,
and even in the latest figures it slightly widened. However, it is
increasing for all groups. Such inequalities have always existed and,
as the Minister 
<?notus-xml column=39?>noted in Committee in the other place, adjusting the pension age is not
the right way to address these inequalities. We need to address these
issues elsewhere through tackling the factors that lead to these
differences in life expectancy. To illustrate the rate of increase, the
period of life expectancy at age 65 for males in the lowest
occupational class between 2002 and 2006 was 15.3 years. You have to go
back only to 1999 for the average period of life expectancy of males
from all occupations to be the same figure.</hs_para>

single-tier pension’s key features are simplicity—giving
people the clarity and confidence to save—and a value set above
the minimum income guarantee standard. Allowing early access would mean
that we would have actuarially to reduce the pension, and this would
severely undermine both these key features of the new system,
complicating outcomes and meaning that, if people’s actuarially
reduced state pension was below the minimum guarantee, we would retain
an extensive and complex system of means-testing. International
organisations have repeatedly advised countries to withdraw incentives
to early retirement. Indeed, in recent years, a number of countries
have put in place measures to discourage it, including Denmark, Finland
and Germany.</hs_para>

between the generations, such as taxpayers and pensioners, at any given
time. It is therefore right that the Government Actuary’s
Department focuses on total life expectancy from state pension age and
not on healthy life expectancy. Indeed, the Pensions Commission
advocated that pension age should rise proportionately in line with
life expectancy, thereby maintaining the proportion of adult life spent
in retirement. Just last week, the noble Lord, Lord Turner, reasserted
this principle. This is what the GAD element of the review is
for.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14011329000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#14011329000069">We also
think it is crucial that future Governments have access to wider
evidence before laying any proposals to change state pension age before
Parliament. We have been clear in the White Paper and in the other
place that we believe the reviews of state pension age should consider
healthy life expectancy but also differences between socioeconomic
groups and the wider economic effects of increasing state pension
age.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14011329000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#14011329000070">On my
original point about flexibility, we do not want to be too prescriptive
in setting out factors that must be looked at by each review. We want
to foster a more long-term view which would allow each Government to
specify factors relevant to the circumstances at the time of
commissioning the review. There is the danger that, by setting out a

about healthy life expectancy, and so on, but I will make just make a
few points on it. The first is to warn noble Lords that the ONS measure
of healthy life expectancy from 2000 onwards was changed to run in
comparison with our EU partners, so we do not have a consistent data
run for the whole period, although we have evidence that shows that
healthy life expectancy has increased consistently since the 1980s. Do
not use the run because there is a discontinuity in it.</hs_para>

factor that I would suggest noble Lords look at is not just the good or
the very good figures for health but the figures for fair health. On
average, men and women aged 65 can expect to maintain good or very good
health until their mid-70s and expect to maintain at least fair health
until their early 80s. This equates to spending almost 90% of life
remaining at age 65 in very good, good or fair health. On that
measure—I think it is in terms of healthy life expectancy, good
or very good—we rank third in

thinking about raising the state pension age—and I cannot

government. We need that, because, as pension credit is withdrawn, with
every year that we equalise the state pension age between men and
women, we reduce the income of men who are in their twilight and who
have dropped out of the labour market early, as 30% or more have and
do. That figure will increase as the pension age rises—that 30%
will probably go up to 35% and 40%, and so on, as we raise the state
pension age, unless we can keep people in the labour market for longer,

somebody who has a real choice about whether to stay in work is going
to make a rational decision to forgo a job that pays £400 a week

credit to top up an employment support allowance? Is that what the

willingly reduce his income to one-third of what it was because of the

Hollis of Heigham:</Member></B> I think that I am right in saying that
under 10%—probably about 7%—of those in that position do
not choose to go on pension credit when that choice is available to
them, and the rest do. So clearly the Government’s position
assumes that people are making a choice that is attractive because they
have been financially encouraged to do so by the relative generosity of
pension credit. I cannot attach any other understanding to the
Minister’s position. If pension credit did not exist, the
assumption would be that the benefits structure was less attractive and
therefore, presumably, that they would stay in work for
longer—and that therefore they are being encouraged because of
pension credit to leave earlier than they need to and that, therefore,
withdrawing pension credit is a wise move in the process of the
rationality of economic thought in the labour market. Is that what the
Minister is
saying?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011329000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#14011329000091"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Freud" PimsId="5439" UID="14011329000191" xid="2007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#14011329000191">Lord

Hollis of Heigham:</Member></B> I think that the Minister and I have a
very different understanding. My view is based on my experience
representing—I do not know if the noble Lord has ever had that
privilege—one of the poorest wards in my city for nearly 25
years. My noble friends here have either represented such wards or
constituencies with very poor members and I can tell the Minister that
if people can work they want to work. They want it for self-respect,
for income, for social mobility and they regard going “on the
club”, as it used to be called in my ward, or taking benefits as
something that they are not proud of but reluctantly do because the
labour market does not make appropriate provision for them, given the
state either of their skills or their health. If that comes from
experience of working with people, as I have done and as I am sure my
noble friends have done, then I regret that the 
<?notus-xml column=43?>Minister cannot share that personal experience, which might give him a
greater respect for the pressures that some people face in making
decisions when they have to leave the labour market. I am not for a
moment suggesting that he is lacking respect, but there is a great
difference in perspective on this and I do not know that I can bridge
it with the noble
Lord.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011329000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#14011329000093">It
is certainly the case that, as pension credit is withdrawn, it will
reduce the income of people who have already had to leave the labour
market, usually on grounds of ill health, and as a result they will
have less money for heating, diet and all the other things that we know
they will need. People going onto pension credit are already
effectively entering that second decade of disability without, in many
cases, having gone through the first decade of reasonably healthy
retirement. By withdrawing pension credit and putting no substitute in
its place, we are ensuring that all we do is increase people’s
poverty and thereby progressively increase the rate at which they go
into further ill health, since they can no longer afford the heating,
the diet, the aids and appliances, the cleaning help and all the rest
of it which keeps them more effectively fit and engaged in society.

appreciate

Hollis of Heigham:</Member></B> Indeed so—I made the image up on
the spot, but I will, indeed, repeat it. What I was arguing there was
that women were facing a cliff edge. Men had always had that slow path
to the beach, but that is now being withdrawn from them and as a result
they have a cliff edge in the future between where they are, on
benefits, and state pension. Unfortunately for the Minister, the

expectancy, of increasing disability, of as decent a quality as we
possibly can. The noble Lord, Lord Stoneham, said that factors will
change. Of course they will. The Minister said that factors will
change, but the point is that that is already covered, as was pointed
out by my noble friend Lord Browne, but the wording of Clause 26(1)(a)
gives the Secretary of State alone the privilege of determining the
other factors. Putting all these factors in the Bill, as listed in the

permits; it is a basis on which I would hope that the DWP has its arm

Government are not bound by the legislative requirement to consider
those factors? On the contrary; by putting those factors into the Bill
we will strengthen the DWP’s arm in requiring other departments
to play their part in seeking to extend healthy life expectancy and to
improve the quality of the decade of disability. Without it, his
position will be weaker, not stronger. The other factors, as my noble

Minister said that such inequalities have always existed and should be
tackled in other ways. How does he expect them to be tackled? Does he
think that putting into the Bill the wording of the White Paper, which
talks about tackling them, makes that possibility more or less likely?
I am sure that he, too, wants healthy life expectancy to rise along
with life expectancy, and the quality of the second decade of
retirement to be as high as we can possibly make it. I am sure he
agrees with that. I am surprised that he does not see that his position
vis-à-vis other departments and policy development would be
strengthened, not weakened, if this was in the Bill. Other factors
remain. He can still specify them. I do not understand why he does
not.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14011329000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#14011329000100">For me,
this is not just an actuarial issue. It is a moral issue about whether
we make that last period in people’s lives as healthy and free
from disability as we possibly can. To do that, the Minister would be
well advised to have the words of this White Paper enshrined in the
legislation in order to hold his colleagues to account. I shall
withdraw the amendment, but it may be that we will come back to it. I
think the Minister is being very unwise in refusing to put it in the
Bill. He has given no explanation for that other than flexibility. He
does not need to say that. He has other factors in already. That is
redundant verbiage, if I may say so. Why, exactly, is he not willing to
add his first thoughts to his second thoughts, which are the Bill? I
can only presume that he has been got at by HMRC, which wants to retain
the simplest tick-box of them all, rather than the list the Minister
was talking about: average longevity increases, therefore average state
pension age rises. If he wants any help in resisting that, he needs
these words in the Bill. I beg leave to withdraw the
amendment.</hs_para>

Amendments 53 and 54 are tabled in my name and that of my noble friend

rules about pensionable age, having regard to life expectancy and other
factors, to be prepared by an independent commission.</hs_para>

an important role for an independent commission, while recognising that
the Government of the day would determine the policy that is brought to
Parliament. The demographic challenge poses unavoidable choices, which
are partly for society to make and partly for individuals. However, for
those choices to be rational and sustainable, they have to be informed,
barriers have to be removed and a broad consensus has to be achieved.
One of the useful roles of an independent commission is to present
society with those difficult but unavoidable choices. It can spell out
the facts and choices clearly and starkly. It can identify the
complexities. That process will also assist the parties in reaching a
political
consensus.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011329000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#14011329000103">Public
debate on policy changes will be better focused and more likely to
arrive at consensus if there is a permanent independent body charged
with presenting to society the evidence and the issues. A commission
can provide the public with a clear and comprehensive narrative about
what is happening and what it means. Delivering a sustainable state and
private pension system and responding to the demographic challenge are
long-term projects that cannot be delivered in the lifetime of any one
Government.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14011329000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#14011329000104">A
consensus needs to be held over a long policy framework, because
optimal outcomes take decades to come through. However, securing and
maintaining a consensus will not be easy, because deciding the way
forward involves important political judgments, and successive
Governments have focused very often on immediate challenges. Trade-offs
are the essence of political debate, but achieving some degree of
consensus on core principles will be easier to achieve if there is an
independent commission supporting that consensus. We know that the
long-term management of public finances requires intensive debate now
about the state pension age—but, notwithstanding the
desirability of continuity in policy being achieved, the detail of
pension and associated policies will and should be subject to
continuing debate over time, in the light of new information becoming
available<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T19:04:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011329000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#14011329000105">Life
expectancy and healthy life expectancy may change significantly from
current forecasts, trends in voluntary private pension savings could
turn out to be more or less favourable, and the participation rate of
older workers in the labour force may prove problematic. As the
information available changes, so the precise public policy direction
can be refined, even if the overall framework of the system maintains
as much continuity as possible. It is important that an independent 
<?notus-xml column=46?>commission should consider the sort of issues and complexities that we
all referred to in the previous
debate<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T19:04:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011329000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#14011329000106">As
to the type of commission, it should be small, so that the quality of
engagement between commissioners is dynamic and qualitative, but
sufficient in number to allow for wider input and for the stimulation
of considerations that an individual by definition could not achieve.
The commission could become a source of authoritative and independent
presentation of the facts, and of the estimates of public expenditure
consequences and of what future rises in the state pension age might be
implied by the principle of pension ages rising in proportion to life
expectancy increases. A commission could maintain a clear and steady
focus<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T19:04:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011329000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#14011329000107">The
report could capture the key trends in life expectancy and the
differences in morbidity, employment and retirement patterns among
older people, by gender, region, occupation and socio-economic classes.
This analysis would also allow early and regular identification of
whether increases in state pension age are accompanied by increases in
productive employment and/or a greater reliance on means-tested
benefits and whether major inequalities in healthy life expectancy can
make across-the-board increases in retirement ages feasible or
unfeasible<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T19:07:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011329000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#14011329000108">For
example, if state pension ages rise and average retirement ages rise,
state pension expenditure as a percentage of GDP will be reduced, not
only by a pension expenditure reduction but by a rise in GDP. However,
if pension ages rise and average retirement ages do not, the reduction
in pension expenditure will be offset by other non-pension benefit
expenditure and lower
GDP<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T19:08:30"></hs_TimeCode>. These
issues are matters of some moment when we are looking to achieve
sustainability in the light of what is a major demographic

the public is important. Individuals consistently underestimate their
own life expectancy. Research confirms that. Individuals on average are
unaware of, or do not believe, the projected increases in life
expectancy—in some instances, even when the evidence is
presented to them. Such attitudes make it difficult for people,
particularly young people, to think rationally about the savings
rate/retirement age/pension level trade-off that they personally and
society face. An independent commission would assist in changing those
attitudes and getting those key messages across in a way that very
often government and political parties cannot do
successfully<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T19:09:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011329000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#14011329000110">The
commission’s analysis could also identify the latest trends in
private pension provision on average and across different gender,
socio-economic and ethnic groups, and thus of the overall coverage and
adequacy of pension provision. This analysis coming from an independent
commission could assist in future debates about appropriate adjustments
in employee or employer default contribution rates. This is a not
insignificant matter and a key debate—one that people are
probably feeling tentative about in view of other, wider
considerations, but one which certainly an independent commission would
help address, as well as helping the formation of a political
consensus.</hs_para>

previous amendments we heard much reference to data—the quality
of the data, what they show, their integrity, whether they are
sufficient and so forth.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T19:10:16"></hs_TimeCode> quality of
choices made and policy decisions taken is directly influenced by the
quality, quantity and type of data that are available. An independent
commission would be well placed to interrogate the quality of the data
available and to make recommendations on the gaps or omissions in the
data collected, and on the data needed to inform
debate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011329000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#14011329000112">As the
Minister conceded in an earlier discussion, there is a need to take a
long-term view on these issues. In considering those long-term issues,
long-term projections also need to focus on the uncertainty inherent in
such analysis and on important sensitivity analysis. These are issues
that a standing commission could focus on. It could assist in helping
the debate and in helping the quality of government and individual
decisions.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14011329000113" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#14011329000113">To
repeat what I said at the beginning, one of the useful roles of an
independent commission is to present society with difficult but
unavoidable choices. It can spell out the facts and choices clearly,
and it can identify the complexities and assist government and
political parties in making the type and quality of decisions that are
necessary in the light of the challenges that we

stands, the Bill simply says that the Secretary of State shall review
the rules about pensionable age. That leaves us with some significant
gaps. There is insufficient information about the kind of review
mechanism that there might be. There is also insufficient detail about
who will conduct a review or how it is to be done, and there seems, on
the face of it, to be insufficient scrutiny by Parliament of any

all, they may be nervous about this. There has been a succession of

Sherlock:</Member></B> My Lords, as I said, there has been a succession
of changes to pension policy and legislation. One key example is that
under the previous Labour Government the number of years of
contributions required to get a full basic state pension fell
significantly, only for there to be a change of Government and for the
number now being proposed to shoot back up again. The Chancellor did
not help by giving the appearance of using the Autumn Statement to make
an ad hoc announcement about the raising of state pension age. Once the
dust settled, that turned out to be nothing more than what was already
in the Pensions Bill and was therefore not necessary. However, that ran
the risk of reinforcing the impression that pensions policy is made on
the hoof, and we need to tackle
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011329000121" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#14011329000121">If we
are serious about getting Britain saving for retirement, we need a
proper, cross-party consensus on the way forward for settling the state
pension age. Rather than simply being a matter for the Secretary of
State, as the Bill proposes, we need a proper external panel which has
the kind of cross-party and independent representation which will
reassure the public and give confidence to parliamentarians from across
the spectrum. We need a review mechanism that is clearly understood, a
review body that is clear in purpose and function and ways of working,
and clear parliamentary scrutiny of its finding—the kinds of
things that will come from the
report.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011329000122" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#14011329000122">I know
that the Minister will want to be reassuring about the
Government’s intentions. In another place, the Pensions Minister
said, in the face of pressure from the Opposition, that he had always
envisaged a model such as the Hutton review, where the review is
chaired by someone who people respect and who has credibility across
the spectrum. That point was underlined by the Minister at Second
Reading. I am happy to accept that the current Pensions Minister means
that. However, even if that proposal were satisfactory, he will not
always be Pensions Minister. I mean no disrespect when I say that I
hope very much that in 18 months he will not be Pensions Minister any
more. I can recommend my right honourable friend Mr Gregg McClymont,

receives a report that is both impartial and credible. We appreciate
the attraction of a panel to ensure that a wide range of views are
reflected in the compilation of the report. However, we have been clear
that we do not think that prescribing a committee is the right way to
go. We do not want to restrict future Governments by prescribing
exactly what the review looks at and who is doing the looking. There is
greater merit in allowing Governments to choose whether to appoint a
single reviewer—as with the review of public service pensions by
the noble Lord, Lord Hutton—or a larger commission, such as the
Pensions Commission. Indeed, the latter, set up by the previous
Government, was made up of three individuals, two from the worlds of
academia and business, neither of which, incidentally, was mentioned in

regular basis than the five years envisaged here. To pick up the
timings that we have experienced, there is the example of Independent
Public Service 
<?notus-xml column=50?>Pensions Commission. The noble Lord, Lord Hutton, was appointed in June
2010 and reported some nine months later, in March 2011. In the
intervening period the noble Lord held two calls for evidence,
undertook a research event, published an interim report and published
his final report. It is clear that a lot can be done in the space of a
year, and that is the kind of period that we imagine is about the right
length of time required for a review.</hs_para>

areas of longevity, healthy life expectancy, socioeconomic variations,
trends in the labour market and so on, and they tend to be published on
a much less regular basis than this. I want to be clear, though, that
the groups indicated in Amendment 57A and many others should all be
encouraged to participate and contribute in the process. Indeed, the
review has been designed to ensure that both Parliament and
stakeholders will have ample opportunity to participate in the process
and shape the outcomes. Furthermore, because the reviews will be
regular, stakeholders may indeed be able to better prepare and
contribute than they are now.</hs_para>

Government decide to bring forward changes to the pension age, then
those changes must be secured through primary legislation and subjected

have such extensive and political input at the data-gathering and
analysis stage risks stymieing the process before information can even
be provided to the Secretary of State. Indeed, the House of Commons

Drake:</Member></B> I thank the Minister for his comments. I certainly
was not trying to overleverage my experience on the Pensions
Commission; that was not necessarily the main driver for my amendment.
I shall respond to some of the points that he made. In Clause 26 the
periodic review on the state pension age is a standing arrangement,
which is why it provides an opportunity to create an independent
commission in support of that arrangement. It is not a case of a
one-off job and then it finishes, otherwise it would not be in the
Bill. It 
<?notus-xml column=51?>is obviously intended as a standing arrangement, which is meritorious; I
do not disagree with that. However, that is materially different from a
one-off commissioning of something. It says that if you are going to
have this standing arrangement and periodic reviews and assess whether
the current rules on state pension age are fit for purpose, that lends
itself to being supported by a commission on a standing
basis.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011329000134" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#14011329000134">Again,
on reading Clause 26 it is not simply dealing with the narrow issue of
the state pension age rules, it is also quite clearly saying it will
review other factors relevant to the review. The implication in that
must be that the Government recognise that complexities would arise
around the demographic challenge. That would need to be understood in
order to influence policy decisions across a range of issues. Again, a
standing commission would be able to assist in looking at that wider
range of factors that would inform the review.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14011329000135" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0001.htm#14011329000135">I also repeat the point
I made in moving the amendment because it is really important. The
long-term management of public finances, particularly in respect of
responses to the demographic challenge, would be really helped by
having a standing commission. The fact that so much progress was able
to be made on a political consensus that we are still getting the
reward from was because there was a commission. It was able to present
the issues and the case to Governments and political parties, as well
as the country as a whole, in such a compelling way that it drives,
almost from a sense of political responsibility, a consensus on the
long-term management of public finances on that issue. It would be a
shame to lose
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011329000136" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0002.htm#14011329000136">Sustainability
is a long-term project. Secretaries of State change, Governments
change, but as a society we want a political system that delivers
rational policies that give us good long-term outcomes. The one thing
that characterised pensions in the last 20 years of the previous
century was the incremental decisions that Government after Government
made about both the private and public pension system. When you stood
back you could see the complexity and the dysfunctionality of what the
political system, motivated as it might have been in each instance in a
very positive way, created. Certainly, when employers started to
withdraw from the private pension system it started to show the
weaknesses of our political system.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14011329000137" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0002.htm#14011329000137">If we are looking for
long-term effective management of public finances, the sustainability
of the private pension system and the demographic response over the
long term this strikes me as a way to go forward. To take an anecdotal
example, I remember telling my 
<?notus-xml column=52?>husband that I was about to go and tell the whole country that they had
to work significantly longer and we could not even promise that even
the first forecast of how much longer they would have to work would not
be increased further in the light of experience. He thought that I was
committing career suicide and could not believe that I could possibly
do that. I explained to him that the evidence was so compelling and if
one cared desperately about a pension system and the interests of the
people in this country you had to have the courage to take that debate
out to people.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14011329000138" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0002.htm#14011329000138">I can remember the CBI
being horrified at the thought of having to retain older workers. I can
remember trade unions being mortified at the prospect of the default
retirement age being raised or abolished because it was a stalking
horse for raising the state pension age. However, because you had a
commission you could have a much more positive influence on that
debate. I remember, as I am sure the Minister will experience, lots of
people from around the world, particularly in Europe, asking how the UK
managed to get such a consensus from the country about the reforms that
needed to be made to the pensions system and the state pension age in
particular. I genuinely think that one of the reasons that was
possible, compared with some of the problems that are being experienced
in other countries, is because the analysis and the narrative that were
taken out to people were not just the product of party politics. They
were the product of a commission that sought to identify the issues and
the choices on the basis that even if you did not make a choice, that
by definition was a choice because you would be inevitably moving along
a certain line.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14011329000139" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140113-gc0002.htm#14011329000139">I think that that is
right. There are 60 million people in this country who have an
investment over the very long term, either for themselves, their
children or their grandchildren, so we must get this right. What is
there to fear in trying to sustain the political consensus by having a
group of independent people who assist that process by being able to
assist with the narrative and identify the issues? It is that passion
that makes me move the amendment, not just that I happened to be on a
commission at a point in time. I beg leave to withdraw the
amendment.</hs_para>

priority to ensure that all adults in England have the basic literacy

steps to support Further education (FE) institutions in improving their

Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Department for
Education announced plans to provide funding to help FE institutions
recruit new high quality mathematics and English teachers and enhance
the skills of existing teachers in these areas. This includes a
£15m bursary scheme during 2013-15 to attract graduates to train
as specialist mathematics or English teachers; an
enhancement programme launched nationally in October 2013 to help
numeracy and vocational teachers in FE improve mathematics teaching to
GCSE level; a similar programme to enhance the skills of existing
literacy teachers to be piloted in colleges in spring 2014; and
dissemination of innovative and best practice in the teaching of these
subjects to post-16 students in spring 2014. A £20m support
programme during 2014-16 focused on building the capacity of FE
teachers to teach level 3 mathematics qualifications was also announced
recently. These initiatives will improve the quantity and calibre of
teachers in FE.</hs_para>
