Government there was no attempt even to measure how much business was
going to SMEs, but we are now measuring that and improving it. We have
cut out a lot of the bureaucratic nonsense that often prevented small
businesses from even being able to bid for business, let alone win it.
The result of that, as my hon. Friend says, is that nearly one fifth of
Government business goes to SMEs one way or another. It is our ambition
for that to rise to 25%, and I am optimistic we can achieve

stories—incredibly moving and brave stories. We should thank
them for the work they have done in going into school after school,
college after college, to remind people of the dangers of what happened
and how we should drive out hate and prejudice from every part of our
national life. The Holocaust Commission has been set up—it is
cross-party, with representatives from all parties—to ask the
question: as, tragically, these Holocaust survivors come to the end of
their lives, what should we do as a country to ensure that the memory
of this never fades? Should that be a new museum, a new way of
remembering, or a way of recording their memories?

Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mrs Theresa
May):</Member></B> With permission, Mr Speaker, I will make a statement
regarding the Government’s proposal to relocate some of the most
vulnerable refugees who have fled the conflict in Syria. The whole
House will join me in deploring the appalling scenes of violence and
suffering that we have witnessed in Syria. More than 100,000 people
have been killed, and the credible reports of systematic use of torture
and starvation are simply sickening. Millions of innocent people have
fled their homes. There are now more than 11 million Syrians in
desperate need, including 6.5 million people displaced inside Syria and
more than 2.3 million refugees in neighbouring countries, at least half
of whom are
children<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T12:36:16"></hs_TimeCode>. The
numbers are staggering and the scale of the crisis is immense. The
Prime Minister has rightly called it the greatest refugee crisis of our
time<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T12:36:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012951000003" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0001.htm#14012951000003">The
greatest contribution we can make is to work to end the conflict
altogether, using UK diplomacy and our international influence to
support the negotiations taking place in Geneva at this moment, and
that is precisely what we are doing. Our goal is a peaceful settlement
that enables a political transition and an end to the violence in
Syria. That is the only way to create the conditions for all Syrian
refugees to do what they most want to do, which is to return to their
homes and livelihoods in
peace<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T12:36:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012951000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0001.htm#14012951000004">We
are also leading the world in responding to the humanitarian disaster.
Britain is the second largest bilateral donor in the world after the
United States. We have provided £600 million for the Syrian
relief effort so far, of which £500 million has already been
allocated to support refugees and the internally displaced. We are
helping Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq and Turkey to support those who have
sought refuge there. As a result of our assistance, 320,000 people a
month are being given food, 900,000 a month have drinking water, and we
have enabled almost 316, 000 medical consultations to take
place<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T12:37:35"></hs_TimeCode>. This is
the UK’s largest ever response to a humanitarian crisis, and it
comes on top of our efforts to secure humanitarian access inside Syria
and to provide essential materials such as shelter, blankets and stoves
to help vulnerable Syrians to survive the
winter<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T12:37:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012951000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0001.htm#14012951000005">The
greatest need is in the region and it is there that the United Kingdom
can make the largest impact. The Prime Minister made it clear last week
that our country has a proud tradition of providing protection to those
in need, and where there are particularly difficult cases of vulnerable
refugees who are at grave risk, we are ready to look at those cases.
Following consultations with the London office of the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees in recent days, I can tell the House
that the Government will be launching a new programme to provide
emergency sanctuary in the UK for displaced Syrians who are
particularly
vulnerable<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T12:38:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012951000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0001.htm#14012951000006">The
programme—the vulnerable person relocation scheme—will be
based on three principles. First, we are determined to ensure that our
assistance is targeted where it can have the most impact on the
refugees at greatest risk. The programme will focus on individual cases
where evacuation from the region is the only option. In particular, we
will prioritise help for survivors 
<?notus-xml column=864?>of torture and violence and for women and children at risk or in need of
medical care who are recommended to us for relocation by UNHCR. That is
where we, as the United Kingdom, can make a distinctive contribution.
For example, some of the worst abuses in the Syrian conflict involve
the use of sexual violence, including in regime detention centres. The
UK’s preventing sexual violence initiative is working to end
those crimes  globally. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has
deployed teams of experts to train Syrians to document and investigate
crimes of sexual violence and enable  future prosecutions. The
Department for International Development is prioritising the protection
of women and girls, including providing clinical care for
12,000 Syrian refugee survivors of sexual and gender-based
violence in Jordan. Looking at examples such as these through our
resettlement scheme, without excluding any others, will help promote
our wider goal of ending war-zone sexual violence. That is an approach
co-ordinated across the whole of
Government<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T12:39:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012951000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0001.htm#14012951000007">Secondly,
the scheme will be run in addition to the two resettlement programmes
the Home Office operates in partnership with the UNHCR: the gateway
programme, which settles 750 refugees from a small number of targeted
locations every year; and the mandate resettlement scheme, which is
designed to resettle individual refugees who have been recognised as
refugees by the UNHCR and have a close family member in the UK who is
willing to accommodate them. It will also be in addition to the asylum
claims that we have been considering—and will continue to
consider—under our normal rules. Since the crisis began, we have
taken in nearly 3,500 Syrian asylum seekers, the fourth
highest number in the European Union, with 1,100 Syrian nationals
recognised as refugees in the year to September 2013.</hs_Para>

because we want to focus our assistance on the most vulnerable people,
we do not intend to subscribe to a quota scheme. I want to make it
clear to the House, therefore, that this programme will run in parallel
with the UNHCR’s Syria humanitarian admission programme and we
will work in close consultation with UNHCR offices in London, in Geneva
and in the region.</hs_Para>

UNHCR built up over many years and £61 million of UK

House and our whole country can be proud of the role we are playing in
supporting the Syrian people at a time of great crisis. British money
is helping to provide food, water and shelter to hundreds of thousands
of displaced Syrians every day. We are granting asylum to those who
need it, consistent with this country’s proud tradition of
giving help to those who need it most, and through the relocation
scheme that I have announced today we will be providing emergency
sanctuary to the people who are most at risk, including victims of
torture and violence. But the only way for the violence and suffering
to end is with a negotiated political transition and the Government
will spare no effort in working to find a peaceful solution to the
crisis that will allow refugees to return home. I commend the statement

and common sense have prevailed over the Government’s resistance
last week. Britain is rightly providing help and assistance to the
majority of refugees that have claimed sanctuary in the neighbouring
countries—Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey—and is rightly
leading international efforts, but the Opposition and many others have
argued for some time that a minority of refugees are too vulnerable to
cope or survive in the camps: the abandoned children, torture victims,
women who have been abused and those who need medical help.</hs_Para>

particularly welcome the Government’s commitment to helping the

series of questions about her announcement today. First, I welcome her
announcement that these places will be in addition to the places
provided by the UN to the existing UN gateway and mandate programmes.
Countries such as France, Finland and Austria have each agreed to take
about 500 refugees, and the Netherlands 250. The right hon. Lady has
not set a specific figure, but can she confirm that she expects Britain
to provide similar levels of sanctuary?</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14012951000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0001.htm#14012951000015"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T12:44:57"></hs_TimeCode>Secondly,
can the Home Secretary confirm that the refugees to whom Britain offers
sanctuary will also have access to specialist help and
support—for example, working with many of the excellent
charities that help those who have suffered great trauma and
abuse?</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14012951000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0001.htm#14012951000016"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T12:45:18"></hs_TimeCode>The
right hon. Lady says that much of the programme will in fact be
delivered by the UNHCR, and she will know that all the things she says
she wants to do—the three principles she set out—are
possible within the UN Syria programme. Some countries within it have
set specific figures; some, such as the US, have not set what she would
call a quota, but are still operating within the UN programme. So my
third question is: is what she has announced effectively the UN
programme, but with a different
name<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T12:45:43"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012951000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0001.htm#14012951000017">Fourthly,
will the Home Secretary agree to look again at her net migration
target? I am sure she agrees with me that there is a world of
difference between immigration policy and border control on the one
hand, and giving 
<?notus-xml column=866?>sanctuary to those fleeing persecution on the
other<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T12:45:59"></hs_TimeCode>. Refugees

second question, about specialist help and support. We will of course
look to the arrangements we have used for the gateway programme, for
example, to see the extent to which we will be able to relocate
refugees in line with our existing structures and relationships with
local authorities, but there will be people, identified on a
case-by-case basis, who need very particular assistance—perhaps
very particular medical assistance. We will of course seek to ensure

Teather</B> (Brent Central) (LD):</Member> Having visited Jordan and
seen the conditions in which Syrian refugees are living, I am
absolutely delighted that the Home 
<?notus-xml column=870?>Secretary has made this statement—I hope that it gives her heart
to think that doing the humane thing for refugees is often popular and
not always unpopular. I am a little disappointed
that we are not signed up to the UNHCR’s scheme, but so long as
we are working hand in hand with it to identify the vulnerable people,
that is what is most important. I ask her to keep under review the
priorities she has set as the crisis unfolds, because the people who
are the most vulnerable may well change over time. If we are to have
our own programme, rather than the UNHCR scheme, that might be
important<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T13:00:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012951000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0001.htm#14012951000048"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mrs May" PimsId="1758" UID="14012951000143" xid="420" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0001.htm#14012951000143">Mrs

to look at the priorities we have set. As I have said, those priorities
tie in with other work we are doing in the region. I think that it is
important to have that degree of flexibility, which is what having our
own scheme gives us. However, I reiterate the point I made in answer to

Gentleman<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T13:04:28"></hs_TimeCode>. I do
not think that countries that take a separate route, working with the
UNHCR to identify vulnerable cases, undermine the international
community’s ability to provide support, aid and help to those
who are vulnerable as a result of the Syrian conflict. I think that
what we are doing is absolutely appropriate. We will be working with
the UNHCR, as I have said, but we have identified a bespoke scheme that
will allow us to focus on particular groups of people, such as victims
of sexual violence and women and children who are at risk or in need of
medical assistance. We will be able to prioritise those groups within
the scheme in a way that would not have been fully possible under
another

the Home Secretary’s statement. I visited a Syrian refugee camp

Britain is providing, but I have to tell her that in three days not a
single refugee told me that they wanted to relocate to Britain, or
indeed any other country; they wanted to go home and to be free from a
murderous regime. I think that we need to keep that in mind when

political resolution and a smooth transition in the government of

would be foolish of me to pretend that the boundaries of principal
local authorities preoccupy many people. People care about many things,
but local authority boundaries are some way down their priorities. MPs,
however, get somewhat nervous at talk of boundaries. We can all recall
the recent debacle of the misconceived legislation on parliamentary
boundaries and the panic that surrounded it. Many an MP has a love-hate
relationship with his or her local council, irrespective of whether the
party that controls it is of his or her persuasion. Indeed, it is
sometimes better for the MP if the controlling party is not the one to
which he or she
belongs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012952000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0001.htm#14012952000010">None<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T13:26:41"></hs_TimeCode>
of that should persuade us that everything in the garden is beautiful
and that we should put up with the local government boundaries that we
have. Boundaries are neither uncontentious nor inevitable. There has
been a constant process of revision and evolution since the
Redcliffe-Maud proposals ushered in the modern age. We have seen a
range of things: the establishment of unitaries, the disappearance of
counties and councils, the abolition of the metropolitan counties, the
creation of the Greater London authority, and sundry minor
tweaks.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012952000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0001.htm#14012952000011">Many<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T13:27:39"></hs_TimeCode>
of the objections to boundary reviews have disappeared. At one time, it
was held that a primary local authority must be of a given size. That
requirement made a fair deal of sense when the local authorities ran
all the schools before the legislation on academies and the like. We
now live in an age when local authorities are losing control even of
social services, as social care merges with health care and presumably
comes under health and wellbeing boards. We also live in an age when
councils share back-office functions and chief executives; outsource
many of their functions; and co-operate in city region councils that
look like the old metropolitan counties. The priority now is not size
or scale, but local effectiveness and
responsiveness<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T13:28:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012952000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0001.htm#14012952000012">Where
the council is not the best or most appropriate local voice, there will
be demand for reconfiguration, the establishment of new councils, the
reassignment of communities to neighbouring authorities or changes to
the boundaries. The problem is not whether that should 
<?notus-xml column=879?>happen, but how it is to happen. The remit of the Local Government
Boundary Commission is covered by two recent Acts: the Local Democracy,
Economic Development and Construction Act 2009 and the Local Government
and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007. Under the current
legislation, there are three ways to engineer change: the Local
Authority Boundary Commission can unilaterally decide to conduct a
review, although it has no responsibility for implementing any review
that it deigns to recommend; a council can ask for a review; or the
Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government can initiate a
review by asking the Local Government Boundary Commission to
act.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012952000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0001.htm#14012952000013">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T13:29:27"></hs_TimeCode>
first two steps are unlikely. Councils do not vote for the change, just
as turkeys do not vote for Christmas, and civil servants on commissions
do not usually rock boats. Sadly, the Secretary of State has made what
is almost a policy decision that he is not minded to recommend further
reviews in this Parliament. In effect, no major boundary review of a
major authority is likely to take place any time soon. I would
therefore argue that the public voice is silenced, which is not in the
spirit of the times.</hs_Para>

want an elected mayor and to establish parish councils. However, they
have absolutely no power to contest who runs their community. My Bill
would change that by obliging the Local Government Boundary Commission
to respond to public petitions, on the condition that the petition
passes the same threshold as is necessary to force a vote on an elected
mayor, which I believe is 10% of the electoral roll. Most people would
accept that as an appreciable hurdle. A further condition could be put
in place that it is the clear will of 20% of the wards making up a
local authority. That, too, would count as reason to get the commission

will briefly give the example of my own local authority, Sefton, one of
the Merseyside authorities, which is named after a hard-to-find little
village in the middle of it. It has two very different centres of
gravity and power—Bootle in the south and Southport on the
Lancashire border in the north. After more than a quarter of a century
of being a hung council, Sefton  
<?notus-xml column=880?>council passed into Labour control in 2011. Even now, the contrast
between the two parts of the borough is extraordinarily stark. In the
last election, in 2012, six of the seven Southport wards returned
Liberal Democrats, with the Tories holding one. Southport has never
elected a Labour councillor, a situation that I hope will be
perpetuated. However, Sefton now has a ruling cabinet composed entirely
of Bootle councillors. All the chairs of the scrutiny committees are
also Labour appointments. I think we would accept that Bootle is
incorrigibly Labour. It had the distinction of having the lowest amount
spent by political parties per elector at the general
election—it amounted to 14p per elector among all parties. It is
fair to say that the floating vote sank a long time ago in
Bootle<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T13:32:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012952000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0001.htm#14012952000016">Understandably,
when the council has to make cuts, Bootle councillors look favourably
on their own patch. In the recent review of library services, three
libraries were closed in Southport but none in Bootle, even though
demand for those services was greater in Southport. Time has made a
dysfunctional local authority appear more dysfunctional, which is why
my local residents’ long-standing concern requires
investigation. I personally favour the division of Sefton into two
local authority
units<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T13:33:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012952000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0001.htm#14012952000017">Such
scenarios are not uncommon, but in Sefton we have the advantage of
having had a review in the past in response to public demand and
petitioning. It was parked for a while—the Local Government
Boundary Commission promised that it would reopen the issue if the
council could better demonstrate that the interests and voices of the
diverse communities in Sefton were not being well served. It was able
to do that, but no solution is currently
available<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T13:33:46"></hs_TimeCode>,

Cooper:</Member></B> I do not know the detailed discussions that the
Home Secretary has had with the UN on the scale of support needed, but
the UN has asked for 30,000 places to be provided across the world.
Even without the British contribution, the UN was already well on the
way to reaching those sorts of numbers, and the contribution that the
UK needs to make can still be significant, even if it is more limited.
Each country needs to look at the kinds of support it can provide, and
also at support that can be provided in the region. My point is that
some small countries are offering places for 50 or 100 refugees, and
when all countries do their bit, even if places are limited, that still
adds up to a significant international humanitarian effort. It is right
for us to support that.</hs_Para>

already part of the UN mandate programme, which helps a limited number
of refugees from around the world who have family in the UK who will
support them, and that programme states clearly that it has no quota.

simply do not understand the reason for not being part of the UN
programme. As we understand it, the UNHCR will do the work of
identifying the most vulnerable refugees. It will provide that support
on  the ground—that is exactly what it does as part of
the UN Syria programme. Many of the elements of the 
<?notus-xml column=886?>Government’s programme—the principles that the Home
Secretary set out earlier—are principles
that can be adopted within the UN programme. Other countries have done
so. It is unclear why the Home Secretary  is so resistant to
biting the bullet and why she wants the UK programme, which looks an
awful lot like the UN programme, to have another
name.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012952000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0002.htm#14012952000056">There
is an explicit advantage of being part of the UN programme. If the Home
Secretary wants to call on countries that have not signed up to the UN
proposal to do so, such as Italy, Portugal, Poland and New Zealand, it
will be much easier if she does not distance herself from the UN
programme. Britain has the aid programmes and bureaucracy to run a
parallel programme, but most of those countries do not. We should
therefore encourage them to work with the UN and to be part of the UN
programme. Surely there is an advantage in saying that the world should
pull together. Britain should not go it alone, because we believe that
no country alone should have to shoulder the burden of any serious
humanitarian crisis. We believe in everyone doing their bit and sharing
the
challenge.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012952000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0002.htm#14012952000057">We
will not fall out over this today. The most important thing is that the
Home Secretary has come forward with a proposal that will help
vulnerable Syrian refugees. The most important thing for the Opposition

most desperate and in need of her help, but I urge her to look again at

me turn to one wider issue before I close my remarks—other hon.
Members have raised it. Hon. Members agree that there is a big
difference between, on the one hand, immigration policy and border

stronger measures to prevent illegal immigration and limit those coming

are inclined to resist any resettlement programme whatever the
circumstances because it will affect the net migration target, which
they are under such pressure to meet. I therefore ask her to give
serious consideration to the net migration target to make it clear to

vulnerable refugees getting caught up with human traffickers. The Home
Secretary rightly referred to people coming to Britain to claim asylum.
Some certainly have, but travelling across a continent and being able
to claim asylum is difficult for the most vulnerable. When people are
vulnerable, they are at huge risk from those who would exploit and
abuse their situation. Part of the reason for the UN Syria refugee
programme was to avoid the challenges they face—some people are

assistance helps those refugees at greatest risk, it will focus on
individual cases where evacuation from the region is the only option.
Secondly, it will be run in addition to the two resettlement programmes
we currently operate in partnership with the UNHCR: the UK’s
gateway protection resettlement programme, which resettles a number of
refugees from a small number of targeted locations every year; and the
smaller mandate resettlement scheme, which is designed to resettle
individual refugees who have been recognised by UNHCR and have a close
family member in the UK who is willing to accommodate them. Thirdly,
because we want to focus our assistance on the most vulnerable people,
we do not intend to subscribe to a quota scheme. Instead, our programme
will run in parallel with the UNHCR’s own Syria

Richard Ottaway</B> (Croydon South) (Con):</Member> The scale of the
human tragedy in Syria is horrendous. More than 130,000 are dead,
including thousands of children; there are documented cases of torture
and summary execution; about 9.5 million men, women and children are in
need of humanitarian help; and 2.3 million refugees, half of
them children, are spilling into neighbouring countries—Jordan,
Turkey, Iraq and Lebanon. Those countries are absorbing 97% of the
massive influx of refugees, and it is threatening their stability.
Lebanon is on course to receive 1.6 million refugees by the end of this
year, which, for that small country, is the equivalent of 20 million
refugees coming to the United Kingdom. Terrorism is back in Iraq, which
has witnessed a resurgence of al-Qaeda. The war in Syria is inflaming
its own sectarian
battles<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T14:24:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012953000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0002.htm#14012953000048">Every
day in Syria, the death toll, the atrocities, and the numbers of
displaced persons and refugees are climbing. Against that relentless
backdrop, the UNHCR wants countries to take 30,000 Syrian refugees in
addition to the current resettlement quotas. That is a drop in 
the ocean. The United Kingdom has taken more than 1,000 Syrian asylum
seekers this year. We have committed ourselves to helping some of the
most vulnerable Syrian refugees, and I welcome the Government’s
announcement today, which confirmed
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T14:24:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012953000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0002.htm#14012953000049">It
is absolutely right for us not to commit ourselves  to
arbitrary numbers. A quota of 500, 1,000 or even 5,000 Syrian refugees
may achieve much in humanitarian terms, but in overall terms it
achieves very little, because it does not tackle the root cause of the
problem. As the Home Secretary pointed out in her excellent speech, the
only meaningful solution to the refugee crisis—the only way in
which to secure a better future for countless innocent
Syrians—is a political solution. The refugee crisis has to be
considered as part of an overarching foreign policy, and not in
isolation. Talks in Geneva this week show us how difficult a task that
will be. There are about 1,200 different rebel groups in Syria who have
no interest in negotiating. Our best hope of dialogue is of dialogue
between Syria’s national coalition and the Government, but they
will not talk face to face: self-interest is getting in the
way.</hs_Para>

uncompromising preconditions being dished out on both sides, the scope
of Geneva II is inevitably limited. Even the deal that was hammered out
to aid trapped residents of the war-torn city of Homs now appears to be
threatened. The rebel alliance on the ground has issued further demands
which it says must be met before anyone can be evacuated. There is
nothing new there—this is politics—but it is costing

we like it or not, political progress in Syria will never succeed
without directly engaging the puppeteers of this war of attrition. If
Iran and the Gulf states withdrew their cash and supplies of arms on
the Syrian battlefield, refugees would have some prospect of a safe
return. We must stop the supplies of deadly arms, and put pressure on
the armed militias that are terrorising Syrian communities. The United
States and Russia have discussed a ceasefire in Syria, and only a
ceasefire will make the delivery of humanitarian aid to the besieged,
rebel-held areas possible as the civil war intensifies. That has
already happened in some parts of the country, but millions are still
trapped and under siege, and beyond the reach of help.</hs_Para>

They should be contributing more to the humanitarian effort where the

many past, and sadly some present, attitudes to the treatment of
refugees, including in the UK, are difficult to justify. We should
never forget that, after the Anschluss in March 1938, rather than
relaxing entry requirements for Austrian Jews, the British Government
tightened them, introducing strictly controlled visas precisely to
restrict their numbers. With the benefit of hindsight, we understand

part in the debate. I commend the motion and the way in which it was
moved. I unreservedly welcome the efforts of the Home Secretary and
many Front-Bench colleagues to respond to the crisis. I wanted to take
part in the debate because the right hon. Member for Normanton,
Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper), who speaks for the
Opposition, moved the motion in a conciliatory and considered manner. I
thought over the past couple of weeks that that was not necessarily the
tone being taken by people outside. I felt strongly that there was a
danger that a Government who had done an extraordinary amount in
relation to the crisis might end up on the wrong side of the
argument.</hs_Para>

Government’s basic position is absolutely correct, as all
colleagues have tended to endorse. It is best to help in the region
where people are concentrated, and the extraordinary efforts being made
by neighbours have been helped by the most generous contribution that
this country has ever made to such a crisis abroad. 
<?notus-xml column=898?>However, as times and needs change, a bit of flexibility is not always a
bad thing. Therefore, the response to what the UN has been saying has

all colleagues have said, it is important to work with the UN. We have
been its biggest supporters in going around the world asking for higher
contributions to meet its appeals. As colleagues have mentioned, a
number of countries have not stumped up. It would have been difficult,
had we done all this, if the UN had turned on us and said,
“You’re not doing enough.” It  is good,
therefore, that we have reached this position.  It is better
than just taking a slightly smaller number of people. Targeting the
people we can help most, particularly those caught up in sexual
violence, bearing in mind all that my right hon. Friend the Foreign
Secretary has done in relation to this, makes an even more important
point. The help is targeted, and I think that the response has been

a wider issue, I too, as colleagues would know and expect, have visited
those who have been working with refugees in Lebanon, Turkey and
Jordan. There is hardly enough that we can say about the generosity and
hospitality of those countries, or about the skill and expertise of our
own aid workers—often technical specialists in the camps and
outside. I visited a small town in Jordan where people had been
decamped. They are in the local economy and that puts pressures on as
well, to which we have been
responding<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T14:38:09"></hs_TimeCode>.
However, the extraordinary skills that people have been displaying to
assist those who work for the NGOs and who work through DFID, have all
played a part. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has done a
tremendous job in keeping up interest in relation to that. Therefore,
the combination of what the UK is giving by working locally and the
response here has been particularly
effective<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T14:38:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012953000069" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0002.htm#14012953000069">One
or two colleagues say that we should take special notice of Christian
victims. I have not spoken much on the matter before. It was a policy I
was looking after, but I want to make two or three quick points because
it is an important issue. It is undeniably true that the Christian
community in the middle east has been under particularly severe
pressure in a region where lots of people have suffered, but the answer
is not to single them out but to say that the rule of law has to
protect all. The importance of that is that it is not being politically
correct; it is ensuring that Christians are not identified with the
false claim of the extremists that it is a western construct and a
western religion. To give any sense to that and to say, however well
meaning, that there is a welcome for them in a “Christian
country” feeds that narrative and assists the extremists.
Therefore, I urge colleagues and people outside who are rightly
concerned about the Christian community to take a lead from his Royal
Highness the Prince of Wales and Prince Ghazi of Jordan, who are
working with Muslim leaders in the region to recognise the particular
issues facing Christians and to work through those leaders to provide
relief

that it is winning. We talk about there being no foreign intervention
in Syria, but there is. The boots on the ground are from Iran and from
Hezbollah, and support is coming from Russia. In addition, the Gulf
countries have supported those groups that they believe to be in a
position to remove the regime, but they should be focusing all that
attention on the official opposition, rather than on the extremists.
Starvation and sieges are being used as weapons, which is one of the
reasons why it is difficult to get stuff into the country. The regime
has played a desperate role in relation to the citizens who have been
caught up in the conflict. I believe that extra pressure needs to be
placed on the regime. We also need to work with Russia, because it is
in that country’s interests that the conflict should end sooner
rather than later. The sad truth is, however, that it will end only
when that suits other people’s interests, and not, alas, the
interests of the people of Syria. We should never lose sight of that

implementing the humanitarian obligation towards refugees. It has been

proposition that has been aired in the course of the past 24 hours is
that people do not want to see us being dictated to by the United
Nations. The United Nations is not in a position to dictate; it is not

have also seen a change of policy. I am glad to say that there has been
no sense of triumphalism. Those terrible words “U-turn”
have not been used as far as I can recall at any stage of the debate.
That is because common sense and humanity have prevailed. It is said
that the proposals that the United Kingdom Government want to talk to
the United Nations about will have flexibility—flexibility no
doubt over the particular qualifications of an individual that would
demand that they be included in the UK-UN programme. I hope, too, that
flexibility will also apply to the question of numbers. If we had to
set some arbitrary limit, then, as ever, there will be deserving cases

Friend the Member for North East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt) in
relation to the suggestion that somehow the British effort should be
confined to Christians. That is something that was raised by Mr Nigel
Farage. On one day, he said that he was in favour of us taking our
responsibility. On 30 December, on the Jeremy Vine show, he said that
he was in favour of that responsibility only so far as it extended to
Christians who had been persecuted. Let me put it this way: I would
find it very difficult to distinguish between a woman who had 
been raped as a Christian or a Muslim. I would find it 
<?notus-xml column=902?>equally difficult to distinguish between two children who had suffered
grievous injury on the basis that one was a Christian and the other a
Muslim. The whole point about humanitarian recognition is that it
should be universal. Anything less than that is of considerable damage
to the obligation.</hs_Para>

will end on a slightly lighter note. Much has been said about the
contribution made by refugees in this country. Let me take the House
back to the wonderful Olympic games of 2012 and to Mr Mo Farah. Having
won his second gold medal—he won the first in the 10,000 metres
and the second in the 5,000 metres—and still panting with the
exertion of the race, a microphone was thrust under his nose by someone
from the BBC, who said, almost as his first question,
“Wonderful. Well done. Would you not like to be representing
your own country?” Mr Farah, who came here when he was six, was
standing there with a Union flag around his shoulders. He said,
“No, this is my country now.” If ever there was an
illustration of the contribution that refugees can make to the quality
of life and the achievement in a society such as ours, it is surely to

Elfyn Llwyd</B> (Dwyfor Meirionnydd) (PC):</Member> I am proud to be a
signatory of today’s motion. A few months ago, Plaid Cymru voted
against military action in the wake of the suspicions over the Syrian
regime’s use of chemical weapons. If an attack had gone ahead
then, we would not have seen the relinquishing of the chemical weapons.
I should also add that since that decisive debate and vote, Iran has
been persuaded to enter talks on its nuclear programme. For the first
time in years, there appears to be a better prospect of some agreement.
I am not naïve about this, but there are signs of progress. Only
time will tell whether I am right, but President Rouhani shows strong
signs of being willing to engage with the rest of the world. The
avoidance of military intervention last year undoubtedly helped to
create the space for that to happen. However, I must express
disappointment that Iran is not at the table at Geneva II. None the
less, there is a growing consensus that those talks are now
Syria’s only hope, and we must not lose sight of their
importance. Journeys to peace are seldom without their roadblocks, and
there are certainly no shortcuts. To be utterly fair to the Government,
they have led the way in appealing for and sending aid to Syria, as

somebody’s suffering can be alleviated nearer home, it is always
better to do that than displacing them to a country further away. I
fully agree with that. I urge the Government, even at this late stage,
to consider the UNHCR scheme. I have heard what the Secretary of State
has had to say on the matter, and there is some force in her argument,
but I cannot understand why we are not part of the scheme.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T14:58:52"></hs_TimeCode>The
all-pervading hysteria about migration of any sort seems to have
clouded the issue. Surely humanity should dictate what we all do. When
I questioned the Home Secretary earlier on, I made the point that the
refugee status under international law is entirely different and should
in no way be affected by the toxic debate about migration, to which we
are all being subjected by the media. As one who does not have any
nightmares about the UK Independence party or about Farage and that
bunch, I add that Wales has a long and proud tradition of welcoming
people from around the world. I urge the Government to involve the
Welsh Government in this most important of policies. Plaid Cymru has in
the past called for Wales to be taken into account by the Migration
Advisory Committee, which develops policy. The committee works with
Scotland and Northern Ireland but, for some reason, not Wales. I hope
that there will be a change in that policy shortly.</hs_Para>

should detail them. We all realise, I am sure, that Russia is key to
persuading Assad and his supporters to reach some form of reasonable

evoking the Ugandans, it is important to remember that in 1972, this

remember that we took in 50,000 Cypriots. In thinking of the Vietnamese

Teather</B> (Brent Central) (LD):</Member> As I said during the
statement, I am absolutely delighted that Britain is to take refugees
for resettlement. I have a particular interest because I visited
projects serving Syrian refugees in Jordan last November. They included
projects inside Zaatari camp provided courtesy of the UNHCR by Doctors
of the World, UNICEF and Save the Children, and outside the camp by the
Jesuit Refugee Service.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14012954000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0002.htm#14012954000039">It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T15:15:13"></hs_TimeCode>
seems to me that there are three reasons why it was right of Britain to
agree to take some of the most vulnerable refugees for resettlement.
The first two have been spoken about quite a bit, but the third has
not. The first—humanitarian reasons—is obvious. I will
offer a few remarks on that from my experience in Jordan.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14012954000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0002.htm#14012954000040">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T15:16:22"></hs_TimeCode>
second reason is solidarity. That was clear to me when looking at the
pressure that taking so many refugees puts on Jordan, a country that
already has difficulties, with enormous pressure on services. The
generosity of Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq in providing for the
huge exodus of refugees from Syria is
extraordinary—staggering—especially when one considers
the debate here about taking just a few hundred. Like others who have
spoken today, <hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T15:16:11"></hs_TimeCode>I
think it would have been better had we chosen to take part in a UNHCR
programme. It would have easier for us to make the arguments of
solidarity, but if we are working hand in glove with the UNHCR, that is
probably the most important
thing<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T15:16:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012954000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0002.htm#14012954000041">The
third reason, about which few have spoken, is that if there is no legal
route—no hope—for people to get out, the risk increases
that they will take extremely difficult journeys to escape. Already,
the boats coming into Lampedusa are carrying significantly more
Syrians, whereas previously they were dominated by people coming from
Eritrea. That is very worrying indeed and shows precisely the reason
why we need to provide legal routes for people who are desperate to get
out.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14012954000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0002.htm#14012954000042"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T15:17:02"></hs_TimeCode>When
in Jordan, I was able spend a day in Zaatari. It was sobering to see
the conditions for the people living there, which are difficult for
anyone, let alone the very vulnerable groups of people we are talking
about resettling. The UNHCR walked me through the route by which people
get to Jordan, and it is worth rehearsing now. Since Jordan started
managing its borders, the only way into the country from Syria is to
traverse great swathes of wilderness and desert to reach the
easternmost point of Jordan where it borders Iraq. Families have to
sleep exposed to the elements—rain, snow and frost—for
10, sometimes 12, days. We saw the pictures just before Christmas;
those are the sorts of traumatic conditions people are having to
endure, so they are already extremely hungry and tired and often have
no belongings at all.</hs_Para>

UNHCR gives them the basic building blocks to rebuild their life, but
it is a meagre existence for one who previously lived a first-world
life. It is worth our thinking about what it would be like for one of
us—accustomed to gadgets and soft comforts—to go into a
camp such as Zaatari or tried to live in the conditions that many
living outside the camp are coping with
now.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012954000044" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0002.htm#14012954000044"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T15:18:26"></hs_TimeCode>Uniqlo
donated 500,000 items of clothing to Zaatari camp for the winter. That
is staggering generosity. It is worth highlighting when people do good
things in order to encourage them to do more. However, the security
conditions and particularly the toilets in the camp have been driving
many out of the camp to live in host communities, and their plight is
stark. They are reliant on the World Food Programme for food vouchers
and have no access to rent, and they are not allowed to work in Jordan.
Some work illegally, but most send their children to work. I did not
meet a single family, either in the camp or in the host community in
Amman where I visited people in homes, whose children were in school.
That highlights the potential for a lost generation. People are living
in poor, overcrowded, damp and difficult conditions.</hs_Para>

is worth remembering that Jordan has already taken many refugees. It
took many refugees from Iraq in particular, and they still cannot work.
It was also the backbone of the service that the Jesuit Refugee Service
was providing, both its educational project in east Amman and the home
visiting team. To end on a moment of hope, I saw there refugees serving
other refugees, building a sense of community, working from their own
experience and supporting others to integrate in difficult
circumstances. That demonstrates what can be done if we provide people
with the space to serve
others<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T15:20:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-29?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_29_PT_1/F77D5646BE7D3D447422A237FC422D304FA6E577" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="29 January 2014">Wednesday

at significant risk of sexual and gender-based violence. Other Members
have talked already about the reasons—not least the conditions
in the camps. However, the refugees also face more mundane but none the
less significant challenges: the inability to earn money, to feed
themselves, to have housing and shelter, and to be able to educate
their children and to access basic services that will keep them
healthy. The UNHCR says that the majority of refugees are reliant on
humanitarian food aid. We know that food banks in this country are
wrong. The indignity of relying on others for food is a problem, even

have a superb record of aid in the region. That is acknowledged on both
sides of the House. I am sure that the Secretary of State for
International Development will expand on that when she sums up. One
thing remains that needs to be clarified. In opening the debate, the
Home Secretary made much of the distinction between the programme that
she is seeking to implement and the UNHCR programme. However, that is a
distinction without a difference. I agree with the Home Secretary that
the most important element is the response in the region, but in trying
to differentiate her scheme from that of the UN, she said that she did
not intend to subscribe to a quota scheme. However, the UN programme is
not a quota scheme, as she knows. She needs to establish why, other
than for political surface argument, her scheme is different from what
is offered by the flexibility of the UNHCR scheme. She has manifestly
failed to do
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T15:36:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012954000078" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0002.htm#14012954000078">For
every refugee that we take into the UK for resettlement, it will be
life changing. To give one case from my constituency, an Iraqi woman
sought the assistance of my office in bringing her sister’s
family to the UK. They fled Iraq and went to Syria in 2008 when the
husband was killed. Before they could be safely transferred to the UK,
the youngest daughter tragically died of an illness that could not be
treated in Damascus because of what was going on there. I am delighted
that, under the gateway programme, the family have been transferred
safely to the UK for resettlement and are rebuilding their lives in
Manchester. That is wonderful. There must be no confusion between the
UN gateway process, which we have always been a part of and is our
normal process for admitting refugees, and what is being embarked upon
here. For the torture victims, abandoned children and other vulnerable

many hon. Members have wanted to speak in this debate because of the
sheer scale of the humanitarian crisis that is unfolding. As many
people have said, this is the greatest refugee crisis of our time and
we have a moral responsibility to act. The UNHCR predicts that the
number of Syrian refugees fleeing the country will be more than 4
million by the end of the year. That will be the largest refugee
population in the world. None of us have forgotten what the millions of
Syrian people who need help are fleeing from: the death and violence
preceding and following the deplorable chemical attacks on civilians in
Damascus last August. The traumatic images of those attacks are etched
on all our minds. We can only begin to imagine the scars that have been
left on the surviving refugees by a conflict with an estimated death
toll already<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T15:39:07"></hs_TimeCode> of
130,000.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012954000082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0002.htm#14012954000082">In
the face of this enormous crisis and the horrifying number of desperate
people that we can hardly begin to imagine, all that is currently being
asked by the UNHCR is that 30,000 Syrian refugees be admitted to other
countries. I stress that that figure is what the UNHCR thinks is
politically and logistically realistic, not the full number of
vulnerable people who may need to seek refuge on our shores. We should
not get fixated on the figure of 30,000, because the number could be
much higher. Although I welcome the fact that the UK has agreed to help
an unspecified number of refugees, I fear that that number will be very
small.</hs_Para>

want to compare that situation with the huge strain under which
Syria’s neighbours are already buckling. Not surprisingly,
Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon and Iraq are under enormous pressure, and there
is real concern that they may begin to feel that they have to turn
refugees away from their shores. Scores of people trying to escape the
fighting, including families with small children, are already being
denied admission by those neighbouring countries. According to an April
2013 survey, 71% of Jordanians want the border with Syria to be closed
to new arrivals. With thousands of people fleeing Syria every day, that
would be catastrophic. That is why western countries have a moral
responsibility to show solidarity with Syria’s neighbours by
sharing responsibility for protecting some of the people fleeing
Syria<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T15:40:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012954000084" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0002.htm#14012954000084">The
current situation in Syria’s neighbouring countries is
incredibly fragile. For example, the current estimate is that refugees
equating to approximately a quarter of Lebanon’s population of
4.5 million have already fled there, and by the end of the year the UN
expects Lebanon to have 1.6 million Syrian refugees, an enormous 35% of
the population of a country that was ranked 67th in GDP per capita in
2012. We, on the other hand, are a member of the G8 and one of the
world’s largest national economies, and we are potentially being
seen to be quibbling about a tiny number of people. The bottom line is
that I fear we are not doing as much as we

Gentleman’s earlier remarks. He is right to highlight the
pressures that the influx of refugees is having not just on countries
as a whole, but on so-called host communities. Many have seen their
populations literally double, and that is having the sort of effect we
can all imagine. It is stretching health care, hospitals,
schools—I will come on to talk about some of the work we are
doing to support children—water, sanitation and sewerage
systems. The UK was instrumental in working with the World Bank to set
up a trust fund, focused in that case on helping Jordan, to invest in
basic services. We want to ensure that not only are refugees taken care
of, but the people in host communities who have been very generous in
accepting refugees and have been hugely affected by doing so. Another
example, which is part of our work to support children in Lebanon, is
that we have recently provided more than 300,000 packs of textbooks for
children in public schools. Most of the children receiving those
textbooks will be Lebanese and about 80,000 will be Syrian. It is
important that we reflect and recognise the support needed by host

wonderful Teach First scheme, which was about the road to having
qualified teachers in the classroom. Gaining QTS, as I will explain, is
not the be all and end all of focusing on teacher quality, but it is an
important plank of the minimum standards that we would expect. The
attainment gap between children on free school meals and those whose
parents can afford to pay actually widened in 72 out of 152
areas last year. There remains a worrying attainment gap between less
advantaged pupils and those from more affluent families, and current
policy is failing to address that. The most worrying disparities were
in the affluent areas of Wokingham and Buckinghamshire. There is

for some time on the question of education, because it actually relates
to what is taught. I believe that we need proper grammatical rules in
order to ensure that words are used with precision. Like all bodies of
knowledge, however, it evolves over time. There is no tension between
recognising that there are certain grammatical rules and that they
change, in the same way as there is no tension between recognising that
there are certain literary works that should always be in the canon and
that over time they change. For example, Macpherson’s

the House to decide exactly how accurate and helpful it is: in its

the way in which he often puts his case in the House and outside drives
everyone mad. He spoke for more than 20 minutes, and I tried not to
make an unhelpful intervention. There were lots of party political
jibes and counter-jibes. A lot of people out there who are interested
in education want Government and Opposition Members to address the
issues. They want us to say, “Look. There are important
challenges. Together, we can get it right.” I am getting to the

us concentrate on the quality of teaching. There is a great deal of
stuff out there on the priorities. I still go to more schools than most
Members of Parliament. My great hobby and passion is going to schools
and assessing them. When I became Chairman of the Committee, I did not
know how to read a school. Only when I did my first inquiry into
primary education did I learn. Really good experts took me into schools
and said, “This is how you read a school. This is how you can be
conned by the up-front presentation.” I got a kind of Ofsted

of codology. I assure hon. Members that they can go to schools where
somebody on the staff will say awful things such as, “You
realise that we can’t teach here. We’re just social
workers.” It drives me mad when they say that. The fact is that
all good teachers look at the child holistically. Many of a
child’s barriers to learning are found in a bad home environment
or the lack of the English language. Children have a complex range of
challenges to surmount to
learn.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012968000095" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0003.htm#14012968000095">Another
thing people say is, “What do you expect us to do with the
children in an area like this one?” They suggest that, because
there is a great deal of poverty and deprivation, children cannot be
taught. One of the great things about Sir Michael Wilshaw as a chief
inspector is his ability to say, “When someone says that to you,
look to the school.” He can say to the head teacher and staff,
“Funnily enough, there is a school not far from
here”—it could even be on the other side of the
country—“with exactly the same social composition in the
neighbourhood. It is doing so much better than you. What is the reason
for that?” That is why I am a great admirer of Sir Michael
Wilshaw. I hoped that the Secretary of State, in his speech today,
would have said what had happened last week to make a modest man, who I
have known for a long time and who ran one of the best academies in the
country, so angry as to accuse the Department for Education of briefing
against him. It has been said outside this House, but I have not heard
the Secretary of State explain why the chief inspector was driven to
make that statement in <I>The Sunday Times</I>.</hs_Para>

chief inspector is excellent and he has a core team. He still struggles
with something that I think goes back to 1972, which is that many

am glad that the shadow Front-Bench team grasp the central importance
of teacher quality to driving up standards in our schools. However, I
doubt I am alone in feeling that today we are living through the
parliamentary equivalent of groundhog day. Almost exactly three months
ago, the Opposition secured a debate on this topic. The House will
remember that during the course of that debate I challenged the shadow
Secretary of State to supply the evidence showing that employing
non-qualified teacher status teachers in our state schools was damaging
children’s prospects, or to provide examples of head teachers
who were taking on unqualified teachers just to save money or sticking
them with low-achieving children. If that evidence was produced, we
could then review the impact of non-QTS teachers on educational
standards and consider, on that evidence, whether to outlaw them. There
was no answer to my question.</hs_Para>

QTS—that he and his team must have been working through the

teachers without QTS should be forced out of a job. I challenged him on

position of the Secretary of State is that, within a strong
accountability system, we should trust head teachers. The number of
non-QTS teachers is reducing. There are many fewer now than when Labour
was in power, and the shadow Secretary of State’s refusal in

reduced, are removed from the system, the shadow Secretary of State
needs to show why that is a good idea. When Charles Parker, the chief
executive of the Baker Dearing Trust, came before the Committee this
morning, he said of people who taught in university technical colleges,
including those with
PhDs<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T17:19:19"></hs_TimeCode>:
“They’re amazing people, they are highly professional,
but they may not be highly professional in the sense of being qualified
teachers.” Before they are got rid of, let us check that there
are not more good than bad; let us ensure that they are not doing good.
If they are doing good and the hon. Gentleman gets rid of them, it will
damage not just his conscience, but the education of the children whom
he is duty bound to protect.</hs_Para>

want to make a point that I have made before and that is incredibly
important. The countries that have been most successful in education
have often forged a cross-party consensus and a wider consensus in
society about education and its role. Look, for example, at Germany,
and at the technical and vocational education system in Switzerland.
Switzerland has a national centre for the use of evidence in education.
A number of people, particularly John Dunford but also
Baroness Morris, have put forward that idea, whose time has come. I
called for it two years ago, when I used the title “Office for
Educational Improvement” and the Secretary of State’s
response was, “We already have such an office—it is
called the Government.” I took that in good humour but I do not
think that that is a good enough answer.</hs_Para>

of the problem with education in this country, under successive
Governments of different parties, is that the line between education
and politics has been drawn in the wrong place. Politicians rightly
decide how much money should be available, how it should be divided and
the legal structure for education, but I do not think that politicians
should get involved in the pedagogy and the curriculum. The
professionals should 
<?notus-xml column=945?>lead on that and I believe that a centre for evidence could play a
crucial role in delivering that.

morale of the teaching profession matters. It is undoubtedly the

there is still more that can be done, led by the profession, to support

must be of a consistently high standard and relevance to enable
teachers to update and refresh their pedagogy and subject-specific

teacher CPD—as the Government’s White Paper “The
Importance of Teaching” highlighted—too little teacher
training takes place on the job, and too much involves compliance with

develop effective practice. The White Paper states that two thirds of

itself to lead and design that process, rather than Whitehall imposing
a model, and a royal college of teaching would be an obvious body to do
that work. A royal college of teaching could provide a strong voice for
teachers to press the case for their ongoing professional development,
including promoting time and resources, and perhaps also acting as an
accreditor of CPD activity so that high standards could be promoted.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T17:31:12"></hs_TimeCode> role of the
Government in establishing a royal college of teaching should be

way to support CPD is by ensuring that each teacher has an individual

Schools would ensure that each teacher had such a plan, and Ofsted
could play a role in reviewing their effectiveness. We also need to

in that situation. Nothing is more important for
opportunity and social mobility than a good education. Mediocrity, low

its verdict. What should the elements of that be? First, there is no
point in shooting the messenger. We cannot confront a problem if we
deny that we have one. We must accept the verdict and vow never to be

fourth point is directed at the Minister so that she addresses it in

have urged Wolverhampton to do, also need help in turning things

capacity in every part of the country. As I said earlier, we should not
shoot the messenger. However, it is not enough simply to pass damning
verdicts and then walk away. If Wolverhampton responds by saying that
it accepts the verdict in the Ofsted report, understands that there is
a problem and wants to turn things around, the Department for Education

Skidmore</B> (Kingswood) (Con):</Member> I echo the remarks made by the
shadow Secretary of State, who said that we should put our differences
aside and start the debate in the spirit of bipartisanship. It might be
helpful to put on the record what we can welcome and agree on. We can
welcome the fact that the number of unqualified teachers has fallen by
3,000 since 2010, down 20% from a high of 18,600 in 2010. We can also
welcome the fact that the proportion of unqualified teachers has
dropped in academies from 9.6% of all teachers in 2010 to 4.8% today.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T17:42:24"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Liverpool, West Derby (Stephen Twigg) was absolutely right to talk
about Teach First as one of the great successes of the previous
Government, and it is booming. In 2015, there will be 2,000 graduates
from Teach First, four times as many as in 2010. This year, the No. 1
destination for Oxbridge graduates is teaching, and we should all be
very proud of that
fact<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T17:42:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012968000164" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0003.htm#14012968000164">We
should welcome the establishment of School Direct, under which 9,580
teachers are being trained in a school setting. The success of School
Direct is highlighted by the fact that demand far exceeds the number of
places. There was demand for 17,700 places, so I hope that the scheme
will grow. It has been proven to have a far better retention rate than
a university-based

should welcome the 363 teaching schools that have been established,
just as we should all welcome the fact that the Government have limited
the number of 
<?notus-xml column=950?>resits for teacher training tests in English and maths. Previously,
people could take that test—and someone did—50 times. We
are ensuring that the PGCE qualification is far more rigorous than it
has been. We should welcome that, just as I welcome the statistic that
has already been mentioned: the proportion of teachers with degrees at
2:1 or higher rose from 48% in 1998 to 62% in 2010 and is now at 71%.

previous Government that there were 17,000 teachers with QTS who were
underperforming and should not be in the classroom, but in the past 15
years, and even up to this day, we see bad teachers not being removed
from the classroom or sacked, but instead being managed out. Up to
2010, only 18 teachers had been removed altogether from the teaching
profession for poor teaching standards. What we see is this

500,000 teachers in place; how many of them will have to go through the
process, and how often? Who will administer the process? Will it be led
by Ofsted or by head teachers? Surely revalidation happens all the
time—that is the role of the school leadership team and the head

bureaucracy.

Dakin</B> (Scunthorpe) (Lab):</Member> The best teachers want to be
better teachers. What is changing fastest is the young people
themselves and the world that they are being prepared for, both as
young people and in the future as citizens and workers. Today, very
young children are adept at using a tablet computer, and anyone who
goes into a primary school will see electronic devices being used to
access information, to draft written text creatively or to make video
clips or other inventive things. The world is changing rapidly and
teachers need to change too. Pedagogy needs to move with the
times<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T17:51:07"></hs_TimeCode>. The best
teachers have always wanted to be better teachers. That is why in my
30-plus years of what was the chalkface and is now the technology
interface, I have always seen teachers talking to each other, keen to
share and develop, and keen to learn in the interests of their
learners.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Liverpool, West Derby (Stephen Twigg) said in a
quite brilliant speech, need to be careful in the way they talk about
these matters. They need to talk about the real world, not the world of
fantasy classrooms, and about what is actually going on out there.
Politicians would do well to start by understanding and celebrating
what is going on in teacher education and ongoing teacher development.
It is worth understanding how important high quality initial teacher
training is in getting recruitment right. We have debated this before,
and the Government’s obsession with School Direct is imperilling
effective teacher recruitment and induction. It may well be that one of
the Government’s achievements is to preside over not only a
school places crisis, but a teacher supply crisis as well, while
continuing with expensive, unproven pet
projects<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T17:52:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012968000186" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0003.htm#14012968000186">There
is a huge amount of excellent practice in schools and colleges, which
any consultation on ongoing teacher development should capture,
recognise and build on. Every hon. Member who has spoken has paid
tribute to the work of teachers throughout the land, and I add my
tributes, but it is important to understand the role of induction and
support in teachers’ early years. When I was a principal, I
always said to staff that supporting a new teacher effectively was one
of the most important jobs they did. Get it right and the benefits are
huge. Get it wrong and the problems are massive. We need to recognise
how appraisal works at the moment, how the process to support staff
going through the threshold works and how the ongoing process of
keeping evidence of personal development that is commonplace in our
schools and colleges works. Anything new needs to build on this.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T17:53:32"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

Dakin:</Member></B> My personal view is that performance-related pay
rarely works in any sphere of life; all it tends to do is push up the
cost of pay without tackling the real issues. I think that separating
pay and performance is helpful, because we need to focus on getting
performance right. If teachers are not up to scratch, we need to tackle
that as a separate issue. I have dealt with that myself. Any good
school or college leader will do that day in, day out—it is not
easy, but it is done. The link between pay and performance, in my
experience, is unhelpful more often than
not.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012968000191" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0003.htm#14012968000191"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T17:56:06"></hs_TimeCode>My

Hinds</B> (East Hampshire) (Con):</Member> It is a pleasure to follow
the hon. Member for Scunthorpe (Nic Dakin), my erstwhile colleague on
the Education Committee, who spoke passionately and, for the most part,
compellingly. I agree entirely that teaching is a noble profession and
a
vocation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012968000193" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0003.htm#14012968000193">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T17:59:51"></hs_TimeCode>
also agree with three key aspects of Labour’s motion. First, it
is obviously right that the quality and effectiveness of a school
system cannot exceed the quality and effectiveness of the teachers in
it. Secondly, those teachers must be able to access the best possible
training and ongoing development, and not just in subject knowledge,
but in classroom management, lesson planning, progress tracking and all
the other things that are so important. Thirdly, I agree about the
importance of validating and revalidating teachers’
effectiveness, because if we want to raise the bar and improve the
overall level, we cannot wait for a turnaround in all the generations
of teachers. I disagree on exactly where and how that validation should
happen, however, as did
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T17:57:15"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Kingswood (Chris
Skidmore).</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012968000194" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0003.htm#14012968000194"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T17:57:17"></hs_TimeCode>There
are also three important deficiencies in the motion. First, in its
headline emphasis on qualified teacher status, it refers to a very
small proportion of teachers. It is often said that no one forgets a
great teacher. Sadly, most of us can also remember at least 
<?notus-xml column=954?>one who was pretty rubbish. I mean that not as a value judgement or a
political point, but as a statement of fact; some teachers are better
than others, and some are just not very good at teaching. That person
we remember was almost certainly a qualified teacher. According to the
2012 work force survey, 96.5% of teachers were qualified, which means
3.5% were not, and the figure is now lower than it was under the
previous Government. As the Secretary of State pointed out, the part of
the country that does best in education is the part with the highest
proportion of non-qualified teachers, and—to add another little
fact—four fifths of them are not on a route towards
QTS.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14012968000195" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0003.htm#14012968000195"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T17:58:17"></hs_TimeCode>Secondly,
the motion is logically inconsistent. If QTS is an irreplaceable
standard that every teacher should reach before being let loose in the
classroom, how can it possibly be acceptable to have someone teaching
who has only just begun the route towards QTS?
Thirdly<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T17:58:40"></hs_TimeCode>, the
motion’s critical deficiency is that it conflates two words that
sound a bit the same but are completely different:
“qualifications” and “quality.” I note that
the conflation extends even to the hallowed institution of our
democracy, the Order Paper, because two days ago it referred to a
debate on teacher qualifications, but today that has morphed seamlessly
into a debate on teacher quality. Either subject would have been an
important and interesting subject for debate, but they are completely
different topics. That is the fundamental problem here.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14012968000196" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0003.htm#14012968000196"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T17:59:16"></hs_TimeCode>I
do not expect a sudden flood of teachers who have not done a PGCE or
other qualification to come into teaching. When Mary Beard appeared
before the Education Committee, she talked about Jamie’s dream
school—I hate to bring it up again—and, when asked what
she would have done differently, said, “A bit of training would
have been nice before going in to teach the kids.” What an
understatement. Of course, an individual going into teaching, let along
the school and the parents, wants to know that they have been properly
trained to cope with the
situation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012968000197" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0003.htm#14012968000197"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T18:01:53"></hs_TimeCode>There<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T17:59:55"></hs_TimeCode>
are, however, circumstances in which somebody has a lot to give, and in
which taking the necessary time out for full
retraining—something like a PGCE—would put them off. They
might be someone who has taught for years in a private school, a
university lecturer, a business leader who goes in part-time to do
lessons in entrepreneurship, or an artist, musician or actor with
unique skills and creativity. I want such things to be available to

than once today. It has what I call a positive disruptive influence in
schools in bringing in new ideas, in new teachers learning from
teachers it already employs and those teachers learning from new ones

years. Before that, I was a teacher for 
<?notus-xml column=956?>15 years in a Catholic primary school with 550 children. For
every one of those 15 years, I was on a professional development
course, whether a diploma or a master’s—I never actually
finished the master’s course—in Welsh, media, science,
computing, religion and a variety of other courses. That did me a power
of good: I loved it and the children benefited from

have to look at the pressures on children today. Many of the facts and
figures that I will give have come from parliamentary answers to
questions that I have tabled. Children today check their phone six
times an hour or every 10 minutes. That is 600 times a day and over
200,000 times a year.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T18:04:43"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Scunthorpe (Nic Dakin) mentioned the positive aspects
that the digital age has brought to teaching, but it has also had
negative effects. Young people make constant comparisons through
Facebook and Twitter. It has brought cyber-bullying. A young person
watches 180,000 adverts by the time they are 18. Those adverts give
mixed messages that confuse children. The fashion industry tells them
to be size zero; the fast-food industry tells them to go large. The
cigarette industry, the sugar industry and the fat industry are all
targeting young people. That is having an effect on their bodies and on
their minds. In America, 8% of children are physically addicted to
computer
games<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T18:05:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012968000212" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0003.htm#14012968000212">In
this country, 32.3% of 16 to 25-year-olds have one or more
psychological condition. They have those conditions when they are doing
their GCSEs, A-levels and degrees. Two per cent. of that age group have
severe attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and 9% have mild to
moderate ADHD. How can young people learn when there are such massive
pressures on them? It does not get much better for 25 to 35-year-olds.
Thirty per cent. of them have one or more psychological condition. Any

key element that could help young teachers and young pupils is
mindfulness. Mindfulness is a way of breathing, relaxing, expressing
gratitude, gaining balance and equilibrium, and gaining focus and
attention, all of which could help people in their education. It also

helps them to flourish as young
individuals<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T18:06:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012968000214" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0003.htm#14012968000214">I

Katherine Weare, has made a fantastic assessment of that evidence base.
I ask Ministers to make their own assessment. Britain is ahead of the
rest of Europe on mindfulness in education. Oxford, Cambridge, Bangor
and Exeter are all centres of excellence. Professor Willem Kuyken,
Professor Felicia Huppert, Professor Katherine Weare and Professor Mark
Williams are the cutting-edge scientists who have proven the science
behind mindfulness. They have proven its contribution to health to the
National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. We now need to
assess its contribution to

have to begin with a confession. I began teaching without any teaching
qualifications. Having left university with a philosophy degree, I took
a job with Liverpool city council as an estate manager. At that stage,
Liverpool city council thought that it needed to employ graduates, but
it was apparent after a week that neither the council nor I knew
exactly what I was supposed to do. I saw an advertisement for Warwick
Bolam secondary modern school in Bootle and within a week I was
teaching 11 to 16-year-olds in what was a surprisingly good and
well-run school. I had to learn quickly on the job because the
tradition in Bootle was that the children felt obliged to play up and
the teacher had to demonstrate that they could exert control. Failure
to do so was a route to a nervous breakdown, resignation and a pretty
unhappy life. The children actually preferred not to mess around, but
the onus was on me to demonstrate that they could be prevented from
doing
so<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T18:09:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012968000220" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0003.htm#14012968000220">After
two quite happy years in the classroom, I was sent a letter by the
Department of Education and Science, as it then was, saying that I was
a qualified teacher. By that time I had moved on to Salesian high
school, also in Bootle, which had become a comprehensive school, where
I taught English, history and social studies. The last of those was a
new subject introduced for embittered 15-year-olds who had been badly
affected by the raising of the school leaving age and were disgruntled
to be there, but it
worked<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T18:10:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012968000221" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0003.htm#14012968000221">It
gets worse. I was then asked to take on A-level sociology, which I
believe to be a much underrated and misunderstood discipline.
Unbelievably, I helped to revise and set the extremely testing and
highly theoretical A-level syllabus and exams for the Joint
Matriculation Board. The students’ A-level results were pretty
good—in line with, or better than, their grades in other
subjects<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T18:10:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012968000222" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0003.htm#14012968000222">After
a happy and successful decade, I moved to a top independent school as
head of religious studies, also teaching some Latin, neither of which
subjects I had taught before. Only towards the end of my career did I
teach philosophy at A-level, which was what my degree was in. In the
meantime, I had done a diploma, an MEd and even, for no apparent
reason, a course in teaching maths, which I found interesting rather
than of any real use in the
classroom<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T18:11:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

therefore clearly cannot argue credibly that teacher training is either
a sufficient or a necessary condition 
<?notus-xml column=958?>for being a good teacher. Indeed, I would probably argue that an
effortless grasp of some subjects, such as that shown by brilliant
mathematicians and the like, often equips people poorly to explain them
to lesser mortals who are struggling to comprehend them.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T18:11:41"></hs_TimeCode> believe that
teacher training can help, inspire and provide a fund of ideas that the
grind of day-to-day teaching might not. It cannot provide commitment
and dedication, which are indispensible to successful teaching, but it
can do much that is good.</hs_Para>

refer hon. Members to the recent, surprisingly enlightened, CBI report
on our education system, “First steps: a new approach for our
schools”. It argues that good schools are those that are well
led and have clear and challenging targets, but that have considerable
flexibility in how they organise themselves and their staff, and that
even an enlightened Secretary of State should back off. It seems to me
that today’s teachers would welcome that. They have a
prodigious, often unnecessary administrative load, and they are already
assessed rigorously in every school worth its salt. To add a national
scheme of revalidation for every teacher, as proposed by Labour, seems
to me overload on top of overload and would not be welcomed by the
profession. It is likely to annoy good professionals, to no real
effect<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T18:12:52"></hs_TimeCode>.
Continuing professional development—we are up for that. However,
Government teacher MOTs would simply produce clones, not charisma, if

regular statements recognising that we have the best teachers ever.
Most of them were trained, I would remind him, under the last Labour
Government. His betrayal of them, however, is in assuming that almost
anybody can march into a classroom and teach our children, which is
wrong. I for one believe that teachers should be required to fulfil a

that our education system is designed to deliver the skills and
knowledge that the young people of today will need to succeed tomorrow,
and a crucial requirement of that is ensuring that their teachers are

teaching as a profession is equally ambitious, and continually strives

great teachers at all levels we must boost the status and enhance the
standards of the teaching profession, attracting the very
best—we have done a bit of that recently—the brightest,
and the most able into the profession. The first step along that path
is to ensure that our teachers are rigorously trained to the highest
standards, and that the merits of the qualifications are properly
recognised. Without such a step it is impossible to guarantee
consistency or the quality of teaching, which in turn jeopardises the

education.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012968000231" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0003.htm#14012968000231">That
teachers must have a first-rate knowledge of the subject and curriculum
in the areas they teach is beyond any reasonable argument, and for
precisely that reason, teaching should remain a graduate profession.
However, possession of subject knowledge is not, of itself, a
satisfactory safeguard to ensure the highest possible standards. Making
certain that all teachers undergo such training before entering the
profession would put minimum standards in place to ensure not only that
teachers are in possession of a solid knowledge of the subject matter,
but that they understand the associated educational and teaching values
that promote high standards of planning, monitoring, assessment and
class management. Achieving qualified teacher status confirms that a
formal set of skills, qualities, and professional standards, recognised

to pupils. The second is the importance of trusting and empowering
heads to be the leaders they are appointed to be under the “use
them or lose them” principle. Third is the importance of
embracing working and learning in today’s global environment,
and fourth is the critical need to bridge the worlds of education and
industry if we are to compete successfully in that global
race.</hs_Para>

think that, like me, every child who goes through education has a truly
inspirational teacher who has an influence on them for the rest of
their life. For me, it was the lady who taught me German during my
final years at school. There were four of us in our A-level class. She
was a truly remarkable woman and I learned as much from her about
character as about language. Being German, she could convey the
language well, but what was truly remarkable about her—it is
fitting to mention this this week as we remember the
holocaust—was that, as we understood it, she and her father had
helped Jewish children to escape from Germany to Britain during the
second world war, and then had to leave the country. That gave her an
understanding, which she conveyed through language and literature, of
compassion and common humanity, of endurance and perseverance, of
selflessness and humility, and of the right priorities for life. I have
never forgotten. She taught me that no insignificant person has ever
been born, that every individual has the capacity to make a remarkable
difference, and that we should all strive to do so. When she arrived in
this country, she had no relevant qualifications for teaching here. She
had the life she had lived, which was worth far more than any paper
certificate when she was teaching
us.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012968000240" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0004.htm#14012968000240">That
brings me to my second point—giving heads the discretion to
appoint the best staff for their school and allowing them the freedom
to exercise leadership in the role entrusted to them. For almost 20
years, I was governor of a small inner-city independent faith school in
one of the most deprived areas of Salford. It was started as a home
school by an inspirational teacher, 
<?notus-xml column=961?>who found other parents asking her to take in their children. She took
on a building—the Victorian building where the first ragged
school in Manchester was housed. She taught those children and led many

professionals.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012968000241" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0004.htm#14012968000241">When
she needed a physics teacher, she found one from
somewhere—someone who had retired or someone from business. She
did similar with music teachers and teachers of many other subjects.
She provided a special education in a small class environment. Most of
the children would never have flourished had they gone to schools
elsewhere in the city. They needed that individual help and support.
Her dedication enthused and pervaded the whole school. To have
inhibited her from exercising that initiative and from appointing staff
of her choice would have been a travesty and a tragic waste of her

Qureshi</B> (Bolton South East) (Lab):</Member> In 1997, when the
Labour party came to power, one of its key mantras was
“education, education, education”. In the years to 2010,
the Labour party spent an enormous amount of money investing in
education: on schools, textbooks and pay to raise teachers’
morale. The educational qualifications and standards in our schools
improved tremendously. That is not the end of the story, however, and
there is still more to be done. This debate on the training of teachers
should be seen in the context of the continuous need to improve the
education of our
children<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T18:25:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012968000251" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0004.htm#14012968000251">The
Secretary of State started his speech by going through a literal
interpretation of the Opposition motion. When I trained as a lawyer, we
were told that judges have three approaches to interpreting
legislation: the literal interpretation, which the Secretary of State
was alluding to; the golden principle, where legislation is applied in
a liberal way; and the mischief rule, which asks, “What is the
mischief that the law intends to deal with?” The mischief we
want to deal with in this debate is that we have teachers in our
schools who are not qualified properly.</hs_Para>

accept fully that there are some teachers without qualifications who
are brilliant. I also accept that there are people with qualifications
who may not be as good, or even competent. That does not mean, however,
that we should not continue to strive for what I call the gold
standard, which is providing training to our teachers. A young teacher,
or someone who has just qualified or graduated, may be excellent in
their subject matter and have a first class honours degree, but the
reality is that in most of our junior and secondary schools they will
be faced with classes of 25 to 30 children, perhaps with various levels
of learning. To set their classes, to deal with the issue of how to
control the classroom, to identify which child may need extra help, and
to look at pastoral care and whether a child is being neglected at
home—those are all part and parcel of a teacher’s work.
If teachers are not qualified and have not received training on these
issues, how will they be able to identify them? How will they
automatically be aware of what to do? That is where the importance of
having some kind of training—we could have a debate on how long
training should last—is surely crucial.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T18:29:49"></hs_TimeCode> am therefore
surprised that Government Members, in particular, are deriding the idea
that teachers should be trained.</hs_Para>

might think this is a bizarre example, but we would not let people
operate on us if they were not fully qualified. A person might say,
“Look, I’ve been in hospital for 10 years and guess what?
I’ve doing all sorts of things. I didn’t pass my exam,
but, because I know what I’m talking about, allow me to operate
on you.” We would not accept that, so why are we willing to make
that compromise with our children’s education? We accept that
what we are trying to achieve will not stop the expert, the talented
musician or the singer coming in and giving children lessons, but our
provisions concern day-to-day teaching in a classroom, where the
teacher will be there for a long time working with the children. The
qualification needs to be good.</hs_Para>

Secretary of State is still unable or unwilling to recognise the key
fact that anyone who watched it—and, indeed, anyone who has
spent any amount of time in schools and in the company of good
teachers—knows all too well: that being a teacher is not about
teaching a subject, but about teaching the class of children in front
of you, and about supporting the development, academic or otherwise, of
each child in that
class<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T18:36:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012968000268" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0004.htm#14012968000268">Teaching
is a test of pedagogy, not of memory. Deep knowledge is good, but it
means nothing if a teacher cannot impart it in a meaningful way to all
the children in the class, and for no group of children is that more 
<?notus-xml column=965?>important than those with special educational needs. During the three
years for which I was a shadow Minister with responsibility for SEN, I
engaged extensively with stakeholders large and small throughout the
country, and the one observation that I heard time and again, from
teachers as well as others, was that teachers are not given enough
training in SEN as it is, during either their initial training or their
continuing professional development. The fact that the Education
Secretary thinks that someone who has had no training whatsoever is a
suitable person to unlock learning for children with SEN is
incomprehensible to me, and is surely contrary to all the best advice
that he must have

the severe cuts in central local authority education teams, which
include specialist teachers and workers such as educational
psychologists who can provide peripatetic support, it is more important
than ever for classroom teachers to know how to teach the entire class
in front of them, not just the high achievers. Figures from the
Department for Education, published last week, show that the attainment
gap between SEN and non-SEN children is widening at GCSE level. That
applies particularly to the EBacc measure, which is completely
inaccessible to many children with SEN. That is a subject for an entire
debate on another occasion, but suffice it to say in the present debate
that more than one in four young people without an identified special
educational need achieved the EBacc last year, compared with fewer than
one in 20 with SEN.</hs_Para>

we<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T18:39:01"></hs_TimeCode> can all

important, however, qualified teacher status can be part of the
continuing professional development that features time and time again
throughout a teacher’s career. That is why the revalidation of
teachers is so important. It should be not just a requirement, but a
right. It is nothing new; we have had appraisals, and we have had
thresholds. Those things are important because they relate to the

may be that, for some of the lunatic fringe that the Secretary of State

their view teachers are just Marxist troublemakers, but they could not
be more wrong. When YouGov asked teachers their voting intentions at
the last general election, 33% said they would vote Tory, 32% Labour,
and 27% Lib Dem. Actually, teachers—I think I am the only member
of either Front Bench in either House who used to be a school
teacher—are a politically moderate, sometimes conservative group
of swing voters. However, the Secretary of State has worked his magic
on them with his advisers. That important group of middle-class swing
voters now says in the latest poll on teacher voting intentions by
YouGov that the support among teachers for the Conservatives is down
from 33% to 16%, the support for Labour is up from 32% to 57%, and the
Lib Dems—actually, if their Minister cannot be bothered to turn

that the Secretary of State has given me some extra time, I will
conclude my speech. As our motion says, no school system can surpass
the quality of its teachers. That is why we need qualified quality
professionals in our classrooms and better continuing professional
development with revalidation to allow teachers to excel in their
vocations. Yes, teaching is a vocation, as anyone who has watched
programmes such as “Educating Yorkshire” or “Tough
Young Teachers” or who has taught at any time in a school will
know. That is why, despite the undermining of the teaching profession
by the man who should be its greatest champion and advocate—the
Education Secretary—teachers continue to put in hours long
beyond their contractual obligations to help educate our children and
build the future of this country. However, they cannot do that for ever
without support and while being undermined, which is why we should
strengthen, not weaken, their professional status, care about the time
bomb of low morale, which this Secretary of State has armed, and pass
this motion. Teachers and parents want a new direction and new
leadership in education.</hs_Para>

this Government, we have seen a huge improvement in the standing and
attractiveness of the teaching profession, which is absolutely where it
should be. New people are being attracted to teaching in droves. We now
have one of the youngest teaching work forces in the developed world,
with the exception of Indonesia and Brazil. Three-quarters of new
teachers entering the profession either have a first or a 2:1 degree,
which is the highest since records began. Teach First is now
the largest recruiter of graduates in our country, and the
programme 
<?notus-xml column=970?>has quadrupled. We are also extending it to more areas of the country
and into early years. We all agree that teaching quality is the No.1
factor in education, and we are determined to raise standards, which is
why we have improved the skills test, making it harder to pass. We have
limited the number of re-sits that teachers can take. We are paying
bursaries and scholarships up to a value of £25,000 in subjects
such as maths, physics and chemistry. Last year, we recruited a record
number of physics trainees.</hs_Para>

the Opposition are saying about the freedom to hire non-QTS teachers is
a complete red herring. There are actually fewer teachers without QTS
now than there were under Labour. If it was such a big issue for Labour
MPs, why did they not do anything about it in their 13 years
of government? There is also little difference between academies, where
96% of teachers are QTS, and maintained schools, where 97% of teachers
are QTS. As the Chairman of the Education Committee said, there is
simply no evidence that that is a problem in our system. We recognise
the importance of empowering head teachers to enable innovation to take
place. We do not believe in central diktat and box-ticking, which is
what we had under the previous Government. That is why we are reforming
teacher pay and conditions and giving schools and head teachers the
ability to reward good performance with performance-related pay,
although there does not seem to be much agreement on the Opposition
Benches about whether that is a good idea.</hs_Para>

school, which offers maths and science for 16 to 18-year-olds, has
hired a psychology lecturer from the university of East Anglia to teach

is only possible because they can hire that person even though they do
not have QTS. Many schools are using subject expertise to find the
extra people that they need.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Liverpool, West Derby (Stephen Twigg) when he said that
there had been too much centralisation and too much of the
“invented in Whitehall” mentality. That is why we have
put in place a school-led system and why we have had 50 teachers over
in Shanghai learning about CPD, peer research and open-door policies
from their colleagues in the teaching profession. That is why we are
interested in the idea of the royal college of teaching. It must be
independent and we would consider funding a good proposition, but the
important thing is that it must be school-led and head teachers must be
empowered to make the decisions.</hs_Para>

the previous Government, we had an approach that decided that Whitehall
and the Secretary of State knew best. We had centrally driven
initiatives, such as the national strategies, that included chunking
and told teachers how they should teach. Rather than empowering
teachers, they deskilled them. As the shadow Work and Pensions
Secretary has said, that led to shocking levels of English and Maths
among jobseekers.</hs_Para>

PISA 2012, England showed no improvement in maths or reading during

the idea that they are keenest to deny when it comes to the crunch. The
success of these schools shows the importance of freedom within a
strong framework of accountability. We have already seen huge

allow schools and head teachers to decide how best to organise and run

unqualified teachers in schools under Labour than there are now. In

Brooks Newmark</B> (Braintree) (Con):</Member> As you are aware, Mr
Speaker, I presented a petition to Parliament on 12 November 2013 on
behalf of my constituents in the parishes of Foxearth and Liston. The
petition, signed by more than 700 residents of Belchamp St Paul,
Belchamp Otten, Foxearth, Liston and Pentlow villages was in opposition
to a proposed solar panel farm. The proposal is for up to 300 acres of
8-foot high solar panels on prime agricultural land—the highest
grade in all of Essex—for a minimum of 25 years, thereby
degrading the land and, most importantly, spoiling the surrounding
landscape. That point is especially important to my constituents, as
the proposed site is on the edge of an area of outstanding natural
beauty and what is known as Constable
country.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012968001400" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0004.htm#14012968001400"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-29T19:28:00"></hs_TimeCode>Before

play an important role in our country’s future energy mix.
Indeed, there is another proposal for a solar farm in my constituency
that I support. It is for a 50-acre solar farm on a disused airfield
near Gosfield. The Gosfield solar farm would be on a brownfield site
and has the support of Hedingham and Gosfield parish councils and the
wider community. I mention that alternative proposal to draw the

that excellent guidance from the Minister, given the quality of land
under consideration—it is grade 2 agricultural land and
protected as such under the national planning policy
framework—and bearing in mind the almost unanimous opposition to
acres and acres of solar panels blighting some of the most beautiful
countryside, not just in Essex but in the country, the siting of this
solar panel farm, unlike the one at Gosfield, is wholly
inappropriate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012968001408" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0004.htm#14012968001408">Unfortunately,
notwithstanding the extremely helpful guidance from the DECC Minister,
planning officers at Braintree district council take a very different
line. Indeed, they say that the Minister’s letter is not worth
the paper it is written on. They state that unless Department for
Communities and Local Government planning regulations are changed
specifically from those indicated in planning practice guidance for
renewable and low-carbon energy, dated July 2013, to exclude grades 1
to 3A prime agricultural land, permission is likely to be given to the
planned solar farms under current regulations.</hs_Para>

assume that arrays are solar panels. The planning officer said that if
the biodiversity condition is met, he is likely to give planning
permission for the initial 40-acre plot. To my mind, that is absurd. It
is absurd because he says that local objections are of little relevance
and that the visual impact has little bearing on his decision, even
though it abuts an area of outstanding natural beauty. It is absurd
because as long as the proposal ticks his biodiversity box, such as
sheep grazing among the solar panels, it is likely to go
ahead.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012968001411" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0004.htm#14012968001411">Imagine,
Madam Deputy Speaker, a Constable painting of some of the most
beautiful Essex countryside, with sheep gently grazing amid 300 acres
of 8-foot high metal solar panels. That goes beyond the imagination of
even the most avant-garde surrealist and Dadaist painter. I strongly
believe that the planning officer should take the other points from the
DECC Minister’s letter into account, which the planning officer
says has no basis in the
guidelines.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012968001412" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0004.htm#14012968001412">Braintree
district council tells me that it will, under current regulation,
approve the application, given that it is for a temporary installation.
However, given the 
<?notus-xml column=982?>damage that will be done to the area, I do not believe 25
years is temporary. Does the Minister honestly believe we should be
building on some of the best food production land in Essex? Me thinks
not.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012968001413" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0004.htm#14012968001413">The
provisions of the national planning policy framework requiring
“a demonstration of necessity” in selecting high-quality
arable land over low-quality land are too often ignored by local
planning authorities. Planning authorities seem too ready to compromise
on their policies to accommodate such applications, and they remain
behind the curve in taking Government guidance on board. That is the
exact problem in my constituency, where planning applications have been
made for solar panels to be placed on hundreds of acres of prime
agricultural land. The planning framework needs to demonstrate more
clearly the need to spare at least grade 2 agricultural land from being
covered with solar panels. I believe the guidance should direct local
planning authorities to consider roof tops and brownfield sites such as
the Gosfield proposal for the installation of solar
panels.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012968001414" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0004.htm#14012968001414">Given
the DECC Minister’s guidance in his letter of 14 October, more
needs to be done in the legislation, not just the guidelines, to
impress upon local planning authorities the importance of not building
on prime agricultural land. The DECC Minister has made it abundantly
clear that agricultural land must not be used for solar farms, and that
such installations should be directed towards brownfield sites, and
commercial and industrial roof spaces, but there is so far little
evidence that his words are getting through. A clear directive to local
planning authorities in that regard by the Minister is obviously
overdue, and a reassessment of the incentives and sanctions should be
considered. Planning authorities must be given clear instructions as to
their legal obligations in that regard, such that they comply with the
law.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012968001415" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0004.htm#14012968001415">In
addition, there should be an environmental impact assessment, which for
some reason is not a condition for siting solar panels in rural areas,
although it would be a requirement if one of the cottages in the same
area wanted to build a garage. I do not understand why 8-foot high
solar panels on between 40 acres to 300 acres should not be
subjected to an environmental impact assessment, especially in cases
such as the one I have described, in which the environmental impact
through blight is high. Nevertheless, local planning authorities often
elect not to call for an environmental impact assessment. It would
appear that, because the operation of generating electricity by such
means is clean, does not appreciably degrade the site on which panels
are situated and is “of only local importance”, no
environmental impact assessment is considered necessary. In reality,
such installations fundamentally alter the character and visual
environment of the location in which they are
situated.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012968001416" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0004.htm#14012968001416">Overall,
Government directives and letters from the DECC Minister appear to be
having little effect in countering the headlong drive on the part of
developers and landowners to get into the solar farm business by taking
over food producing land, especially high-quality agricultural land,
suggesting that the incentives may have been incorrectly set, or that
the available sanctions are not being applied with sufficient rigour. I
would like the Minister to consider changing the legislation to ensure
that local planning authorities can consider the 
<?notus-xml column=983?>quality of land, the visual impact on the countryside and the views of
local people before granting permission for solar panel farms to be
built.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012968001417" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0004.htm#14012968001417">I
have three specific questions for the Minister. First, can he confirm
that the Government will issue updated planning practice guidance that
explicitly states whether agricultural land classified as being the
“best and most versatile”, meaning grades 1, 2 and 3a, is
suitable for use as a solar farm? Secondly, does the Minister know of
any plans to update the environmental impact assessment regulations in
respect of solar farms, and specifically the criteria and thresholds
for the purposes of the definition of schedule 2 development, meaning
the thresholds at which the regulations suggest that an environmental
statement is likely to be required in support of a planning
application?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012968001418" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/debtext/140129-0004.htm#14012968001418">Thirdly,

publication by the Government of the “Solar PV Strategy Part

policies in the national planning policy framework are clear that there
is no excuse for putting solar farms in the wrong places. The framework
is clear that applications for renewable energy developments, such as
solar farms, should be approved only if the impact, including the
impact on the landscape—the visual and the cumulative
impact—is or can be made acceptable. That is a very high test.
It should be approved only if the impact can be made acceptable. Where
significant development is necessary on agricultural land, the national
planning policy framework is equally clear that local planning
authorities should seek to use areas of poorer quality in preference to
that of a higher quality. Where land is designated at a relatively high
grade it should not be preferred for the siting of such
developments.</hs_Para>

addition, the framework is clear that planning should take account of
the different roles and character of different areas. It should protect
areas with a landscape 
<?notus-xml column=984?>designation. It should recognise the character and beauty of the
countryside and support the rural communities within it. It is very
important, given the particular countryside he was talking about, that
areas of outstanding natural beauty have the highest status of
protection in relation to landscape and scenic beauty. The framework is
clear that great weight should be given to conserving them. I therefore
encourage my hon. Friend to draw the attention of planning officers in
his council to those elements of the framework, the clarity and the
strength with which those policies are phrased, and encourage them to

when speaking to Braintree district councillors—notwithstanding
that it is the highest grade agricultural land, grade 2, in
Essex—they say that as long as a biodiversity requirement is

policy: the national planning policy framework is the framework of
national planning policy. Every planning decision by every planning

practice guidance on renewable and low-carbon energy. To ensure that
these decisions reflected the environmental balance expected by the
framework and that the views of local people were listened to, we
published guidance last summer that made some things very clear. We
reiterated that the need for renewable energy did not automatically
override environmental protections and local communities’
planning concerns. The guidance made it clear that the deployment of
large-scale farms could have a negative impact on the rural
environment, particularly in undulating landscapes, and set out a
number of factors that a local council would need to consider before

expect local authorities to encourage the effective use of previously
developed land, and if a proposal involves greenfield land, the
guidance clearly states that it should allow for continued agricultural
use, but only if it has already met all the other environmental and
landscape policy criteria that are set out in the framework and which
are reiterated, underlined and expanded on in the new planning
guidance. I and the Minister of State, Department of Energy and Climate
Change, my right hon. Friend the Member for Bexhill and Battle (Gregory

importance—and in 
<?notus-xml column=986?>some other way meets the criteria for call-in, which are published in a
written ministerial statement, he can write to the Secretary of State
and request that the decision be called in for ministerial decision.
That is open to him at any point. If he decides not to do that, and
were the local authority to refuse an application, and were it then
appealed, again he could write to the Secretary of State and request
that the decision be recovered, so that it can be made by the Secretary
of State, not a planning inspector. Those two opportunities are open to

Dai Havard (in the Chair):</Member></B> Before Mr Kwarteng introduces
the debate, may I make a couple of comments? I think that people should
know that I am the chair of the all-party parliamentary group on
defence and diplomacy in the middle east and north Africa, which I run
in association with the Royal United Services Institute. In addition, I
would like to report that I visited the Egyptian embassy in London on
13 December for a meeting and lunch with both the Egyptian ambassador
and the strategic adviser to the current Adminstration, Dr
El Mostafa Higazy. I say that simply for the record, and I now ask Mr
Kwarteng to kick us off on our subject, which is the political and
economic situation in Egypt.</hs_Para>

Kwarteng</B> (Spelthorne) (Con):</Member> Thank you very much, Mr
Havard; it is a pleasure to speak on this subject under your
chairmanship. I am also delighted to see several Members of the House
here to take part in the debate. Looking around, I can see that a
number of people have a considered and well developed interest 
in the region.</hs_Para>

am concerned, the developments in Egypt are, in terms of the middle
east’s long-term history and development, in many ways the most
significant. Why do I say that? Egypt is very much at the centre of the
Arab world. Ninety million Egyptians reside in the country and a number
of other people—from Saudi Arabia, from all around the Gulf, and
from across the Arab world—live in Egypt. As a proportion of the
Arab world, Egypt represents well over a third of the Arab-speaking
peoples. Historically, it has always been a country in which
developments are looked to. Culturally, the Egyptian film industry is
dominant in the region, and anyone who has travelled in the region will
say that the Egyptian dialect is the most widely understood, simply
because of wide media outlets and the popularity of Egyptian film.
Egypt is absolutely at the centre of developments in the middle
east.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012948000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012948000010">Two
weeks ago, I returned from a delegation to Egypt organised by the
Conservative Middle East Council. It was the fourth delegation of which
I have been a member since the revolution in 2011, when General Hosni
Mubarak was toppled. It is only really by going back to the country
over a number of years that we managed to develop, I think, an
interest, expertise and knowledge of what is going on in a fast-moving,
complicated situation. Our aim has been to understand better the
historic events that are occurring in the country, and we have spoken
to many people in the Egyptian political scene.</hs_Para>

as people will know, the Muslim Brotherhood was declared a terrorist
organisation at the end of last year and has effectively been outlawed.
As a consequence, in our last delegation we were not 
<?notus-xml column=266?>able to meet members of that organisation, but we have—I
can say this openly—met them in the past. We have engaged with
many members of the Muslim Brotherhood, with people in the army and the
armed forces in Egypt, and with people right across the political
spectrum, from the Facebookers, who initiated the first revolution in
January and February 2011, to other players in more recent
events.</hs_Para>

thought Egypt was a binary situation—I am talking on behalf of
members of the delegation—and felt that the army and the Muslim
Brotherhood were by far the two most powerfully organised and
structured organisations in the country. It seemed to us at the
time—we documented it in our short pamphlet, “Egypt 2011:
Revolution and Transition”—that the political future of
Egypt would largely be determined by the relationship between the army
and the Muslim Brotherhood. We saw, in effect, a temporary resolution
to that dialogue in the way in which the army stepped in in the middle
of last year.</hs_Para>

Opperman</B> (Hexham) (Con):</Member> I warmly congratulate my hon.
Friend on securing the debate. Unlike him, I was not on that delegation
but spent time there recently on my own. Does he accept that although
the army and the Muslim Brotherhood are the main players, the vast
majority of the population, particularly those outside Cairo, have
absolutely no interest in the conflict and are totally committed to a
resolution and a cessation of any dispute?</hs_Para>

Kwarteng:</Member></B> My hon. Friend raises an important point.
Naturally when we go on such delegations, we tend to gravitate towards
Cairo, which is the centre and capital of Egyptian life. I might add
that as a capital, it is very significant. Twenty million Egyptians
live in Cairo, which is a high proportion of the total population.
However, he is absolutely right that Egyptians across the country are
less interested in the power dispute and are more concerned about
economic stability and the future for themselves and their families. I
will talk about the consequences of the dispute between the Muslim
Brotherhood and the army.</hs_Para>

Corbyn</B> (Islington North) (Lab):</Member> I compliment the hon.
Gentleman on securing the debate. He seems reluctant to describe what
happened last year in Egypt as a military coup, which, in reality, it
was. Is he not concerned that that is a precedent, and that large
numbers of opposition people have been arrested in the same way as many
were arrested under Morsi? There is a serious denial of many
people’s human rights throughout the country at
present.</hs_Para>

Kwarteng:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. It is
undoubtedly the case that the army has been very heavy-handed in
dealing with protesters and dissent. There is a new protest law under
which people have been put away for three years simply for protesting
and being out on the street. I am tentative about describing what
happened as a coup, because the army’s view is very much that it
was a popular uprising. The army would suggest that—I heard it
many times in Cairo—although the events of February 2011 have
been described as a revolution, what it feels was another revolution in
June last year has been described as a “coup”. We have to
be careful about the language we use.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=267?><hs_Para UID="14012948000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012948000017">Clearly, it is
true that the army flexed its muscles at the end, but there was popular
support, with Tamarod and people on the streets, so to describe what
happened as a coup does not perhaps get the right tone. Generally,
coups around the developing world are led from the top: a general and a
few of his associates might seize power for themselves. The army in
Egypt would very much contest whether a coup is an accurate description
of what happened last summer and no doubt historians, politicians and
diplomats will debate how to describe it for years to come. I am very
reluctant to use the word “coup”, even though I
appreciate that it has been widely used in the media.</hs_Para>

question at the moment is how to deal with the Muslim Brotherhood.
Clearly the army has gone down one route, which is
heavy-handed—really the iron fist. Our perception was certainly
that the army was willing and ready to deal with, in an uncompromising
fashion, any attempts on the part of political Islamists to use
violence. It was expressing the view that it had had enough of the
Muslim Brotherhood and of trying to accommodate them, and that it would
handle any threats from that quarter with a great deal of repression.
Those were not the words that the army used, but that was very much the
indication that it gave us. There is clearly a massive problem with
that, potentially,
because—</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012948000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012948000019"><B><Member ContinuationText="Guy Opperman" PimsId="5666" UID="14012948000198" xid="1230" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012948000198">Guy
Opperman:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is leading on to the point about
the co-existence of the two particular factions. Does he also accept
the point that was stressed to me on my visit, that the vast majority
of all faiths peacefully co-exist, are friends with one another and
have no dispute with one another, and that it is only the more extreme
elements—for example, of the Muslim Brotherhood—that are
necessarily pushing the dispute and the aggression towards the army and
towards the
alternatives?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012948000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012948000020"><B><Member ContinuationText="Kwasi Kwarteng" PimsId="5671" UID="14012948000199" xid="1221" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012948000199">Kwasi
Kwarteng:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The two
broad groups that I have characterised—I will talk about secular
parties later—are the two most powerful groups, and of course
within those groups there is a wide range of views and dispositions.
There are extremist elements in the Muslim Brotherhood. There are also
some quite extreme repressive elements in the army. My hon. Friend is
right again to say that the majority of people are trapped in the
middle of those two contending and powerful forces, but I must stress
that the fundamental problem with Egypt at the moment, as I see it, is
that one side is simply unwilling to reach any kind of accommodation
with the
other.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012948000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012948000021">Let
us look at the elections that have taken place in the past three or
four years. The one fact that has come out starkly and undeniably is
the strength of the Muslim Brotherhood. I can say, as a member of the
delegation that has travelled to Egypt over three or four years, that
each time we asked, “How popular is the Muslim
Brotherhood?” its support was underestimated; it was never
overestimated. People always said 15% to 20%, but then in the elections
it always performed much better than anyone had anticipated. Equally
surprising was the strength of the Salafis, who got one quarter of the
parliamentary seats. Political Islam in Egypt is a powerful force. What
I think should draw the attention 
<?notus-xml column=268?>of this House and Members of Parliament is the fact that the
army’s attempt to sideline political Islam is fraught with
danger. That is potentially one of the fundamental causes of stress and
conflict in the years
ahead.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012948000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012948000022">The
big question is how the army will deal with acts of terror in the
future. Clearly, in the past two weeks we have seen an intolerable
level of violence in Cairo. We have also seen sporadic terrorist
bombings. Added to that is military repression. We are entering on a
particularly vicious cycle, and everyone in the
west—politicians, diplomats and everyone else in the outside
world—will have to take a view on that. It is obvious to me and
to members of our delegation that the army is determined to impose
itself as the central player in Egyptian politics. Anyone who doubts
that need only look at the referendum that took place two weeks
ago.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012948000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012948000023"><Member ContinuationText="Mr Iain McKenzie" PimsId="5988" UID="14012948000200" xid="1236" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012948000200"><B>Mr
Iain McKenzie</B> (Inverclyde) (Lab):</Member> I congratulate the hon.
Gentleman on securing the debate. He says that the military are
imposing themselves as the dominant power in Egyptian politics. Does he
not agree that they are putting themselves forward as the only power in
Egypt’s politics? Now it looks very much as though the general
who led the coup will put himself forward for the presidency, putting
the country back into a situation in which the military are in
charge.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012948000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012948000024"><B><Member ContinuationText="Kwasi Kwarteng" PimsId="5671" UID="14012948000201" xid="1221" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012948000201">Kwasi
Kwarteng:</Member></B> Yes, that is a broad characterisation of where
we are. However, we have to accept that the army is supported by a
large number of people. That is why I am always hesitant to talk about
coups and all that sort of thing. There is popular support for the
army, and it is unrealistic and perhaps rather naive of us to think
otherwise. It is not a military junta that has suddenly emerged out of
nowhere and is seeking to dominate the country. There is a groundswell
of support for the army. How big that is and whether it constitutes a
majority, no one knows.</hs_Para>

is a much more nuanced situation than one in which a bunch of generals
have decided to claim power for themselves. If we look at the economic
conditions in which Egypt has suffered for the past three or four
years—the total collapse of tourism, which constituted between
15% and 25%, depending on different estimates, of the economy—we
see that there is a massive and pressing need for stability, and it was
in that cauldron that that military regime, if we want to call it that,
emerged. That has happened across modern history. Across the world, we
have seen situations in which there is a cry for stability and then
someone emerges, often from a military background, to try to impose
order. That is a very similar situation to the one that we
find  in
Egypt.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012948000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012948000026">The
leading indication, the most obvious example, of the army’s
determination was the result of the referendum: 98.1% of people voted
for the constitution. Those of us who live in democratic countries such
as Britain will know that there is not a single issue on which 98% of
people would vote one way. I even suggested to one of my researchers
that if there was a referendum on what day of the week it was—on
a point of fact—we would not see 98% of people agreeing to that.
We might see 90%, but there would still be dissent on what is a very
palpable and obvious question, so the 98.1% does arouse suspicions
about the transparency, openness and fairness 
<?notus-xml column=269?>of the process. If we look for other examples in the Arab world of 98%
mandates—actually, I was told that Saddam Hussein used to
get 100% in his elections—we find that there
are not that many other examples of people getting
98%.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012948000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012948000027"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr McKenzie" PimsId="5988" UID="14012948000202" xid="1236" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012948000202">Mr

Kwarteng:</Member></B> Absolutely, but 38% is not a disgracefully low
turnout. That is quite a large turnout. In our local elections, we
would be quite happy to get 38%. That does not invalidate them as
exercises in local democracy, so I do not think that the turnout was
particularly depressing. It was a reasonable turnout, but the 98% of
the 38% does raise legitimate
questions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012948000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012948000029"><B><Member ContinuationText="Guy Opperman" PimsId="5666" UID="14012948000204" xid="1230" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012948000204">Guy

the hon. Gentleman on securing this important debate. Before he goes on
to the other issue, may I put this to him? He mentions the
constitution, which has increased provision for religious freedom
compared with what there has been recently. However, in relation to
ethnic and religious minorities, particularly Christians and Copts,
does he not agree that words are fine—the constitution may make
provision in certain areas—but the issue is the enforcement of
and the abiding by those provisions and the human rights afforded to

more authority than I can on this, but our Government have been
absolutely clear about our commitment to human rights and to religious
freedoms in Egypt. What the right hon. Gentleman should be aware of is
that the Copts—we talked about a coup last year—were very
much in favour of the military stepping in. They saw the Muslim
Brotherhood as no particular friends to them. Indeed, they felt that
the incidence of religious violence and of terror against their
community increased dramatically in the brief period of Muslim
Brotherhood
rule.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012948000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012948000033">There
are many conflicting issues that we have to deal with. On one side is
the protection of minority rights; on the other is the democratic will
as expressed by the majority. Often in these cases in the Arab world,
those two things are in conflict. One justification for military
involvement was on precisely this issue. The army would say—it
did say to us—that the Muslim Brotherhood did not look after the
human rights of all Egyptians; it was 
<?notus-xml column=270?>sectional, and it looked merely to its own. In that context, the army
has taken on itself the role of guardian of minority rights.</hs_Para>

parlous economic situation is the context in which that military
strongman, for want of a better term, may well emerge. The budget
deficit has risen to $34.8 billion, which is 14% of GDP. To put that in
context, our deficit was 12% of GDP in 2010, which was the highest
proportion it had been in our peacetime history. Public debt in Egypt
is running at about 90% of GDP. Clearly, there has been a massive
economic crisis and the country is under a lot of pressure. There are
also problems with terrorism and the rule of law. When we first arrived
in Egypt in 2010, we managed to drive through the Sinai peninsula on
our way to Gaza, but the presence of armed militias and armed forces in
the Sinai peninsula, and the battles that rage there, make such a trip
impossible today. The country suffers under massive economic pressure

been, for the past 40 years, under Egyptian control, the situation is
one of relative anarchy. In that context, it would be asking a lot to

making one or two remarks about our response. We went to our embassy in
Cairo, where we received generous hospitality, and we encountered some
hard-working and committed diplomats. The feeling that we received from
people to whom we spoke in Egypt, at all levels, was that the west had
failed Egypt and that we, as one of Egypt’s longest-standing
partners, had not fully grasped the nature of the situation. That might
be a misrepresentation, but I can only report what I was told. There
was a perception that we had been slightly wrong-footed by events. In a
fast-changing environment it is easy to back the wrong horse and then
find that the winning horse is suspicious of people who have not fully
supported
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012948000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012948000038">For
decades to come, we will have to question the operation of the
multi-party system. Over the past four years, secular parties have not
emerged. The two power blocs of the army and the Muslim Brotherhood are
the dominant forces in Egypt, and they may well be for some time to
come. The Al-Nour party, which won a quarter of the parliamentary
seats, is a Salafist party inspired by political Islam. It is difficult
to see how a multi-party secular democracy can emerge in a country in
which the army and political Islam, particularly the Muslim
Brotherhood, play such dominant roles.</hs_Para>

Westminster and across western capitals, we will have to come to terms
with that. We will have to reassess the somewhat naive idea that Egypt
might become a 
<?notus-xml column=271?>multi-party system like Australia, for example. If anyone thought in
2011 that that might happen, it was a rather naive assumption. We
simply have to describe what we see on the ground and how popular will
is expressed. Secular parties have not developed as many of us
anticipated, and it is an open question whether we should try to
encourage their growth or simply focus our attention on the
humanitarian and economic situation in Egypt.</hs_Para>

Iain McKenzie</B> (Inverclyde) (Lab):</Member> It is a pleasure to
serve under your chairmanship, Mr Havard. I congratulate the hon.
Member for Spelthorne (Kwasi Kwarteng) on securing a debate on this
important subject. More than 98% of participants in the Egyptian vote
in January this year voted in favour of approving a new constitution,
and I concede that the turnout was a reasonably respectable 38%. That
was, however, slightly lower than the turnout for a similar poll
following Egypt’s 2011 uprising. Egypt’s new constitution
strengthens the country’s three key institutions—the
military, the police and the judiciary—and it appears to give
more rights to women and disabled people. However, opposition members
and rights campaigners have questioned the integrity of the referendum,
saying that it was conducted against a backdrop of fear. Transparency
International, an international monitoring group that sent a small
delegation to observe the process, has said:</hs_Para>
<hs_brev UID="14012948000173" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012948000173">“Government
officials openly promoted a vote in favour of the amendments; private
and public media provided one-sided coverage in favour of the draft
constitution; and the government harassed, arrested, and prosecuted
peaceful critics, closing democratic space to promote views and debate
before the
referendum.”</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="14012948000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012948000043">The
referendum process and outcome are clearly mired in controversy. If
Egypt is to stand any chance of a more stable, prosperous and
democratic future, lessons must be learned quickly. That will not be
easy in a society that is being subjected to unbearable economic and
other stresses. Under the social contract that bound Egyptians since
Nasser, the state guaranteed education, health care, food, energy and
even jobs to all citizens in exchange for their unconditional retreat
from politics and matters of governance. That contract has been
unravelling for decades and is now utterly frayed. The Egyptians, more
than others in the region, are right to panic at the thought of
persistent instability, fuelled by Egypt’s exclusionary,
rudderless, confrontational and highly stressful political landscape.
Given that uncertainty, the mounting economic pressure that has given
so much violence is not
surprising.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012948000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012948000044">The
population of the countryside and an urbanised underclass are growing
in numbers, but the established elites still enjoy all the levers of
power, and the latter are 
<?notus-xml column=272?>bent on keeping the former in check. Those tensions, which are
increasingly manifest in society, have been decades in the making, and
addressing them will be neither easy nor straightforward. Sadly, but
realistically, it may not be possible to bridge some of the fault lines
before things run their course on the streets, but we hope that fear of
total collapse will continue to serve as a powerful safeguard. State
institutions are dysfunctional but resilient, and Egypt can expect much
support, whether benevolent or biased, from sympathetic states in the
Gulf and the west. Democratic or not, many Egyptians see the referendum
as delivering a constitution that legitimises the army’s
powerful and unquestioned position in Egypt today.</hs_Para>

authorities maintain that the new constitution is a big improvement
that delivers more rights and freedoms and is a crucial step on the
road to stability, it would seem to be a version of stability that
fortifies the power of a military who allow civilians to be tried in
military courts. The constitution gives the military control over the
appointment of the Defence Minister for the next eight years, and, most
worryingly, it also stipulates that the military’s budget will
be beyond civilian
oversight.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012948000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012948000046">Critics
believe that the constitution favours the army at the expense of the
people and fails to deliver on the expectations of the revolution of
2011 that overthrew the long-time military ruler, Mubarak. Egypt is a
divided society, and it is in turmoil. Attending protests can result in
a three-year prison term; that is part of an escalating clampdown on
dissent. Rather than healing the divisions in Egypt, some fear that the
new constitution will harden them. It is due to be followed by
presidential and parliamentary elections in the coming months, and it
now seems certain that the army chief who led the coup will run for
President, possibly putting a military strongman back in charge of
Egypt.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012948000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012948000047">Although
the authorities are insisting that the country is on a road map to
democracy, some are not convinced and are predicting another mass
revolt. Instead of rushing to endorse this or that leadership, hailing
the political road map and hoping for the best, a constructive policy
for the UK would be to combine healthy political scepticism with a more
consistent approach to the issue of individual liberties and a clearer
economic road map that would tie together Gulf money, western aid,
international loans and a much-delayed reform
programme.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012948000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012948000048">Without
doubt, Egypt’s economy is in serious trouble, with a growing
budget deficit, an unprecedented increase in domestic debt, high
interest payments and a slowing of the economy. Coupled with political
unrest and other factors, that has led to a slow-down in industrial and
economic activity in general. We can clearly see that Egypt’s
economic health began to deteriorate immediately after the revolution
in 2011. The world is now a small place, and communication channels are
large, complex and in everyone’s hands. In the past, 
the world was somewhat blind to such turmoil amid  the
transition to democracy. Not now. Nightly, on our news channels, we see
it, hear it and the world economy feels

central and eastern European countries, which had been well set on the

is often thought that when a totalitarian regime emerges, based on a
totalitarian ideology, it does so in a coup, with no popular support at

not usually the case. There was certainly popular support for the
Nazis, as well as for the communists in many cases where they succeeded
in coming to power. The paradox in trying to deal with such situations
was that there was a degree of democratic legitimacy to the initial
taking over of the country, but once that had happened, the regimes
proceeded to dismantle the very framework of democracy—however
great or limited it was at the time—that had enabled them to
come to power on the basis of some form of popular support. Such
popular support was often allied to a specific type of devious

question that must be faced by democracies looking on as such
situations develop is what we do when a group of people come to power,
initially with a greater or lesser degree of democratic legitimacy, and
proceed to subvert the system so that they will never again have to
submit themselves to democratic elections. I suggest that what was
happening in Egypt was a 
<?notus-xml column=274?>movement in that sort of direction. The country was faced with the
choice of whether it wished to see Islamism take control, as it has
done following what I prefer to call the Arab
uprisings, to the disappointment of many of us who were hoping to see
constitutional democracies emerge in other middle eastern countries.
The issue is what we do about that. Do we simply rush to condemn the

my time trying to comment as best I can on defence and security-related
subjects in Parliament, not too many months—certainly not too

of my favourite political quotations from the late, great, Sir Karl
Popper in his famous book, “The Open Society and Its
Enemies”. I have quoted it before and I suspect that
circumstances will require me to quote it again. The paradox of
tolerance is that in a free society, people must tolerate all but the
intolerant, because if you tolerate the intolerant, the conditions for
toleration disappear and the tolerant go with them. I am sure that this
is what the people who ousted the Islamists in Egypt would argue was
their justification. Although I said earlier that one must not make
simplistic comparisons, I am now probably about to do just that. Those
people would probably point to the situation in Germany in the 1930s
and say, “Wouldn’t it have been better if the army had
thrown the Nazis out, once it became clear that they were going to rip
up the constitution and remove any chance of a democratic future, and
when it saw what the Hitlerites were trying to do to the German
system—which had more or less democratically elected them to
power in the first place—using the techniques that we are so

worry when I hear people use phrases such as moderate Islamism. The
description of Islamism is the description of an extreme, intolerant
ideology; there is no moderate Islamism, any more than there is
moderate totalitarianism or moderate extremism. The reality is that

ejection of a group of people bent on destroying any sort of emergent

in Egypt. Those of us who have been in, and aware of, politics for a
long time can remember the bad old days of Nasser. I am sure that some
people would say, “Ah, but those days are likely to come

when Sadat was assassinated by what, today, we would call Islamists,

corruption became rife and the situation ultimately became unstable. Of

last observation is this. A few days ago, I was listening to the
“Today” programme and a representative of the Muslim
Brotherhood was asked a simple question by the interviewer:
“Will you take part in the forthcoming elections or not?”
He could have had plenty of good reasons for saying, “We
won’t do it.” He could have said, “We don’t
think they’ll be fair,” or “We don’t think
we’ll be allowed to campaign freely,” and so on. The fact
was that it took the entire interview, with that question being asked
over and over, to get any sort of final admission from this man that,
no, it does not propose to take part. That reminded me of nothing so
much as old debates with Marxists, 25 or 30 years ago: they never gave
a straight answer to a straight question, because they were subject to
a devious political ideology and had the language to
match.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012948000070" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012948000070">These

situation in Egypt is dangerous and sad. The abuse regarding the right
of protest and the abuse of human rights has been continual in Egypt
for a long time. My hon. Friend the Member for Inverclyde
(Mr McKenzie) correctly pointed out that the military are
back in control of government, as indeed they have been in control or
supportive of government for most of the period since the second world
war, if not longer. The army is the big factor in Egypt. We also have
to recognise that all of Egypt’s constitutions, including the
latest constitution that has just been voted through by yet another
referendum, which is the third in three years, gives a unique and
special place to the army in society and gives it a degree of
independence—way beyond any sense of parliamentary
control—that nobody in this country or in Europe would accept.
Indeed, the Egyptian army has its own economy and source of income.
Egyptian society is essentially a process of debate with the power of
the armed forces, as opposed to anyone else, and we have to recognise
that as one of the big factors.</hs_Para>

factor, of course, is the events over  the past three years
since the Arab spring. Everyone who recognised what was happening
across north Africa and the middle east always
thought that Egypt would be the last place to have mass protests, but
eventually there were huge protests in Tahrir square that resulted in
the removal and trial of Mubarak, who is still in custody. The protests
did not end the power of the army, which during that period was clever
in presenting itself as some kind of democratic force on the side of
popular opinion. A constitution was produced, which was followed by the
election of President
Morsi.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012948000074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012948000074">Initially,
the rest of the world was keen to do business with Morsi. He was due to
come to Britain, and somewhere I have an invitation to meet him. He was
arrested and imprisoned on a Monday, and our meeting was due on the
Thursday. I then got the most peculiar e-mail that I have ever
received, saying, “It appears that President Morsi will not be
able to attend the meeting.” The e-mail did not give any reason
why he was not able to attend the meeting. I believe that you were also
due to be at that discussion, Mr Havard. Morsi has been in prison ever
since.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012948000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012948000075">I
am not a spokesperson for the Muslim Brotherhood—I have many
criticisms of many organisations, including the brotherhood—but
one has to recognise that it has been an important factor in Egyptian
society since its foundation in 1928. The brotherhood has large
support, and its leadership and membership have suffered a lot of
imprisonment since its foundation. The brotherhood has often been
banned—by the British, by various Egyptian Governments, by
Nasser, by Mubarak and by many others—so when the brotherhood
finally won election it was an important turning point in Egyptian
history.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012948000076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012948000076">Those
who protested against the brotherhood presidency and
Government—there were huge protests within a year—rather
bizarrely turned to the army for their salvation. I have asked various
friends on the left of Egyptian politics where that narrative came
from. When people are making democratic protests against a Government
and its authoritarian measures—indeed, there were plenty of
authoritarian measures under Morsi—where in the democratic
alternatives does one turn to the army for salvation? That is the
conundrum. The Government that Sisi now leads, and of which he will no
doubt become President in a short time, have been as oppressive of the
opposition, albeit a different opposition, as the Morsi Government
were. Large numbers of people have been killed or imprisoned, and the
behaviour of Sisi’s Government towards human rights in Egypt is
not good. Although one can understand the degree of opposition to
Mubarak, to Morsi and now to the current Government, one should be
careful of endorsing a military regime and the oppression of human
rights that it is now
undertaking.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012948000077" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012948000077"><Member ContinuationText="Mr John Spellar" PimsId="781" UID="14012948000222" xid="555" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012948000222"><B>Mr

I spent some time in Cairo this time last year, and I spent a lot of
time talking to people in Tahrir square and meeting various others. I
was struck by the level of antipathy towards the Muslim Brotherhood
among people who had voted for it in the election a very short time
previously. They voted for the brotherhood on the basis that it was not
a continuation of the military governance of Egypt, but they rapidly
became disappointed in what the brotherhood was doing. The situation is
complicated, and of course there is a degree of polarisation, but there
is also a massive abuse of the human rights of religious minorities and
others, about which we should be

the BBC and Sky News, and one recognises that all of those journalists
are doing their best to report the facts of what is going on. I guess
those facts are unacceptable either to the army or other authorities in
Egypt, hence the al-Jazeera team has been arrested—al-Jazeera

precarious situation of political strife and economic turmoil; but in
the middle of that there are religious groups. Christians are targeted
for their beliefs, and because of some people’s perception that
they have an attachment to western life. That is not the case:

matters, as the hon. Member for Spelthorne recognised. Geography alone
places it at  the hinge of the troubled regions of north Africa
and the middle east. It is the most populous country in the region and
well over one third of the Arab world. It has a history and culture
stretching back for millennia. It is a major centre of scholarship,
media, as the hon. Gentleman rightly mentioned, film and debate in the
Arab world with a sophisticated, developed and articulate middle class,
as we saw particularly in the early days of the Arab spring. As some
hon. Members have mentioned, it was in the vanguard of change in the
Arab world in the ’50s as well as more recently, and it lies
across one of the world’s major trade arteries in the Suez
canal, which, incidentally, is also a major source of revenue for the
Egyptian Government.</hs_Para>

all share the concern about the all-too-familiar picture of a rising
tide of violence and disorder with the usual complement of bombings and
assassinations. 
<?notus-xml column=282?>Whatever direction Egypt goes in will have an impact not just on its
citizens, but on the wider region and the world. At this crucial time
for peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians, let us remember it
was the bold and enlightened leadership of Anwar Sadat that helped to
establish peace in the area, for which he paid with his life to those
fundamentalists we have been talking
about.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012948000101" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012948000101">I
was in Jerusalem and Ramallah last month and I was struck and
encouraged by the more positive atmosphere in both jurisdictions,
engendered not least by the tireless efforts of Secretary of State John
Kerry in trying to bring the talks together. Tribute was fully paid to
him from both sides. An absolute precondition of the advance of those
talks and a successful outcome is the Israeli need for territorial
security and integrity. The stabilising efforts of the Egyptian army in
Sinai and its discouragement of Hamas in Gaza are a crucial element of
that.</hs_Para>

early return of civilian government in Egypt, and recognise the
important role of the military in ensuring the security environment
that will allow effective democratic government and economic progress
for the Egyptian people. The issue is not just about Egypt, but about
the example in the wider region. It is fair to say that in neighbouring
Tunisia, the more stabilised environment in Egypt has contributed to
the recent encouraging developments and the move towards inclusive
government, with the likelihood that elections there will be held later
this year on a pluralist basis.</hs_Para>

lesson from Tunisia is the way in which the many parties that grew up
rapidly during the changes since the start of the Arab spring have
started to pull together in a progressive bloc, and will fight those
elections in a pluralist society where both sides acknowledge that they
will abide by the result and the subsequent change. That is an
important change from the more Islamist-inclined party and reflects the
outcomes of the less pluralist view of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt
and the
consequences.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012948000104" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012948000104">I

Union and partly through the Westminster Foundation—I hope the
Minister will speak about this—the sort of work to enable not
just confidence building but capacity building in the various parties,

a pluralist society is most important and within that is a significant
issue. This touches on the point made by several Democratic Unionist
Members—the right hon. Member for Belfast North (Mr Dodds) and
the hon. Members for East Londonderry (Mr Campbell), for Strangford
(Jim Shannon) and for South Antrim (Dr McCrea)—about the role of
Christian and Coptic minorities, the protection of those religious
minorities and the rights of women. They are not necessarily
unconnected because there is an additional pressure on those Christian
minorities from some extremists to conform to Islamic standards. That
is another form of pressure and
oppression.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012948000105" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012948000105">With

recent developments in Egypt and the largely orderly referendum, and
welcome the fact that the new constitution enshrines fundamental rights

women’s rights. We must monitor that to ensure that those rights
are upheld. We must also be aware of and concerned about the pressure
that 
<?notus-xml column=283?>extremists place on minorities, particularly the long-standing Coptic
and Christian communities and, as was mentioned today, by acquiescence
at local level from some of the authorities in some of those actions.

we all hope that we will see the return of pluralist democracy and

presidential and parliamentary elections. However, as my hon. Friend
the Member for Inverclyde (Mr McKenzie) said, it is not necessarily the
role of individuals from the military in government that concerns us.
For example, in Indonesia, President Yudhoyono was a general, but has
clearly been a civilian general and has been able to exert civilian
control over the military. That is what we should be looking for in
Egypt, certainly not military control. We want effective civilian
government and
control.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012948000107" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012948000107">This
is only the start. Egypt’s people and especially its very large
young population, to which several hon. Members referred, including my
hon. Friend the Member for Islington North (Jeremy Corbyn), desperately
need economic development, and my hon. Friend the Member for Inverclyde
spelled out some of the economic data. That depends very much on the
security environment, especially with the significance to the Egyptian
economy of tourism and the need for security to attract tourists, but
it also requires the EU to engage directly with the new Egyptian
Government, when it is elected, to encourage economic relations and
investment to bring back and to expand the aid from the EU that was so
crucial in helping to relieve suffering and to promote development in
Egypt. We look forward to hearing from the Minister what the Government
will do about
that.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-29?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_29_PT_1/FD87FBFECF578159472C72918ABC8A544C03A315" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="29 January 2014">Wednesday

in January 2011, in Tahrir square. Since then, the Egyptian people have
seen three Governments: the military-led Supreme Council of the Armed

interim Government. This is a crucial time for Egypt’s future
and long-term stability. As many have said, the referendum on the draft
constitution that was held on 14 and 15 January was an important
milestone on the political road map and allowed millions of Egyptians
to express their opinion through the ballot box. Egyptians are now
looking ahead to see what kind of political process will take shape
over the next six months. We expect the presidential election to

Gentleman and to the House that they were enthusiastic about the new
constitution and thought that it was a step forward. As is often the
case with senior bishops, the bishop I met was sensitive about the
previous Government, but it was clear that life for the Copts had not
been easy under the Muslim Brotherhood. Indeed, I heard that evening
how the Ministry of Tourism in Cairo traditionally issues licences for
Christmas celebrations, but when it tried to license the first
Christmas celebrations under the Muslim Brotherhood Government it was
told not to do so. It was therefore unable to license Christmas
celebrations over that period. This year alone, 94 or 97
licences—I cannot remember the figure—were issued, so
licences are being issued once again. For all the difficulties to which
the hon. Gentleman correctly drew attention, it was clear from my

to recent press reports about Ofsted. I am not here today to attack its
methods or to call for its abolition—far from it. While I have
the odd reservation, I am a big fan of Sir Michael Wilshaw and of
Ofsted’s work. The issue that I want to focus on is
Ofsted’s monitoring of the performance of local authorities in

policy context is that under this Government, more and more schools are
being freed from local education authority control. Thanks to the free
schools programme and the Government’s dramatic expansion of the
academy model, parents, teachers and head teachers are being trusted
with the task of driving up standards in the classroom, rather than
spending their time answering to local councils. More than half of
secondary schools are in the process of converting to academy status,
and I am sure that more and more schools and parents will want to take
advantage of the freedoms that such status
offers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012948000123" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012948000123">I

local authorities continue to run nearly half of secondary schools,
nearly 85% of all schools and, obviously, the vast majority of primary
schools. The head of Ofsted, Sir Michael Wilshaw, said in a newspaper
over the weekend that local authorities should continue to have a role
“overseeing” free schools and academies. Local
authorities will continue to be relevant and important to the standard
of education delivered in Britain’s schools. However, that
raises some key questions. How can parents and the public know what
councils are actually doing to promote high standards in schools? How
can the performance of local councils and their officials be assessed
and judged? Are they doing the right things? Are they doing enough? Are
they ambitious enough on behalf of their young people?</hs_Para>

people hold local authorities to account? I would contest that that is
not very easy. There are tables showing the performance of schools in a
local authority’s catchment area, but those performance data can
be affected by a number of other factors, such as the socio-economic
characteristics of the intake. Issues with performance can also be
masked by the performance of particular schools—I will say more
about that a little later—including schools that are outside an
authority’s control, and by the educational attainment of pupils
from outside its catchment area. The questions therefore remain: how
can people tell what local councils are doing to improve educational
standards? Are they doing the right things? Is it enough, and are the
people at the local education authority up to the job?</hs_Para>

prompted to raise those questions today by the concerns that I and many
of my constituents—and now also Ofsted—have about the
performance of Reading 
<?notus-xml column=288?>borough council as the local education authority. I will not skirt
around the issues or dress them up; I will just report them as they
are. I hope that Reading LEA will listen carefully to my critique,
which is based on the facts, and try to engage sensibly, rather than
behaving in a knee-jerk, defensive and political way. I am willing to
help it to reform and improve if it does the right things. At the end
of the day, the key must be to improve the outcomes for children in LEA
schools.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012948000127" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012948000127">Reading
has struggled for years to make consistent and long-lasting
improvements to educational outcomes, thereby allowing many children to
underachieve. Even at GCSE and A-level, for which the results are very
good, its real performance has been masked by the excellent results
from grammar schools, where around 90% of the children come from
outside the borough. It strikes me that there must be something
fundamentally wrong with an LEA that allows that level of educational
underachievement to continue. Let me explain
why.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012948000128" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012948000128">Just
before Christmas, the director of education, adult and
children’s services at Reading borough council wrote to the head
teachers and chairs of governors at all local schools, admitting that
Reading’s key stage 2 results in reading, writing and
mathematics had fallen behind those in almost all other areas of
England, and were in the bottom five nationally. Reading LEA had the
largest drop in the proportion of pupils reaching level 4 and above in
the south-east region, and the third largest fall in performance in the
country. The achievement of key groups, including some ethnic minority
groups, those with special educational needs and those on free school
meals, was also extremely poor according to the LEA’s director
of education.</hs_Para>

local children’s centres has found them to be inadequate. In a
damning judgment, Ofsted found children’s centres in east
Reading to be “inadequate in all respects”, and is
planning interventions to bring about improvements. To be inadequate in
all respects takes some doing.</hs_Para>

year, the Minister wrote to Reading LEA, challenging it over the gap
that has developed between rich and poor children’s
performances, despite the huge Government investment through the pupil
premium. Last year, the George Palmer primary school was removed from
the LEA’s control and reopened as an academy due to its constant
failure to improve its failing performance.</hs_Para>

concerns in a letter to Sir Michael Wilshaw, and earlier this week
spoke to Matthew Coffey, the Ofsted regional director. Ofsted has
informed me that it was already concerned about Reading LEA’s
performance because of the high exclusion rates in a number of schools;
in fact, Reading was found to have the highest fixed-term exclusion
rate of any local authority in England. The key stage 2 data confirmed
Ofsted’s concerns, and on 5 October last year Mr Coffey wrote to
the LEA expressing those concerns. Shockingly, Ofsted has told me that
5,000 of 13,000 pupils under Reading LEA control are at schools that
are not considered even to be good. Surely a good school is the least
that any parent and every child should have the right to expect. The
situation suggests that Reading is an LEA that at best is allowing
schools to drift, and at worst is failing to challenge inadequate
standards properly.</hs_Para>

with the LEA on 13 December, when it was made clear that if no
improvement was seen, there was the option to carry out a focused
inspection of the

agreed to share tracking data for key stage 2 and targets for
improvement. I also welcome Ofsted’s recent finding of
improvement in Reading’s key stage 1 results. A further meeting

March.</hs_Para>

Wilson:</Member></B> As we all know, a debate on that subject is taking

many years. I see no reason to try to change the current
arrangements.</hs_Para>

explain the significance of the poor key stage 2 results I
mentioned. Key stage 2 is an assessment of the attainment of primary
school pupils. Although six of the eight secondary schools in
Reading’s catchment area are now academies, only five out of the
31 primary schools are. Poor performance in primary schools means poor
performance in the schools that Reading borough council runs. That
suggests that the council, in its stewardship of the schools, is
hindering progress, rather than fulfilling its legal duty to promote
higher standards. Ofsted is concerned that the attainment gap between
pupils receiving free school meals and the rest is getting bigger at
primary school level, even though in secondary schools—most of
which have left LEA control—the data are getting better and the
gap is narrowing.</hs_Para>

situation must not be allowed to continue at the primary school level.
I suggest that in the LEA there is a lack of ambition to challenge, and
a lack of will and desire to take the decisions necessary to make real
and lasting educational change. There is a culture in which failure in
local schools is too easily accepted and excused. For a long time now,
I have noticed a lack of aspiration for some groups of children, and a
lack of will to challenge the notion that some children from difficult
areas and chaotic homes are too challenging or damaged to be
helped.</hs_Para>

LEA’s poor performance and attitude have forced me into a much
more active role regarding local schools than I ever envisaged when I
first became MP for Reading East. The local authority has termed that
interference, but it would be a dereliction of my duty to my
constituents not to intervene. Of course, I was conscious of
Reading’s lack of consistent progress in schools when elected in
2005, but I could not immediately put my finger on the reason for it.
When I did, the Government were resistant to making the necessary
changes and to challenges to the educational
orthodoxy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012948000138" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012948000138">That
changed in 2010, when academies and university technical colleges got
rocket boosters, free schools were introduced, changes were made to the
curriculum, and help was made available to poorer pupils through the
pupil premium—a policy on which I agreed with the Minister long
before my party did. That gave me the tools to start bypassing an LEA
that was at best coasting and at worst failing. It meant I was able to
be a focal  
<?notus-xml column=290?>point for setting up a new UTC, which challenged other schools to up
their game and LEAs to invest where there was
inadequate performance.</hs_Para>

that UTC encouraged the neighbouring LEA, Wokingham, to invest in
Bulmershe school. Recently I helped another school from the
neighbouring authority to get behind setting up a new free school for
11 to 16-year-olds. Maiden Erlegh free school will enable its mother
school’s outstanding DNA—the standard that parents want
for their children—to be delivered in my constituency. It was

authorities have a legal duty to promote high standards in schools and
among other providers, so that children and young people achieve well

Reading? Will he commit to reviewing continually other Ofsted
procedures for inspecting local authorities? Are those procedures
sufficient and effective? Will he give a commitment that where Ofsted
finds that a local authority is not doing enough to promote high
standards, its recommendations will have real teeth and the situation
will not simply be allowed to continue? With specific reference to
Reading, will he give a commitment that he and his Department will keep
a close interest in developments in Reading, and make it clear that if
there is no developed and credible plan of action soon to improve
performance radically in the LEA’s schools, they will ask Ofsted

local authorities, and indeed he would be the first to recognise that
spreading best practice is important. That is something that Ofsted
seeks to do, but for the time being, it is targeting its scarce

to say a few things about the national context of underperformance, and
then I will talk in detail about the particular issues in Reading that
have been raised by my hon. Friend. As I said recently at the North of
England education conference, improving our education system is the
biggest long-term challenge we face as a nation. We are making
progress. Last week, the results for secondary schools were published,
and they show that the number of state-funded schools
classed as underperforming in relation to floor targets is now
154 out of 3,200 secondaries, down from 195 the previous year. Those
figures are a credit to teachers’ professionalism and hard work,
and they mean that the number of pupils being taught in underperforming
secondary schools has fallen by 50,000 since last year and by almost
250,000 since the coalition Government was elected in
2010.</hs_Para>

there is much more to do, as my hon. Friend has made clear. Attainment
in many schools is still too low, and we have a long way to go in
narrowing 
<?notus-xml column=292?>the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and other pupils. There
is also wide variation between different parts of the country, as he
mentioned. Our vision is of a school-led system where improvement is
driven from within, with the very best teachers and school leaders
modelling excellence in practice and working in partnerships to build
capacity and raise standards across the system.</hs_Para>

leaders of education programme enables head teachers of Ofsted-rated
outstanding schools and their staff to use their skills and expertise
to support schools in challenging circumstances and improve the quality
of teaching and leadership. There are three NLEs in Reading. Alongside
that, the local leaders of education programme enables head teachers of
Ofsted-rated good schools to work outside their own school to provide
support to another head teacher and their school. There are five LLEs
in Reading. In addition, the Teach First programme now places nearly
5,500 teachers in schools in challenging circumstances. The programme
started in inner London and will, in the year ahead, be for the first
time a genuinely national scheme in all regions of the
country.</hs_Para>

particularly grateful to my hon. Friend for bringing to my attention
the situation in Reading. I will raise it, as he has done, with the
chief inspector when I see him next week for my regular stocktake, and
will mention this debate. Reading is presently ranked 111th out of 150
local authorities in Ofsted’s latest table for percentage of
pupils attending a good or outstanding secondary school, and 116th out
of 150 local authorities for percentage of pupils attending a good or
outstanding primary school. The 2013 results for pupils at the end of
primary school, in key stage 2, show that Reading has dropped
significantly below the national average of 75%. Reading now stands at
69%, a drop from 73% last year. Those figures are disappointing. I
note, however, that in my hon. Friend’s constituency, which
includes primary schools in both Reading and Wokingham local
authorities, the key stage 2 percentage is 73%, which is close to the
national average.</hs_Para>

4, the percentage of pupils in Reading achieving five or more good

academies, as my hon. Friend will know, which have contributed

LA-maintained days. My hon. Friend will know that half the
borough’s secondary schools are already academies. I understand
that the only sponsored academy is now starting to make good progress
following a slow start. Again, that school had many deep-rooted issues

at the end of primary education, 58.8% of pupils

Laws:</Member></B> Ofsted looks at 23,500 schools across the country.
It has a huge number of early years settings and other, wider
responsibilities beyond the schools. It has recently, under Sir
Michael’s leadership, taken a far more thorough and proactive
approach to local authorities, picking out the local authorities that
it is most concerned about and beginning in a proper and proactive way
the process of inspection that should have been taking place a long
time ago, including under the previous Government.</hs_Para>

primary schools in Reading show that the percentage of pupils, both
those on free school meals and their peers, who met the expected
standard has gone down between 2012 and 2013. The results for free
school meal pupils dropped from 54% to 52%, and the results for their
peers dropped from 77% to 74%. At key stage 4 nationally, the
proportion of free school meal pupils achieving at least five good
GCSEs has risen from 34.6% to 37.9% in 2013. The gap between those
pupils and their peers has now dropped to 26.7 percentage points,
compared with 27.4 percentage points in 2011, which is welcome. In
Reading, the picture is of rising attainment but the gap has widened.
The percentage of free school meal pupils achieving the standard has
risen from 31.9% in 2011 to 35.1% in 2013, but the rise for
non-free-school-meal pupils has been greater than that, so the
attainment gap has risen from 28 percentage points to 35 percentage
points. In our view, that is not acceptable.</hs_Para>

illustrate that although the national picture is positive, all schools
and local authorities need to improve so that we can finally start to
break the link between poverty and future life chances. To ensure that
all schools are equipped to do that, we have spent, as my hon. Friend
acknowledged, almost £4 billion on the pupil premium so far,
with another £2.5 billion planned for next year. The rate for
primary school pupils will rise significantly next year to
£1,300 per pupil per year, and the rate for secondary school
pupils will rise to £935. I want to ensure that that will be
used appropriately and make a difference. Ofsted has a key role to play
in ensuring that schools use the pupil premium for its intended
purpose, and on an evidence-based basis.</hs_Para>

their disadvantaged pupils based on their recent results. I was able to
write to two schools commending them on their excellent performance and
encouraging them to support other 
<?notus-xml column=294?>schools. If my hon. Friend has not seen those letters, I will make sure

authorities have an important role to play, together with national
Government, in leading the delivery of our ambitions for improved
education. Where local authority maintained schools are underperforming
or failing, early intervention and swift, robust action are required to
tackle failure. Statutory guidance for local authorities,
“Schools causing concern”, makes that clear. I understand
that Reading has issued five warning notices to primary schools since
2009 with the aim of securing improvement, and I encourage LAs such as
Reading to continue to make full use of their statutory intervention
powers where they consider that maintained schools are not doing enough
to bring about improvement. The statutory guidance is also clear that
academy status with the support of a strong sponsor is often the best
way of securing lasting improvement in those circumstances.</hs_Para>

as Reading, local authorities should focus their main school
intervention activity on the schools that they are responsible for.
Good LAs should work constructively with all local schools, but

have about academy performance directly with both Ofsted and the
Department for Education.</hs_Para>

local education authorities where the failures are right across the
board, but it also needs to look at the signals of those that are
almost bumping along the bottom? They are not quite at the bottom, as
the Minister showed through his league tables for primary and secondary
school, but they are in that patch where they are consistently failing
in areas of what they are doing. Ofsted really needs to challenge them,

our attention to the need to ensure that it is not only the LAs at the
bottom of the performance table that are challenged, which I am sure
that the chief inspector would acknowledge. It is relatively early in
the process of inspecting local authorities in this way, and over time,
I am sure that the chief inspector, who is independent of the
Department in these matters, will make sure that he refines the way in
which things are done, but does not simply focus on those areas that
are right at the bottom of the league tables.</hs_Para>

is weakness, local authorities can intervene in many ways, such as by
making effective use of data to intervene early; offering direct school
support; encouraging schools to form self-improvement clusters; seeking

is highlighting regional and local disparities in the quality of
educational provision through Ofsted inspections of local authority
school improvement arrangements. We welcome his plans to ask
challenging questions of local authorities, academy trusts and other
external parties about their contribution to school improvement. Where
the chief inspector reports a less than satisfactory response to his

specific examples that my hon. Friend has raised and the statistics he

between Ofsted and the director of children’s services in
December last year. I am told that a number of actions have been taken
as a result, including a new system for tracking exclusions and more
close monitoring and tracking of achievement for pupils, which Ofsted

my hon. Friend in the past few days and has written to him. I am
confident that if Ofsted considers that Reading is not taking
appropriate steps to address the key stage 2 issue, it will use its
power to take appropriate action, whether through focused inspection of
schools or through an inspection of the local authority school
improvement arrangements. My hon. Friend will understand that deciding
which local authorities to inspect and on what basis is ultimately a

the move away from legal aid support for personal injury cases, and

conversations I had while in practice over many years, in which I tried
to explain that the description of so-called “no win, no
fee” agreements was wholly inadequate. The basis of conditional
fee agreements, as they are properly termed, was that if a claimant was
unsuccessful, he or she would not face a bill for either their costs
and disbursements or those of their opponent. Any risk was principally
borne by the claimant’s lawyers. Their reward was that when they
succeeded for their clients, they benefited from an uplift on their
costs—a 
<?notus-xml column=297?>success fee paid for by the unsuccessful defendant. All that was
designed to take account of other cases that were
unsuccessful.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012955000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012955000010">The
structure was underpinned by insurance: in the event of the claimant
not succeeding, wholly or in part, that insurance would provide cover
for the unrecoverable disbursements and the defendant’s costs.
In the absence of suitable pre-existing, before-the-event legal
expenses cover, that policy would be arranged on an after-the-event
basis, known as ATE. The insurance premium was borne by the
unsuccessful defendants in cases where the claimant won. In successful

represented a significant erosion of a claimant’s damages. It
was argued in this place that mesothelioma cases should not fall foul
of those provisions, and that those cases should be exempt. It was
entirely right to have those exemptions in that Act in section 44,

work. There should be no linkage between LASPO and the Mesothelioma

one hand, we are talking about the conduct of cases where employers and
insurers are known; those cases progress in the ordinary way. On the
other hand, we are talking about a scheme to deal with cases where
insurers are not traced. It is simply disingenuous and grossly
insulting to sufferers to try somehow to make a link between the two,
and to justify changes that will impact on the conduct of civil cases
by saying that the “untraced” scheme is being progressed.
If someone suffering from mesothelioma can trace an insurer, their case
will proceed in the ordinary way. That others who cannot locate an
insurer have recourse to a scheme has no bearing whatever on the
conduct of ordinary civil cases. It would be refreshing if the Minister
could make that abundantly clear when he responds to the debate, as in
my view there is no integrity whatever in such an
argument.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012955000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012955000025">Without

initiating the debate. Like him, I shall begin by paying tribute to the
work of the late Paul Goggins, who was a fantastic campaigner on
mesothelioma. I, too, went to his funeral at Salford cathedral a couple
of weeks ago. It was an incredibly emotional yet wonderful occasion, on
which people paid tribute to his life. Many things touched me
throughout the service, but one thing that happened really made me
realise the man he was. Tony Whitston, a long-time campaigner for
asbestos victims, came up to me afterwards, and speaking to him made me
realise that Paul Goggins had reached out beyond Parliament and beyond
his own community to a much wider community. He was very well known for
fighting many causes, but this is one for which he and I 
<?notus-xml column=300?>shared a great passion. It still feels bizarre that we are having a
debate in the House on mesothelioma and he is not here. I still keep
looking out for him in Portcullis House, as I am sure many colleagues
do, wondering what he is going to say and what he is going to
contribute on issues such as
this.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012955000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012955000030">I
am sure that if Paul Goggins were here, he would share my
disappointment that we are even having to have this debate today. It
should not be needed. It is taking place only because of what I think
is a bad decision by the Ministry of Justice, whisked out in the middle
of December, on its review. We should pay tribute to the Government,
because they are doing some good things on mesothelioma, but to
campaigners for justice for victims of this dreadful disease, it often
feels as though it is two steps forward and one step back. The
Mesothelioma Bill is a really good example of that. It was a good Bill,
but not a great Bill. The LASPO exemption under section 48 was a really
good compromise that hon. Members on both sides of the House supported,
but now we are back having to debate whether sections 44 and 46 of
LASPO should be applicable to people with mesothelioma. I think that we
should pause for a second and consider why mesothelioma is such an
important
issue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012955000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012955000031">Mesothelioma
is an absolutely dreadful disease. It is nasty. People die it from very
quickly and they contract it through no fault of their own. People can
get mesothelioma only through exposure to asbestos—there are no
other causes—and they are most likely to have been exposed in
their workplace. Let us be clear: this is not just about the industrial
classes. This is not just about the ship laggers who were perhaps
operating in Chatham dockyard, in my constituency, in the 1960s and
’70s. It is also about professionals, such as teachers. It is
about people who worked in a wider environment. I am aware of an
admiral who passed away because he worked in a wider dockyard
environment. He was not personally working with a hammer and nails; he
was not exposed in great detail to asbestos, yet he died of
mesothelioma. He is one of nearly 3,000 people who die every year from
this
disease.</hs_Para><hs_ParaIndent UID="14012955000212" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012955000212">Many
people seek compensation through the civil claims process, but not
everyone does, because the system is so complex. One in seven people
who contract mesothelioma do not bother going through the civil claims
process, because it is too difficult. I think we should remind
ourselves of that complexity. Whether a victim is a lagger or a
teacher, they are likely to have had more than one employer, which is
why case law such as Fairchild and Barker exists. The previous
Government passed the Compensation Act 2006, which reversed Barker, and
now we have LASPO. In addition, recent rulings from the Supreme Court
make deciding whether the Fairchild rule applies even more complex. An
individual who contracted mesothelioma because they worked in industry,
worked in a dockyard or lagged a ship has to navigate through a
minefield of complex case law, and they need specialist legal help. It
is not fair that they should be punished by sections 44 and 46 of LASPO
when they receive such help.</hs_ParaIndent>

towards the pre-action protocols originally proposed in the Government
review, because I felt that they might speed up access to justice and
make the process simpler for victims. As it happens, the Government
ditched the pre-action protocols and will introduce measures that may
take away 25% of a victim’s damages to fund the conditional fee
arrangements and after-the-event insurance. I want to get as much money
as possible to the victim as quickly as possible. As the hon. Member
for Middlesbrough has said, once people find out that they have
mesothelioma, they have little time left in their lives to plan for the
financial security of their dependants because, very sadly, they often
die quickly and nastily within six to nine months of contracting the

after-the-event insurance or the best-priced legal fees when they are

a consequence of which changes may be made swiftly. When we have been

might be too early to conduct a proper assessment of the effect of
sections 44 and 46, we must be aware that the legal ombudsman has made
it clear that the changes are causing considerable stress and excessive
loss not only to mesothelioma victims but to other personal injury
claimants. Mesothelioma victims are a special case, for reasons that
have been outlined. The Government recognised that in their written
ministerial statement, and the introduction of section 48 of LASPO
indicated that mesothelioma should be considered differently from other
personal injury cases.</hs_Para>

pick up on the written ministerial statement, which the hon. Member for
Middlesbrough has mentioned. It referred to the Mesothelioma Bill, an
important piece of legislation for those who cannot trace their
insurer, which will be welcomed by the 300 or so victims every year who
cannot get compensation through the civil claims process. LASPO is not
relevant to the Mesothelioma Bill. LASPO deals with those who are going
through the complex civil claims process, but the Mesothelioma Bill is
there for entirely different reasons. If we continue to mix the two
pieces of legislation—the Minister should listen carefully to
this, because it would have a Treasury impact—we may end up
providing a disincentive for people to trace their insurer because they
find it too difficult to do so through the civil claims process. If
they trace their insurer, they may lose 25% of their compensation as a
result of sections 44 and 46 of LASPO. We want people to access the
scheme for the right reasons, and those measures create a perverse
incentive for people to access it for precisely the wrong
reasons.</hs_Para>

to read the exact quote from the late Paul Goggins that the hon. Member
for Middlesbrough used, in order to make the point that people find it
repulsive that victims of mesothelioma could be asked to shop around to
get the best deal from those who might represent them. However, the
hon. Gentleman made that point perfectly adequately, and I hope that
the Minister heard it the first time. We must acknowledge the fact that
the report has not been published. We are 
<?notus-xml column=303?>not trying to be difficult with the Minister—I am certainly not.
All I want is to put the victim at the centre of the process. To be
perfectly honest, it does not feel like that is the case

am sure that the Minister is aware that over the past few years 15
people have died of mesothelioma in his own constituency. That is the
15 deaths that are registered; it is not necessarily the 15 people who
have had secondary exposure, such as the women who washed overalls or
the children who hugged their father when he came home from work. Of
the 15 people who were registered, statistically two of them would not
have bothered to go into the civil claims process because it is too
complex. Those who have, I hope, have been adequately compensated for
simply going to work and contracting a disease. The danger is that the
legislative changes proposed on the Minister’s watch could mean
that more people do not get the financial compensation they deserve,
either because they do not go through the civil claims process, or
because they do and are punished by losing 25% of what they should get
to lawyers or
insurers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012955000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012955000044">Our

many people have died of this disease so far; we do not know how many
people will die of it in future. We do know, however, that they will
die quickly. We also know that they will want to pass away leaving some
sort of financial security for their dependents. I urge the Minister
not only to publish the report—it is a moot point as to whether
the process was conducted properly or whether the question asked was at
all relevant to mesothelioma victims—but to halt the
introduction of sections 44 and 46 until much further consideration has
taken

Christmas, I was a member of the Public Bill Committee that scrutinised
the Mesothelioma Bill, and it really was informative. The Labour
Opposition and I missed great opportunities to try to get the rightful
compensation for people who have suffered greatly as a consequence of
mesothelioma. As I look around the Chamber, I see people, including the
hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Tracey Crouch), who clearly
understand how this disease affects individuals. It is as vicious as
any work-related condition that anyone could experience. We must never
forget the impact it has had on families and

is one of those diseases where once someone has been diagnosed, the
prognosis is basically death within—if they are lucky—18
months. As politicians of whatever party—red, blue, yellow or
whatever— we have a duty to look after people whose
only  crime was going to work in unsafe conditions. At the time
they were very much unaware of how unsafe the conditions were. We heard
tales of people—young people; apprentices—making asbestos
snowballs at work and throwing them at each other, not knowing that in
future it could have a dramatic impact on their lives and those of
their families. The issue is really, really serious.</hs_Para>

continue without paying tribute, as has each Member who has spoken, to
the late Paul Goggins. He made a fantastic contribution to the
Mesothelioma Bill Committee and was for a long time a fantastic
campaigner on similar issues, particularly those related to cancer. Of

Mesothelioma Bill was a missed opportunity. Once enacted, it will
underpay people who are suffering—the victims. As the hon.
Member for Chatham and Aylesford said, we must at all times “put
the victim at the centre of the process.” Too many others have
been involved, such as the insurance company that has led things from
the front. During scrutiny of the Bill, the Minister in the Committee,
the Minister of State, Department for Work and Pensions, the hon.
Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning), said quite clearly that it
was not a case of bringing the insurance companies to the table to
discuss compensation; they had to be dragged there. The insurance
companies have made fortunes—millions if not billions of
pounds—from premiums. We must not forget that premiums were
paid. It is not a case of insurance companies looking for finance that
was not there: the premiums had been paid by the employers, and the
insurance companies have paid out dividends to shareholders instead of
keeping the money for compensating dying victims of
mesothelioma.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012955000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012955000050">We
often forget the families. The cut-off date in the Mesothelioma Bill is
July 2012. That means that millions—sorry, I am getting carried
away with my figures—certainly hundreds if not thousands of
people will miss out on any form of compensation. At best, the
individuals affected will receive 75% of damages. It is beyond me why
they have to accept that. If someone gets hurt and the employer accepts
it, why should the insurance company demand that they get only 75% of
what the injury is actually worth? That is absurd and should not be the
case for this horrendous disease. At the same time as getting only 75%
of damages, the benefits clawback is being pitched at
100%.</hs_Para><hs_ParaIndent UID="14012955000213" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012955000213">These
people, who have suffered, are suffering greatly and will suffer in
future, are confused. They are confused by our debating LASPO. These
people are ill, their families are looking ahead to a lifetime without
their loved ones, and they are trying to understand what LASPO and CFA
mean. As politicians we should be above that. We should have ensured
that the families came first, as the hon. Member for Chatham and
Aylesford said. The families are not aware of what section 44 and
section 46 mean. They have not got a clue and, let us be honest, they
are not even bothered what section 44, section 46 and section 48 of the
LASPO Act mean. What they want is justice for their families and for
the person who sadly will be leaving the family within 18
months at best. The review is totally flawed. As I said in an

Green:</Member></B> Does my hon. Friend agree that that must be at best
a quite cynical statement? The argument about the Mesothelioma Bill was
that a deal was being negotiated with the insurance industry, and that
it would not be possible to introduce a scheme to have effect prior to
the conclusion of that deal on 25 July 2012. It seems that at the
beginning of 2012, when the LASPO Act was passed, Ministers were
envisaging a deal that did not exist, as the present justification for
saying that the two can be synchronised. They cannot possibly have been
waiting to synchronise with a deal that might never have come to
fruition.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012955000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012955000053"><B><Member ContinuationText="Ian Lavery" PimsId="5675" UID="14012955000281" xid="1227" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012955000281">Ian

second issue is the fact that the section 48 review did not ask
respondents to make the case for the mesothelioma exemption. It asked
if respondents agreed with the Government that the exemption should be
lifted in the light of the consultation reforms, plus the CFA reforms
and the Mesothelioma Bill. Had the Government asked for the case to be
made, the recent legal ombudsman’s report on no win, no fee
arrangements would have been most pertinent. The report states that the
CFA agreements are not simple to understand and contain unclear terms
and conditions, and that there is evidence of some lawyers failing to
make clear the financial risks of CFA agreements and trying to pass on
the risk to customers. That is precisely the situation that the Lords
feared and would not tolerate for dying mesothelioma
sufferers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012955000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012955000055">As
it stands, the review is not based on the effects of sections 44 and 46

that—it is question 15 of the section 48 review. It is even more
reason for us to seek agreement to the abandonment of the review, and
to get to grips with the real problems cutting across the Mesothelioma
Bill. MPs should ensure that the outcome of a proper section 48 review
is brought before Parliament and not introduced via a commencement

legal aspect of the matter seems extremely complicated, and I make an
appeal to politicians from across the Chamber. The legislation is not
really what I 
<?notus-xml column=306?>or many other Labour Members wanted, but it is progress. It will mean
that individuals can get some form of compensation through the scheme.
We must put individuals at the heart of things—the sufferers:
people who are losing their lives, and families who will lose loved
ones within 18 months. Such things should be cleared pretty quickly, so
that families will not be bogged down in legal problems, and will fully
understand the compensation procedures they want to embark on. Even if
there was 100% compensation for mesothelioma it would not be enough;
there cannot be enough compensation for the loss of a breadwinner,
father and husband, or mother and wife. There cannot be enough
compensation for the loss of someone so important in family
life.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="14012955000258" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0001.htm#14012955000258">3.16

other questions. Indeed, the last communication that I had with him, by

struck by how important this issue is to the public. The pack contains
cuttings from newspapers from all around the country, not just from the
old industrial areas. Real anger comes through in the personal case
histories, and from commentators, about how the Government have been
selling mesothelioma victims

similar response was given to my noble Friend Lord Beecham and Tony
Whitston, which made it clear that the only link between the LASPO
provisions and the Mesothelioma Bill is that they might happen at the

second point that has been made, which I will not labour, is that,
somehow, it was right to go ahead with applying sections 44 and 46 to
mesothelioma claims because of the other changes that were being made.
Under the influence of the Association of British Insurers, as always,
the Government were pretending that the pre-action protocol, the
gateway and the fixed costs would actually help mesothelioma sufferers.
Let us be fair to the Government, because for once they did not go down
the route of pursuing the ABI agenda. I am pleased to say that on some
issues, such as the changes to the small claims limit for
whiplash—with which the Government are not going ahead
either—the Government are not slavishly following the insurance
industry’s agenda, as they have previously. They are following
that agenda most of the time, but not all the
time.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012955000090" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0002.htm#14012955000090">Having
now resiled from those positions, the Government cannot rely on the
changes as a reason for not going ahead with the review and for not
persisting with mesothelioma as a special case. All they are left with
is the proposed reforms described in the consultation. That is a
completely circular argument that takes us back to exactly where we
were when the Government tried in the first place to say that the
changes to CFAs and “after the event” premiums should
apply to mesothelioma as they do to everything else. All the Government
are saying is, “We were right all along. We had to say something
to get our legislation through, but we never had any intention of
complying with it. We have gone
forward.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012955000091" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0002.htm#14012955000091">Finally,
I remind the Minister of the points made by Paul Goggins during our
consideration of both the LASPO Act and the Mesothelioma Bill. The
problem with the new cost regime is, first, that a successful claimant
will pay up to 25% of their general damages as success fees. Secondly,
to mitigate that attack on their damages, a claimant will have to shop
around for a cheaper lawyer. Thirdly, the qualified one-way costs
shifting does not provide a complete defence against costs. It does not
address disbursement, part 36 offers 
<?notus-xml column=311?>or issues where a court decides that a claim has been misconducted.
Finally, there are far fewer lawyers who will be
able under the new regime to take on such cases. It may be that not
only will people have to pay their own costs out of the damages but
they may not be able to bring the case at all. That is without going
into the problems of complexity and difficulty that, under the most
difficult circumstances, mesothelioma claimants already have to deal
with, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wansbeck and the hon. Member for
Chatham and Aylesford have
said.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012955000092" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0002.htm#14012955000092">With
all those problems, which affect other personal injury and civil claims
but which many Members of both Houses believe particularly apply in
mesothelioma cases, the Government should honour their commitment to
doing a proper review and a proper report explaining why, if they wish
to persist with applying sections 44 and 46, they intend to do so. They
should not do that in such a flippant and offhand
way.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012955000093" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0002.htm#14012955000093">Perhaps
the Minister could take the Secretary of State’s hint and go
back to consult properly by calling for evidence on exactly what will
be the consequences of applying sections 44 and 46. If he did that, he
would find overwhelming evidence that mesothelioma sufferers are a
particular case and that the Government’s commitments should be
honoured. I end on that point, but I ask the Minister to tell us what
the Government’s plans are, to justify the Government’s
intended actions and to tell us whether he will now go away, properly
consider the matter and honour the pledges made by his predecessors

me say at the outset that the Government recognise that mesothelioma is
a terrible disease and has a devastating impact on the families of its
sufferers. We take very seriously the plight of sufferers and their
right to be able to claim compensation for negligently caused personal
injury. The subject is, understandably, emotive, and that has been
demonstrated in our heartfelt and thorough debate today, as well as
during the passage through both Houses of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and
Punishment of Offenders Act 2012. Debates on LASPO included
consideration of the Government’s reforms to no win, no fee
conditional fee agreements, or CFAs, and led to the limited exception
of mesothelioma cases, to which I will return
shortly.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012955000102" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0002.htm#14012955000102">This
debate has highlighted the importance of the issue, and the Government
wholeheartedly agree that, given the short life expectancy after the
disease has been diagnosed, it is imperative that there is early
payment of compensation when necessary. That is why we announced on 4
December 2013 that we will explore whether more can be done to improve
the compensation claims
process.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012955000103" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0002.htm#14012955000103">I
appreciate that today’s debate has been about the
Government’s decision to remove the limited exception from no
win, no fee reforms in relation to mesothelioma cases. I want to deal
with three main issues. The first is why our reforms to CFAs are the
right way forward, and the second is the limited exception to these
rules in respect of mesothelioma claims and the circumstances in which
that exception will end; thirdly, I want to clarify the position
relating to the section 48 review and how it was carried
out.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012955000104" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0002.htm#14012955000104">I
will start by setting out briefly the rationale for our changes to
CFAs. Many mesothelioma claims are funded under such agreements. Legal
aid has not been available for some time. The previous
Government’s Access to Justice Act 1999 removed legal aid for
the majority of personal injury cases, including mesothelioma cases,
when alternative forms of funding, such as CFAs, were available. As
hon. Members will know, the Government have introduced reforms in
England and Wales relating to the way that civil cases are funded, and
the costs involved in bringing those cases. Those reforms are 
set out in part 2 of LASPO and took forward recommendations by Lord
Justice Jackson, a distinguished Court of Appeal judge.</hs_Para>

LASPO’s passage through Parliament, the Government accepted that
the reforms should not be brought into effect for mesothelioma claims
until a review had been carried out of the likely effect of those
reforms on such cases. That review provision is in section 48 of the
Act. If Parliament had intended the LASPO provisions not to apply to
such claims at all, it could have legislated to that effect. In the
event, mesothelioma claims were exempted, and Parliament legislated to
the effect that the provisions could be commenced for claims following
the conduct of a review, as set out in section 48. Of course, we must
recognise that a review could lead to a number of possible
outcomes—to claims continuing to be exempted from the reforms,
or alternatively to the exemption not continuing.</hs_Para>

Vara:</Member></B> I am coming immediately to the point that I
anticipated the hon. Gentleman would refer to. In conducting the
review, the Government focused their consideration on matters relevant
to claims for mesothelioma that are subject to litigation—in
other words, where a solvent defendant is identified. The provisions of
the Mesothelioma Bill, however, apply to sufferers who cannot trace a
defendant to sue for compensation. If claimants are able to identify a
defendant, the Mesothelioma Bill is not directly relevant to their
claim, and the Government have carefully borne this in
mind.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012955000118" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0002.htm#14012955000118">The
Government have not therefore taken the Bill into account in relation
to litigated cases in respect of the review. However, the Bill is
relevant to the timing of the application of sections 44 and 46 of
LASPO, since we have always intended to synchronise the implementation
of any decision on this matter with other reforms directed at improving
the position of mesothelioma sufferers. This was made clear when
Parliament agreed the relevant provisions in LASPO. Much was made of
that in earlier speeches, so I refer hon. Members to a debate on LASPO

would be a synchronisation of what the Department for Work and Pensions
did and what we did. That is what has happened. I trust that Members

Government have carefully considered the likely effect of implementing
the LASPO reforms on mesothelioma claims, including the evidence put
before us by respondents to the consultation. The issues raised,
however, were generally similar to those in other very serious personal
injury cases to which the reforms already apply. There was little
explanation of any particular feature of the mesothelioma claims
process that would lead to a different or disproportionate effect on
claimants’ access to justice, should the reforms apply.
Ultimately, in our view, there needs to be a specific
justification for the continued difference in treatment between
mesothelioma cases and other personal injury cases—most
particularly, other serious personal injury cases that have their own 
<?notus-xml column=316?>tragic features involving, as some do, catastrophic injury and the need
for substantial care arrangements for the remainder of a
claimant’s life, sometimes when the claimant is very
young.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012955000131" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0002.htm#14012955000131">Let
me emphasis that we entirely understand that mesothelioma victims face
an appalling and fatal disease with which they and their families have
to come to terms, while also having to engage with the claims process.
Without in any way seeking to minimise the distress that this entails,
however, there are many other serious personal injury and fatal claims,
to which the LASPO reforms already apply, that produce difficult
challenges for victims and
families.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012955000132" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0002.htm#14012955000132">On
4 December, we announced that we intended to apply sections 44 and 46
of LASPO to diffuse mesothelioma cases from July this year, when the
Mesothelioma Bill is expected to be implemented. When the reforms take
effect, claimants will be entitled to a 10% increase in general
damages. The average general damages for such cases, as set out in the
Judicial College guidelines, is £70,000, so that would be an
average additional £7,000 in
damages.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012955000133" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0002.htm#14012955000133">Claimants
will be liable for any success fee claimed by their lawyer, as in any
other personal injury case, but there is no requirement for a success
fee to be charged. The amount of any success fee is a matter for
negotiation between claimants and their lawyer. Claimants will also
benefit from costs protection in the form of qualified one-way cost
shifting, to protect them from having to pay the other side’s
costs if the claim fails. Additionally, the costs of any
after-the-event insurance that claimants feel they need in order to
deal with defendants’ part 36 offers—a process of
negotiation between parties on a reasonable offer for
resettlement—are expected to reduce. If a part 36 offer is
unreasonable, a claimant is not at risk for rejecting it. Claimant
lawyers tend to know what is and is not a reasonable offer. Claimants
are of course liable for disbursements in relation to their case, but
the general rule in all civil litigation is that reasonable costs will
be paid by a losing
defendant.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012955000134" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0002.htm#14012955000134">We

a country that has seen significant progress since its infancy.
Responding to the millennium development goals, it has reduced the
poverty gap ratio from 17% to 6.5%. Investment in children’s
health has resulted in a reduction in the mortality rate of
under-fives, and the prevalence of underweight children has almost
halved. The World Bank recognises the advances that the country
continues to make, suggesting that it will become a middle-income
country by 2021.</hs_Para>

happens in Bangladesh is hugely important for its prosperity and the
life chances of the people living there. However, the recent election
has seen those advances undermined by the country’s own
political leadership. As we all know, on 5 January, Bangladesh held its
10th general election. On paper at least, it demonstrated overwhelming
support for the Awami League, which won 232 of the 300 seats. However,
the reality of the election was a turnout that was reported as being as
low as 10% and a mass boycott by Opposition parties that meant that
half of the seats remained uncontested. Schools used as polling
stations were burned down and the lives of 21 were people
lost.</hs_Para>

the progress made by Bangladesh since its modern birth in 1971, but the
ongoing mistrust between the Awami League and the Bangladesh
Nationalist party and other Opposition parties points to a
dysfunctional political climate in which the prospect of free and fair
elections seems elusive.</hs_Para>

Andrew Smith</B> (Oxford East) (Lab):</Member> I congratulate my hon.
Friend on securing this enormously important debate and endorse what he
has said about the importance of the progress that Bangladesh has made.
Does he agree that one of the fundamental problems with the election
was the Awami League’s refusal to follow the precedent of
previous elections, whereby there had been a caretaker Government to
oversee fair process, foreign observers and the rest, and that that
failure and the political thinking behind it led to the tragedy that
now confronts us?</hs_Para>

Shuker:</Member></B> My right hon. Friend makes a powerful point, which
has been much debated not just in the House but further afield. The
events running up to the election were deeply regrettable. The question
of whether it was right to press on with the elections will perhaps be
left for others to decide—or even for history. Right now, it is
vital that the international community takes a lead—as the UK
has—in saying that the elections were neither free nor fair and,
for that reason, were not right.</hs_Para>

me, he probably has a large number of people from Bangladesh in his
constituency. Obviously, they are extremely concerned about what
happens back 
<?notus-xml column=318?>home, to use an expression, because that can have effects here. The
absence of an interim Government to oversee the elections was certainly
a major setback in a country that is now moving from third-world status

before in the Chamber: there was a real lack of democratic credibility
for the elections that took place. That is the past. The question I
have for him—and for the Minister—is about how we move
forward. Does he agree that the international community needs to work

Shuker:</Member></B> It is an excellent point. What is required in a
situation such as this, where there appears to be deadlock, is for the

regard.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012955000147" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0002.htm#14012955000147">We
have that role not least because we are a major investor in Bangladesh:
in this calendar year, the Department for International Development
will spend around £275 million in Bangladesh. Around a third of
that will go directly to the Bangladeshi Government, and a significant
proportion of the money that will be spent is aimed at boosting
political participation and promoting safety and justice. One programme
that falls into that category, called Strengthening Political
Participation in Bangladesh, holds three clear goals: first, to make
political parties more responsive to citizens and their interests;
secondly, to strengthen core democratic institutions, namely the
Bangladesh Electoral Commission and Parliament; and thirdly, to ensure
that civil society advocates effectively for a more accountable and
responsible political system. Despite the commencement of that
programme four years ago in 2009, the 2014 election was notable for its
success in weakening all three objectives.</hs_Para>

political conflict has a damaging effect not only on empowerment and
accountability but on other things. The Centre for Policy Dialogue has
estimated a total economic loss of over £3.8 billion as a result
of the conflict around the election caused by blockades and ongoing
political turmoil. That loss has hit the transport industry, the
agricultural sector and the clothing and textiles industry hardest.

right that in this scenario DFID should reflect on the relative success
of the programmes that are funded in conjunction with the United States
Agency for International Development and amount to aid of 
<?notus-xml column=319?>over £56 million over a five-year period. Arguably, their success
is questionable. The issue is complex—I am
not suggesting that the programmes simply do not work, or that they
should be junked or the money withdrawn—and DFID Ministers
should look urgently at how that money is spent, so that it can be
fully effective in engaging and empowering voters across the

review of the programmes would be helpful, as through them we have the
potential to shape a relatively young country, and shape a structure
that is fair and sustainable. That must be done quickly, as tensions
remain high and local elections will take place over the coming months.
Will the Minister reflect on that in his discussions with the
Department for International Development and, in his reply, will he
commit the Government to publishing the findings of the DFID review
that is already being spoken about? There is scope for reviewing all
in-country programmes in Bangladesh, to assess whether they have made

to condemn human rights abuses—a subject that we do not have
time to go into today—committed by all sides, but we must not
lose sight of the imminent needs of the Bangladeshi people. We must
encourage the President to act on the assurances given to work with the
18-party alliance. We must discourage the personal exchanges that have
occurred between party leaders, because such actions have enormous
implications for their ability to work together in the interests of
Bangladesh. We should call for the release of the many political
prisoners who have been detained in the run-up to the presidential
election and who await bail. That is happening, but clearly not fast

in place for this year’s local elections, and it is incumbent on
us to ask what practical support is necessary to ensure that those, and
the subsequent phases in March and May this year, happen cleanly. It
goes without saying that Britain, where half a million members of the
Bangladeshi diaspora live, should continue to play a significant role.
Those individuals remind us of Britain’s historical relationship
with Bangladesh, our privileged role as a member of the UN Security

relationship with the USA and other English-speaking nations and our
seat at the heart of Europe. Working from this place with our partners,

Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Hugh
Robertson):</Member></B> Thank you, Mr Hollobone—although
perhaps not for that introduction, to be honest. May I begin by saying
that I am grateful to the hon. Member for Luton South (Gavin Shuker)
for securing this important debate? I apologise to him at the outset
for not being the Minister with direct responsibility for Bangladesh,
but I read the Backbench Business Committee debate from 16 January
before this debate and I give him a commitment that I will ensure that
his remarks today are passed to Baroness Warsi and, in view of the
comments he made, to my ministerial counterparts in the Department for
Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012955000164" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0002.htm#14012955000164">It
was clear from reading the report of that debate that Members on both
sides of the House share a common commitment to the well-being, future
prosperity and stable democratic development of Bangladesh, but
considerable concerns have been expressed about all three areas. As the
hon. Gentleman said, the relationship between the UK and Bangladesh is
strong, with considerable ties of history and family. We want to
promote a shared belief in democracy, good governance and sustainable
development. He is right to say that the recent election in Bangladesh
fell drastically short of the ideals we would expect. Our response
falls into three areas. First, we expressed public regret at the lack
of participation and the scenes of violence. Secondly, we call on
Bangladesh’s political parties to begin a dialogue that finds a
long-term, sustainable solution, in a way that does not exist at the
moment, for the good of Bangladesh’s people. Thirdly, we
recognise that a proper functioning democracy, as we would understand
it, is vital for Bangladesh’s future security and prosperity. I
shall take each of those in turn.</hs_Para>

British Governments have believed that peaceful, credible elections
that express the will of the voters are the true mark of a mature,
functioning democracy. The 10th parliamentary elections, held in
Bangladesh on 5 January, were constitutionally correct, as the hon.
Gentleman acknowledged, but the main Opposition party did not
participate. Indeed, half the electorate did not get the chance to
vote. There must therefore be concern as to whether the will of the
Bangladeshi people has been properly reflected and whether the
elections met the goals of a true
democracy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012955000166" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0002.htm#14012955000166">In
the run-up to those elections, the UK engaged with all political
parties in a number of ways, calling on them to ensure full, open and
participatory elections. My honourable and noble Friend Baroness Warsi
delivered the same message personally to leaders of the ruling and
Opposition parties when she visited on 12 December. Her public
statement on 6 January expressed our disappointment at the election
outcome and condemned the acts of intimidation and unlawful political
violence. 
<?notus-xml column=322?>Those acts are striking: more than 500 people are believed to have lost
their life as a result of political violence in 2013; 21 deaths were
reported on polling day; and more than 100 polling centres, many of
which were schools and colleges in poor rural areas, were burned down.
By any standard, that is shocking. The deaths and destruction sadden
me, as I know they sadden Members on both sides of the House.</hs_Para>

deeply concerned about the deaths and the continued political
harassment, and the heightened political tensions that underlie them.
However, as the hon. Gentleman said in his well-balanced and fair
speech, there have been some positive moves recently. We are pleased
that the Bangladesh Nationalist party has condemned the violence and
announced a suspension of its enforced strikes and transport blockades.
The relaxation of police restrictions at Opposition party offices and
the granting of bail for some BNP leaders by the High Court brings some
promise, but it is not nearly enough. Further bold moves by all sides
are needed if the needs and wishes of the people of Bangladesh are
going to be met and put first. As he said in his balanced speech, in
the meantime, the UK continues to do what it can to support Bangladesh
and its
democracy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012955000168" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0002.htm#14012955000168">We
remain absolutely committed to supporting the Bangladesh development
goals, as laid out in the millennium development goals. Between 2011
and 2015, as the hon. Gentleman said, our support will lift 1.5 million
people out of extreme poverty, provide access to safe water for 1.3
million people and ensure that 500,000 boys and girls complete their
primary school education. I am pleased that UK aid is working to
improve governance in Bangladesh. It is vital to develop a political
system that is more capable, more accountable and much more responsive
than it is at the moment. I will ensure that the remarks that the hon.
Gentleman made are brought to the attention of DFID
Ministers.</hs_Para>

Gentleman briefly mentioned the support that was given around election
time. The UK supported the Bangladesh Election Commission and work was
done to update the voters register, train polling officials and develop
new systems to publish candidates’ details, including
declarations of wealth, which I imagine is  a controversial
topic in that part of the world. Notwithstanding the outcome of the
poll, we believe that those improvements will stand the Government in
good stead in future elections.</hs_Para>

hon. Gentleman particularly wants to raise anything else, I shall end
where I began; by congratulating him on securing the debate and on the
tone with which he led it, and by thanking him for his continued
interest in the country. It is shared by many across the House.
Bangladesh is an important partner for the United Kingdom and we will
continue to support its people in their aspirations, as we see them,
for a more stable, prosperous and democratic future. In doing that,
however, it is important that we never shy away from delivering tough
messages to the political leadership to try and ensure that those
expectations are fulfilled.</hs_Para>

Morris</B> (Morecambe and Lunesdale) (Con):</Member> First, may I
express my mixed emotions about introducing this debate on the cockle
picking disaster that took place 10 years ago, in 2004? I have mixed
emotions because I am extremely honoured to represent Morecambe and
Lunesdale, but the event that we are talking about is a great scar on
my community and our whole
nation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012955000173" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0002.htm#14012955000173">Morecambe
bay is one of the most picturesque places on earth, but it is also an
unforgiving environment that can claim lives in minutes. I have always
found it hard to reconcile the sedate appearance with the dangerous
reality. In 2004, many people believed that the risks associated with
Morecambe bay had been mitigated. After all, we had been offering
guided tours under professional supervision for years, warning signs
were all around and in any case the amount of onshore fishing had
declined. Given that background, it is easy to see why the people of
Morecambe felt such a profound sense of shock and sadness when the
events of 5 February
unfolded.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012955000174" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0002.htm#14012955000174">Before
I make any comments on the 10 years since the cockle pickers’
tragedy or what we should do in the future, perhaps it is worth
remembering what happened. On 5 February 2004, a group of some 38
illegal immigrants from China were working to collect cockles near Hest
Bank, which is the northern part of the bay. Shockingly, they were
being paid £1 per kilogram of cockles—a desperately low
wage by anyone’s standard. As the day drew on, a team of British
cockle pickers tried to signal the Chinese workers and warn them that
the tide was coming in. Given the distance, they tapped their watches
and tried to speak to them, seemingly to no avail. At about 9.30 pm,
the Chinese cockle pickers were cut off by the incoming tide. It is a
long-held belief locally that they were waiting for the evening to
come, as cockles come to the surface at night.</hs_Para>

clear that the cockle pickers were in trouble, they phoned the
emergency services for help. Sadly, what followed was fairly confused,
for the following reasons. It was quite dark, and a basic description
of the location was unlikely to enable emergency services to pinpoint
exactly where they were. The cockle pickers were not fluent in English
and found it hard to explain their predicament. The phone call was
unclear, and the severity of the situation was not successfully
conveyed to the emergency services. All of that led to delays that
undoubtedly cost lives. In the end, 23 people, mainly from Fujian
province in China, lost their lives. Just 15 people escaped.
Sadly, one body has never been
found.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012955000176" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0002.htm#14012955000176">In
the aftermath of the cockle pickers’ tragedy, the gangmaster,
Lin Liang Ren, was sentenced to 14 years in prison. He had sent a group
of people who had little or no experience of Morecambe bay out without
any proper guidance or supervision to their deaths. Anyone who knows
Morecambe bay will say that sending people out in that way is
unforgivable. Indeed, Lin Liang Ren was described in court as a callous
man, motivated by money. The men and women he exploited paid a heavy
price for that cavalier and greedy attitude. Not only did many die, but
all of them had paid enormous sums to be smuggled into the UK in the
first place.</hs_Para>

Wu Hong Kang, who was killed on 5 February 2004. His wife and children
bear a debt of nearly £20,000 to pay for his transit to the UK,
yet their monthly income is just £20. They have no prospect of
ever paying off that sum. At first glance, we might say to ourselves
that they should not pay the debt. After all, what was done was
illegal, so perhaps the authorities could step in. Sadly, the reality
is that the gang collected the money many years ago. The debt is to
friends and family who put up the money for Mr Wu’s
transport, and these are people who cannot afford to write off the
debt. I have no idea what it must be like to be paying a crippling debt

gratitude of the people of Morecambe and Lunesdale for his work on this
issue and for the work of my predecessor, Geraldine Smith. Like all
bodies, the GLA is not perfect, but the 2005 Act set the groundwork for
much of the work that is being done to protect these vulnerable

a range of national and international issues have been raised by this
disaster, and the 10th anniversary is the time to review what work has
been done and what has yet to be done, but before that, I want to talk
to my hon. Friend the Minister about some very localised issues. I take
the view that, no matter how much we regulate gangmasters and reduce
illegal immigration, and no matter what the salaries we pay to workers,
no one should be out in the middle of Morecambe bay unless they are
properly trained and supervised and are aware of the dangers of their
working environment. No amount of general employment regulation will
ever be enough in such an environment. For that reason, I believe we
should be licensing people to undertake onshore fishing in the bay. The
aim would be not to stop people making a living, but to ensure that
when teams go out they possess the proper skills required to work both
profitably and
safely.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012955000180" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0002.htm#14012955000180">With
the right training and knowledge, Morecambe bay need not be a dangerous
environment. In fact, tour guides take people out daily with no
problems. We  must recognise, however, that they can do so
because local knowledge and experience are paramount. Teams of onshore
fishermen who do not hold such a level of knowledge are endangering
themselves, their staff and the emergency services that might have to
intervene. With that in mind, will my hon. Friend the Minister update
me on the progress of the Morecambe bay hybrid fishery order? I know
that it has a number of facets to it, but how does he believe it will
protect vulnerable workers in future? Also, when will it be implemented
in full, what has happened up until now and what have been the
hold-ups? I am sure he will agree that, whatever national issues were
faced in the aftermath, we have a duty to get the regulation right for
the bay and for offshore fisheries around the
nation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012955000181" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0002.htm#14012955000181">The
tragedy raised national and international issues. Nationally, we have
the Gangmasters Licensing Authority. I know that there have been
discussions about what changes might be made to it as we
approach the 10th anniversary of the disaster. With that in mind, what
lessons have 
<?notus-xml column=325?>been learned from its first nine years in operation?
Does it need any reform or change of scope? What impact has it
made in reducing the abuse of vulnerable workers? I should say that I
am not tied to any one system; if reform is needed I am happy to work
with anyone to look at it. It is important to the people I represent
that we feel we are doing all that we can to ensure that we balance

is no point in having this debate if we do not touch on the problem of
illegal immigration. The cockle pickers’ disaster demonstrated
that, at best, illegal immigrants and their families are small cogs in
far larger and more sinister criminal gangs. At worst, they are nothing
more than victims. Most are from poor backgrounds, forced to leave
their home countries due to extreme poverty. We all know that we have a
problem with illegal immigration in this country, and I am glad that we
are taking steps to deal with it because I believe that it is far worse
for the immigrants themselves. As I said earlier, they are forced to

hon. Gentleman will know that on that night 10 years ago,
the cockle pickers could just as easily have set off from the Furness
end of Morecambe bay, had the tides been different. Indeed, those gangs
were a regular sight, going on to the sands from the coast road between
Aldingham and Rampside. His predecessor, Geraldine Smith, and my
predecessor, now Lord Hutton, were strongly involved in establishing
the Gangmasters Licensing Authority after the tragedy, to try to ensure
that this horrible activity—and the way that these people were
being abused and exploited—could not happen
again.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012955000191" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0002.htm#14012955000191">Let
me, too, call on the Minister to respond on his Government’s
commitment to the Gangmasters Licensing Authority. It was recommended
for abolition in the Beecroft review. I understand that there is a firm
commitment from the Government not to enact that recommendation, but it
is important that the Minister puts that on record and shows that he
understands and hears the calls. The rush to abolish regulations and
strip away so-called burdens on business can sometimes target the
essential element of safety, and we could also end up with people who
want to observe safety standards, as many of our local cockle pickers
did and do, finding themselves undercut by these horrible, unscrupulous
practices.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-29?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_29_PT_1/AAB6BD3DC9C0BF63E3CFA82C4B908FDB3AF23420" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="29 January 2014">Wednesday

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs (George Eustice):</Member></B> I congratulate my hon. Friend
the Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale (David Morris) on securing this
debate, which is poignant and relevant to his constituency. The 10th
anniversary next week of the tragic events in Morecambe bay is indeed
an appropriate time to reflect on developments since. As my hon. Friend
said, we know that the Morecambe bay sands are no stranger to
loss of life over many centuries; it is, as he said, a beautiful yet
treacherous
place.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012955000193" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0002.htm#14012955000193">On
the evening of 5 February 2004, some 40 Chinese workers were picking
cockles on the sands, sent by their gangmaster. For him, maximising
profits meant cutting corners, ignoring tidal information and flouting
basic safety rules. As night closed in, hours after they should have
been told to leave the sands, the workers realised the tide had come up
too fast for them to escape and they were stranded. The bodies of 21
men and women were recovered from the bay in the next few days. There
were two further known victims: one was not found until 2010 and, as my
hon. Friend said, one has never been
found.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012955000194" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0002.htm#14012955000194">The
victims were illegal immigrants, inexperienced, untrained and with poor
English language skills. Their gangmaster, Lin Liang Ren, was
eventually convicted of  
<?notus-xml column=327?>21 counts of manslaughter, facilitating illegal immigration and
perverting the course of justice. In sentencing him to 14 years’
imprisonment, the judge at Preston Crown court said he was motivated by
greed to shockingly exploit his countrymen with no heed for their
safety.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012955000195" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0002.htm#14012955000195">The
causes of the 2004 tragedy stem from the management of the foreshore
fisheries at the time and employment legislation that allowed ruthless
exploitation of workers and neglect of safety to go unchecked. The
Government’s response addressed both those aspects. Following
the disaster, the north-western sea fisheries committee and later the
Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authority instituted a raft of
measures through a succession of byelaws to better regulate access to
the fishery, including tighter permit conditions to improve safety
standards. In specific terms, the number of permits issued has been
reduced from 2,000 in 2004 to 120 now. In addition and more
importantly, in order to be granted a permit to fish for cockles,
applicants must now complete a safety course which, as my hon. Friend
rightly said, is so
important.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012955000196" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0002.htm#14012955000196">Those
measures and others will be taken forward in the proposed Morecambe bay
fishery order, which is due to be consulted on in the near future. I
know that my hon. Friend expressed frustration that there is no time
scale for that. Beyond saying “in the near future”, I am
unable to give him a specific time scale at this point, but after
today’s debate, I will ask officials to make inquiries about the
exact status of the order and when he can expect it to be introduced,
so that it can be signed off and put in place. When in place, the order
will allow for more long-term and adaptive management of the entire
mollusc fishery, including the cockle beds. Most importantly, safety
measures imposed through the proposed order will be more stringent than
those that are in place now.</hs_Para>

to the disaster 10 years ago, the Government adopted a private
Member’s Bill, introduced by the  then hon. Member for
Renfrewshire West, now the  hon. Member for Paisley and
Renfrewshire North (Jim Sheridan), resulting in the Gangmasters
(Licensing) Act 2004. That established the Gangmasters Licensing
Authority to regulate the supply of labour in the shellfish,
agriculture, food processing and packaging sectors. The GLA’s
role provides protection to vulnerable workers, including taking action
against criminals, while operating an effective licensing regime to
ensure that standards are maintained and to prevent
exploitation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012955000198" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0002.htm#14012955000198">Casual
labour agencies in the agricultural sector perform an important
function. The seasonal nature of harvests in areas such as horticulture
means that flexible labour arrangements are crucial. Most operators in
the sector are responsible and compliant businesses, and GLA licensing
enables the well-regulated supply of casual labour to the sector. We
know, however, that there will always be a small minority who ignore
the rules.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14012955000199" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0002.htm#14012955000199">Since
beginning operations in 2006, the GLA has issued more than 2,500
licences, and there are currently just under 1,000 licence holders. In
that time, the agency has brought 67 successful prosecutions—43
for unlicensed gangmasters, 23 for using an unlicensed gangmaster, and
one for obstructing an investigation—and in the past three
years, it has helped to recover some £4 million for
casual staff who have either been underpaid or had 
<?notus-xml column=328?>unfair deductions taken from their pay. The GLA has also revoked
licences in 203 cases, where the holder has breached licensing
standards on pay, safety and other matters.</hs_Para>

sentences result in fines of between £300 and £5,000,
community service and probation orders or suspended sentences. It is
important to note that that is to be expected since we would want fines
and penalties to be proportionate to the breach committed. However, we
should also note that there is scope for custodial sentences in extreme
cases. In a landmark decision last December, the first custodial
sentence was handed down; a man in Norfolk was jailed for seven years
for acting as an unlicensed gangmaster. It was an extreme case,
involving violence and intimidation, and the individual built up an
organised crime group responsible for placing large numbers of
vulnerable people from Lithuania in substandard accommodation,
demanding high rents and charging for finding them work in local
GLA-sector industries. What that case illustrates is that the law can
and does provide the powers to deal with a full range of incidents that
the GLA encounters, from minor breaches right through to criminal abuse
and intimidation.</hs_Para>

Government have made it clear that they want the GLA to focus more on
the worst excesses in the areas that it regulates and work more closely
with other agencies that tackle crime, while stripping out unnecessary
burdens on the majority of compliant businesses. I would say that the
GLA is doing that. In September 2013, as part of the round of action to
ensure that public bodies remain fit for purpose, a triennial review
was announced, which provides an opportunity to test robustly the
requirement that the GLA is operating and is organised as effectively
as
possible.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012955000202" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0002.htm#14012955000202">The
hon. Member for Barrow and Furness (John Woodcock) asked for
reassurance on the Government’s intentions regarding the GLA.
The GLA has been considered by several reviews in recent years,
including the red tape challenge and the 2010 public bodies review. The
triennial review, which will be published shortly, provides an
opportunity to consider whether we can better organise the authority to
address the challenges that we
face.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012955000203" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0002.htm#14012955000203">I
will shortly publish a statement on the GLA triennial review, but I
will outline the main points today because I have been specifically
asked about our intentions. The review will conclude that the functions
of the GLA are necessary and that the GLA remains the right body to
deliver them. We will also conclude that the GLA should remain a
non-departmental public body and should continue to deliver reforms
already in train to reduce financial and administrative burdens on
compliant businesses and to focus effort on enforcement. We believe
that reforms to the GLA board should happen as soon as possible to
bring about a smaller, better structured board that is able to provide
a clear strategic direction for the
authority.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012955000204" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0002.htm#14012955000204">The
GLA is already proceeding with reforms to remove burdens on the
majority of compliant businesses by removing the need for all
applicants to receive an application inspection and by introducing
longer-term licences. That fits with the Government’s commitment
to have safeguards in place to monitor those businesses that are at
risk of breaking the law while enabling law-abiding, compliant
businesses to get on with business unhindered.</hs_Para>

alone in taking steps to mitigate the risks to vulnerable workers. On
16 December 2013, the Home Secretary published the draft Modern Slavery
Bill, which would consolidate existing human trafficking and slavery
offences; increase the maximum sentence available from 14 years to life
imprisonment; restrict the activities of offenders and those who pose a
risk to others; and require statutory bodies, such as the GLA, to
report all victims of human trafficking to the National Crime Agency,

routinely.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012955000206" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/halltext/140129h0002.htm#14012955000206">The

terrorists, evidenced by a significant number of attacks with lethal
intent taking place in the weeks before Christmas. Many more such

without any significant security incidents taking place is a major
achievement. High levels of cross-border police co-operation continue
to be a crucial part of efforts to combat terrorism and keep people in
Northern Ireland safe. Working relationships between PSNI and An Garda

issue. As the body responsible for setting standards for police
practice, it is right that the College of Policing should consider
whether their existing authorised professional practice (APP) on armed
policing should be amended in light of forthcoming IPCC guidance. Any
change in statutory guidance by either the college or the IPCC will be
for the Secretary of State for the Home Department to
approve.</hs_Para>

costs to DEFRA and Natural England in the December 2009 Judicial Review
hearing against DEFRA and Wightlink amounted to £23,230. This is
the amount paid for legal counsel and does not include the Department's
staff time, which officials have been unable to ascertain. DEFRA was
also ordered to pay a contribution of £30,000 to the successful
claimant's costs. A further fee of £4,260 was paid in relation
to additional advice from Counsel concerning subsequent correspondence
from the claimants. Interested parties in this case included Natural
England, Lymington Harbour Commissioners and New Forest District
Council. The latter two bodies may have also incurred legal costs,
having been represented at the hearings, but DEFRA does not hold
records of such costs. Natural England was not represented at the
hearing but is likely to have incurred costs in relation to its own
staff time supporting the Department in the case. However, again, the
Department has no record of
these.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012977001573" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/text/140129w0002.htm#14012977001573">We

aimed at encouraging business investment and supporting growth apply to
share farming as they do to other forms of farming and to businesses
generally. For example, in 2011 the Government increased the lifetime
limit for Entrepreneurs' Relief, which provides a reduced, rate of
capital gains tax for many sales of businesses, business assets and
shares, from £5 million to £10 million. Also, in 2013 the
annual investment allowance, providing an immediate tax deduction for
expenditure; on plant or machinery, was increased from £25,000

Lamb:</Member></B> The blood regulations were considered as part of the
Red Tape Challenge and the responses received by the Medicines and
Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) were in favour of
retaining the regulations. European Union blood regulations were
overall assessed favourably in the Department's Balance of Competence
Review in 2013. Separately, there was a request from the European
Commission for suggestions for technical amendments to the blood
directives and MHRA consulted with the Department of Health, devolved
Administrations and the United Kingdom blood transfusion services.
Suggestions were forwarded to the European Commission but the
Commission has said that there will be no revisions to the blood
directives until 2015 at the
earliest.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="1401303000029" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/text/140129w0005.htm#1401303000029">Departmental

Poulter:</Member></B> A key aim of the care.data programme is to link
information from all of the settings in which patients receive care in
order to provide a joined-up picture of the care being delivered. Given
the diverse range of information systems used in primary, secondary,
tertiary, community and social care, the Health and Social Care
Information Centre considers that the use of pseudonymisation-at-source
could, at this time, limit its ability to effectively link data from
across care settings.</hs_Para>

must meet fair processing obligations under the Data Protection Act
1998 (DPA), including an obligation to ensure that patients are aware
of how their personal confidential data are shared and their right to
object. The NHS England leaflet drop campaign will explain how the
national health service uses patient data and what patients should do
if they have any concerns or if they wish to
object.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1401303000894" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/text/140129w0005.htm#1401303000894">GPs
are responsible for the personal data that they hold and could face
civil action if they breached patient confidentiality or they could be
fined by the Information Commissioner if their action breached data
protection law. However, GPs are required by law to provide data to the
Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) for care.data and
provided that a GP releases no more data than that which is requested
by the HSCIC, there would be no grounds in which to take action against

financial support for inter-faith projects through out funding

the new arrangements are also an opportunity to deliver savings. The

place such figures in context, the right hon. Member may wish to peruse
the answer of 6 February 2007, <I>Official Report</I>, column 780W,
which outlines spending under the last Administration. The
Department/its predecessor spent £3.2 million on non-corporate
software licences in 2003-04, £2.6 million in 2004-05 and
£1.8 million in 2005-06, plus an additional £2.1 million

last Administration failed to get value for taxpayers' money due to
poor management of IT contracts. Indeed, the Department published a
contract tender in December 2009 for a desktop IT programme costing up
to £160 million. This was subsequently cancelled under this
Government as part of our wider reduction in departmental spending and
reconfiguration of IT procurement policy.</hs_Para>

council tax in England under this Government with the last Labour
Government. Overall, average council tax bills more than doubled under
the Labour Government, but have fallen by 10% in real terms under this
Government. This is due to this Government's council tax freeze and due
to the provisions in the Localism Act to allow local residents to veto
excessive council tax

the inaugural Overseas Territories Joint Ministerial Council in 2012,
the UK and Territory Governments stated a shared belief in tackling
discrimination so that all citizens had an equal opportunity to play an
active role in society. Since then a number of pieces of
anti-discrimination legislation has been passed in the Territories. For
example Bermuda's Human Rights Amendment Act 2013 ensures that no one
is discriminated against on the basis of age or sexual orientation. At
the Joint Ministerial Council in 2013, the UK and Territory Governments
made a commitment to work together to extend the core UN human rights

already.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1401306000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/text/140129w0005.htm#1401306000056">The

provide a number of explicit exemptions allowing Iran to purchase
humanitarian and other non-sanctioned goods from the EU. In line with
our commitments, there are no legal restrictions on any EU banks
handling permitted transactions (provided designated entities are not
party to the transaction, and subject to the 
<?notus-xml column=627?>authorisations and notifications required under the EU Regulation).
Under the Joint Plan of Action, the EU has increased ten-fold its
thresholds for authorisation of humanitarian transactions and payments
relating to other non-sanctioned trade. We are in consultation with
E3+3 partners on additional measures which may be required, in line
with the Joint Plan of Action, to facilitate humanitarian trade for
Iran's domestic needs using Iranian oil revenues held
abroad.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="1401306000011" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/text/140129w0005.htm#1401306000011">Japan</hs_8Question><Question><hs_Para UID="1401306000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/text/140129w0005.htm#1401306000071"><B><Member PimsId="455" UID="1401306000105" xid="512" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/text/140129w0005.htm#1401306000105">Andrew

£7.65 per hour. In London this is £8.80. The minimum

This equates to £8.31 per hour for staff employed to work
outside of London and £8.53 per hour for staff employed to work
in London. Staff in London also receive a location allowance of
£4,520 pa. This increases the minimum hourly rate in London to

Baker:</Member></B> During 2012, a total of 1,367
non-human primates were imported into the UK for use in regulated
procedures. This number comprised 38 rhesus macaques bred in China and
1,329 cynomolgus macaques bred in China, Vietnam and Mauritius. All
1,367 animals were captive-bred including 676 which were F1 generation
(the offspring, bred in captivity, of at least one wild-caught parent).
No wild-caught animals were imported from any source. These figures, by
month, are summarised in the following
table.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012957000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140129/corrtext/140129c0001.htm#14012957000011">Since
1 January 2013, when the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (the
Act) was amended to transpose European Directive 2010/63/EU on the
protection of animals used for scientific purposes, there has been no
requirement to notify the Home Office of the acquisition from overseas
breeding centres of non-human primates for use in regulated procedures.
