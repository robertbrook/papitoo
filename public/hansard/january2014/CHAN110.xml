story, is to progress the success of OEMs—original equipment
manufacturers—which are expanding, down through their supply

that issue through the Automotive Council and the industry strategy.

rejoicing at the fact that the FTSE 100 now has only two companies with
all-male boards. A couple of years ago, the figure was 24 boards, so
there has been significant progress. To increase the number of women
going on to boards, we are doing everything we can to improve the

support, mentoring and advice that they need to make themselves ready
for and to get into board positions. We are doing what we can to

employment agencies employing workers on, or close to, the minimum wage
appear to have been doing. I have been passed evidence that suggests
Blue Arrow, Staffline, Acorn, Taskmaster, Randstad and Meridian,
employment agencies employing more than 100,000 workers, have been
mis-selling personal accident insurance to workers which they arguably
do not need and from which those agencies have been profiteering. There
is even a company, Gee 7 Group, which specialises in putting together
these dubious arrangements for agencies. Further to my questions on

Democrat peers seem to think the party is in need of a truth and

Africa. It is clear that the Deputy Prime Minister has no authority

their misleading figures on flood defence spending. The crime figures

people had waited over a year for their treatment. Now that number has

worse, especially in Lancashire and the Ribble Valley? Annually, local
authorities pay £30 million in compensation to
motorists, so motorists themselves end up paying £2.8 billion in
repairs because of the number of potholes and craters in the roads. A
debate would enable us to focus on how much money is spent on the roads
and to ensure that the money is spent equally in counties such as
Lancashire, including in rural areas such as the Ribble

why we are pursuing a long-term economic plan which, among its many
benefits, is getting many more people into work, with 1.68 million
private sector jobs. We were left with an enormous deficit and we have
had to deal with that. We said at the outset that that would
necessitate a reduction in public sector jobs. Labour Members and the
Leader of the Opposition said, “It will never happen. Jobs will
be lost in the public sector but the private sector could not possibly
create equivalent numbers of jobs.” There are now four private
sector jobs for every public sector job lost. The hon. Lady and other
north-east MPs should be on their feet extolling the successes in the
north-east. This week, Nissan, with a new Qashqai model coming off its

Secretary of State for Defence (Mr Philip Hammond):</Member></B> With
permission, Mr Speaker, I wish to make a statement on the final part of
the armed forces redundancy programme. As the House will be aware,
following the decisions set out in the 2010 strategic defence and
security review, the first such review for 12 years, we have been
significantly restructuring and reshaping our armed forces to ensure we
can sustain their world-class capabilities in the future. As we move
from more than a decade of enduring operations in Iraq and Afghanistan,
and as we bring our troops back from Germany, we are constructing a new
force, Future Force 2020, to protect this country against future
threats<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T11:36:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012359000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/debtext/140123-0002.htm#14012359000067">Restructuring
the armed forces has required us to transfer personnel and resources
between regiments and trades to ensure that we can invest in new areas
of priority, such as cyber and ISTAR—intelligence, surveillance,
target acquisition and reconnaissance. We have also needed to ensure
that our armed forces retain the right age profile and skills as they
reduce in size. Achieving that outcome has, unfortunately, required a
limited redundancy
programme<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T11:37:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012359000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/debtext/140123-0002.htm#14012359000068">Today,
the armed forces are announcing the specialist areas from which they
will select personnel to be made redundant in this, the fourth and
final tranche. By strongly encouraging transfers between different
parts of the Army in particular, we have deliberately sought to keep
the number of redundancies to an absolute minimum. Hon. Members will no
doubt have seen recent speculation in the press about the size of the
final tranche. As a result of the steps we have taken, I can confirm
that the overall number of redundancies required is considerably lower
than that predicted in some recent press articles and lower than in
each of the three previous tranches. It will comprise up to 1,425
members of the Army, up to 70 medical and dental officers and nurses
from the Royal Air Force, and up to 10 from the Royal
Navy<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T11:38:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012359000069" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/debtext/140123-0002.htm#14012359000069">Tranche
4 will apply the same selection principles within the eligible cohorts
as were used in the last three tranches. Selection for redundancy will
be based on three criteria only: performance, potential and
employability. This is viewed by the individual services as the fairest
methodology to all who fall into the redundancy bracket. Individuals
will be informed of the outcome of the selection process on 12 June
2014. Applicants for voluntary redundancy will leave six months later
and non-applicants 12 months later. As with previous tranches, there
are a number of important exclusions from eligibility for compulsory
redundancy: those serving on specified operations any time between
today and the date of notification of selection for redundancy, 12 Jun
2014; and those who, on the date of notification of selection for
redundancy, have been warned for specified operations commencing on or
before 12 December 2014.</hs_Para>

tranche 3, those who volunteer for redundancy having been formally
warned for specified operations deploying before 12 December 2014 may
still be directed to deploy by their chain of command. This is to
ensure that their places do not have to be backfilled at short notice
owing to the notification period occurring over the handover between
the Herrick 19 and Herrick 20

current operations in
Afghanistan<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T11:40:00"></hs_TimeCode>.
Personnel assessed as being permanently below the level of fitness

a way of reducing still further the number of personnel to be made
redundant, we will continue to encourage personnel to transfer from
areas of surplus to areas of shortage. Specific vacancies have been
identified across all three services and those identified as at risk of
redundancy will be encouraged to transfer to areas for which they have
appropriate skills and will be offered retraining, as necessary. The
chain of command will continue to inform these personnel of the
transfer opportunities available to them at all stages of this
process<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T11:40:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012359000072" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/debtext/140123-0002.htm#14012359000072">I
have also instructed the services to seek to maximise the number of
volunteers in order to minimise the number of compulsory redundancies.
However, noting that 84% of personnel made redundant in tranche 3 were
applicants, it is likely that the percentage of volunteers overall in
this final tranche will be lower owing to the low historical level of
volunteers among Gurkhas—one of the fields eligible in this
round—and the fact that a number of specialist fields will face
100% selection, meaning that there is little or no incentive to
volunteer<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T11:41:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012359000073" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/debtext/140123-0002.htm#14012359000073">Throughout
the whole redundancy programme since 2010, approximately 500 Gurkhas
have been transferred to other parts of the Army, significantly
reducing the requirement for Gurkha redundancies. However, there
remains a surplus of personnel in the Brigade of Gurkhas, which is due
largely to the changes in their terms and conditions in 2007 that
aligned their service periods with that of the Regular Army—from
15 years to 22 years—and a raised recruitment level
to compensate for some soldiers’ previous long periods of leave
in Nepal. Gurkha personnel now serve on the same terms and conditions
as the rest of the Army and are therefore eligible for the redundancy
programme, like other personnel currently employed in areas of
surplus.</hs_Para>

only an extensive redundancy package but comprehensive resettlement
support to help them find work and settle into life outside the armed
forces. The career transition partnership, which provides briefings,
advice and guidance on such issues as housing and obtaining future
employment, is highly successful in assisting service leavers to find
work, and our latest figures indicate that approximately 90% of service
leavers seeking employment find it within six months of leaving the

an organisation that is fed from the bottom up, the armed forces are
always recruiting, and this must and will remain a priority. There is a
constant need to replace with new talent those who are promoted or who
complete their service. The armed forces require a constant flow of
young, fit recruits to maintain the structure required. That is why a
major multi-media Army recruiting campaign began earlier this month for
both regular and reserve recruits, which we are confident will raise
awareness of Army recruiting and provide the backdrop to a
reinvigorated recruitment effort at all levels over the next couple of

pressing ahead with these redundancies, the Government are taking risks

the required uplift in the number of reserves—the 10,000
new recruits to replace the 30,000 regulars—was not happening at
anywhere near the speed required. The Government hardly met a third of
their own targets. We said then, as did Members from across the House,
that the Government should pause their reductions in Army numbers until
it was clear that their reserve recruitment was on track. That is still
the case

this specific round of redundancies, will the Defence Secretary tell us
how many of them will be compulsory and from which regiments and

that this is a shocking way to repay the dedicated service that these
people have given their country? Is he concerned about a loss of
skills, particularly on pinch points, and what is he doing to address
the problem? Will he confirm at least that no one will be made
redundant in a way that affects their pension entitlement? Is it true
that a small number of military personnel have been made redundant just
days before they meet a service requirement for a pension to which they
are entitled? If that is the case, it is not fair.

hon. Gentleman began by asking when the Government had changed their
aspiration to have larger armed forces. Perhaps some of my hon. Friends
can help me with that, but I would guess that it was at about the time
when Labour was wrecking our economy, and we were recognising that we
would have to recalibrate our ambitions in all sorts of areas in order
to govern the country responsibly. We understand, above all else, that
a strong defence of this country can be built only on a strong economy.
We must first repair the damage that Labour has done to our economy and
then repair the damage that it has done to our society, after which,
hopefully, we shall in due course be able to afford to put more money
into our armed forces as our economy and our public finances

hon. Gentleman said that we had let the armed forces down. I say that
it is Labour, through its wrecking of our economy, that has let our
armed forces down, as it has let the rest of the country down. As for
the hon. Gentleman’s comments on this particular tranche of
redundancies, what I hear from him is total confusion. He accepts the
need for downsizing and restructuring of the Army, but says that we
have not made the case for using the redundancy process to do that. He
is talking nonsense. We have set out a structure for our armed forces
in “Future Force 2020”. They will be smaller than they
have been previously, but, crucially, they will have a different
structure, relying on reserves, on civilian support and on contractors
in some specialist areas. As a consequence, the redundancy process
needs to address the structural imbalance in the Army, taking out areas
of capability that we no longer need in our regular
forces<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T11:53:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012359000092" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/debtext/140123-0002.htm#14012359000092">As
the hon. Gentleman will understand if he listened to my statement, I
cannot tell him in advance what percentage of the redundancies will be
compulsory; that will depend on how many people volunteer. However, I
have been very upfront with the House. As there will be a significant
number of Gurkha redundancies and Gurkhas traditionally do not
volunteer for redundancy, and as the fact that 100% of the numbers in
some fields of redundancy will be made redundant, giving little
incentive to volunteer, we expect the overall percentage of volunteers
to be lower in this final round of redundancies than it has been in the
past<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T11:54:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012359000093" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/debtext/140123-0002.htm#14012359000093">The
hon. Gentleman made two points about fairness. First, he asked whether
I thought it was fair that people approaching their immediate pension
point—the point at which they can leave the Army and draw an
immediate annual cash pension—should be eligible for redundancy.
We have thought very carefully about this over the period of the
redundancy programme. The truth is that wherever we draw the line there
will be somebody just on the other side of it who feels hard done by,
and understandably so, but we concluded that it would be unfair to take
into account length of service—proximity to immediate pension
point—as a criterion for redundancy and we have stuck to that
position throughout all four tranches of redundancy. Given the nature
of the fields we are looking at in this tranche, we expect the number
of people potentially at risk of redundancy who are within a year of
their immediate pension point to be very small compared with previous
tranches<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T11:55:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Gentleman asked about the Gurkhas and raised again the question of
fairness. He asked explicitly whether the increased cost of Gurkha
service was driving these redundancies. The answer
is no, but it is the change in their terms and
conditions. Previously Gurkhas served under different terms and
conditions. The size and level of recruitment to the Brigade of Gurkhas
was designed around 15 years of service. We now have to deal with the
bulge caused by a change in the terms and conditions so that Gurkhas
serve for 22 years. That is a structural challenge in the Brigade of
Gurkhas. We have also seen a change to the terms and conditions of
service, which no longer provide for Gurkhas to take long periods of
leave to return home to Nepal. That was previously covered through an
over-manning by about 370 individuals in the Brigade of Gurkhas, which
allowed for those periods of extended leave at home that are no longer
available now that the terms and conditions of service are standardised
across the Army. So what we are seeing here is not an unfairness; we
are seeing the consequences of a decision to apply fairly the terms and
conditions of service to the Brigade of Gurkhas as they are applied to
the rest of the

interview in question, he seemed distinctly vague about some of the
details of our defence policy. He could not even quite remember what
our position was on aircraft carriers, and it seemed to have completely
passed him by that we were building the two largest ships in the Royal
Navy’s history right now, not only to replace the carrier
capability but hugely to enhance it. I absolutely reject his suggestion
that we will not be able to be a worthy and preferred partner for the
United States in the future. Just last week, I met the commander of the
United States fifth fleet, who told me specifically that the Royal Navy
was, and will remain, the fifth fleet’s partner of preference
and that, in their joint operations in the Gulf, the dividing line
between the Royal Navy and the fifth fleet was invisible. That is the
way we want it to be, and that is the way we will ensure it
remains.</hs_Para>

Hammond:</Member></B> Well, there were a lot of multiple questions in
there. First, I should like to make it clear that the restructuring of
the Regular Army is predicated on a number of things. The growth of the
reserves is one of them, but an increased use of civil support and
contractors to provide some of the support functions is also an
important part. Once we have built the reserve force to the level that
we have set out by 2018, there will be certain areas where we use
reservists routinely on operations because we only hold those
capabilities in the reserve force. But of course, a core function of

have been tried in different 
<?notus-xml column=472?>areas and different parts of the country to see what works best. What is
clear to me is that, as I said in the House last week, we must focus
back on using front-line reserve units as the principal tool of
recruitment to the reserve. We can support that with national campaigns
and a nationally managed IT platform, but we must rely on front-line
reservists recruiting their fellow reservists. Everything that I have
seen reinforces that, and it will be one of the driving requirements in
how we manage this

Hammond:</Member></B> First, my hon. Friend
continually asserts, and I continually rebut, the
idea that we are trying to replace 20,000 regular soldiers
with 30,000 reservists— that is not what we are doing.
We are restructuring the regular force; the regular force will be
smaller. We will use civilians in a different way from how we have used
them in the past. We will use contractors more effectively, learning
the lessons, particularly from the US experience of using contractors
to support combat operations. We will also use reservists, but it is
simply wrong for him to suggest that this is a straightforward swap of
20,000 regulars replaced by 30,000 reservists. That is not
how it works.</hs_Para>

Hammond:</Member></B> Let me just be clear about what we are talking
about, as although the hon. Lady may understand this, perhaps not all
hon. Members do. When people reach their immediate pension point they
can leave the Army, notwithstanding the fact that they may be only in
their 40s, and take an immediate pension. When somebody is close to,
but has not reached, their immediate pension point when they leave the
Army through a redundancy, they receive an enhanced lump sum 
<?notus-xml column=473?>redundancy package to reflect that fact and they still, of course,
retain their pension rights when they reach their pensionable age of 60
or 65, depending on what pension scheme they are in. We have looked at
the alternatives and concluded that all of them would deliver at least
as much unfairness to other groups, and that this is the fairest and
most appropriate way to
proceed<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T12:22:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Edward Leigh</B> (Gainsborough) (Con):</Member> We were told,
understandably, that the armed forces had to take their share of pain

recruitment programme does not go as well as we all hope it will go,
can we at least keep the door open—I am not asking for a
commitment now—to once again recruiting more for the Regular
Army in the future and increasing it to meet our commitments as they

Hammond:</Member></B> I can say two things on that to my hon. Friend.
First, unfortunately, the scale of the damage to our public finances is
such that, as the Chancellor set out a couple of weeks ago, although
the economy may be recovering, we have not yet dealt with the
structural deficit we inherited from the Labour party, and it will take
some years yet to correct the fiscal imbalances that we face in this
country. However, he is right to say that we should never say never,
and one of the key drivers in our restructuring of the Army is to
ensure that we retain a capability to regenerate force, so that if at
some future point our public priorities change or external
circumstances force us to change them, we will have the capability
within our armed forces to expand again and regenerate that
capability<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T12:24:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

be made redundant in a pinch-point trade; these redundancies are
happening only in areas where we are carrying surpluses. As a result of
restructuring, a change in the way we deliver the service means that
the posts of 16 RAF dental officers, nine RAF dental nurses and five
RAF dental technicians are no longer required. She is right to raise
the issue of retraining, and I recall that she raised it in respect of
previous tranches of redundancy. We have put in a lot of effort in this
tranche to make sure that we put even more emphasis behind the
opportunities for retraining. Where people have the skills and the
willingness to retrain, they will be fully supported through the chain
of command to retrain and redeploy within the armed forces. We have no
wish or ability to lose talent and skills that we have, so long as we
can deploy them in a way that is usable within the new structure that

that we are making people redundant in certain areas does not always
mean that we will not be continuing to recruit in those areas. The
armed forces are bottom-fed organisations, and we have to get the
correct rank structure within each of the specialisms. My hon. Friend

redundancies will be 10, all of which will be in the medical and dental

importantly, we have put in place mechanisms to ensure that projects do
not get signed off willy-nilly by politicians 
<?notus-xml column=475?>when the resources are not in place to pay for them. That ensures that
we have a coherent defence budget and that we never again find

was that important? If it could be shown that the activities of the
pickets were deliberately planned to intimidate, the charges laid

Wales was a part of the world where the McAlpine family had a huge
amount of political influence. They were not only influential players
in the Tory party but one of the biggest developers in the
building industry, including at the site in Brookside in
Shrewsbury that was the epicentre of the case against the pickets.

the police investigation gained momentum, 31 pickets were
arrested on 14 November—two months after the end of the dispute.
The men were released without charge, but three months later, on
Valentine’s day 1974, 24 of them were rearrested. A barrage of
charges— 242 in total—were levelled at these men,
all of whom were charged with intimidation. Much more seriously, the
first six to go on trial were charged with conspiracy to intimidate
contrary to common law. This was the charge that the employers’
body wanted to see, because it gave the establishment the chance to
send pickets to jail for long periods. The intent was clear—lock
these people up and the rest of the trade union movement will know that
legitimate trade union activity, including picketing, could now be
treated as a criminal act.</hs_Para>

how did these workers become embroiled in this legal minefield? On 31
August, a joint meeting of members of the Union of Construction, Allied
Trades and Technicians and the Transport and General Workers Union was
held in the Ball and Stirrup pub in Chester. At the meeting, which was
the first time many of those present had met each other, a request was
read out from union members in the Shropshire area seeking support from
other comrades throughout the north-west to successfully prosecute
their case in their area. The meeting agreed that a group of pickets
would travel down to Oswestry on 6 September to meet local activists
and then decide which locations to picket.</hs_Para>

meeting is crucial to the issue. Anyone who has ever been involved in
picketing—looking round this room, I see a number of people who
have been—knows that, especially when you are going outside your
own area, you have to plan properly—basic stuff including where
people are going to be picked up, when they can expect to get home, and
where they are likely to be throughout the day. You also need to ensure
that anybody going picketing is aware of the need to behave properly at
all times and give them clear information in case there are problems.
The meeting was simply a planning meeting, but crucially, when the case
went to court, it was classed as a meeting to conspire to intimidate
workers on the ground. No evidence was ever laid to substantiate that
claim, but it was the crux of the case and it was what led to
imprisonment.</hs_Para>

prosecution were so intent on getting jail sentences imposed that they
even charged a person with conspiracy who was not present at the
planning meeting. John McKinsie Jones had been collecting union subs in
the downstairs bar of the pub, and he left before the planning meeting
even began. He was nowhere near the meeting, yet amazingly he ended up
being sentenced to nine months in jail for conspiracy to intimidate.
How on earth can someone be part of a conspiracy when they are not even
at the meeting where it is
discussed<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T12:53:07"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012382000096" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/debtext/140123-0002.htm#14012382000096">It
is interesting to compare what happened to the pickets who were charged
with 242 offences between them and those at other courts who had been
involved in similar activities. Earlier in the year, two trials were
held in Mold. At the first trial, only minor charges were upheld by the
jury and the maximum fine was £50. At the second trial, the jury
found all defendants not guilty of anything. One of the main reasons
for this was that in Mold, prior to the jury being selected, the
lawyers for the defendants exercised their long-held right to challenge
potential jurors. As was the right of the defence laywers, they were
looking for people who might have connections with the building
industry or might be hostile to trade unions. As a result of the
cross-examination, a number of prospective jurors were excluded from
the jury.</hs_Para>

forgive my scepticism—after those trials, but before the
Shrewsbury ones began, the Lord Chancellor, Lord Hailsham, another part
of the Tory hierarchy, unilaterally banished the right of lawyers to
challenge jurors. This was done without warning and contrary to decades
of practice, and without any prior consultation with the legal system
or other interested parties.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T12:54:25"></hs_TimeCode> order to try
to get a fair trial despite these clearly deliberately motivated
changes to the legal process, the defendants’ lawyers requested
that the trial of those charged in relation to picketing in Shrewsbury
be held in Mold or be moved to an area of the country that was 
<?notus-xml column=483?>more neutral than Shrewsbury would have been. The judge flatly turned
down that request and set 3 October 1973 as the date for the first
hearing.</hs_Para>

high-profile, politically charged case. He had little, if any,
experience in cases of this magnitude, or in criminal cases at all; his
expertise was mainly in rural and ecclesiastical matters. His behaviour
throughout the case led many to question his capability and
impartiality. A number of issues gave rise to this concern. For
example, when the jury were called to bring in the verdict, they were
unable to come to a majority decision—they were tied at eight to
four. The judge asked them to keep going but they said,
“We’re too tired to go on today—we need to have a
break.” So he agreed to give them a break and let them stop in a
hotel overnight, but he closed by
saying:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="14012382000099" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/debtext/140123-0002.htm#14012382000099">“You

the fact that I regularly adjudicate criminal trials myself I have no
hesitation in saying that, during the trial, the Judge’s conduct
towards the defence frequently crossed the line between permissible and

Platt-Mills who represented Des Warren and to Des Warren himself. I
vividly recall an occasion when Mr Platt-Mills was cross-examining a
witness (probably a police officer) and the Judge took off his wig and
threw it on the bench in irritation. I recall occasions when he threw
his pen down and turned to face the wall when either a defendant was
giving evidence or the defence were adducing evidence in

my party was, quite rightly, lectured by then Opposition Members about
the failure of Tony Blair to listen to the Attorney-General in relation
to the Iraq war. In this instance, the same authority advised the Home
Secretary not to pursue the case. The Home Secretary ignored him, and
we have to ask why. The people who went to jail are clear about the
reason. They have no doubt that that the pressure from the building
industry, particularly from a man who would soon be appointed as deputy
treasurer and chief fundraiser to the Tory party, was overwhelmingly
more important than the views of the people entrusted with advising on
legal issues at the highest level.</hs_Para>

level, with the result that in the autumn of 1972 they set up a huge

despite the fact that on the day in question—6 September
1972—not only were no arrests made, but the police actually
congratulated the leaders of the pickets on the disciplined way in
which they conducted their activities. We must also remember that this

issue of grave concern was the decision during the trial to allow an

referred to the ongoing trial. The day after it was aired, Judge Mais
dismissed the defence’s attempts to have the TV company charged
with contempt. Indeed, he criticised the defence for having the

Friend the Member for Blaydon has suggested, the exploitation of
workers and the unacceptable and unsafe working conditions in which
workers were forced to operate were the bedrock of the first ever
national building workers’ strike in 1972. As a result of that
national strike, which was settled on 16 September 1972, the building
workers succeeded in achieving an across-the-board increase for all
trades working in the construction industry. There was, however,
enormous political anxiety as a result of that victory, fuelled by a
targeted lobbying campaign by the National Federation of Building
Trades Employers. Shrewsbury 24 campaigners firmly believe that the end
of the strike was in fact the beginning of the employers’
campaign to have pickets prosecuted, and to use that as a deterrent
should they ever have the temerity to take further industrial
action.</hs_Para>

September 1972, a letter was sent to all NFBTE regional secretaries
around the country from its head office in London. It was headed
“Imitation Dossier”. The dossier was presented to the
Home Secretary, Robert Carr, who had previously been Secretary of State
for Employment and overseen the introduction of the contentious
Industrial Relations Act 1971. Out of 85 instances of alleged
intimidation and violence detailed in the dossier, only six related to
north Wales. Despite the undeniable fact that most incidents occurred
elsewhere, the Home Secretary instructed the chief constables of West
Mercia and Gwynedd police forces to carry out an inquiry into picketing
in north Wales during the strike. Let us not forget that, as was said
earlier, none of the pickets was cautioned or arrested on the day, the
unions did not receive any complaints from the police about the conduct
of the pickets, and photographic evidence shows that the police were
present and mingling freely with strikers. Some police had their hands
in their pockets—hardly intimidation.</hs_Para>

that of the 900 statements taken, 600 were disregarded by
the authorities, presumably because they failed to corroborate what the
police hoped they would say. On 11 October 1972, Robert Carr told this
House that in his opinion there was no deficiency in the law as it
stood, and the problem lay with enforcement. In other words, he was
pressuring the police who he believed had failed to do their job
properly. A few days later, the then Attorney-General, Sir Peter
Rawlinson QC, gave a speech to the Tory 1922 committee in which he used
strikingly similar language. Following that, we know that of the 200 or
so pickets identified, just 24 were carefully selected for a
political show trial at Shrewsbury Crown court, and charged with the
offence of intimidation under section 7 of the Conspiracy and
Protection of Property Act 1875.</hs_Para>

I reiterate the point made by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T13:43:38"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Aldershot: we have to ask why, over a long
period—the Labour party was in office for three
terms—former Labour Lord Chancellors decided not to release this
information. That is a perfectly legitimate question to ask. If
Opposition Members feel passionately about this issue—I clearly
see that they do—they should challenge and scrutinise their
colleagues to ask why the Labour Government did not release
it.</hs_Para>

am very interested to hear from the Minister whether he will release
the documents and, if not, why he is not prepared to release them. I
have been approached by constituents who have a different perspective.
They feel that they do not want documents to be withheld from the
public domain if there is the potential for a cover-up of some kind, or
some form of inappropriate behaviour. As a community, I think the
argument is evenly balanced in Shrewsbury. There are people who want to
remember the violence. We are a wonderful but quiet Salopian town. This
was an extraordinary event in our history and they want people to
remember the violence they experienced. They also want the Government
to account for why they will not release the

building sites. It is about an industrial campaign to ensure that those
working conditions changed. It is about a trial that led to the results
that my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T13:46:51"></hs_TimeCode> hon.

was here in the 1970s, and I could not believe it the moment I got to
London: we were on picket lines, and winning—winning! It does
not happen very often, so we have to treasure every moment. My father
worked for 50 years in the pits, and when we won the 1972 strike, he
said, “It’s the first time in my life.” Yet there
is all this talk, some how or other, about workers having power. It is
not true, and this is another example where they do not have it, or
otherwise the papers would have been released and, what’s more,
this whole episode would not have begun. It began because of the
climate of 1970 onwards. The establishment, the Heath Government, were
defeated by the miners in 1972, after a seven-week strike. It is true
there was a bit of pushing and shoving, but by and large it was a
relatively peaceful affair. The police were wearing long stockings
underneath their trousers. I told Tom Swain, and he said,
“I’m getting a pair.” That’s what it was
like, by and large.</hs_Para>

happened then? The Upper Clyde shipbuilders had a sit-in and won. Then
there was Vic Turner and Bernie Steer saying, “We’re
going to put some pickets on down at the docks”—at what
is now Covent Garden—and they got put in Pentonville jail. The
Industrial Relations Act had just got Royal Assent, but what happened?
After Vic Turner was put in jail with his mates, the Official Solicitor
had to turn up, representing all the echelons of the establishment,
saying, “They won’t purge their own contempt.
We’ve got to do it for them.” We said, “Yes, but
at a price”, and so they had to kick the Act into the long
grass.</hs_Para>

the middle of all this, some people, such as those I should not speak

never had great wages, but UCATT and the building workers had had a lot
of injuries, so they decided in that climate to take a chance and fight
for better wages and conditions. That is all it was. The evidence was
there, as we have heard, but the establishment decided that somebody
needed a lesson: “We’ll take these on. We lost to the
miners. We lost to Upper Clyde. We lost the Industrial Relations Act.
We’ve got to have a victory.” That was what this was all
about, and let no one kid themselves: when the echelons of the state
decide to take action, the judiciary join them, and I do not care what

of building sites over the last four decades. The trade unions can
certainly take credit for that, as can anyone involved in health and
safety and, indeed, employers. When the London Olympic stadium was

happening at other major sporting venues around the world. Let us

reflect on the Shrewsbury 24 issue, the conditions that existed in the
building industry in the 1970s were a blight on our society. Sites with
hundreds of thousands of men were given two rat-infested, filthy
toilets. There was nowhere to change, so if workers got soaked in the
rain, they would either have to go home and lose their pay, or continue
to work—sodden and freezing. The health and safety conditions
were appalling. In 1973 alone, there were 231 fatal accidents in
construction. When talking about this issue, I am reminded of why these
people were victimised—it was because they were raising serious
health and safety concerns to ensure that workers were safe in the
workplace. That is why the then employers turned against the trade
unions—to make sure that health and safety issues were not
raised at the appropriate time. The employers’ agenda was not
about looking after their workers.</hs_Para>

look at their supply chains and improve their human rights
records<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T14:04:29"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Shrewsbury 24 were picketing in conditions that we would be horrified
at today, so the calm and dignified protest they led is to be
commended. It was a difficult task—something that has not been
repeated—trying to organise building workers who often moved to
new temporary sites and it was a struggle to organise them on account
of that. The Shrewsbury 24 wanted to highlight the issues caused by
colleagues “on the lump”, but they did not get violent
and did nothing illegal. At this stage, I am reminded of what the
Scottish Affairs Select Committee is doing on the issue of
blacklisting. Only yesterday I listened to some of the evidence that 
<?notus-xml column=502?>the trade unions gave to that Select Committee. Even today, trade union
organisers are refused access to building sites, simply because they
want to raise health and safety issues that the employer does not want
to listen to. Ordinary trade unions are still struggling to get
recognition.</hs_Para>

Shrewsbury 24 hired six coaches and picketed large sites around
Shrewsbury, which were chosen because they were not as well organised
as some places in the bigger cities. It was peaceful—there were
no cautions and no arrests. They had the permission of site owners.
Chief Superintendent Meredith even shook the hand of Des Warren and
thanked him for the co-operation of the UCATT and the then Transport
and General Workers Union.</hs_Para>

reason, when 24 men were arrested on conspiracy charges months later,
they were shocked and confused. Six were sent to jail, and over four
decades later, the pickets still deny that they were guilty of any of
the charges levelled against them. The sentences had a devastating
impact on these men. While in prison, Des Warren was regularly forced
to drink “liquid cosh”, which has been blamed for his
death from Parkinson’s disease in 2004. These men struggled to
get work afterwards.</hs_Para>

Tom Watson</B> (West Bromwich East) (Lab):</Member> What lies behind
this motion is a belief by many that there has been an abuse of state
power and a subversion of the legal process. Successive Governments
have said repeatedly that there are just a handful of files relating to
the Shrewsbury trials. I would like to focus today on just one single
file—PREM 15/2011, with which I hope the Minister can acquaint
himself. It is described as “Woodrow Wyatt’s TV
programme, ‘Red Under the Bed’”. On 27
August 2012, the National Archives website said that this file was
“retained” by the Cabinet Office under section 3(4) of
the Public Records Act 1958. Why would such a file be kept back when it
relates to a current affairs programme that was broadcast on ITV in
November 1973<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T14:07:39"></hs_TimeCode>?
Following a freedom of information request by the Shrewsbury 24
campaign’s incisive researcher in August 2013, the Cabinet
Office finally conceded and released some of the papers.</hs_Para>

is this file relevant? It is relevant because the film was broadcast on
13 November 1973, the day on which the prosecution completed its case
against the pickets. It was featured in the TV listing section of the
local evening newspaper, the <I>Shropshire Star</I>, which would have
been read by many of the jurors. The film included a highly tendentious
commentary by Woodrow Wyatt, interspersed with footage that showed the
following: two of the six defendants, John Carpenter and Des Warren;
Shrewsbury Crown Court, surrounded by police officers, with a group of
demonstrators attending a meeting nearby; images of a march through
Shrewsbury in which the defendants could be made out; violence and
damage alleged to have been caused by pickets on building sites during
the national building strike of 1972; and violence and damage alleged
to have been caused by pickets during a recent coal strike and a recent
dock strike.</hs_Para>

next day, the defence applied to the judge for the television company
to be held in contempt. The judge viewed the film and dismissed the
application, even criticising the defence for raising the point. The
file shows that the film, which lasted for one hour, was followed by a
studio discussion of 30 minutes. Interestingly, the discussion was not
broadcast in every ITV region—Granada, for example—but it
was transmitted by ATV, the region covering Shrewsbury. The final words
of that discussion were from the then Conservative MP Geoffrey
Stewart-Smith. He was asked by the studio chairman, the late Richard

against this for years deserve it, but there is a bigger cause, too:
the rest of us. This is about defining freedom in this country. That is
what this debate is about, and why this Liberal Minister has to
act.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-23?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_23_PT_1/CC4FBE8A4CB9441BE301723D6420739EFE1CCE54" __version__="1.8"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="23 January 2014">Thursday

Shrewsbury 24 debacle represents a catastrophic and deliberate
miscarriage of justice by the state against working individuals. I say
again for the record that this was deliberate. This attack on the
Shrewsbury 24 was a deliberate, calculated miscarriage of justice. It
is a catalogue of deceit, deception, secrecy and discrimination worthy
of the best of the best North Korean governmental political plots. It
truly is a must-read true-life story of thriller proportions. The
covert, politically inspired interference of faceless decision-makers,
be they politicians, civil servants, police or the judiciary, made life
hell for ordinary hard-working people whose only crime was to dare to
take industrial action against the mega cash-rich building companies of
that time.</hs_Para>

£30 for 30 hours and better health and safety on the building
sites, where, as has been mentioned on more than one occasion, 571
people in the construction industry were killed in three years. Is that
not fair? Is that not what we should be seeking in a modern-day
society—health and safety, preventing people from being abused
and killed when they take their sandwiches to work and want to return
to see their families at night? Is that a crime? Should they have been
punished—should they been imprisoned, as the six Shrewsbury
pickets were? The answer to that is of course

have tremendous experience of picketing, and I am proud of having been
a picket during many disputes. I witnessed what happened on the picket

have seen in the last two or three weeks is again a Government refusing
to allow papers—confidential and secret papers—relating
to that dispute to be released. What we have seen is absolutely
ludicrous. There has not been the outrage there should be, but we have
seen that senior Cabinet Ministers in a previous Government 
<?notus-xml column=507?>and a Prime Minister—Thatcher—stood at the Dispatch Box
and deliberately misled the Commons, and deliberately misled the
Government. Where is the public outcry from the press? There is not

lot can be said about this but I would like to finish on this point. We
cannot even begin to understand how these men and their families felt
when they were hammered by the state—by the Government. They
were offered lesser charges and they would have been freed. They stood
by their principles so that people in the future would benefit, and
they went to prison. We cannot begin to think what it was like for
these people, who could have been free—“£50 fine
and you can go home tonight and be home by 3 o’clock.”
That was the agreement, but they stood by their principles. We cannot
begin to imagine how they suffered in their time in prison.</hs_Para>

construction, the lack of a structured, organised business caused
industrial carnage as many colleagues have mentioned, with nearly 600
dead on building sites in three years. The lump set worker against
worker and kept the industry in the dark ages. They were dark times,
indeed, not only for the country but for individuals thrust into the
front-line—the Five, the 24 and others. The ’70s was a
decade of massive industrial unrest; I am old enough to have been on
strike in the ’70s with the fire service—against a Labour
Government. It is surely time for the Government to come clean. The
Government should publish the papers—I am looking forward to

Government’s determination to keep documents secret and to keep
information from the appellants casts a very dark and long shadow over

interfere with the criminal justice system. It can hardly be more
serious.</hs_Para>

worse it will get. It is a travesty that men have already gone to their
graves without this matter having been resolved. The
campaigners’ case is simple: they were wholly innocent of the
charges made against them. The dispute had come to an end, and no
complaint had been made about their conduct at the time. The subsequent
investigations many months later, the prosecution and then the
sentences imposed upon them were draconian, wholly inappropriate and,
worst of all, politically motivated. I want to spend some time talking

so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012382000300" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/debtext/140123-0003.htm#14012382000300">At

politicised debate. It touches on the desirability and necessity of
workers organising themselves in the workplace to ensure that they are
treated well and have decent health and safety and terms and
conditions. It has been clear from the speeches that there are
different views about that on either side of the

have been correct to try to explain the context of the industrial
dispute. My family were some of those involved in the dispute. My
grandfather, Barney Davies, who is still alive, and Larry McKay, my
uncle, were members of the Transport and General Workers Union and
worked in the construction industry all their lives. They were clear
with me why they thought it was important to have strong trade unions
in the construction industry, in particular for health and safety.
Indeed, they supported the closed shop, because they felt it was the
only way that progress would be made in the construction
industry<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T14:36:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012382000314" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/debtext/140123-0003.htm#14012382000314">It
is necessary to say clearly that this type of organisation and the 1972
strike were seen as a significant threat to those who owned the
construction industry and made huge profits from it. The more we find
out about the Shrewsbury 24, the more murky it gets. The motion today
is simple: it calls for the release of the documents. It will be
interesting to see how
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T14:36:50"></hs_TimeCode> Minister
responds to that request. It is difficult to see after 40 years how
they can contain anything that seriously threatens national security.
If we are not successful now in getting the documents, the issue will
not be looked at again until 50 years after the dispute. Some
of the people directly involved have already died, one of them probably
as a direct result of drug-induced Parkinson’s and the treatment
that he received against his wishes in prison. I would ask the Minister
to look at this seriously. If he believes in freedom of information and
transparency, he should please take action to release the
papers.</hs_Para>

dismissal and blacklisting were commonplace for anyone who complained

Government and employers, trade unions across the sector organised the
biggest national strike since 1926. They were calling for fair terms

conduct of the trials, the use of conspiracy charges, the sentences

The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T14:44:21"></hs_TimeCode> use of
section 23 of the Freedom of Information Act to withhold selective

silence the voluntary sector and the trade union movement under the

one other matter is very important. There is currently a legal

Miscarriages of justice are not matters for the Government to consider;
they are matters for the Criminal Cases Review

The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T14:57:28"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Blaydon set out the arguments for a miscarriage of justice review,
and I understand them. The cases of at least some of the Shrewsbury 24
have been referred to the Criminal Cases Review Commission and it is
currently assessing that set of applications. It has the power to
require, when it is reasonable, that any information held by any public
body in relation to any case under review can be retained for, and
produced to, it, irrespective of confidentiality. The Commission
therefore has, potentially, the access to information of the highest
sensitivity, including material withheld by the Cabinet
Office—the Commission has the power to see that. My
understanding is that the Commission has asked for this information. It
is currently considering the application for a review, with this
information before it. If the Commission sends a case to the courts,
the courts have the power to see the information, and I would entirely
expect them to be able to do so.</hs_Para>

was the holocaust and why does it matter to me? I was born just 10
years after the end of the second world war and brought up in north
Manchester, one of the main centres of the Jewish community outside
London. Jewish boys and girls were a key part of our Bury grammar
school community and I was aware of them from my earliest days at five
years old. As friends, we played and grew up together, and I picked up

September 1935, the Nuremberg laws banned intermarriage and sexual
relations between Jews and Aryans and stripped Jews of their

then the war. Shortly after Germany invaded Poland in September 1939,
Nazis began to force Jews under their control to move into ghettos.
This short-term measure soon developed into a long-term policy. The
first ghetto in Poland was set up in October 1939. The Nazis
established more than 1,000 ghettos in Poland and the Soviet Union
alone. Living conditions were abysmal. Often several families lived
where before there had been one. Jews were not allowed to leave or have
any contact with the outside world. Food rations were at starvation
level and disease was rife through lack of clean water and sanitation.
Hundreds of thousands of people died in the ghettos. In the wake of the
Warsaw ghetto revolt in April 1943, the Nazis decided to liquidate the
remaining large ghettos. Eventually, those who lived in the ghettos

of our common humanity. However, we should still choose our words and
descriptions with care so as never to minimise the scale of what the

holocaust has always baffled me. If we are going to give away our age,
I was born 20 years after those events. I have never understood how
human beings in their millions could be so seduced by a message of hate
that they could stand by and watch as other human beings were degraded,
humiliated and murdered; how people could have stayed at the entrance
to the gas chambers in Auschwitz, stripping people of their belongings
and their last remnants of dignity, knowing that the fate that lay in

death.</hs_Para>

Burns titled, “Man Was Made to Mourn”. As
poignant as those words are, I still do not think they convey the
horrors that took place over 70 years ago. Probably like everybody else
in the House, I have read the books and watched the documentaries. I
have watched “Schindler’s List”, “Band of
Brothers”, in which the 101st Airborne Division liberated a
sub-camp of Dachau concentration camp, and “The World at

however, fail to equal the insight offered to me by a survivor, Harry

had the privilege of meeting Harry in 2012. The Holocaust Educational
Trust suggested that I might like to encourage my local authority to
have a survivor meet and talk to older pupils from high schools in my
area. Harry was born in 1925 and lived in Vienna with his mother and
father and his sister, Gertie. His father owned a men’s clothing
shop and, for that time and place, his family were relatively well-off.
The young Harry remembered having family holidays. He enjoyed swimming
and ice-skating, and his mother and father were well-off enough to be
able to give him a season ticket membership to an ice-skating rink. He
remembered hanging out of a window in Vienna watching the Germans march
in, in 1938. He remembered liking the soldiers marching and the bright
flags, but little did he know as a child that they were Nazi soldiers
and that those bright flags were swastikas.</hs_Para>

membership of the ice-skating rink was revoked just days later, when a
“No Jews Allowed” sign was erected. In November 1938,
Harry’s father’s business was destroyed during
Kristallnacht. He was arrested soon after. After he was released from
prison, the family intended to flee to Shanghai, but his dad was robbed
on his way to purchase the tickets. Thinking, as any mother and father
would, of the safety of their children, Harry’s parents arranged
for him and his sister to flee on a Kindertransport to the United
Kingdom.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski) mentioned
such people from Poland—who did so much to protect Jewish
people. She was honoured in 1965 by the state of Israel as
“Righteous among the nations”. During world war two,
Irena served as a plumber working in the Warsaw ghetto. She smuggled
Jewish babies out of the ghetto in the bottom of her toolbox. At the
back of a truck, she kept a dog she had trained to bark to cover the
noise of the infants when Nazi soldiers approached. The Nazis
eventually caught her, sentenced her to death and broke both her arms
and legs, but she managed to evade execution and survived the war. She
kept details of all the children she saved in a glass jar she buried in
her back garden, and she tried to locate their parents after the war,
but sadly most had perished in the gas chambers. I wonder if I would
have been brave enough to do something like that.</hs_Para>

want to finish on a positive note. I have been very lucky in my life. I
have visited both the Holocaust museum in Washington DC and Yad Vashem.
These museums are grim, and going through their exhibits can be an
emotionally draining experience. At the end of the museum in
Washington, the visitor passes down long corridors, either side of
which are huge glass containers filled with the spectacles, shoes,
luggage and possessions of the Holocaust victims—a haunting end
to an experience that you can never forget—but at the very end
is a video loop in which a woman explains her personal story of
liberation. When she was emaciated, dehydrated and thought she was near
the end of her life, 
<?notus-xml column=528?>she was picked up by a soldier. She told the soldier
that he could not touch her because she was Jewish, and he replied,
fighting back the tears, “I’m Jewish too.” The
gentleman was a GI. After the war, they married and they settled in the
United States of America—a triumph of the human spirit over evil
and another reason we should all observe Holocaust memorial
day.</hs_Para>

things, such as the very normality of life around Auschwitz that
carries on today, and the extraordinary bewilderment at how a herd of
human beings could have persuaded themselves not to stop this happening
at the time. It was difficult to manage the sense of disbelief, horror
and outrage as we went through this vicarious
experience<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T15:46:38"></hs_TimeCode>. When
we returned on the 
<?notus-xml column=529?>plane, there was a not a shocked silence—more a sense
of relief from a discussion of shared experiences.
We gained a nearer—never a perfect, but a
nearer—understanding of what had taken place there.</hs_Para>

those who have the privilege of living in the UK, one particularly
telling item was a map on the walls of Auschwitz, showing the railway
lines along which all the people had been transported from around
Europe. Huge distances—from Norway or Hungary, for
example—were involved, but there was no line through the UK. We
were not invaded by the Nazis, and were not subject to these appalling
transportations, so all the more for us learn from the experience. We
all carried with us the shocking images and the sense of outrage, and
we recalled the point on the tracks where the trucks were parted, the
dolls’ clothing, the names on the suitcases, the sheer
industrial scale of Birkenau, and the candle lighting ceremony at the
end. These experiences created a deep impression and will be for ever
remembered. <hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T15:47:59"></hs_TimeCode>I

encouraged to be part of communicating the message and sharing it with
their peers. It was a harrowing and tough day for all of us and the
horror of what saw and the reactions and emotions we experienced will
stay with us for the rest of our lives. One cannot overstate the
importance of visiting Auschwitz-Birkenau or of recognising the full
extent of the ghastly industrialised nature of the holocaust. These

Friend the Member for North East Bedfordshire said about focusing on
positive things, but let us be absolutely clear that there should be no
no-go areas for this type of behaviour. We must not allow the excuse of
“What happens on the terraces stays on the terraces”. In
this instance, with anti-Semitic behaviour, holocaust denial or teasing
chants, the police must enforce the laws of the land. If we allow a
chink in this armour, we start to excuse something that is historically
inexcusable. We have the witnesses of young minds on the football
terraces; they must not be given the chance to think anything other
than that the holocaust was one of the most horrific experiences in
history. A visit to Auschwitz with the Holocaust Educational Trust is
the ultimate antidote to any such tendencies. I commend the
trust’s work and the public support that it receives, and I

first Holocaust memorial day was held here in the United Kingdom in
2001, as a result of a cross-party decision by Parliament following a
private Member’s Bill presented by Andrew Dismore. At that time,
there were doubters who were not sure that it was appropriate to have a
Holocaust memorial day focusing on the holocaust itself. Now that date
is firmly in the national calendar, and I think that very few people
would question the correctness of our
decision<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T15:51:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012382000558" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/debtext/140123-0003.htm#14012382000558">It
is absolutely essential for new generations to receive education about
the brutality, the depravity, and the racial hatred involved in the
organisation of the calculated mass murder of 6 million people. That
lesson needs to be learnt so that people not only know about the unique
horror of the holocaust, but understand where hatred and bigotry can
lead, because that affects all of our society and all the people in it.
The Holocaust Educational Trust’s “lessons from
Auschwitz” programme enables generations of young people and
their teachers to visit Auschwitz, as part of a wider educational
programme to provide a greater understanding of the holocaust and its
impact for
everyone<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T15:52:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012382000559" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/debtext/140123-0003.htm#14012382000559">This
week I attended the trust’s annual Merlyn Rees memorial lecture,
which was given by Thomas Harding. He spoke of the search for Rudolf
Höss, the Kommandant of Auschwitz. That served as a reminder of
the need to bring war criminals to account, and also as a reminder of
the nature of evil. Rudolf Höss led an apparently normal family
life, with a loving wife and loving children, in the midst of the
horrors and the butchery of Auschwitz. Perhaps we should reflect on the
nature of evil, and on what people can
do<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T15:53:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012382000560" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/debtext/140123-0003.htm#14012382000560">Also
this week, the Football Association decided to charge Anelka following
his celebration of having scored a goal by making an “inverted
Nazi symbol” salute, the “quenelle” . What I found
even more disturbing than what Anelka did was his defence, which was
that he had acted in support of his friend Dieudonné
M’bala M’bala, who is a French performer, a holocaust
denier, an anti-Semite, and someone whose offences include inviting the
holocaust denier Robert Faurisson on stage as part of his performances.
The people who support this performer claim that they do so because
they are anti-establishment, and that they are not anti-Semitic, but it
does not take very much imagination to appreciate what that defence
actually means. It gives us food for thought, because it is deeply and
gravely
disturbing<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T15:54:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012382000561" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/debtext/140123-0003.htm#14012382000561">Sadly,
anti-Semitism has not gone away, even following the horrors of the
holocaust. A very recent European survey made disturbing findings in
that regard. There is also anti-Semitic discourse: not explicit
anti-Semitism, but reference in writing, speech and films to images and
words which invoke feelings of anti-Semitism. The Community Security
Trust has listed incidents of anti-Semitic discourse in its recent
report and they are extremely disturbing. They are disturbing because
they are wide-ranging and cut right across the political spectrum. They
range from the bizarre, such as the reference in Press TV, speaking for
Iran, which claimed that the Olympics were a Zionist plot and blamed
Jews in Hollywood and the so-called Jewish-controlled media as
ultimately responsible for the United States school shootings and
massacres of children, to those I find more disturbing, 
<?notus-xml column=531?>such as the Occupy Wall street cartoon from Tampa in
the USA which was displayed on Facebook and which showed a big-nosed
bearded Jew using the UN logo as a steering wheel in a car with
President Obama as the gearstick.</hs_Para>

said:</hs_Para>

find that kind of insinuation that morally Judaism is inferior to, in
his case, Christianity not just plain wrong but deeply disturbing. That
kind of insinuation, which I hear too often, should be recognised.

that we have Holocaust memorial day firmly in the national calendar, I

because being caught while fighting in the second world war with a
Jewish surname was the difference between going to a prisoner of war
camp and a concentration camp. We kept the name after the second world

Singer had fled to Krakow with forged Aryan papers and hidden there
before being betrayed, arrested and tortured for his money. He was then
dragged to his death along a country road, chained behind a horse and
cart. Three thousand Jews lived in Nowy Targ before the war. I asked

us think of Britain in the 1930s. The rest of Europe was succumbing to

one country was fighting not just for Britain’s freedom but for
the world’s liberty. Britain did not just win the war; we won
the right for people around the world to live in freedom. For me, that
period defines our country. It is what makes Britain the greatest
country in the world, with a special claim to the values of democracy,
freedom, fairness and tolerance. Because of who we are as a people and
what we are as a country, the British people came together and stood up
to the Nazis and fought fascism. We are a country that does not walk
away or turn a blind eye. On each occasion when people have been gassed
and chemical weapons have been used against people, we have known whose
side we were on and we have always in the past stood up for the

day. As other Members have mentioned, we cannot forget what happened or
let it go because, if we did, we would demean the memory of many people

hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham (Bob Stewart) made a strong point
about when he was serving in Bosnia and the reality of genocide there.
That demonstrates poignantly, powerfully and horribly what life and
death really mean in such situations, and it reminds us all of what is
happening in the Congo and Syria and of the rise of profound political
and religious extremism, which has got worse over the past few years.
We all have views about why that has happened, but it is undeniably
continuing to get
worse<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T16:12:52"></hs_TimeCode>. A number

Feelings, ignorance, fear and anger are the same today as they were

we have computers and a few other things and we drive very fast in
cars, which we could not do 500 years ago, but humanity does not
change. However, a positive aspect of humanity is a continuous
determination to get better, to improve and to be kind and generous.
Alongside all the horror that the Holocaust Educational Trust helps us
to understand as parliamentarians, and Holocaust memorial day helps us
to remember and commemorate those who died, there is the other side of
human nature. That is also part of this
remembrance<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T16:14:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012382000593" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/debtext/140123-0003.htm#14012382000593">I
shall give colleagues an example. There is a country at the moment that
does not get a busting lot of good media coverage in the <I>Daily Mail
</I>and the rest called Bulgaria. Perhaps all hon. Members
know—I did not know until a few months ago—that, although
Bulgaria is smack in the middle of the Balkans and central Europe and
has had a history of virulent anti-Semitism for hundreds of years, the
Bulgarian people would not accept what the Nazis wanted, so 50,000 Jews
survived in Bulgaria. Is that not fascinating? That is the flip side of
this horror of the holocaust; so many good things were done. As another
colleague said, we should not forget the individual families in Poland
and other parts of Europe who saved Jewish families, at enormous cost
to themselves. I was determined to mention the 50,000 Jews saved in
Bulgaria in the Chamber today, because whenever I read certain papers
at the minute I find that poor old Bulgaria does not get a lot of good
coverage. So I pay tribute to that nation, in my small way as a 
<?notus-xml column=536?>Member of Parliament within Westminster, for what its people did. A lot
of the Bulgarian Government wanted to go along with the Nazis and pack
all 50,000 Jews off, but the Orthodox Church in Bulgaria and the people
there just would not have

where are we at? Human nature is never going to act in a way
that means these things will never happen again—we all know
that. The reason for this commemorative day and the reason it is so
important that the mother of Parliaments keeps having this debate year
after year, even though it is 40, 50, 60, 70 years since these
tragedies took place, is that it is a small way of holding the mirror
up to man’s bestiality. That small attempt, that bit about
knowledge and that emphasis on trying to ensure that the memory never
disappears goes some way in helping us to challenge bigotry, of
whatever type. Wickedness is not specific to any particular character
or race; it covers humanity generally. So I am proud and privileged
every year when I take part in these debates, even though I am not

approach. Initially, it was, “Let’s try and shoot the
Jews.” Well, that was not fast enough. Then it was,
“Let’s look at portable gas chambers”, but that
was not efficient enough. Then they looked at how to dispose of the

comprehensible? We must all understand that we, as part of the
international community, stood back and watched it happen.</hs_Para>

The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T16:26:31"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Dudley North (Ian Austin) made a point that was particularly
interesting and relevant to me when he spoke about how this country
stood out against Nazism. My late father, who was brought up in London
in the 1930s, remembered very well that on Sunday mornings the
blackshirts marched in their hundreds up and down the streets of this
country shouting, “The Yids, the Yids, we’ve got to get
rid of the Yids.” That is hard for us to believe in our society,
despite the mention today of the CST and some unforgiveable
anti-Semitic incidents. When I compare that with people watching
hundreds of people marching in jackboots in our own country shouting
such things about Jewish people, I believe that we have
progressed tremendously.</hs_Para>

father, on being conscripted into the Army in this country as a normal
18-year-old boy, was beaten up by the non-Jewish members of his
platoon, who said, “You Jews are to blame for this war.”
That was a feeling then and the little remnants of that feeling come
out in what those people from Hungary say and what people—very
few people, but some—say elsewhere, albeit quietly now because
of the protection of the law. That feeling is still there.</hs_Para>

in the holocaust. A young lady—a Muslim—told me that the
speaker, a 90-year-old lady, was the only Jewish person she had ever
met in her life. In certain hon. Members’ constituencies two
miles to the north and east of here, that probably would not be the

the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T16:33:52"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Leeds North East (Fabian Hamilton), who spoke about his meetings
with holocaust survivors—some of whom were members of his

had never left them, not least because of the numbers tattooed on their
arms. My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T16:34:06"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Friend the Member for Beckenham (Bob Stewart) gave an account of what
he had seen in Bosnia in 1992. He concluded by saying that we must
prevent an event such as the holocaust from ever happening again, which
is, of course, one of the reasons for holding this debate and for the
programme of events run by the HET. As
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T16:34:32"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Ilford North (Mr Scott) reminded us, when we read about
the horrors of Bosnia, Cambodia, Darfur and Rwanda, we sometimes wonder
whether we have learned the lessons of the holocaust. When I visited
memorials in Rwanda and spoke to people who wanted to talk about the
genocide, one question I was regularly asked was, “Why did the
international community stand by and let it happen?” We might
ask ourselves whether we are doing enough to bring conflict and
bloodshed to an end across the world

exhibition consists of paintings by artist Anne Berger, who has visited
the Anne Frank house and created a number of images of her life. Using
those images, students from schools across the town will take part in

at some of this place’s wartime debates about the holocaust.
They make it absolutely clear that there was a high level of awareness
of the situation. In a debate on refugees on 19 May 1943, a Home
Office Minister said that since the outbreak of the war, 8
million people in Poland had suffered barbarous punishment or death,
and many others spoke knowingly of the Nazis’ intention to
exterminate the Jewish
people.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012382000631" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/debtext/140123-0004.htm#14012382000631">There
is also a palpable sense in these pages of powerlessness with regard to
tackling the problems, which were known about, and saving lives.

1939 the merchant ship St Louis set sail from Hamburg with 937
German-Jewish refugees on board, seeking asylum from Nazi persecution.
Despite setting off with visas to allow them into Cuba, they were
denied access. They set sail for the US and Canada, where access was
also denied to them. The St Louis returned to Europe, and at that point
the UK agreed to take 288 of the passengers. Others went to Belgium,
France and the Netherlands, but following the German invasion of those
territories, they were again at risk, and historians estimate that 227
of the asylum seekers on that boat subsequently perished in the

makes the holocaust stand out is not only the sheer number of victims,
but the concrete evidence of how the killing was organised and
implemented on such a scale. Of great significance is the fact that
every Jew was defined not by their religion or their own definition,
but by the perpetrators’ definition. Jews were singled out and
registered on a central database—its purpose was to expedite
their murder—before being publicly marked, stripped of their
citizenship, forced to hand over their possessions, dehumanised and,
ultimately,

numbers that should come here or go elsewhere in our empire. I am sure
the Government of the day thought they were acting for the best, but it
simply was not enough. Edmund Burke is attributed with saying that the
only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good
men—and, indeed, women—to do nothing. We said,
“Never again,” and we set up the United Nations to

my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T16:42:01"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Mr Brown) in 2008. In
it, he reflected on a visit to a museum in Rwanda that commemorates the
millions who lost their lives as the world looked the other way. There
is a picture of a young boy called David, a 10-year-old who was
tortured to death. His last words were, “Don’t
worry—the United Nations will come for us”. But, as my
right hon. Friend said, we never did. That child believed the best of
us, only to discover that the pieties repeated so often, over and over,
in reality meant nothing at all. The words “Never again”
became a slogan, rather than what they should be—the crucible in
which all our values sit and are
tested.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012382000636" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/debtext/140123-0004.htm#14012382000636">My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T16:42:55"></hs_TimeCode>
mother, like many of her generation, watched the liberation of the
camps on newsreel footage. She was so profoundly moved by what she saw
that she ensured that I was educated about it, and she gave me a copy
of Anne Frank’s diary when I was about 10 years old. I devoured
that book—trying to imagine myself in Anne Frank’s
shoes—and I gained a tiny insight into the injustice and
inhumanity to which she and her family were subjected. It was a lesson
that I hope I have not forgotten.
Years<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T16:43:25"></hs_TimeCode> later, my
mother and I visited Prague. We went to the ghetto, and saw the walls

and the ones to Anne Frank’s house and to Dachau, affected me. I
have therefore baulked at making the trip referred to by many hon.

year, we mark the centenary of the outbreak of the first world
war—the great war, as it was labelled at the time—and we
should use the tone of this debate, which I commend, to fend off the
revisionism that such occasions sometimes engender. It is widely
believed that the treaty of Versailles created the conditions in which
fascism emerged into the 1930s, and from which the horrors of the
holocaust unfolded. Let us bear that in mind when we assess the events
of 100 years ago and let us apply the lessons to our foreign policy

know so much about the holocaust. We should be immensely grateful to
the Holocaust Educational Trust for providing the resource that we all
need. I join others in commending its work and that of Karen Pollock in
particular. I am sure that the trust will rise to the challenge of
keeping alive and accessible the stories and lessons of the holocaust
as the number of survivors sadly dwindles over time. I commend the
Government’s continuing commitment to ensuring that the
holocaust is never forgotten, including through their funding for the
Holocaust Memorial Day Trust under the admirable leadership of Olivia
Marks-Woldman. Both trusts play their part in humanising the holocaust.
In my view, that is the only way in which we can begin to comprehend
such a vast and enduring

the Chamber today, we have heard how Members have comprehended the
horror through seeing the piles of shoes or treading the steps into

Prague ghetto. We know so much, and yet we seem to learn so little. As
we pause in the week before we mark Holocaust memorial day on 27
January, with its theme of journeys, we should take time to reflect on
our global shortcomings and on our tendency to recognise the absolute
horror of the holocaust, and yet to allow subsequent genocides to

Friend—in saying that it has been a privilege to listen to all
the speeches that have been made in this debate. That is not always our
experience in this Chamber, but everyone has listened intently to every
word that has been said today. I have been moved by many of the remarks
that colleagues have made. We have shared our different experiences,
the ways in which we have encountered the holocaust and how we have
responded individually. Perhaps more importantly, we have resolved to
act
together<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T16:47:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012382000643" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/debtext/140123-0004.htm#14012382000643">The
British mainland escaped the horrors of Nazi occupation. Although some
European Jews were able to flee here, most notably through the
Kindertransport, for most of us the holocaust is not a family
experience. I note that it is for some Members who have spoken. For
most of us, our witness and understanding has come through history,
literature and perhaps
film.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012382000644" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/debtext/140123-0004.htm#14012382000644">My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T16:48:19"></hs_TimeCode>
first knowledge of the holocaust was as a 13-year-old watching the TV
series “Holocaust” in the late 1970s. That spurred me to
read the only book about the holocaust that I could find at the time,
which was “Scourge of the Swastika” by Lord Russell of
Liverpool, who was involved in the prosecution of Nazi war criminals. I
have never forgotten the table of categorisation in that book for the
Nazis’ targets for imprisonment and murder. We are all familiar
with the yellow star and the armband, but less often mentioned are the
colours and symbols that were used for Gypsies, Roma, Jehovah’s
Witnesses 
<?notus-xml column=544?>and the disabled. I was most alarmed by the
pink triangle for homosexuals, because at that age I was
just coming to terms with what I
was<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T16:48:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012382000645" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/debtext/140123-0004.htm#14012382000645">The
first reason to remember the holocaust is to understand that minorities
are our friends, our neighbours and our work colleagues. In the twisted
minds of those who hold a prejudice, the minority could be ourselves.
That is why we should be thankful that we live in a society in which
human rights are upheld and in which minorities are our fellow
citizens, not outsiders who are confined to legal or physical
ghettos.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012382000646" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/debtext/140123-0004.htm#14012382000646">In<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T16:49:10"></hs_TimeCode>
recent years, mass knowledge of the holocaust has come through the
films with which we are all familiar, but literature and celluloid are
no substitutes for real-life experience and testimony. We have all
mentioned speeches and visits to museums and monuments. I first went to
Auschwitz-Birkenau in 1992, when frankly it was not usual to do so,
during a visit to Poland while inter-railing. I will never forget it.
There were very few visitors at that time, and when we followed the
line to Birkenau, I climbed the gatehouse tower and looked at the scale
of the camp. To those who have not yet been there I say that that is
the memory that will live with them; the scale and the
industrialisation of mass murder. I was there entirely on my
own—no one else—visiting on a hot summer’s day in
1992, and it gave me my own time of quiet contemplation. It is not a
visit I have ever wanted to repeat, but like the shadow Minister, I
think it is perhaps something I should now do.</hs_Para>

been to Amsterdam and the Anne Frank House, and I have also seen the
pink triangle memorial in that city—the only known monument to
gay people who were murdered by the Nazis. In 2012, I went to Yad
Vashem with the Liberal Democrat Friends of Israel, and I was familiar
with many of the historical displays there. My right hon. Friend the
Member for North East Bedfordshire said that he was profoundly affected
by the children’s memorial, and no one could not be. What most
affected me was the hall of names, where one looks up at a cone of
photographs—hundreds, perhaps thousands, of photographs of
people who were wiped out by the Nazis, reflected in a dark pit below.
I really could not hold it together on that occasion.</hs_Para>

is a unique event and must be remembered and understood, particularly
by young people for whom it is an historical event that took place long
before they were born. It is right for the Government to support that,
and many hon. Members have mentioned that they work with the Holocaust
Education Trust, led by Karen Pollock. It facilitates school visits to
Auschwitz, as well as talks in schools, such as those that took place
in my constituency, to give young people a vivid account and an
unforgettable memory. Of course the most powerful testimony comes from
holocaust survivors, such as Auschwitz survivor Freddie Knoller, who is
still speaking in schools at the age of 92.</hs_Para>

joined several other people now in the Chamber—the hon. Member
for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs Ellman) mentioned this—at the
Holocaust Educational Trust annual Merlyn Rees memorial lecture, to
listen to Thomas Harding tell the fascinating story of his Uncle Hanns
and the arrest of the Auschwitz commandant, Rudolf Höss. Thomas
Harding discussed how people can turn from being loving fathers to
murderous monsters. We are all familiar with the phrase
from that time and the excuse that was often used about 
<?notus-xml column=545?>following orders, but he said that that was perhaps better
described as people surrendering their capacity to think to
others.</hs_Para>

recent massacres and genocides we have seen how easy it can still be
for people in advanced societies to slip from civilised values into
thoughtless barbarity, whether in Cambodia, Rwanda, Darfur, or the
current horrific scenes in Syria, where reporters are using the
holocaust as a context in which to explain a tragedy unfolding before
our eyes. People can still all too easily be led into acts of cruelty
and murder.</hs_Para>

it is right that this Government—as did the previous
Government—support the work of the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust,
led by Olivia Marks-Woldman. Its annual act of remembrance on 27
January, the date of the liberation of Auschwitz, will be marked around
the country on Monday. This year’s theme is journeys, and those
of us who have seen at Auschwitz the pile of leather suitcases will
certainly appreciate the resonance. Next year will be the 70th
anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. The Prime Minister has set
up the Holocaust Commission, chaired by Mick Davis, president of the
Jewish Leadership Council. That is because real-life memories are
fading as people who remember the holocaust or who were told stories by
their parents die. The work of the commission will be to consider how
we can keep that testimony live and real, and ensure that those of the
next generation comprehend the history, and also learn how to shape
their future.</hs_Para>

I commend this debate to any of those who watch our proceedings,
whether those in schools thinking about Holocaust memorial day, or
young people who want to watch something not just on this issue but on
how Parliament works. The debate has been exceptional. We have had
personal experiences, family experiences, difficult experiences of some
horrors and a collective knowledge of the subject that has been brought
about by those who work so hard for us outside, including the Holocaust
Educational Trust. The debate has been a model of its kind. I am proud
to have led it, but even prouder of the speeches we have heard this
afternoon<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T16:56:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012382000658" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/debtext/140123-0004.htm#14012382000658">Secondly,
I would say, “Do fix on the hope.”
“Schindler’s List” does not conclude with the
death of the little girl in the red dress; it concludes with the
generations, who were saved by Oscar Schindler, and the generations
still to come. The personal experiences and journeys referred to by
colleagues are a reflection of hope. As
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T16:57:23"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Stirling (Mrs McGuire) said, the survivors won, not the
Nazis. In all our reading on the holocaust, we should fix upon the
hope<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T16:57:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012382000659" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/debtext/140123-0004.htm#14012382000659">Thirdly,
we must not believe that it cannot happen again. Above all, we should
keep in our minds that it could happen again. It is the evil in human
hearts, which is reflected the moment one begins, unjustifiably, to
separate someone as the “other”, that provides the
opportunity: so long as somebody can be “Untermensch”, so
long as someone is not like you, so long as someone is not human, they
can be disposed of. As colleagues have said, the world is full of
examples, even today, of where that is true, so do not believe that it
cannot happen again.</hs_Para>

reflect on this: we know about the holocaust for a number of reasons,
but two are primary. First, people survived. That is how we know about
it: people have their stories. Memorial day and everything we have
spoken about today depends on the fact that people survive and can tell
their stories. The second, and more difficult thing that people have to
remember, is that we know about it because it was stopped. The
holocaust did not come to a natural end. People did not suddenly wake
up and say, “This is wrong and we must stop doing it.” It
was physically stopped. It would be wonderful if we lived in a world
where there was no physical need to intervene and stop people doing
wrong. I do not believe that we do. That is why an international
security system exists to protect people. This is something to debate:
at what stage do people say, “Enough is enough” and do
something about
it<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T16:59:08"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para>

say. “Do go.” So many of the speeches we have heard today
have been influenced and coloured by the fact that we have been to
places: the Anne Frank house, Yad Vashem, museums around the world and,
above all, Auschwitz. Go and get the sense of what this was about from
the physical presence in various places.</hs_Para>

Vickers</B> (Cleethorpes) (Con):</Member> I would like to thank Mr
Speaker for granting me this debate, which is of great significance to
my constituents, many of whom have seen their homes and businesses
flooded for the second time in six years. This time, it was a result of
a tidal surge; previously it was a result of heavy rain—but if a
person’s home is flooded, the source is of little
consequence<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T17:02:39"></hs_TimeCode>.
With your permission, Madam Deputy Speaker, I shall conclude my remarks
in time to give my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Goole (Andrew
Percy)<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T17:02:45"></hs_TimeCode>a couple

tidal surge that affected the Humber estuary on the night of 5 and 6
December was greater than that of the disastrous floods of February
1953, but thankfully the impact was much less, thanks to the extensive
work undertaken in the years since. Clearly, investment in flood
defences has been effective, but with severe weather apparently
becoming more common, yet more needs to be done—we must not be
complacent. The recent surge resulted in major damage to the port of
Immingham. Measured by tonnage, the Immingham-Grimsby port complex is
the largest in the UK, with about a quarter of all freight moved by
rail starting or ending in Immingham. Much of this freight—coal
for power stations, oil and other essential
products—is of vital strategic
importance.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012382000673" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/debtext/140123-0004.htm#14012382000673">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T17:03:41"></hs_TimeCode>

Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T17:03:48"></hs_TimeCode>for his
visit to Immingham on the afternoon of Saturday 7 December. He heard at
first hand from Associated British Ports and Environment Agency staff,
and the visit enabled me to brief him about other incidents of flooding
in the Barrow Haven and New Holland areas. We heard from the dock
master for Immingham and Grimsby, and it is clear that he made the
right decision by opening the Grimsby lock gates at exactly the right
time, so preventing a large area of Grimsby and the north end of
Cleethorpes, where thousands of terraced houses are situated, from
being overcome. I lived in one of those terraced houses at the time of
the 1953 floods, but I am not old enough to have more than a hazy
memory of that terrible time. However, there are many who do recall the
devastation and deaths at that
time.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012382000674" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/debtext/140123-0004.htm#14012382000674">The
60th anniversary of the 1953 floods occurred this time last year, and
was marked by a special conference held at the Reeds hotel in
Barton-upon-Humber and attended by the then Minister, my hon. Friend
the Member for Newbury (Richard
Benyon)<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T17:04:55"></hs_TimeCode>. The

the night of 5 December, the hotel was flooded and has since gone into
liquidation, leaving a trail of lost jobs, lost deposits and wedding
plans thrown into jeopardy. One cannot but reflect on the irony of that
situation. The forced closure of the hotel is a loss for 
<?notus-xml column=549?>another reason; it was a social enterprise, owned by Odyssey
(Tendercare), a local charity that helps and supports cancer victims. A

also finds itself closed for business as a result of

Aldous</B> (Waveney) (Con):</Member> I congratulate my hon. Friend on

weeks after the east coast storm surge, we now have a full picture of
the extent of the damage and how well the clear-up and repair costs are
going. In Lowestoft in my constituency, a small geographical area was
hit very hard. Although the community rallied superbly, it will take
many people and many businesses a long time to recover. A concern that
I raised for debate before Christmas was that the Bellwin scheme could
constrain councils such as North Lincolnshire and Waveney district
council in my own area in their work to get communities back on their
feet as quickly as possible. Does my hon. Friend agree that 
<?notus-xml column=550?>to achieve this goal, the tight time scales for carrying out the work
should be extended and the bar on capital expenditure should be
relaxed? Does he also accept that there may well be a case for

are two particular issues I want to raise with the Minister, but before
doing so I should say that another issue I will be writing to him about

prior notice of that, but it was truly devastated when the Humber came
over. Some £30 million-worth of damage was caused to that big
local employer. Although it has said absolutely that it is committed to
bringing that plant back into action, it will struggle, and it may
require and seek some assistance. It has approached the council but the
council simply does not have the resources, so I will be pursuing that
separately<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T17:18:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012382000699" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/debtext/140123-0004.htm#14012382000699">The
first of the major issues is where we go now with the Humber flood risk
management strategy, a document I have been involved with since its
inception some years ago when I was a local councillor. It identifies
particular locations in my constituency, especially the bank at
Reedness, which is significantly lower in part than in other
communities, and there is a feeling that that dip in the bank of about
9 or 10 inches was the reason why it was flooded and other communities
were not. There is the same situation at South Ferriby and the South
Ferriby to Winteringham stretch. The Humber strategy is a good strategy
because it talks about maintaining and improving defences over the next
15 to 20 years. The policies adopted for those two sections are
welcome, but they were adopted in 2008 and we have not yet seen a clear

improvements to the way we manage this type of flooding, we were able

Richard Ottaway</B> (Croydon South) (Con):</Member> It is a pleasure to
see you in the Chair, Mr Chope. Last October, the Select Committee on
Foreign Affairs published its annual
critique<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T14:11:30"></hs_TimeCode> of the

today’s unpredictable world, striking the right balance between
protecting our national interests and holding true to our values, on
domestic shores as well as abroad, is a tough call, but what is certain
is that we live in an age of unparalleled transparency and instant
global dissemination of news and analysis. To win an argument credibly
in this fast-paced environment, consistency is key. The Foreign
Secretary’s speech to the Royal United Services Institute on
human rights and counter-terrorism last year sums up that dichotomy. He
talked of sharing intelligence with countries that do not always share
our values, to keep our citizens safe, but added that Britain must

concerned.</hs_Para>

underestimate Ministers’ accountability to Parliament and the
wider public. That is particularly true in the case of deportation with
assurances, when we collaborate with countries that have little regard
for human rights. Human rights organisations have raised concerns that
assurances from countries where torture is widespread are inherently
unreliable. David Mepham of Human Rights Watch, which published an
excellent report this week providing summaries of principal human
rights concerns in more than 90 countries worldwide, described the
system as “lacking in credibility”.</hs_Para>

the provisions for monitoring the welfare of those returned under
deportation with assurances, or DWA, arrangements could be
strengthened. Some of the bodies supposed to be carrying out that
monitoring do not instil universal confidence, such as the Ethiopian
Human Rights Commission. The UK Court of Appeal found that it could not
be trusted to report deliberate breaches by the Ethiopian Government,
yet the Foreign Office says in its response that it is satisfied that
the commission is fit for purpose. With regard to other countries, our
agreement with Algeria makes no provision for formal post-return
monitoring; British embassy staff do it. We want to be sure that
embassy staff have the training that they need, and I am pleased that
the Government have given that reassurance in their response.</hs_Para>

accusation of double standards if we allow UK commercial
interests to proceed without restraint in developing and exporting
equipment that has the capacity to inhibit free speech on the internet.
Two years ago, Amnesty International highlighted credible
allegations that businesses were supplying technology to countries that
were stifling free speech, including Egypt, Libya, China and
Iran. We welcome the Government’s response, which confirms that
they are working towards an internationally agreed and implemented list
of controlled equipment and guidance for officials in carrying out due
diligence when developing Government-led commercial and security
relationships overseas. Working with the Department for Business,
Innovation and Skills, the Foreign Office should be ready to intervene
by controlling exports if there is obvious potential for abuse by end
users.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012366000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/halltext/140123h0001.htm#14012366000015">In
that spirit of greater accountability, we welcome the Foreign
Office’s decision to define more clearly the criteria for
countries of concern. Its authoritative analysis of conditions in those
countries is to be congratulated, but the Committee questions why the
extent of our engagement in a particular country, or the impact of the
human rights situation there on our interests, should be regarded as
factors in evaluating human rights
standards.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012366000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/halltext/140123h0001.htm#14012366000016">Our
report considers more closely three countries on the list: Sri Lanka,
Burma and Russia. Sri Lanka courted particular controversy as the venue
for the 2013 Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting, which the Prime
Minister and the Foreign Secretary attended, as well as His Royal
Highness Prince Charles. The Committee felt that the previous
Government displayed a striking lack of consistency in 2009 by
objecting to the proposal that Sri Lanka might host the 2011 meetings
on human rights grounds but not to the proposal that it might host the
2013 meetings. That appears timid.</hs_Para>

fair to my Opposition colleagues, a more robust stand after 2011.
However, in the circumstances, I believe that the Prime Minister was

authorities relentlessly on human rights and seek assurances that
people who spoke out on human rights were not harassed by security
forces. Will the Minister confirm that assurances were indeed given and

disappointing was the Government’s answer to the question
whether they still hold the view that there is no substantiated
evidence of Sri Lankans returned home from the UK being tortured or
maltreated. Simply stating that the Foreign Office is not aware of any
new evidence since the original answer was submitted ducks the issue.
Will the Minister clarify what is meant by “the original
answer”? Can he give us an assurance about cases that occurred
before that time?</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border (Rory
Stewart). Burma, like Sri Lanka, attracted widespread media coverage
following the historic visit of Aung San Suu Kyi in summer 2012. We
believe that the EU’s decision to lift economic 
<?notus-xml column=145?>sanctions the following year was the right one, given the remarkable
progress made in that country. However, that comes with a
caveat.</hs_Para>

not hesitate to advocate the reimposition of sanctions if undertakings
on human rights are not followed through. Serious reservations remain
about the continued incarceration of political prisoners and the
failure to bring those responsible for intercommunal violence to
justice. Will the Minister update us on the release of political
prisoners and accountability for the shocking crimes in Rakhine
state?</hs_Para>

with less than a month to go before the 2014 winter Olympics in Sochi,
the Committee, which did not support a boycott, hopes that the UK will
use the occasion as a platform for voicing concerns about human rights
abuses. The recent release of high-profile prisoners in Russia,
including Pussy Riot, the Greenpeace activists and Mikhail
Khodorkovsky, suggests that Russia is receptive—cynically,
perhaps—to cases that damage its reputation internationally.
Khodorkovsky said himself that his release could not symbolise that
there were no political prisoners left in Russia, as much of the
Government’s crackdown on human rights continues unabated. I
welcome the decision this morning to release Platon Lebedev, but the
financial claim of 17.5 million roubles against Khodorkovsky and
Lebedev effectively blocks their return to Russia.</hs_Para>

to us, from Russia’s example in particular, that public opinion
matters, and public opinion is informed largely by the media through
broadcasts and the internet. As we on the Committee have pointed out
several times, the BBC World Service makes a huge contribution to the
projection of the UK’s values and strengths around the globe,
which is why the evidence presented to us about levels of disruption of
media freedom not seen since the cold war is extremely
worrying.</hs_Para>

the 47 countries examined by Freedom House in its survey on internet
freedom, 20 had experienced a negative trajectory since January 2011.
Bahrain, Pakistan and Ethiopia showed the greatest declines, but the
countries making the most comprehensive efforts to frustrate the BBC
World Service’s overseas broadcasts were Iran and China. We
believe that it would be astonishing if the services were to be
diminished because of a lack of resources to protect broadcasts from
interference. The BBC says that it will review the plans once the
licence fee funding begins.</hs_Para>

opinion, satellite providers, and not only those directly affected by

so.</hs_Para>

would like to end on a high note. The championing of women’s
rights across the globe is a major success story for the British
Government. We join others in commending the Foreign Secretary for
driving the prevention of sexual violence in conflict initiative and
for committing millions to fund human rights projects last year. We
strongly welcome the team of UK experts ready to be deployed in
conflict areas. We support their work in helping to build national
capacity in investigating allegations of sexual violence and gathering
evidence to 
<?notus-xml column=146?>help victims. We are pleased that the Government say they will encourage
other countries to contribute personnel and funding as demand

legislation in Afghanistan outlawing violence against women is not a
big step forward if it is not implemented. As a Committee, we are not
as optimistic as the Foreign Office that progress will be made once
international security assistance force troops have withdrawn. We
believe that a reversal is possible. The emphasis should now be on
ensuring that the gains made are not reversed.</hs_Para>

democracy and human rights is a thread that runs through every aspect

coming years. I have seen what has happened in Iraq. I criticise the

growing restrictions in many countries around the world on non-violent

proliferation of “national security” and “public

society operates. I would like to know whether the FCO has or is
planning to put in place a strategy to counter those negative
developments and to provide even more support to beleaguered civil
societies in a number of countries. Without a thriving and diverse
civil society, democracy is very unlikely to take root.</hs_Para>

I must take issue with what the FCO report says about promoting
“our” values, because what we are doing is promoting
universal values. In this connection, I must stress how unhelpful the
negative domestic discourse about human rights and universal values is.
The UK does not exist in a bubble; what we do and say on human rights

is very likely to harm us all in the longer term. Without greater

the decades since the end of world war two, we have made significant
advances around the world in establishing the principle of the
universality of human rights, but it seems to me that we are now in
danger of standing still or perhaps even going backwards. When one
looks around the world and sees the degree of conflict still taking
place between religions and within religions, and on an ethnic and
tribal basis, when one sees parts of the world—for example,
parts of Pakistan and Afghanistan—where women’s and
girl’s rights are now going backwards, and when there are so
many countries in the world in which women’s and girl’s
rights barely exist, if they exist at all, one wonders whether the
principle of universality is being reversed. The first question I would
like to ask the Minister is whether the British Government, and in
particular the Foreign Secretary, who has lead responsibility, will
create a new initiative with as many countries as possible to stand up
for the key principle that the universality of human rights should
override all other considerations.</hs_Para>

what I consider to be one of the most important aspects of human rights
policy: the British Government’s policy on giving export licence
approval to military goods, and dual-use civil and military goods, that
can be used for internal repression and the suppression of human
rights. Until the week before last, the Government’s policy
appeared to be soundly based. The Foreign Secretary told the Committees
on Arms Export Controls on 7 February 2012:</hs_Para>

proposed export might provoke or prolong regional or internal
conflicts, or which might be used to facilitate internal
repression.”</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="14012366000060" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/halltext/140123h0001.htm#14012366000060">There
were therefore two controls. The first—a very limited
control—was to establish a clear risk, which is endlessly
debatable. The second—a much wider, more substantive and more
embracing control—was to determine whether a given export might
be used to facilitate repression. That approach faithfully followed the
key policy of the previous Government, which was set out in a written
answer on 26 October 2000 by the then Minister of State at the Foreign
Office, the right hon. Member for Neath (Mr Hain).</hs_Para>

surprise of the Committees on Arms Export Controls, however, the
Foreign Secretary’s oral evidence of 8 January substantially
reinterpreted the policy statement that he gave in February 2012. He
told the Committees that the limited clear-risk policy applied to all
aspects of the policy. In effect, therefore, he was saying that the
much more substantial and all-embracing 
<?notus-xml column=151?>control of whether an export might be used to facilitate internal
repression would be governed by clear risk—and would, I believe,
be rendered more or less null and void. The question for the House,
from a human rights standpoint, is how satisfactory or otherwise it is
for the Government to rely solely on a clear-risk control for exports
that could be used for internal repression.</hs_Para>

that to the test in an area that has been the subject of much concern,
namely the export of dual-use chemicals to Syria. Such exports have
taken place since 2004 under the previous Government and the present
Government, but I want to focus on the most contentious of all: the
export of sodium fluoride and potassium fluoride to Syria in January
2012, which was well after the outbreak of the civil war. When we
raised our concerns about that with the Business Secretary in December,
he replied, much to our
surprise:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="14012366000063" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/halltext/140123h0001.htm#14012366000063">“in

comment was made against the following background: first, those
chemicals are well known from open sources to be precursor chemicals
for the manufacture of sarin; secondly, Syria was and is known to be a
major holder of chemical weapons; thirdly, Syria was a known
non-signatory of the chemical weapons convention; and, fourthly, at the
time at which those export licences were approved, a major and most
brutal civil war was taking place in Syria. I would add a fifth point:
the Prime Minister subsequently revealed in his statement last August,
following the appalling sarin attack on 21 August, that
there had been 14 previous uses of sarin in Syria, dating back to 2012.
The Business Secretary says even now that those were simply
bog-standard chemicals that it was perfectly reasonable to export to
Syria. I have to say that if that is how the clear-risk policy
operates, it is hardly worth the paper it is written on. I am sure that
the Committees on Arms Export Controls will return to that issue, which
has profound human rights dimensions.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Croydon South (Sir Richard Ottaway), and I had a
meeting with the Bahraini Opposition earlier this week. I believe that
Bahrain is at a tipping point. It could go downhill into the serious
internal civil strife that we have seen in too many other parts of the
middle east, focusing on Sunni and Shi’a. Equally—I still
believe that this is a real possibility—it could become a
standard bearer in the middle east for the peaceful resolution of such
issues and the establishment of an inclusive, fully engaged political
process in which all major sectarian groups can participate.</hs_Para>

for bringing about the second outcome, which we all wish to see
achieved, will take place in a headwind, because over the past year or
more in the middle east, we have seen an ever-increasing degeneration
into strife between Sunni and Shi’a. Sunnis have become more and
more fearful and paranoid about sharing power with Shi’as, and
Shi’as have become ever more fearful and paranoid about sharing
power with Sunnis. I suggest that the only counter to that will be for
the friends of Bahrain, which certainly include Britain, to give fresh
impetus and new support to all parties in 
<?notus-xml column=152?>Bahrain on reaching a peaceful outcome and finding a settlement that is
fair and reasonable to all parties. I urge the British Government to

Gapes</B> (Ilford South) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> I agree with the
comments made by the right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling (Sir
John Stanley) and my right hon. Friend the Member for Cynon Valley (Ann
Clwyd). The universal values of the 1948 universal declaration of human
rights are under attack and are being eroded. That is partly due to
some issues and conflicts that have already been touched upon, but,
unfortunately, it is also due to the shift of economic and political
power and influence in the world, which is moving away from the
transatlantic agenda of those who wrote the declaration towards other
regions of the world with different political histories and traditions.
We will have a big fight in this century to maintain those universalist
human rights values. It is important, however, that we recognise that
there are countries in south and east Asia that are 
<?notus-xml column=153?>democratic and pluralistic and hold to those values. Such countries
include the Republic of Korea and Taiwan, which I recently visited,
where people believe in democracy, pluralism and human rights. It is
important that we recognise the fact that we have friends in that part
of the world and work with
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012366000076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/halltext/140123h0001.htm#14012366000076">I
want to make three points. Mention has already been made of Sri Lanka.
Members will know that for a long time I have taken an interest in what
happened at the end of the civil war there. The Chair of the Select
Committee, the right hon. Member for Croydon South (Sir Richard
Ottaway), has already referred to some of the issues, so I will not
repeat his comments, but it is clear that the Commonwealth did not
confront the situation in Sri Lanka in a good way. The question now is
whether or not, by March, the Government of Sri Lanka will
come forward with credible proposals, as called for by the Prime
Minister. If not, the British Government have said that they will refer
the matter to the United Nations Human Rights Council. The council has
not always had a good record, although the Human Rights Watch report
that I saw yesterday refers to an improvement, which I think reflects
recent changes to its membership. However, several authoritarian
friends of the Rajapaksa family sit on the council, so I am not
necessarily convinced that that route will get the solution we
want.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012366000077" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/halltext/140123h0001.htm#14012366000077">Will
the Minister could address the issue of Sri Lanka in his
reply and let us know what is going to happen if its Government do not
come forward with a credible, independent inquiry into the events of
2009? Many countries around the world have been calling for such an
inquiry, not just the Tamil diaspora. Another mass grave was discovered
in a place called Mannar in December. I understand that so far 31
skulls have been discovered, placed on top of each other. Another mass
grave was discovered in the centre of Sri Lanka a year ago. It is quite
clear that there are questions to be answered about the firing in the
so-called no fire zone and the deaths of 40,000 people there in early
2009, just five years
ago.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012366000078" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/halltext/140123h0001.htm#14012366000078">My
friend, the right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling, touched on the
other issue that will confront us perhaps for decades: the turmoil in
the Muslim world. I do not mean just the Arab world, but the wider
Muslim world. Iran is, of course, an important contributor to the
debate in terms not just of its influence in Bahrain, but its role in
supporting Hezbollah, which fights on behalf of Assad in Syria. So far
in Syria, 125,000 people have died. Millions are internally displaced,
and millions more are refugees. We know what the situation is and we
all bear responsibility. The international community has failed the
democratic, peaceful activists, women and men, who were calling for
change just three years ago. We have failed them. Non-intervention also
has consequences; it does not mean that Syria is nothing to do with us.
All we can do is say, “We did not help you at your time of need
when you were calling for help in 2011.” As a result of that
non-intervention, the situation is now much, much
worse.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012366000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/halltext/140123h0001.htm#14012366000079">We
used to talk about the Arab spring; we are not talking about it
anymore. We have probably entered a period of turmoil and unrest that
will have inconceivable consequences. Let us look at Egypt. Human
Rights Watch has produced an interesting report in which it 
<?notus-xml column=154?>uses the phrase “abusive majoritarianism.” That is a very
interesting concept. The report says, quite rightly, that the Muslim
Brotherhood Morsi Government behaved in a sectarian, undemocratic
manner towards women and civil society groups in Egypt. However, the
military then used the pretext of the mass protests against that regime
in order to stage a coup. The British Government do not use the term
“coup”—at least, I am not sure that they do; the
American Administration certainly does not—but we must be
absolutely clear that that is what happened. The regime that is now in
charge has killed many more people than were killed in the worst
periods under the Mubarak regime. There is terrible violence, but there
is also terrorism against police officers and others in Egypt, coming
from the Islamist extremists. Egypt, a large country with lots of
neighbours, is potentially in a very dangerous
position.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012366000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/halltext/140123h0001.htm#14012366000080">In

I want to say that the Government and all parties in the House can be
proud that we human rights issues internationally. However, I find it
disconcerting when there are regimes in Russia and elsewhere, and
certain countries in Africa, which are able to quote back at us part of
our domestic debate as a way to justify their own bad behaviour.

Friend the Member for Cynon Valley touched on that issue, and it is
right that she did so. Some of our politicians need to be a little more
internationalist in the way they approach some of our debates about
refugees, economic migrants and people from different communities
living together in harmony, because sometimes words may be taken out of
context and used by authoritarian people around the world to justify
their own behaviour.</hs_Para>

begin by strongly supporting the Committee’s recommendation that
the extent of the UK’s engagement in a particular country, or
the impact of the human rights situation in that country on wider UK
interests, should no longer be included in the criteria used to
identify countries to be placed on the list of countries of concern. I
can see no case for a country’s inclusion being
dependent on whether the UK can—as Baroness Warsi, the Senior
Minister of State, said in her evidence to the
Committee—“make a difference”. Apart from anything
else, many of the countries already on the list have seen little or no
improvement despite being categorised as a 
<?notus-xml column=155?>country of concern and therefore presumably having been pressed further
by the UK to improve human
rights<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T14:21:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012366000086" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/halltext/140123h0001.htm#14012366000086">No
one pretends that it is easy to effect change in brutal regimes that
are strangers to the concept of basic human rights, but bringing UK
interests into the equation, in the way that that is being done,
devalues our own commitment as a country to the need to uphold
universal human
rights<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T14:21:42"></hs_TimeCode>. For
example, Bahrain has already been mentioned by several colleagues and I
have had strong representations from constituents who believe that it
should be rated as a country of concern because of human rights abuses.
However, they also believe that that is not being done because of the
UK’s interests in selling military equipment to Bahrain. I would
be interested to hear from the Minister how that can be classified as
an objective evaluation, as the Foreign and Commonwealth Office says is
the case in the criteria for countries of concern. There seems to be
inconsistency; some countries that are left off the list are just as
bad as some of the countries that are on
it<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T14:22:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012366000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/halltext/140123h0001.htm#14012366000087">Of
course, one tactic for making a difference and influencing countries of
concern is to refuse to allow them international status by
holding major events. I personally regret that the Prime Minister chose

last decade in the country has been the advancement of women’s
rights. The women and girls of Afghanistan are now protected by law
from rape within marriage; they can seek justice and support if they
are sexually abused; and millions of girls now have access to
education. However, these transformative changes are variable, fragile
and at risk, as other colleagues have said. Also, as we say in our

is not a “big step forward” if that legislation is not

want to deal with a couple of thematic issues. I attend the United
Nations Human Rights Council as often as I can. I find it interesting.
It is a great improvement on the Commission on Human Rights, in that
there is a more transparent election process for membership of the

We are now coming to the end of the period for the first reviews in the
UPR process. This is beginning to be the problem area. Where a UPR has
come up with significant human rights concerns about a particular
country—there are many of them—and a report comes back
that is inadequate or has responded insufficiently to the Human Rights
Council, the question is, how assertive is the Council prepared to be
in future<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T14:30:45"></hs_TimeCode>? There

opportunity for non-governmental organisations to make their views

<?notus-xml column=158?>well. I should be grateful if the Minister confirmed that, in any
discussions about the future structure of the Human Rights Council,
which Britain is now a member of, the Government will continue to press
for one of the basic principles of the United Nations organisation and
agencies, which is the opportunity for civil society to be able to
speak at the Human Rights Council, and at other agencies. However, I am
more concerned about the Human Rights Council, because it provides an
expatriate non-governmental organisation, for example, or an NGO in a
country with a fairly repressive regime, the one opportunity to
embarrass their Government and raise issues of torture and human rights
abuse. That is a precious right. I hope that the Government are

should also like the Minister to respond, if he could, on the question
about Britain’s attitude to the European convention on human

this Chamber does. I support the European Court of Human Rights, in the
sense that it exists and is an important process and helps set a
benchmark. Many hon. Members have expressed concern, particularly my

about<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T14:32:20"></hs_TimeCode> the
treatment of Pussy Riot in Russia and the abuse of human rights there.
The European Court of Human Rights process has been quite an important
tool for human rights defenders in Russia and in other countries,
including Ukraine, Hungary, Turkey and many other places, allowing them
to raise such issues. If they think that the British
Government’s sole policy is to continually denigrate and attack
the European Court of Human Rights, and withdraw from the convention
and that human rights process, that has two effects. First, it reduces
our moral authority to say anything about anything and, secondly, it is
a signal to many other countries that they, too, could follow the same
path if life became embarrassing for
them<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T14:33:08"></hs_TimeCode>. The point

it is important that the UK should continue to press Burma on the role

the Committee was right to focus on Russia. The “foreign

Russia’s attempts to stifle civil society and dissent and to

and increased internet regulation, as my hon. Friend the Member for

It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T14:43:17"></hs_TimeCode> is
disappointing that Baroness Warsi did not fully engage with the

LGBT rights, there is little surprise that Russia was ranked the worst

remain in detention.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T14:44:25"></hs_TimeCode> must also
consider Human Rights Watch’s warning that Sochi means that
Russian authorities have intensified the harassment and intimidation of

join the Committee in welcoming the long-awaited publication of the
Government’s business and human rights strategy. It remains a
concern, however, that Ministers, when considering opportunities to
promote British companies and investment abroad, are willing to

gave the impression that they were reluctant to raise China’s
human rights record when they visited last year. The Treasury declined
to answer my question on whether the Chancellor had discussed human
rights in China and the action plan on business and human rights with
the Foreign Office before or after he went. Indeed, the answer to that

with assurances arrangements. I put on record that DWA is entirely
consistent with our human rights obligations under international law

will not deport someone if there are substantive grounds for believing
that they face a real risk of torture or other cruel, degrading
treatment in their host country. DWA enables the UK to reduce the

right hon. Friend and others were right to mention Burma and the plight
of the Rohingya. The Government are highly vocal in expressing concern
about that plight. When President Thein Sein visited the United Kingdom
in July last year, the situation in Rakhine state was at the heart of
discussions between him and the Government. In December 2013, our
ambassador in Burma visited Rakhine state and discussed human rights
with authorities. We have been clear with the Burmese Government that
people must be held accountable when serious crimes have been
committed. We continue to lobby the Burmese Government that the United
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights be allowed to open an office
in the country. My right hon. Friend the Member for East Devon (Mr

the report that is made public is inevitably only the tip of the

Friend also mentioned children’s rights. It is correct that the
advisory group’s membership should remain limited for practical
reasons that he will understand. That should not, however, be
interpreted as underlying evidence that the protection and promotion of
children’s rights do not form an integral part of the
FCO’s wider human rights agenda, because they do. The FCO
provides financial support to programmes in this area and works to
ensure that international commitments on child rights are
fully implemented. Our embassies and high commissioners have a
responsibility to monitor and raise human rights issues including,
importantly, children’s rights. Only this week, I held a meeting

the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Nigeria, South Sudan

had a specific concern with water and sanitation, which I accept that
the Government acknowledged immediately, because there was no
particular focus on violence against women and girls. Everyone knows
that this is a prime example of where women and girls are especially
vulnerable, either when they are going to collect water or are using
sanitary facilities—they become vulnerable to attack. We welcome
the Government agreeing that they should update the guidance. Will the
Minister report on the progress made? They gave us 12 months’

genital mutilation with the Prime Minister. The International
Development Committee was concerned that it was also an issue within

country, and yet there have been no prosecutions. Sometimes, too, girls
are shipped out to have it done abroad and then brought back. Thirdly,

brought up here may go back to the country of their family’s
origin where they are at risk, and yet the extent of our ability to
protect them as British citizens is

deal with such issues and, in particular, whether there is any update
on the possibility of prosecutions. There have been investigations, but
no case has been brought to trial. As the Prime Minister said, getting
people to testify and give evidence is the problem, but our view is

that is so. We are aware that the Secretary of State champions the

Select Committee was particularly concerned. The recommendation is now
going through a working party. Will the Minister tell us what the

people have said, for example, that we cannot have a target of zero

are in effect diluting the commitment to achieve measurable
transformational change in the
sector<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T15:19:28"></hs_TimeCode>. I guess
that the challenge to our Government is whether they will continue to

we visited Ethiopia to support the programme we visited a project on
child marriage supported by the Department, which the Minister has also
visited. I do not often do commercials, but I think there is still
something about it on our website. An interesting thing was that
although the funding came from DFID and the leader of the project was
UK-based everyone else on the programme was Ethiopian. They worked with
the community, but they did not arrive with a pre-determined objective.
They sat down with members of the community to discuss how child
marriage affects communities, and led them to realise how damaging it
is. The participants went from thinking that it was in the
girls’ best interest to understanding that it is not.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T15:20:45"></hs_TimeCode> heard some
powerful testimony from a young girl who had been divorced at 13;
another who said she had been married—and she meant
married—at seven; a mother who had married off her elder
daughter and then realised she was wrong, and became determined not to
do that to her younger daughter; and a young priest who championed the
case against child marriage. He pointed out that it increased the
poverty of the village. That was powerful evidence of what can be
done.</hs_Para>

slight concern arose with respect to the campaign on female genital
mutilation. I know that the Minister has visited the project in
Senegal, and has praised it. It was believed to be effective, but we
were concerned that it might become the blueprint for what would happen
in every country. I hope the Minister will agree—I am fairly
certain that she will—that the work must be done according to
each country’s social norms, so that people can come to their
own conclusion that female genital mutilation is not the thing to do.
It is after all not in just low-income countries that it happens. The
biggest country where it is practised is Egypt, where about 90% of the
women have been subjected to it. Indeed, they accept it. There is a
huge amount of work to do. Another sad statistic was from Ethiopia,
where 70% of women thought that it was perfectly all right to be beaten
by their husbands—that they had a right to do it. There are huge
cultural challenges involved in turning things around.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T15:22:24"></hs_TimeCode>I had a strong

to Afghanistan, we recommended in a separate report that DFID should
sharpen up its commitment to its programmes specifically on women. We
said that 
<?notus-xml column=170?>women’s status after the military departure—we will stay
there for development purposes—will be the test of whether our
intervention made a transformation. The statistics are extremely
worrying. A UN report shows that although there has been a 28% increase
in violence against women in Afghanistan there has been only a
2% increase in prosecutions. Laws have been changed to
disadvantage women. For example, family members are not allowed to give
evidence, which makes prosecution extremely difficult. President Karzai
proposed to support the reintroduction of the stoning of women for
adultery. That is a shocking indictment of a country that we tried to
support, and for which our men and women died. The values we are
concerned about are not cultural; they are absolute. We are entitled to
speak out without compromise and say, “I don’t care what
your religion or social norms are; if violence by one sex against
another goes unchallenged, that will demean and diminish your society.
It is just wrong and should not be tolerated.”</hs_Para>

report, but the all-party group on population, development and
reproductive health, of which I am a member, has also produced a
report. “A Childhood Lost”, about child marriages in the
UK and abroad, was published a year ago. The report says that it is
estimated that every year 5,000 to 8,000 people, including many young
girls, are at risk of forced marriage in England. The chair of the
all-party group has tabled amendments to the Anti-social Behaviour,
Crime and Policing Bill, which is currently being debated in the other
House, to safeguard 16 and 17-year-olds in the UK, who are currently
able to marry with parental consent. I want to repeat the comments made
in the Select Committee report, about FGM in the UK, with reference to
this topic: while it is beyond my remit to comment on domestic policy

second issue to do with violence against women that I want to talk
about is often ignored. It is one on which the UK has the potential to
assert global leadership. That is the denial of abortion to girls and
women who are raped in situations of armed conflict, in violation of
their rights under international humanitarian law. The Select Committee
report has a chapter entitled “Abortions for women raped in
conflict”. Currently, the major providers of medical
humanitarian services, including those funded by DFID, routinely
exclude the option of abortion to girls and women raped in armed
conflict. That forces the majority of rape victims—including
young girls whose bodies are unprepared for motherhood —to
endure unwanted, dangerous, and life-threatening pregnancies and
childbirths. Denying rape victims access to safe abortion in
humanitarian medical settings leads to further inhumane treatment of
people already brutalised by war, because it compounds the physical
injuries and psychological devastation of the rape itself.</hs_Para>

severely restricting decision making in respect of her sexual and

important debate about violence against women and girls follows the

the contents of which the Chair of the Committee, my right hon. Friend
the Member for Gordon (Sir Malcolm Bruce), has outlined. Violence
against women and girls is a wide-reaching issue. Globally, one in
three women will experience one type of gender-based violence or
another in their lifetime. Although such violence is first and foremost
an abuse of basic human rights, and, in some cases, even child abuse,
it has other more wide-ranging societal implications, which the
Department for International Development should address when
apportioning aid.</hs_Para>

most shocking forms of violence committed against women worldwide,
already mentioned by my right hon. Friend the Chair of the
Committee, is undoubtedly female genital mutilation. Globally, up to
140 million girls have been subjected to the practice. The issue is all
the more concerning when we consider that FGM is a culturally
institutionalised practice and in some countries is endemic; the
percentage of girls having undergone the procedure in Somalia and
Kurdistan stands at 98% and 70% respectively. It is practised in about
28 countries

how DFID aims to do that. The Chair of the Select Committee mentioned
the project we saw in Ethiopia—a powerful project about village
empowerment to educate people against such practices. We saw that in
action. Only by teaching communities about female genital mutilation
and the complications it causes can they be made aware of the true
brutality of the practice. I believe that in patriarchal societies such
as those we have mentioned, such education should be focused on men and
boys, especially village elders and religious leaders, as well as women
and
girls.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012366000204" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/halltext/140123h0001.htm#14012366000204">Alarmingly,
however, FGM is not confined to far-away countries. Figures in a recent
report showed that, as those who have been working for up to 30 years
to stop the practice in Britain know, the incidence of FGM here has
increased considerably over recent years. The National Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children reports that last year 70 women
sought treatment for injuries sustained during the procedure and
illnesses associated with the practice. Some cases even led to
death.</hs_Para>

those figures are not entirely representative of the true extent of the
problem, as many women fear the consequences of telling the
authorities. That makes it difficult for the police and prosecutors to
identify cases of FGM, and to date there has never been a prosecution
under the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 here in Britain. That
situation presents law enforcement authorities with something of a
problem, and I would welcome mandatory reporting by doctors, nurses and
other health professionals, and teachers who feel that their pupils are
in danger of either having the cutting done here or of being taken back
to their home community to have it done.</hs_Para>

important that public bodies are taught that FGM is not a culturally
sensitive issue but a crime that needs to be reported to protect the
girls whom it affects. It is child abuse, and until there has been a
prosecution the practice will continue unabated. It is against British
law and punishable in the courts. Why are the safeguarding boards not
shouting from the roof tops about the issue? All those entrusted with
protecting children, young people and women need to start taking a much
more robust approach.</hs_Para>

say that France’s record is much better than ours. It has had
around 100 prosecutions to date and is setting a good example. We
should look at what it has done and how, and then do the same. It is
shocking that some French girls are sent here to be mutilated in 
<?notus-xml column=175?>this country. Why do we not change the law to prosecute the parents of
girls who have been cut? The children are supposed to be under their
protection, but the parents allow that to happen. They have been
complicit, even when they have not done the cutting themselves. When a
few parents have been prosecuted, more will think twice about the
practice.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012366000208" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/halltext/140123h0001.htm#14012366000208">I

there is so much more to be done. Greater 
<?notus-xml column=176?>co-ordination between in-country DFID
representatives and Foreign and Commonwealth Office consular staff is
paramount in promoting the regional presence of the forced marriage

the International Development Committee a few years ago when we went to
Nigeria, Bangladesh and other places. We witnessed violence against
women, child abuse, forced marriage, under-age marriage and poor
education, especially for girls, with lack of water and sanitation in
girls’ schools, which was provided in other schools. We
witnessed that discrimination. I miss the work of the Committee, and I

today’s news that a 20-year-old woman was tied to a tree and
gang-raped in India, allegedly on the orders of village elders, the
issue of violence against women and girls is particularly poignant; the
utmost importance of addressing this critical issue has been
highlighted again. As a member of the all-party group on population,
development and reproductive health, I want to draw attention to the
importance of family planning and sexual and reproductive health and
rights when tackling violence against women and
girls.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012366000222" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/halltext/140123h0001.htm#14012366000222">Violence
against women has been called the most pervasive yet least recognised
human rights abuse in the world. As many as one in three women in the
world 
<?notus-xml column=177?>have suffered some form of abuse, most often by someone she knows,
including her husband or another male family member. Any such abuse can
leave deep psychological scars and damage the health of women and
girls, especially their reproductive and sexual health, and sometime
results in death or leaves them permanently disabled, ruining their
lives.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012366000223" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/halltext/140123h0001.htm#14012366000223">The
effects of violence on a woman’s reproductive health can be
profound, from unwanted pregnancies and unsafe abortions to
complications from frequent, high-risk pregnancies and sexually
transmitted infections. Gender-based violence is sustained by a culture
of silence and a denial of the seriousness of the health consequences
of abuse. In addition to individual harm, those consequences exact a
social toll and place a heavy burden on health services. Gender-based
violence is sustained by silence, so women’s voices must be
heard and every effort must be made to enable women to speak out
against it, and to get help when they are victims of
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012366000224" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/halltext/140123h0001.htm#14012366000224">The
Government should be congratulated on hosting the family planning
summit in July 2012. Global leaders united and pledged $2.6 billion to
provide 120 million women in the world’s poorest countries with
access to contraception by 2020, and the UK announced
£500 million in aid.</hs_Para>

more than 200 million women and girls in developing countries do not
have access to modern methods of contraception. The inability to choose
and access family planning will cost many of those women their lives. I
urge the Government to ensure that part of their pledge is dedicated to
making emergency contraception available to victims of sexual violence
to alleviate some of the suffering and SRHR problems it
causes.</hs_Para>

modern contraceptives can help prevent an estimated 600,000 neonatal
deaths. In 2012, an estimated 291,000 women and girls in low and
middle-income countries died from pregnancy-related causes; 104,000 of
those pregnancies were unintended. Investing in SRHR is cost-effective.
Money spent on modern contraception helps save more in maternal and
newborn health care and is a strong tool for moving towards gender
equality and female empowerment. It helps tackle violence against women
and girls and its devastating
effects.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012366000227" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/halltext/140123h0001.htm#14012366000227">As
well as ensuring access to family planning and SRHR, I urge the
Government to strengthen advocacy on gender-based violence in all our
country programmes in conjunction with other United Nations partners

prevention of gender-based violence into information, education and

violence.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012366000228" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/halltext/140123h0001.htm#14012366000228">Lastly
and most importantly, I appeal to the Government to call for the new
millennium development goals framework to include a target on universal
access to sexual and reproductive health and rights and a stand-alone

much—perhaps “enjoyed” is the wrong

Development Committee. I confess that I had not given enough thought to
this issue over the years, and the process opened my eyes to the extent
of violence against women and girls, not only in the developing world
but, as we have heard, in the developed world. I am pleased that the
Government have made the issue a focus of their work, led by the

Development, including the former
Minister<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T15:53:55"></hs_TimeCode>, my

particularly brought home to me by three students who approached me
from King Edward VI school in Stafford, in my constituency. Those three
girls—Maya Lucey, Amy Mace and Chloe Taylor—wrote to me
saying that they would like to speak with me about it. I had not spoken
to them about it before, but what they had heard in the press and
elsewhere had made them concerned about female genital mutilation in
the UK. I had the pleasure of meeting and speaking to them last Friday,
or rather of listening to what they had to say. I was profoundly
impressed not only by the extent of their knowledge, but by their
commitment to stopping FGM in this country. I pledged that I would do
what I could to raise the matter in this debate and to supporting all
the work that

already discussed the statistics on FGM prevalence rates. They are as
high as 98% in Somalia and 94% in Sierra Leone; I will mention Sierra
Leone a bit later. An estimated 3.3 million girls a year globally are
still at risk from the practice. A study conducted in 2007 by the
London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the City university
midwifery department, using modelled estimates, concluded that 66,000
women resident in England and Wales had undergone FGM, and that 23,000
girls under the age of 15 were at risk of it. This matter is of great
importance not just in countries in the remit of the Department for
International Development, but right here on our doorstep. I welcome
the work being done by DFID. We understand that, in March 2013, it
dedicated £35 million to ending FGM in one generation. Part of
that money will fund social change, communications and research. The
goal is ambitious and worthy, and I congratulate DFID on its
commitment.</hs_Para>

the time remaining to me, I will concentrate on the vital matter of
changing social norms. I well remember living in Tanzania and having a
good friend from an area where FGM was the norm—everybody
allowed their young daughters to be subjected to it. He was
determined that that should not be the case for his daughters, and
instead of taking a negative or critical approach, he stood up and
said, “We’re not going to allow our daughters to go
through this. We are setting an example.” That comes back to a
point made by previous speakers: it is vital that we engage
communities, not just lecture them. We must work with women’s
groups, as my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T15:57:37"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Mid Derbyshire said, and with men and boys,

briefly to address the question of early marriage, and one problem that
it brings and to which FGM contributes: fistulas. When I was in Sierra
Leone at the end of last year, I visited the Aberdeen Women’s
Centre in Freetown, which has been equipped through generous donations
from Scotland, in particular, and from Ann Gloag. We saw women there,
some of them very young, whose lives were being transformed by the
repair of their fistulas, which had developed largely as a result of
their being married and giving birth at an early age. It made an
enormous difference to them. Without it, they would have been almost
outcast and ashamed to be in society.</hs_Para>

about the critical matter of water and sanitation. While I was living
in Tanzania and my wife was running a public health programme there,
one key thing that she wanted was for shallow wells to be drilled in
every village to enable women and girls to get water locally, rather
than having to travel 5 km, 6 km or 7 km for it. Such travelling not
only meant that they could not receive education, but put them and
their mothers at risk of violence. The project made a big difference,
especially as the community was involved in not only raising the money
for the wells and pumps in the first place, but maintaining them. One
could see that when a community was committed to the well-being of the
girls and women in their midst, it was quick to raise the necessary
money.</hs_Para>

conclude by again commending the Government’s work in this area.
We must ensure that it continues and is not a theme for only a year. It
has to be a theme for this Government and many Governments—and
for many generations. That is so obvious, yet it sometimes seems to
escape our

Bruce</B> (Congleton) (Con):</Member> Like most hon. Members, I want to
focus on one aspect of violence against women and girls: female genital
mutilation. I believe that our concern reflects that of the public, and
that was brought home to me when I was asked to do several media
interviews following the publication of our Committee’s report,
because every one of them focused on concern about FGM in this country.
I believe that once people become aware of the issue, they want
resources allocated to address it. I welcome the prioritisation that
DFID is giving FGM by providing £35 million towards the
ambitious aspiration of ending it in a generation.

According to UNICEF, 98% of women and girls in Somalia are affected. In

Leone, 88%; in Ethiopia, 74%; in Sudan, 88%; in Gambia, 76%; and in

Committee was shocked to receive statistics for this country from the
Department of Health. A 2007 report indicated that about 66,000 women
and girls in the UK had undergone FGM and that more than 20,000 girls
aged under 15 were at risk. However, those figures may well have been a
gross underestimate. I had the privilege of sponsoring the launch in
the House this week of a report from the New Culture Forum. That report
extrapolated figures from the 2011 census data, whereas the figures
that I cited were from the 2001 census. The number of women and girls
living with FGM from migrant communities is highly likely to have
increased over those years. It is now estimated that the figures could
be about three times those that the Committee received, meaning that
about 170,000 could have undergone FGM, and about 65,000 girls aged 13
and under could be at risk of mutilation.</hs_Para>

turn to several questions to which I would like the Minister to
respond. First, although our Committee welcomes DFID’s
announcement of £35 million for a programme to end FGM in a
generation, if that aspiration is to be met, the funding needs to be
invested sensitively and carefully. I remind the Minister of the
Committee’s recommendation of adopting a “phased and
flexible” approach to ensure that evidence-based programming is
conducted. Will she update us on progress with regard to the use of
that £35 million to tackle FGM worldwide?</hs_Para>

will the Minister confirm reports of how the Metropolitan police are
approaching the issue? I understand that they have reopened some FGM
cases. How confident is the Minister that that will lead to a
prosecution in this country? It is clear that we need to put aside
political correctness and adopt a far more robust, cross-agency
approach in which the police proactively track girls at risk. Our
Committee has recommended the publication of an up-to-date, binding
document requiring all health service providers, the Department of
Health, the Department for Education, the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office, the Home Office, the Government Equalities Office, the police,
the Ministry of Justice and the Crown Prosecution Service to play their
part. Will she look again at that? Is it not the case that unless we
have joined-up working, we will not be able to tackle FGM in this
country? Even more so, unless we have international joined-up working,
and learn from good practice and success in other countries, we will
not achieve our global aspiration. This

graphic descriptions, but Jenny Tonge, as a doctor, did embark on the

Hornchurch and Upminster (Dame Angela Watkinson), for Ayr, Carrick and
Cumnock (Sandra Osborne), for Ealing, Southall (Mr Sharma) and for

violence is a human rights and development necessity, and it is a

that I have. Since the International Development Committee
presented its report on the Government’s work in this area,
there have been several developments. Following the recommendation in

November, the Secretary of State for International Development, my
right hon. Friend the Member for Putney (Justine Greening), convened
with Sweden the “Keep her safe” event, which brought
together UN and NGO leaders and senior Government officials from across
the international humanitarian system. They agreed a fundamental new
approach to protecting girls and women in emergency situations, which
the hon. Member for Luton South raised, to ensure that their needs are
addressed as part of the initial response. At the event, £21.6

asked about the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Nigeria and
South Sudan, and whether VAWG would be prioritised. We are
currently in the process of a round of resource allocation across all
DFID offices, and we are looking in detail at how we can most
effectively scale up our VAWG programmes. I have mentioned Somalia, but
in Nigeria we have a major programme, “Voices for
Change,” to tackle the underlying causes of VAWG and gender
inequality. DFID and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office are working
closely on VAWG programmes in DRC, ensuring preventative action and

was asked what we are doing about water, sanitation and hygiene, or
WASH. DFID has produced a new briefing note on violence against women
and girls in emergencies, and over the next year will also produce
guidance on how water and sanitation sector programmes can address such
violence. Importantly, through the sanitation and hygiene applied
research for equity programme—SHARE—DFID has funded
development of a violence, gender and WASH practitioner toolkit, which

was asked how we are ensuring that VAWG is prioritised in multilateral
agencies. We are keen to ensure that VAWG is a high priority in
multilaterals. UN Women is a key partner in such matters,
and DFID helps to fund it. The call to action in November last year
that I described secured commitments from a wide range of UN agencies
to put women and girls at the heart of their humanitarian response.
That includes protecting them from violence. It was a pledge not so
much on finance, but on what UN agencies would do under the
circumstances.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012366000290" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/halltext/140123h0002.htm#14012366000290">A
lot of right hon. and hon. Members raised the issue of female genital
mutilation, an issue about which I am passionate. I think that that
comes from frustration, 
<?notus-xml column=188?>having spent two and a half years at the Home Office. Our diaspora is
intrinsically linked with the developing world but there has been a
lack of prosecutions. We were challenged on the latter
continually, but I must also say that there were no prosecutions under
the 13 years of the previous
Government.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012366000291" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/halltext/140123h0002.htm#14012366000291">FGM
is a major issue. I am sure that we all recognise how challenging it is
for a child to give evidence against their parent. As many Members
said, FGM is child abuse and it is illegal, so the inevitable
consequences are that the child will be removed from the parents
virtually as soon as it is known that something has happened. That has
been the great inhibitor. It is important that we have prosecutions, as
much as anything because of the message that they send out. The answer
is clearly not to send 20,000 sets of parents to jail, but
the message that FGM is illegal and unacceptable is very
important.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012366000292" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/halltext/140123h0002.htm#14012366000292">The
Minister for Crime Prevention, my hon. Friend the Member for Lewes
(Norman Baker), is champing at the bit on this issue. He is working
closely with the Director of Public Prosecutions, who believes that we
are very near to the first few prosecutions. Part of the issue has been
getting preparatory evidence on computers. That way, the process might
not necessarily involve a child victim giving evidence in
court—there will be evidence of plans to take a child to a
mother country to have them cut. We are optimistic about prosecutions.
I could not agree more with those Members who said that we must not
tiptoe on cultural eggshells. For a long time, that has been the
problem and a challenge. I am clear that that can have no standing. FGM
is against our
laws.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012366000293" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/halltext/140123h0002.htm#14012366000293">The
hon. Member for Mid Derbyshire asked about what happens in France. They
examine every girl every year until the age of six, as part of other
examinations. When I met with my opposite number in France, she said,
“You know, we just have a little look.” Given that there
is no question about 99% of our population—they do not practise
FGM—that would not necessarily be the best use of resources for
us. There must be continual pressure from the Metropolitan police and
the other forces around the country that were mentioned. They are now
proactively looking for those who are perpetrating FGM and seeking to
prosecute
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012366000294" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/halltext/140123h0002.htm#14012366000294">Many
Members also raised the point that our work should be much more to do
with awareness and getting into and working with communities. The women
of our Somali communities are very hidden. When I visited a school in
Bristol, the first primary school in the country that has an FGM
safeguarding policy and brings in the Somali mothers, that was the
first time that they had all met to be able to discuss such things. The
issues are not discussed in the way that we might in this
country—the women are very isolated. That is why I have been
trying to involve religious and community leaders, alongside those
agencies that are working in this field and are best able to get into
the communities and to deal with
awareness.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012366000295" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/halltext/140123h0002.htm#14012366000295">I
have also involved the TUC and the teaching unions, because they have
an opportunity to look at teacher training and other such issues.
Indeed, I am working with other Ministers on safeguarding, because the
issues are hugely important. The Home Office produced
guidelines—I am going to run out of time—for front-line
workers, but we were shocked to find that eight out
of  
<?notus-xml column=189?>10 teachers do not even know about the guidelines, so we are working

could not agree more with the view that we must be flexible with
funding. However, the £35 million that was raised is, in a
sense, to get things started. We need to find out what is

goes on social change. The funding helps to support the African

FGM.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012366000297" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/halltext/140123h0002.htm#14012366000297">Early

northern Syria, enabling them to provide search and rescue,

fire helmets and goggles, fire extinguishers, stretchers and individual
medical kits. The total cost of the proposed gift is approximately
£700,000, which will be met by the Government’s conflict
pool fund. The overall value of the uplift to the project is
£2.1 million, which includes training for nine teams of

for benefit claims and job search, we have been moving towards an
assisted service for vulnerable claimants where queries are dealt with
face to face for those claimants who require our support. As a
consequence the number of phones deployed has been falling. We are
unable to provide data from 2010 but in 2012 the number of phones
deployed was 3,700. This has decreased by approximately 1,300 to 2,400.
As we continue to develop our digital and assisted service these phones
will be gradually removed and the total will fall to

registered in the UK remain subject to UK pensions regulations and come
within the Regulator's remit. The Regulator has significant
anti-avoidance powers to ensure that abandonment of schemes does not
take place, or to take action where it does. Where there is a
deliberate act to avoid the employer's debt to the scheme or an act
which will detrimentally affect the likelihood of accrued scheme
benefits being received, the Pensions Regulator has a power to issue a
contribution notice. Where the legal

residence requirement to apply to an EU migrant claiming income-based
JSA. It is legitimate for the UK to pay income-based JSA only if there
is a genuine link between the jobseeker and the labour market, and that

armed forces personnel on operations, known as the Operational Daily
Messing Rate, is £3.36 per person. This does not include the
cost of transporting, preparing, cooking or serving meals. This is an
approximate figure based upon 90 raw ingredients assessed as necessary
to provide the calories and nutrition on a daily basis. Clearly
wholesale procurement and lower costs of food in some locations ensures
the daily allowance can be kept
low.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="14012391000075" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/text/140123w0002.htm#14012391000075">Army</hs_8Question><Question><hs_Para UID="14012391000823" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/text/140123w0002.htm#14012391000823"><B><Member PimsId="398" UID="14012391001489" xid="502" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140123/text/140123w0002.htm#14012391001489">Angus

chemical weapons programme, in support of UN Security Council

industrial grade chemicals from Syria. Both these chemicals are 
<?notus-xml column=304?>chloroamines, with very similar chemical properties, and are referred to
as "B" precursors. These chemicals are no more toxic than many other
chemicals that are routinely manufactured, processed and destroyed in
the UK under standard regulatory and security measures. One of the two
chemicals is used as an intermediate for the manufacture of
pharmaceuticals, and identical chemicals were imported into the UK in
2012 for this purpose. The “B” chemicals would become
highly toxic only if mixed with an “A” precursor to make
V-type nerve agents. (A separate tender process, managed by the

for all environmental permissions contractors need to be able to
demonstrate to the Environment Agency that they have the appropriate

Solihull (GBS) City Deal aims to accelerate economic activity in the
long-term and is a commitment to seizing Greater Birmingham and
Solihull's growth potential. The Deal aims to unlock growth and address
imbalances in private sector growth by directing investments to key
projects, infrastructure and sectors. It helps to implement the Local
Enterprise Partnership's (LEP) 'Strategy for Growth' which focuses on
Birmingham and its neighbours, including Redditch. The GBS LEP will
work with neighbouring LEPs to fund projects across LEP areas that
would have mutual economic benefits. Specifically, the Deal will drive
growth in the GBS LEP target sectors (and wider economy) through a
Skills for Growth Hub that will rapidly increase Apprenticeship uptake 
<?notus-xml column=327?>and sustainable employment. Surrounding LEPs will benefit from the
skills delivered through the Hub. Birmingham university will also
establish a new Institute for Translational Medicine. This facility
will support further growth in the health/medical services

Willetts:</Member></B> The average length of time to pay off loans in
full was most recently estimated at the time of the reforms to the
higher education system in 2011. This estimated that, under the
pre-2012 system, those borrowers who fully repaid would do so in an
average of around 13 years. The equivalent period of time for borrowers
under the post-2012 system was around 17
years.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment></System><System type="Index"><?date 2014-01-23?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_23_PT_1/Index/8ABFF5F88FF24FBA03BFA9184F4BDCDDFBC5281C" __version__="1.2"><Index cdate="30" cday="Thursday" cmonth="January" cyear="2014" date="23" day="Thursday" issue="110" maxparts="1" month="January" part="1" price="5@010c00" printing="daily" session="201314" type="back" volume="574" year="2014"><title col="419">ORAL
