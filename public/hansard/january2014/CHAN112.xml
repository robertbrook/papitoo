so many inaccuracies in that question. First, in the case of 99.6% of

fixed the problems we inherited with Border Force and queuing.
Secondly, everyone who comes through our airports has their details
checked and it is clear in the operating mandate that 100% should be
checked. We have fast-track approaches where people pay fees that

Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup

Reilly, a plumber in my constituency, has told me that he has to use a

told me that unfortunately it is increasingly being used for attacks,
particularly on women. In a tragic accident, an innocent householder
put the substance down his drain. It burnt through the pipes overnight,
went through the floor and burned the face of a five-year-old boy
sleeping in the apartment below. Surely we need some system of

someone was found guilty in that case. An EU regulation is being
brought forward on the marketing and use of explosive precursors, and
it separates chemicals into those that have a history of effective
misuse across Europe and those that are less harmful. The great
problem, as he recognises, is that many of those chemicals have
legitimate uses in household activities, such as clearing drains and
cleaning jewellery, so regulating them for legitimate use would be
quite difficult, but we are determined to do what we can to identify

alcohol from supermarkets. The Government’s alcohol policy is

reforms are working: crime continues to fall and stands at its lowest

remain concerned about the fact that violence, particularly domestic
violence, against women has continued at levels unchanged for some time
now. The Government have ring-fenced funding—for example, to
support the specialist local domestic and sexual violence advisers and
advocates—and made changes to the law, for example introducing
domestic violence protection orders to ensure that the victim can stay
in their home and that it is the perpetrator who has to leave it when
action is taken. So support is being given in a number of

Galloway</B> (Bradford West) (Respect):</Member> On a point of order,
Mr Speaker. While infatuated with the king’s horses and men in
the first world war, the Education Secretary is less keen to talk, at
least in detail, about the Kings Science Academy. On 6 January,
here in the House, in answer to oral questions, in successive
sentences, the Secretary of State—inadvertently, no
doubt—misled the House in two important respects. First, he
claimed that the police action now being taken at the academy was
“a direct result” of his Department’s actions.
That is the opposite of the truth. A brave whistleblower caused the
police action, and if it had been left to the Secretary of
State’s Department, there would have been no police action at
all<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T15:36:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012711000187" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140127/debtext/140127-0001.htm#14012711000187">Secondly,
and most important, the Secretary of State claimed on 6 January that Mr
Alan Lewis—a vice-chairman of the Conservative party, no
less—was generously taking a reduction in the income of
£6 million that the academy was paying him for rent on the site,
which he owns. That too is untrue. At the very least,
neither Mr Lewis not the Education Secretary will provide a
scintilla of evidence in this regard.</hs_Para>

me refresh the memory of the House and explain how we have got to where

otherwise given the European Union the power to pass such legislation.

European Act 2011 typically requires that, before the Government can
give final agreement in the Council of Ministers to a proposed article
352 law, the proposal must be approved by an Act of Parliament. The
rationale behind that was to subject the use of that treaty article to
case-by-case approval by Parliament, due to the entirely open-ended and
therefore unpredictable nature of the power that that gives to the
European Union.</hs_Para>

Jacques Delors, who has a very narrow interpretation of what the

European Union to move not towards a federal structure, but towards a
highly centralised structure. That has been the whole direction of

irrational. If someone stands up on a public platform or in this House
and praises the European Union, they are told that they are betraying
our sovereignty and 1,000 years of history. If they criticise the
European Union, however, they are condemned as a nationalist, a
xenophobe and a little Englander. The reality is that my objections to
the European Union are based on internationalism and the value of
democracy, because the European Union has a marked tendency to be
anti-democratic. I see that in what we are discussing today. That is

the Minister has failed to understand is that they use something that
is said to be innocuous, such as twinning, and dish out a little money
so that people can go to other countries within the European Union and
meet other people, but they have to be doing so in advancement of the
European ideal as laid down by Brussels. If they want to have twinning
to set forth Eurosceptic ideas, they will not get any money. It is set
out in the documentation itself, which the Minister ought to be aware
of, that twinning is not an apolitical activity under this programme;
it is using taxpayers’ money to further a political
scheme.</hs_Para>

that, one side—the side that wishes to get out—will have
to raise its own money from the private sector. It will not get any

Minister, when he answers, might question whether that is a reality and
whether I am raising straw men to knock down with what I have to say,
but I have looked into the matter and examined, for example, the
funding that goes to the European Movement. The European Movement has
received about £1.5 million from that programme. It is very
committed to the European ideal. It promotes it and argues for it, but
it also uses its money in an election period to promote voting against
a particular party. The European Movement website includes an undated
paper, briefing paper 11, about the rotten planks of the UK
Independence party platform. I did a bit of Sherlock Holmes work to try
to date briefing paper 11. As you might expect, Mr Gray, being an
expert mathematician, it helpfully comes between briefing paper 10 and
briefing paper 12. Briefing paper 10, of December 2008, was entitled
“How Britain can join the euro”—a very prescient,
helpful, wise paper by the European Movement—and briefing paper
12 was an analysis of the election results in 2009. Between those, a
paper was issued on the rotten planks of
UKIP.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="14012711000989" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140127/debtext/140127-0001.htm#14012711000989">4.15

to understand what powers it has and does not have,so that they are

44%—fewer than half—of 18 to 24-year-olds voted, while
76% of those over the age of 65 voted. I would have thought that it is
common sense that people need to understand the institutions they vote
on and the influence they can have by doing so. Government Members have

appears to be relatively uncontroversial—I say that

The amendments seek to do two things. Amendment 4 seeks simply to limit
what the money from the programme can be spent on, so that it could be
spent only on events commemorating the holocaust and other events in
Europe, particularly those relating to the impact of totalitarian
regimes, dictatorships and autocracies on their citizens.

seeks to ensure that any money given out by the programme would not
interfere with a European

country deserves. I know that many Labour Members desire that
referendum and will do all they can to persuade the leadership of their

I pointed out on Second Reading, the reason we are able to debate the
Bill is the far-sighted reform introduced by the coalition Government
in the European Union Act 2011, which ensures that this House has a
vote on any treaty passed by the European Union and any measure passed
by the European Commission that is not part of an existing treaty. That
is because Government Members believe in scrutinising European
legislation, in giving elected representatives of the United Kingdom
Parliament a say and, through that process and direct democracy, in
giving the people of Britain a say in the future shape of
Europe.</hs_Para>

those who are implacably opposed to the programme full stop, but I ask
them to note that we have succeeded in reducing its size by about 7%,
that our contribution is one among 27 others over a period of seven
years and that this particular part of it amounts to between £1
million to £1.5 million a year. I also ask them to note that we
have increased the proportion of funding for commemorating the
holocaust and the impact of totalitarian regimes from 4% to 20%, and
that in relation to the 60% of the money about which they are
concerned, because it appears in some instances to have gone to
organisations that they do not support, the vast majority of it goes to
organisations that are perfectly innocuous and simply seek to extend
the hand of European friendship across borders on our

right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood) reminds me of
another point, which is that even if the House voted down
the regulation —which seems unlikely, given the results of the
Divisions—the money would not come back to the UK, but would
simply be spent by the European Commission in another way, because it
is part of the overall
budget<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T17:32:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012726000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140127/debtext/140127-0002.htm#14012726000026">On
my personal preference about what Europe should spend less on, first,
Mr Deputy Speaker has made it clear that I should not respond and,
secondly, even if I were tempted to do so, I would have to defer to the
Prime Minister, who is in the course of evaluating our negotiating
position to reduce some of the European Union’s competences.

interference by the European
Union.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012726000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140127/debtext/140127-0002.htm#14012726000027">Another<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T17:33:12"></hs_TimeCode>

desperate disappointment. When I was first elected, I was told by my
hon. Friend the Member for Aldridge-Brownhills that Governments would
promise things. They would give guarantees, undertakings and
reassurances about how Eurosceptic they were, and I, as a young and
naive new Member, would believe them and put trust in the leadership of
the party to speak as it did, just as my hon. Friend found when he
first came here. He said that as time went by I would find that those
promises turned out to be as ashes and dust, and that although the
Government were willing to say, to play, and to sing the Eurosceptic
tune, they would actually be dancing the pro-European dance. In this
Bill, that dance has been taken to a further degree. It would win
“Strictly Come Dancing” for its skill in dancing to the
pro-European tune. It is a great betrayal of trust.</hs_Para>

Heaton-Harris:</Member></B> Yes, I suppose I should agree in general
principle with my hon. Friend the Member for North East Somerset (Jacob
Rees-Mogg). This has been a legitimate exercise in parliamentary
scrutiny of the spending, but I am disappointed with how we got to this
point. I have been surprised by some of the points raised in the
debate. On Second Reading, when the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland
(Helen Goodman) got the number of countries in the European Union badly
wrong, she drew a few concerns that perhaps she did not know what she
was talking about. Fortunately for us, she proved that exactly today in
her speech, so that is all good.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14012726000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140127/debtext/140127-0002.htm#14012726000063">The Minister
said that we had a number of experts in Athens; I think the
Chair of the European Scrutiny Committee is there today. From my list
of 1,000 organisations that received money from this budget in 2007, he
will doubtless be visiting the Masters and Mates Union of Greek
Merchant Marine organisation, which managed to receive €47,316.
The problem is not necessarily with the organisations that bid for
money, and what the Minister did not say when he responded to the hon.
Member for Bishop Auckland is that things do not have to be written in
the regulations for each budget line. Pages 1, 2 and 3 of the European
Union’s budget each year state at the front what is expected of
organisations that receive money from the European Union. It will not
surprise the Minister to know that those organisations are required to
promote ever-closer Union, fly things such as the European flag, and
there are other requirements. 
<?notus-xml column=691?>It is disappointing that so many organisations feel they have to bid for
European money with so many strings attached.</hs_Para>

this is a bit like the debate on tax credits that we entered when we
took office in 2010. So many people had tax credits—someone with
up to about £60,000 of household earnings could claim them.
However, when we gradually took something away from people because we
could not afford it, people were cross because the Government had
spread their largesse around. That is what the European Union is doing.
It is throwing its largesse around; it is throwing around our cash with
its name all over it, and we had an opportunity to change
that.</hs_Para>

dangerous driving. Does he agree that we also need to consider offences
linked to dangerous driving? For example, the maximum sentence for
causing death by dangerous driving is 14 years, but for causing death

Friend on securing the debate. Will he find time in his opening remarks
to talk not just on sentencing, but on when the Crown Prosecution
Service chooses to prosecute? In my constituency, there was a case
where somebody was convicted of another offence and the police decided
not to pursue a conviction for dangerous driving because they were

Skidmore:</Member></B> I thank my hon. Friend for that remark. I will
focus on the law on death by dangerous driving, but other Members have
raised the issue of whether the Crown Prosecution Service’s
definition of careless driving should be classified as dangerous
driving. I understand from alarming statistics that too many drivers
have been prosecuted for careless driving when dangerous driving was at
play. As a result, their sentences were far more lenient than they
would have been if they had been prosecuted under dangerous
driving<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T18:06:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

my hon. Friend on securing the debate. In my time as an MP, one of the
most difficult things I have had to do is to meet the parents
of young people killed by dangerous driving with regard to the
sentences that have been handed down. There was a case in my
constituency, three years ago to the day, where two young girls were
killed. The driver who caused the accident received a sentence of 36
weeks, despite the fact that he ran away from the scene of the crime
and left the young ladies to die. My constituents cannot understand how
such sentences can be considered proportionate, when they suffer a

Government are committed to reviewing the law surrounding offences of
dangerous driving, and I hope the debate is able to influence their
position in the next few months. Already, as part of the Legal Aid,
Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012, a new offence of
causing serious injury by dangerous driving has been established, with
a penalty of five years. It came into force on 3 December 2012 and
received cross-party support. I hope that the tone of this debate

dangerous

debate is topical not just because there are so many Members who want
to raise individual constituency cases, but because of the current
situation. On 28 August 2013, the Government announced that the
Sentencing Council would review sentencing guidelines for the recently
introduced offences of causing death by careless driving; causing
serious injury by dangerous driving; and causing death by dangerous
driving. It was with that review in mind that I wanted to hold the
debate, so that the will of the House, and the views of Members from
all parts of the House, could be heard and made known to the Sentencing
Council. I hope that the Minister will take note of the various issues
raised, and that they will inform the Government’s own
decisions, once the Sentencing Council has conducted its review, so
that they are aware of the strength of feeling about the fact that the
laws on dangerous driving need to be
changed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012726000365" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140127/debtext/140127-0002.htm#14012726000365">I
know that many Members are committed to campaigning for a change in the
law as a result of tragic constituency cases of deaths caused by
dangerous driving, and they will have met families of victims of
dangerous drivers who have had their loved ones cruelly torn from them,
often at a young age, only to find that the law is not on their side.
The pain and suffering of losing a family member to such a violent
death at the irresponsible hands of a dangerous driver are unthinkable,
but for the perpetrator of so great a crime then to be given a
custodial sentence of a few months or years, or even just a fine and a
suspended sentence, is an injustice that few could agree is acceptable.
It is in their memory that we hold this debate.</hs_Para>

Lovell did know, speeding in his partner’s Citroen Picasso
through Hanham, the police now on his tail, sirens blazing, was that he
should never have been in that car in the first place—he was
serving a driving ban, having been disqualified from driving. It was
not ignorance of the law that had driven him to take the wheel of a car
that afternoon; he had simply chosen to ignore it. Neither was it the
first time he had been banned from driving. He had committed 11
offences of driving while disqualified and been convicted for dangerous
driving four times. Not that he seemed to care: two weeks earlier, he
had met an acquaintance, John Fleming—nicknamed “Johnny
Fireball”—outside the Jolly Sailor pub on Hanham high
street, where he challenged him to a race. “He said,
‘Come on, Jonny Fireball. Let’s have a race. I’ve
got a fast car put down’”, Fleming later recalled, adding
that Lovell also told him, “I don’t care if I do 90 mph
and hit
someone.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012726000370" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140127/debtext/140127-0002.htm#14012726000370">At
3.50 pm exactly a year ago today, as Lovell sped into Lower Hanham

control his car. Clipping a parked car, his vehicle launched itself
across the other side of the road. Call it what you like—the
wrong place, the wrong time, that split second moment that can make the
difference between life and death—the uninsured car hit a newly
purchased tandem bike being ridden by Ross and Clare Simons. They did
not stand a chance, and their deaths were almost immediate. Lovell, on
the other hand, was still very much alive—alive enough to run

Indeed, it is the basis of my speech, and I will talk later about what
needs to happen to toughen up the law and make driving while
disqualified at least an aggravating factor, if not something more, in
cases of death by dangerous driving. In Canada, for instance, while
causing death by dangerous driving can incur a penalty of 10 years,
causing death by dangerous driving while disqualified can incur a life
sentence. We should be going down that route of much tougher penalties
for these people, who should not be let out of jail in the first place

speeds of 70mph. In August 2000, he again fled from the police and
drove on a public footpath and subway before crashing into a tree, and
eight years later, he was spotted by police who wanted to question him
about two robberies, but reversed at speed into their vehicle, causing
damage, before mounting a pavement to undertake vehicles waiting at
traffic lights, forcing two pedestrians to jump out of the way in order
to avoid being hit. He was a ticking time bomb. Given the number of his

Sentences are being handed down that do not fit the crime. I believe
that the sentencing guidelines for dangerous driving, and, indeed, the
law, need to be changed to reflect the added culpability of a driver
who has already been disqualified and should never have been
in a car in the first place, and who then causes death by dangerous
driving. As I said earlier, in Canada the penalty for causing death by
dangerous driving is a prison sentence of 10 years, and someone who was
already disqualified from driving at the time is given a life sentence.
At the very least, the fact of killing someone while driving
dangerously and while disqualified should constitute an additional
aggravating factor, and should result in a longer

incident in which a dangerous driver, overtaking when it was not safe

simply sent on a course. The police completely failed to investigate
the incident properly, and the CPS completely failed to take it
seriously. I have known that same police force to investigate other
cases in a very poor way. I was careful, when putting together my
statement, to demonstrate clearly that that man’s driving met
the criteria for a charge of dangerous driving, but no prosecution was
brought. The guy was simply sent on a course. In fact, I believe that
it was an anger management course, so it was
clearly accepted that he had been driving dangerously because he was
angry. He was not prosecuted, however. That was absolutely

too often, incidents in which people are seriously injured are
downgraded from dangerous driving to careless driving because that
makes it easier to secure a conviction. However, a conviction for
careless driving usually results in the driver just having to attend a
course. We need a comprehensive review of how the police investigate
such incidents and of how the justice system operates when people are
hurt or killed on the roads. Enforcement of traffic laws should be
reviewed to improve road safety. That would benefit all road users, but
particularly cyclists and pedestrians. Road traffic police numbers have
decreased dramatically over the past 10 years, and we should look at
reversing that trend to improve enforcement and investigation.
Prosecution guidance needs updating to ensure that bad driving that
causes obviously foreseeable danger should be classed as a dangerous
driving offence. Long driving bans should be more widely used to
penalise drivers who have caused serious danger, but not recklessly or
intentionally. Where drivers have caused serious danger recklessly or
intentionally, or have a history of breaching bans, long prison
sentences are more

all that, there needs to be better information on how the criminal
justice system deals with collisions. Currently, the complete lack of
information makes it difficult to prevent future accidents from
happening. Ministers should look at linking the information taken by
the police at the scene of a collision with the information from the
criminal justice system. That would make it easier to analyse the
response of the justice system to road collisions. It would
also help to identify areas that need improvement.</hs_Para>

Young Robert was killed. I want to highlight the case again because it
shows clearly how the laws on driving offences are not in proportion to
the crime. The driver hit Robert, killed him and drove away. He did not
stop, he did not report the incident. Indeed, he returned home and
re-sprayed his car. He took a life, he ran away and he tried to hide
the evidence. In this case, the driver incurred a pitiful sentence of

If the case had involved a gun, a knife or a baseball bat and a life

recognise that a car is not a gun or a knife and I am not trying to
claim that driving a car and carrying a firearm are the same thing. All
I am saying is that although the use of a car is a necessity in our

important that we review the situation. A car in the hands of someone
irresponsible or dangerous can cause the same devastation as a firearm.
A driver behind the wheel who is dangerous can cause as much damage as
a pedestrian with a baseball bat, if not more. Ten months in jail for
ending the life of a young boy is not right. It is not right when the

commensurate to the injury caused, does she support what I have
proposed in my private Member’s Bill on driving while
disqualified? At the moment, causing death by driving while
disqualified has a two-year maximum sentence, whereas causing death by
dangerous driving has a 14-year maximum sentence. Does she agree that
the sentence for causing death by driving while disqualified should
increase significantly to reflect that for causing death by dangerous

urged the Government to review the sentencing guidelines for maximum
penalties for driving offences that lead to death or serious injury.
Today, Members are urging the Government to consider the laws on
dangerous driving. It is clear that the law is not doing what it should
be doing as regards driving offences. The rules and guidelines set out
by the law mean that drivers who end the lives of innocent people on
our roads sometimes have their sentences reduced to mere
months.</hs_Para>

guidelines are terribly subjective and open to interpretation, and they
hold back judges from making the decisions that, in all justice, need
to be made. The average sentence served by drivers who kill or
seriously injure another human being—a mother, father or
child—while driving is 11 months. For the
family of Robert Gaunt

Mulholland:</Member></B> I thank my hon. Friend. That is another
example of a sentence, given only today, that surely cannot reflect the
reality of killing someone through criminal driving. I use the phrase
“criminal driving” very deliberately. This debate is
entitled “Dangerous Driving”, but we are all aware that
what we are actually talking about are various forms of criminal
driving—any form of it that has resulted in someone losing their
life. One of the weaknesses in the system is the confusion in both the
sentencing framework and the sentencing guidelines as to whether
particular forms of criminal driving should be regarded as particularly
serious. I will come back to that important
point.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012730000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140127/debtext/140127-0002.htm#14012730000062">I
wish to relay to the House briefly the awful case of Jamie Still, who
was just 16 years old, with everything to live for. He was a schoolboy
in Otley, a market town in my constituency. He was out with friends on
new year’s eve in 2010. At around 9 o’clock, when
crossing a road in the middle of town, he was hit by a car that was
travelling at 50 mph in a 30-mph shopping zone. He was flung through
the air. He died later, as a result of the injuries that he sustained,
in his mother’s arms; his mother managed to get to see him, but
his sister did not. As people were celebrating new year’s eve
and seeing in the new year, that family lost a beloved son and brother,
and the community lost a young man with an awful lot to
give.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012730000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140127/debtext/140127-0002.htm#14012730000063">Part
of the awful injustice is that despite the seriousness of the
crime—a crime is clearly what it is—the perpetrator was
allowed to continue driving, right up to when he 
<?notus-xml column=711?>was sentenced. He lived only a few miles away, and
was seen driving in Otley—the very place where he ended this
young man’s life. It is hard to imagine the distress that that
must have caused Jamie’s mother, Karen, and his sister, Rebecca.
The man responsible was found to be twice over the drink-drive limit.
Eight months later, he was sentenced to four years, but the sentence
was reduced to 12 months after he wrote to the judge—not the
family—to say how sorry he was. That followed a two-year
reduction in his possible sentence after he pleaded guilty, even
though, at previous court hearings, he had not done
so.</hs_Para>

Chishti:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman said that the offender was

Whether it is someone’s second, third, fourth, eighth, 10th or

were killed a year after Jamie Still, on new year’s day 2012, on
the Stanningley bypass in Leeds. They were an honest, hard-working
couple, who had just begun to enjoy retirement. They were hit by a
driver—rear-ended—who was speeding at 100 mph. The impact
of the crash caused the Metcalfs’ car to be thrown 10 feet in
the air before it flipped over. Mr Metcalf died instantly, and Mrs
Metcalf some time later in hospital. The driver, Mr Eduard Mereohra,
was a Moldovan national in the UK illegally. He had been drinking all
night at a party, and even the next morning he had twice the permitted
level of alcohol in his system. He had previously been deported for
entering the UK illegally, but somehow he had entered the country
illegally for a second time. He fled the scene, only to be caught by a

caught, Mr Mereohra first tried to deny being the driver. Later he
tried to blame David Metcalf for the accident. As if that was not bad
enough, to make it even more galling, he had been caught speeding a few

the Select Committee on Home Affairs, for that intervention. The
speeding offence occurred in the UK. Clearly there was a catalogue of
failures, which warranted a full investigation, which I asked for and
got somewhere with. The most galling thing is that, because Eduard
Mereohra is a foreign national in the UK illegally, he is likely to
serve only half of his nine-year sentence—frankly, his offence
should automatically have triggered a 14-year sentence, given the
catalogue of offences—before, quite rightly, he is deported. The
trouble is that we can impose no parole conditions on him in a foreign
country, so it is likely that he will serve considerably less time than
if he were a UK national. That is another blow for the

thing that needs to change—it has already been covered, and I
want to add my support—is the failure of sentencing to give real
justice to the families. Let me make it clear that this is not an
instance of 
<?notus-xml column=713?>politicians saying, “We want longer sentences
per se.” We have a confused and, in some ways,
conflicted system for sentencing people. We have too many
different offences and a wholly inconsistent approach when it comes to
the interpretation of guidelines, and there are weaknesses in those
guidelines. After four years and 20 weeks of his sentence, the driver
who killed Jamie Still was allowed to move to an open prison, and could
drive—potentially in the area where he had committed that
crime.</hs_Para>

me to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood (Mr
Spencer) that it is absurd for driving bans to run concurrently with
prison sentences. It is such an obvious, simple and common-sense thing
for driving bans to begin on the day on which people can drive again,
whether on weekend day release or whether they are out. Certainly, as
soon as they have an opportunity to get into a car, those terms must be
considered. Far too few people have received the maximum sentence
available, even where it is warranted, as in some of the
cases that we have
mentioned<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T19:19:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012730000076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140127/debtext/140127-0002.htm#14012730000076">Another
problem concerns plea bargaining and the fact that far too often the
charge for dangerous driving is careless driving. I
have great sympathy with Brake’s view that the solution is to
get rid of the offence of causing death by careless driving
and to have only the offence of dangerous driving. The judge can then
sentence on the basis of appropriate guidelines, with a maximum
sentence for the worst offences to lower ones for lesser
offences<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T19:20:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012730000077" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140127/debtext/140127-0002.htm#14012730000077">We
have heard of cases today from up and down the country of terrifying,
wilful, aggressive, reckless criminal driving being deemed not
dangerous, but careless. That is simply dishonest, untrue and wrong.
That fails people such as the family of Jamie Still. Due to plea
bargaining and due to the CPS deciding that it is easier to obtain a
prosecution for death by careless driving, people who are clearly
guilty of dangerous driving are allowed to opt for a lower sentence.
That is why we need the offence of dangerous driving with adequate
sentencing guidelines for all who have driven dangerously, as all the
people mentioned clearly have

seems to be police practice, at least in some areas, that someone who

as being over the drink-drive limit, but that is not tested for,
because a prosecution will be guaranteed anyway. That is another factor

simple. We have a year of this Parliament to try to change the law. We

justice for all the families who have been referred to today. We need
justice for the Simons family, the Still family and the Metcalf family.

Rebecca and Peter, Jamie’s grandfather, show that these people

prevent people from getting behind the wheel of a car and behaving in a

sentence them appropriately. All hon. Members from both sides of the

often, laws are there to be broken. Consider the attitude of
many hon. Members to speed cameras. People talk about them being cash
cows, not recognising them as devices to get us to obey the law or that
they are often in place because of long campaigns by local

want to talk specifically about the number of people legally driving on

licence, a woman in Bolton with 27 points on her licence, and 8,000
other people with more than 12 points. What does that say about the
seriousness with which we treat driving laws? The law says that people
should be banned when they have 12 points, unless they would face
exceptional hardship. Exceptional hardship is not about losing
one’s job, but it could be about losing one’s home or
other people losing their job.</hs_Para>

wonder why the Squeeze singer, Chris Difford, escaped a driving ban
after pleading that it would cause exceptional hardship as he would no
longer be able to travel the country playing gigs. The 57-year-old,
who earns up to £100,000 a year performing around the
country, was caught doing 88 mph on a 70 mph road. The son of Tony
Christie, famous for his song “Amarillo”, claimed
exceptional hardship because he would not be able to drive his dad to
gigs after he had totted up 25 points. The jockey Kieren Fallon escaped
a driving ban after he claimed that it would cause exceptional hardship
because the state of the racing industry was such that he could not
afford a full-time driver. Premiership footballer Zak Whitbread
who admitted speeding at 97 mph with 17 points escaped a ban
after saying that he would not be able to find another football job if
he could not drive. There are many other cases of people who have
escaped bans. Not all those 8,000 people are famous, but often they are
rich enough to pay a good barrister to get them
off.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012730000085" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140127/debtext/140127-0003.htm#14012730000085">Drivers<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T19:29:19"></hs_TimeCode>
cannot use the same exceptional hardship plea each time they
are taken to court, but there is no central record of which plea has
been used. There is also no record of whether drivers are involved in
later accidents. If a driver can clock up 47 points, 27 points, or even
just 15 points, it seems to me that they have a disregard for the law
and therefore pose a risk to other road users.</hs_Para>

parents and siblings have been drastically affected. Of course, a young

that he was partly to blame, because he was speeding—a Jack the

the Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry), who talked not about
individual but corporate actions in relation to the responsibility of
schools. That made me reflect on schools in Rochford and Southend East.
State schools in Southend have very good protections for passengers
from errant vehicles, but that cannot be said about private schools. We
should perhaps look not only at private schools, to make sure that they
are treated in a similar way to public ones, but at nurseries. As the
boundary between the definitions of public and private schools merges
in the form of free schools, such protections may become even more
important<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T19:41:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012730000102" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140127/debtext/140127-0003.htm#14012730000102">I

friends. The police now estimate that he was travelling at about 47 mph
in a residential road. He simply did not have the skills to control the
vehicle, and he hit all the teenagers. Teenagers who gather and go from
place to place for a birthday celebration tend to chat; getting from A
to B is as much a part of the birthday celebrations as the actual
outing to a location. Some of the individuals were knocked through a

people’s liberties and incurring costs, but
Eleanor’s parents have been very responsible. Specifically, they

their driving test and the L plate is removed, however, we
expect them to be equally competent as a driver who has perhaps driven
for 20, 30 or 40 years and passed an advanced driving test. The
probationary plates not only allow other people to exercise a little

initially, a simple three-year system, but there are several other
options. In different areas, features of systems include compulsory
logging of the initial 120 hours of driving experience, a minimum
period of driving on certain types of roads or a two-stage
probationary period, which in some places is recognised by the use of
P1 and P2 plates. In some places, there are peer passenger
restrictions, so that only a certain number of people of a certain age
are allowed in the car after dark or late at night. I urge caution in
considering that option, because it would have other implications such
as young people being left on the streets. There are certainly many

case is unique and creates a lasting wound for the friends, family and
community of the victim, but this is not a new issue. We have been
dealing with it for decades. The North report, 25 years ago, was a
full, clear and serious report that pointed out that the courts were
not dealing with serious driving cases with the appropriate severity,
particularly when there were aggravating factors such as the driver
being under the influence of drink or drugs. In criminal practice at
that time—I think the Minister is old enough to remember this,
and I certainly am—the issue of consequence was often discussed.
The culpability of the driver was not properly balanced with the
consequences. We have moved on substantially from that. For example, we
now have the offences of dangerous driving, with a maximum 
<?notus-xml column=723?>two-year sentence, causing serious injury by
dangerous driving, with a maximum five-year sentence, and causing death
by dangerous driving, with a maximum 14-year sentence. Parliament has
given the courts the ability to deal appropriately with the degree of
consequence as well as the degree of culpability. Both are relevant
factors, but we have moved away from the era in which the primary
consideration was simply the quality of the
driving<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T20:06:10"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T20:06:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012731000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140127/debtext/140127-0003.htm#14012731000017"><B><Member ContinuationText="Greg Mulholland" PimsId="4826" UID="14012731000043" xid="861" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140127/debtext/140127-0003.htm#14012731000043">Greg
Mulholland:</Member></B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way and
for his helpful comments. On that point, may I bring to his and the
House’s attention the problem of the difference between the
charges of causing death by dangerous driving and causing death by
careless driving? The latter is when the driving fell below the
standard expected of a careful and competent driver, and the former is
when it fell far below that standard. As we have heard today, there are
some cases—I believe that there are many, and I have asked the
Minister for a review—in which the driving has clearly fallen
below that standard, yet people are charged with causing death by
careless driving, not by dangerous

consider the realistic prospect of conviction as well as the public

the same assiduousness as other criminal cases. I believe that that has
begun to change<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T20:08:07"></hs_TimeCode>.
The consequence was that charges were either not brought at all or
brought at a lower level, because the CPS did not believe that there
was a realistic prospect of success. In part, that may have been due to
the influence of public opinion about standards and quality of driving,

still leaves something to be
desired<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T20:09:30"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
not a straightforward matter. First, there is the question of the
degree to which the driving has fallen below the standard of competent

hon. Member for Leeds North West mentioned. That judgment needs to be

having decided what level of offence to charge, there is the issue of
seriousness regarding the quality of driving, and that of aggravating
or mitigating 
<?notus-xml column=724?>factors, particularly if they pertain to the individual accused. Such
matters are not straightforward, and again, on occasion, prosecutors
err on the side of caution when deciding what to charge and what are
their prospects of success. In the most serious driving cases it is
open to the CPS to charge someone with manslaughter, but that happens
very rarely.</hs_Para>

from across the House have reviewed the nature of
offences—again, in response to pressure from parliamentarians
and the general public over time—and a number of changes were
made by the previous Labour Government. In particular, under the
Criminal Justice Act 2003, the maximum penalty for causing death by
dangerous driving was increased from 10 to 14 years, as it
was for causing death by careless driving when under the influence of
drink or drugs. The Road Safety Act 2006 introduced new offences of
causing death by careless driving or by driving illegally. Those
offences attract lower sentences—five years, I think, in the
first case, and two years in the second—but they are new
offences that came into effect in
2008.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012731000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140127/debtext/140127-0003.htm#14012731000024">Although
it concerns a more recent offence, perhaps for completeness I should
mention the offence of causing serious injury by dangerous driving,
which again attracts a maximum five-year sentence. That was introduced
through the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012,
and both the Minister and I had the pleasure of serving on the Bill
Committee. That offence was contained in one of the few clauses of the
Bill that attracted unanimous support in Committee, and it arose out of
a private Member’s Bill promoted by my hon. Friend the Member
for Kingston upon Hull East (Karl Turner). That is significant not
because he is also a doughty campaigner on these issues, but because
many individual advancements in legislation have come about through
private Member’s Bills or the actions of individual Members on
behalf of their constituents, and indeed through debates such as
this.</hs_Para>

been substantial changes and increases in maximum sentences. That
allows for new sentencing guidelines, and for longer—and indeed
more careful—sentences to be given, since all the factors I have
described must be taken into account by the sentencer. New offences
were created where lacunae in the law were identified, which is right.
The changes in law under the previous Labour Government led to the
substantial revision of sentencing guidelines in 2008. I will not go
through those in detail, but they substantially increased some of the
guideline sentences and gave clear instructions to the courts about how
aggravating or mitigating factors should be dealt with.</hs_Para>

sentence of just a few years for taking a life will always seem
inadequate to the family of the victim, I suspect that what often
causes most concern to families are the sentences handed out for some
of the “lesser” offences such as causing death by
careless driving or while driving illegally. Those sentences can be
measured in months, or perhaps just one or two years, and that will
never seem an adequate punishment for the taking of a
life.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012731000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140127/debtext/140127-0003.htm#14012731000027">As

Rochford and Southend East. Although we have focused
narrowly—quite properly, as this is the subject of the

isolation because it must be considered in the round. One must also
look at prevention.</hs_Para>

against a background around the world of 1.3 million deaths due to road
traffic accidents—I saw those statistics today in <I>The

traffic offences are particularly difficult because the harm caused

Crown Prosecution Service and its involvement in bringing the right
charges were mentioned. The charges considered by courts are dependent
on the charges that the CPS chooses to bring. That will be based on its
assessment of the quality of a defendant’s driving both
preceding and at the time of impact. The CPS must give careful
consideration when making charging decisions in cases involving driving
that has led to a death. In deciding whether to charge death by
dangerous driving or death by careless driving, it is the standard of
driving to which prosecutors must have careful regard. As other hon.
Members have explained, to amount to dangerous driving, the driving in
question must be deemed to be far below what would have been obvious to
a competent and careful driver. For careless driving, the driving needs
to have fallen below the standards of a competent and prudent driver.
Of course, each case should be looked at individually and decided on
its own facts. Many things will play a part in those

his argument, but he will appreciate that there are, of course, risks.
The offence was created because in many cases the choices available to
a prosecutor were either to bring a charge of causing death by
dangerous driving, or a simple charge of careless driving where a death
had resulted. If prosecutors felt unable to prove dangerous driving
under the definitions we have discussed, they were left with what many
would consider the inadequate remedy of a simple charge of careless
driving. That was the reason why the offence was brought in, and we
have to think through very carefully the consequences of removing it

ease of getting a potential conviction for death by careless driving is
being misused, because there are cases—I would like to discuss
some with him—where people’s driving clearly fell far
below the standard and was clearly wilful and grossly dangerous? I
believe it is being misused. That is why Brake believes it would be

comment on particular cases, and it is for Crown prosecutors to decide
what the appropriate charge should be. We would all expect, however,
that where they feel they are able to prove that driving fell far below
the required standard, dangerous driving would be the appropriate
charge; or, indeed, as others have said, in cases of gross negligence
manslaughter would be the appropriate charge. The difficulty is that
where prosecutors believe that in their judgment it is not possible to
prove that driving fell far below the required standard, were we to
remove this offence from the statute book they would simply be left
with the charge of careless driving, which, of course, has considerably

the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T20:30:09"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Hammersmith said, we have introduced a
variety of new offences over the years to fill perceived gaps. We have
created a new offence of causing serious injury by dangerous driving,
ensuring that dangerous drivers are punished appropriately when their
actions have serious consequences short of death. The new offence fills
the previous gap by specifically targeting cases in which dangerous
driving results in serious injury. In addition, the Crime
and Courts Act 2013, which received Royal Assent on 25 April,
introduced the new offence of driving a motor vehicle while under the
influence of certain controlled drugs in excess of set
limits. The new drug-driving offence will improve the law available for
tackling the problem of drug-driving, which presents a significant road
safety risk. That resulted from the campaigning of

Sentencing Council, which has been mentioned several times, has
developed guidelines for the courts when dealing with these offences.
It is important to recognise the distinction between the Sentencing
Council’s guidelines and maximum sentences, the latter being for
the Government and Parliament to set. The Sentencing Council sets
guidelines for how courts ought to approach sentencing within those
maximums, and has developed guidelines for the courts when dealing with
this type of offence. Summary offences, including dangerous driving and
careless driving, are dealt with within the magistrates courts
sentencing guidelines—most recently updated in 2012—and
the sentencing guidelines on causing death by driving were published by
the then Sentencing Guidelines Council in 2008. The latter covers the
offences of causing death by dangerous or careless driving as well as
causing death by dangerous driving while under the influence of drink
or drugs and causing death by driving unlicensed, disqualified or
uninsured.</hs_Para>

Members have referred to those sentencing guidelines, so it might be
worth my drawing their attention to one or two specifics within them.
First, on the comments from
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T20:32:28"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Leeds North West, it is an additional aggravating
factor—in fact, the first in the list—if a person has
previous convictions for motoring offences, particularly offences that
involve bad driving or the excessive consumption of alcohol or drugs
before driving. Causing death by dangerous driving while disqualified,
which my hon. Friend the Member for Kingswood mentioned, is also on the
list. On that list are offences committed at the same time such as
driving other than in accordance with the terms of a valid licence,
driving while disqualified, 
<?notus-xml column=730?>driving without insurance, taking a vehicle without consent and driving
a stolen vehicle.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T20:33:08"></hs_TimeCode>These matters

thoroughness and his generosity in giving way, but he has slightly
missed my point, which was not about previous convictions, but cases
where someone is breathalysed, given a blood test and shown to be over
the drink-driving limit and therefore to have broken that law. In such
cases, people are not always also drug-tested, even if drugs are
suspected, and that is quite wrong. If someone is over the limit and
also under the influence of drugs, those two things make the act more
reckless and more criminal, and they should have a higher

I have said, we are continuing to look closely at the legislative

whether the current maximum penalties reflect the seriousness of
offending behaviour. I have listened carefully to what has been said

the calls for urgency that we heard from, for example,
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T20:38:51"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friends

consider these matters in the round, and to do so in a way that does
not create discrepancies in the sentencing system. We must ensure that
we understand fully how we can adapt our sentencing practice to deal
with cases such as the many terrible ones that have been raised this
evening, and to deal fairly and sensibly with driving offences such as
those that we have discussed.</hs_Para>

first thanking the Minister and the shadow Minister for their positive,
constructive comments. I particularly want to thank the Minister for
agreeing to look closely at what has been said today. Eight hon.

interventions, and I hope that the transcript of the debate will be

tragically cut short, often by cowards driving dangerously under the

<?notus-xml column=732?>drugs or drink. Some of those drivers were already disqualified, some
were speeding, some fled the scene of the accident. We have also heard
about the paltry sentences that are handed down to those cowards. I was
shocked to discover from
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T20:40:41"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

only one question emerges from today’s debate, it is this: why

the same time, however, we have all seen the glimmer of human spirit
that has shone through in the form of the bravery of those families
who, though they are living with unspeakable pain and tragedy, are
determined to campaign for justice for their loved ones. I mentioned
that today was the first anniversary of the deaths of Ross and Clare
Simons. Their families are at this moment watching our debate on a
wide-screen television in the Cherry Tree pub in Oldland Common. They
are determined to ensure that they get justice for Ross and Clare.
Indeed, that is the title of their campaign. They know that nothing
will bring Ross and Clare back, just as nothing will bring back Jamie,
William, Eleanor, Paul, Robert, Andrew, Rob, David and Dorothy, all of
whom have been mentioned in the debate today.

justice involve? What are the families of Ross and Clare, and of all

debate has helped to give those families a voice here in Parliament,
but justice is not merely about words. I have heard extremely wise,
intelligent arguments and policies being put forward today, and the
Government have kindly agreed to consider them, but justice is not only
words; justice is action, and action is change. We need to change the
law to ensure that we have tougher penalties for those who drive
dangerously, for those who kill and maim and, above all, for those who
will not take responsibility for the consequences of their actions. We
as Members of Parliament must take responsibility for ensuring that
those consequences are fully addressed.</hs_Para>

been recognised by the east midlands councils, the Derby, Derbyshire,
Nottingham and Nottinghamshire local enterprise partnership and the

the railway line to be upgraded. As the Minister knows, a strategy has
been developed between stakeholders and East Midlands Trains
progressively to upgrade the line at a modest cost. A train service has
been identified that gives increased frequency and faster journey times
by extending the hourly Matlock to Nottingham trains to Newark Castle,
with the hourly Leicester to Lincoln trains running non-stop between
Nottingham and Newark. I will return to that point in a

Hykeham and Newark, there would be a doubling in frequency and a
reduction in journey times. For Carlton, Burton Joyce and Fiskerton,
there would be a doubling of frequency, and for Bleasby, Thurgarton and
Rolleston an increase in frequency. I have no doubt that the points

want to add a few details from a Lincoln perspective, as we are
discussing the Lincoln-Nottingham corridor. The economic importance of
that corridor was recognised when, pre-1997, under a Conservative
Government, a dual carriageway was built between Newark and Lincoln, as
the hon. Gentleman mentioned. That has been extended all the way to
Nottingham in more recent years. It is of crucial economic importance.
We have road transport infrastructure but we would like the rail
infrastructure, all the way from Nottingham to Lincoln, to match
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012735000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140127/debtext/140127-0003.htm#14012735000075">When
I was lucky enough to have the honour and privilege of being elected
Member of Parliament for Lincoln, I inherited the only city in the
country that was unfortunate enough not to have a quick, fast, direct
route to London. That has been improved, but we have only one service
to London a day, and none at weekends. Unfortunately, we also had one
of the least frequent and slowest cross-country services, and that is
what we are tonight seeking to ensure that the Department for Transport
addresses.</hs_Para>

Lincoln-Newark-Nottingham service is well below the normal standard of
all comparable routes in all key respects—frequency, speed,
capacity and onward connections. Lincoln has only one train per hour to
its core city, Nottingham, whereas most similar places have two, three
or even four to theirs; I cite core cities such as Birmingham,
Manchester and Leeds as examples. Moreover, the Lincoln-Nottingham
service ran every half-hour until 2002, when half the trains were
withdrawn because of operational difficulties elsewhere on the rail
network, following the Hatfield crash. Those difficulties have long
since been overcome, but Lincoln-Nottingham is the only service reduced
in 2002 not to have been restored to former standards.</hs_Para>

trains that were withdrawn ran every hour directly between Lincoln and
Birmingham. When they were withdrawn in 2002, Lincoln and Newark not
only suffered a reduction in frequency, but lost their direct service
to Derby and Birmingham—a double whammy. The line is
characterised by out-of-date service levels on Sundays, when there are
no services from Nottingham to Lincoln before 4.30 pm, despite the
significant increase in leisure and commercial activity on Sundays in
recent years—a point alluded to by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T20:58:09"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Sherwood (Mr Spencer). That highlights just how far
services on the line have fallen below people’s expectations
today.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012735000078" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140127/debtext/140127-0003.htm#14012735000078">In
1912, fast Lincoln-Nottingham trains took 45 minutes; now
they take around 50 minutes because of speed limits, and many trains
take more than an hour because of extra stops. For the avoidance of any
doubt, it should be noted that the things that make the service
substandard are not the responsibility or fault of East Midlands
Trains. The service frequency is specified by the Department for
Transport, as is the stopping pattern that results in so few non-stop
trains. The speed limits are imposed by Network Rail because of the
characteristics of the infrastructure, and East Midlands Trains is
obliged to obey those speed limits. In fact, it is consistently one of
the most punctual train operators in England, with around 94% of trains
complying with required standards, but even an excellent operator such
as EMT cannot run a fast service on a line with very low speed limits,
especially if it is instructed by DFT that most trains must stop at
stations every few
miles.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012735000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140127/debtext/140127-0003.htm#14012735000079">There
are issues such as the at-grade crossing at Newark between the east
coast line and the cross-country line, and railway electrification,
which Lincoln, Newark and Nottingham would benefit from, if that was
forthcoming in future years. Lincoln and Nottingham are designated
housing growth points––an additional 60,000 houses are
planned over the next 20 years, 18,800 of them in Lincoln. Lincoln
university is one of the UK’s fastest-growing universities, with
a 40% increase in students planned for the next 10 years. A science
park of around 1 million square feet is being developed for spin-off
and related industries. Those are all reasons why we would like an
increased, better train service from Lincoln, Newark and
Nottingham.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="14012735000113" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140127/debtext/140127-0003.htm#14012735000113">8.59

that my hon. Friend raised have to be seen in the context of the wider
challenges for British railways and the way in which the Government are
tackling them. It is undoubtedly true that we face the challenges of
success. To support a growing economy and more jobs, we need to meet
increasing demand. Since privatisation, passenger numbers have doubled
and freight traffic has risen by 60%. In the next five years alone, we
expect a further 14% rise in passenger numbers and at least 4%,
possibly more, in freight. There is understandable frustration among
rail travellers, and we need to tackle the issues of congestion and
crowding.</hs_Para>

time, we need to tackle the wider challenge of deficit reduction, and
the rail industry, along with everyone else, has to play its part. We
need to deliver better value for money for the taxpayer and the fare
payer, and underlying costs must fall across the industry. To address
these and other challenges we are seeing the most significant rail
modernisation package for generations. Between 2014 and 2019, Network
Rail will invest over £16 billion in improving our railways,
having spent over £8 billion in the previous control
period.</hs_Para>

a number of projects that will directly benefit Nottinghamshire and
Lincolnshire. The £150 million Nottingham hub
resignalling and station redevelopment programme, which is nearing
completion, will improve reliability, reduce delays and create the
capacity to cope with increasing numbers of passengers. Electrification
of the midland main line, only guaranteed and delivered by this
Government, is currently limited to the route between London St Pancras
and Bedford, through to Nottingham, Derby and Sheffield, but it will
transform the rail route between London, the east midlands and
Yorkshire, offering reduced journey times, improved reliability and new
trains.</hs_Para>

will also benefit from the new “electric spine”—a
high-capacity electric rail freight route connecting the east midlands
with Southampton, making it much more attractive for firms to locate in
the east midlands and getting more freight off the road. There have
been renewals on the Doncaster-Lincoln-Peterborough line to improve
safety, capacity, journey times and performance, and there is a
£240 million fund for increases in capacity on the east coast
main line, which will bring benefits. That is all before the
introduction of new intercity express programme trains on that line,
which will transform the journey experience. In addition, from 2018,
completion of the Thameslink and Crossrail projects will significantly
improve connections from this region to Heathrow. The
Government’s rail investment strategy from 2014 to 2019 rightly
focuses on strategic priorities for the network, but it will benefit

the Government’s rail investment strategy rightly focuses on the
strategic priorities for the network but, in line with our localism
agenda, it is right that local and sub-regional bodies, which are best
placed to prioritise and fund investment for the needs of their areas
and to support local economies, should come forward with their
priorities. The rail industry did not identify the Lincoln-Nottingham
route as one on which investment is a strategic priority for 2014 to
2019, so it was not included as requiring enhancements in the strategy.
The strategy does however include funding for line speed improvements
across the network and for improvements to level crossings. There is
£300 million for journey time and performance improvements and
£65 million to reduce the risk of accidents at level 
<?notus-xml column=739?>crossings. Network Rail will spend that in locations where best value
for money can be attained. Decisions on the allocation of those funds
could be influenced by a local capital contribution and a local
assessment of need, which is usually headed up by local authorities and
local enterprise partnerships. That is my point: localism and local
authorities being able to influence and enhance the value of Network
Rail’s investment

it is for Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire county councils and the
LEPs—D2N2 and Greater Lincolnshire—to determine whether
investment and enhancement to services on this route to improve
connectivity and support local economies is a priority for their
strategic economic plans and should be included in a bid for funding to
the local growth fund. The Government have committed to putting
£2 billion per annum into the local growth fund from 2015-16 to
2020. Moreover, any subsidy requirement for the proposed additional
service on the line would also need to be funded by the promoter,
usually the local authorities, which would have to be in place for

hon. Friends the Members for Lincoln (Karl McCartney) and for Newark,
the Government have set out this position very clearly, both to
campaigners and to the local authorities concerned on a number of
occasions. I reiterate, as I did to both of them last week, that so far
the Department has received no comment from either Nottinghamshire
county council or Lincolnshire county council. We have not seen a
business case for the proposed investments and improvements. However,
we have made it clear to both Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire and the
LEPs that we are willing to provide guidance and strategic advice.
Neither of the two strategic enterprise partnerships has indicated that
the scheme is a priority, and without support from those bodies, I
regret to say that it is unlikely that much progress can be made in

which is that he has heard me say several times in my remarks that we
have encouraged the county councils, the LEPs and the strategic
economic partnerships on a number of occasions to make the case. The
Department has offered advice and guidance on how they might formulate
that case, but it has not been forthcoming. Therefore, to say that this
is oversight might be quite a big presumption. However, were it to be
an oversight, or even at this late stage, if those authorities chose to
decide that this is now a strategic priority for them—my hon.

bids for the local growth fund are due by 31 March this year. It is
still perfectly possible for local bodies to engage with Network Rail
and its partners in developing a business case for the proposed
enhancements and to put it forward for the local growth fund. Equally,
it is still possible for those local bodies to develop a business case
and put it forward as a priority for investment for the 2019 to 2024
control period. I recognise my hon. Friend’s ambition to have it
earlier, but none the less that would still be
possible.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012735000095" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140127/debtext/140127-0003.htm#14012735000095"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T21:10:41"></hs_TimeCode>My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T21:10:42"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Lincoln reviewed his hopes, and I suspect
those of Lincoln, for an increased through service between London and
Lincoln. I certainly recognise the appetite for more frequent direct
services between that city and London. I welcome the work on a business
case undertaken by Lincolnshire county council in 2012. As he will
know, I cannot commit at this stage to any additional services, mainly
because the Department is currently evaluating the business case and
the network impacts of running services to the locations not currently
served by the east coast main line. However, I can confirm that a
number of regions—Yorkshire, the north-east, the midlands and
the east of England, including Lincolnshire—are in that
evaluation and assessment process. Depending on the outcome of the
work, the invitation to tender for the east coast main line franchise
might include a requirement or an option for bidders to run services to
a specific number of

Government takes the issue of child safety online very seriously and
has engaged intensively with industry; as a result we have set out a
series of measures to help parents keep children safe online. The four
main ISPs have committed to giving their customers an easy way to
install family friendly filters that will protect all devices in the
home. These allow parents to prevent their children from accessing
potentially harmful content.</hs_Para>

replace the penstock valves and other equipment at Dock Bridge pumping
station was carried out in 2013. This project will help improve the
transfer of water from Main Drain to the Ribble Estuary in the area
east of Lytham, providing benefits to properties and agricultural land.
In winter 2012, Birks Watercourse and Main Drain to the east of Lytham
were de-silted by the Environment Agency at a cost of £110,000.
Further de-silting along a stretch of Liggard Brook in Lytham, costing
£25,000, will be taking place prior to April 2014. This will
help improve channel capacity and divert water away from properties in
the town of Lytham.</hs_Para>

are obliged under the Independent School Standards to follow statutory
guidance such as ‘Safeguarding Children and safer Recruitment in
Education’ and guidance that relates to the way in which
allegations of abuse are handled. There are also detailed requirements
on vetting checks for staff prior to recruitment. In addition, the
inspection and regulatory system is designed 
<?notus-xml column=396?>to ensure that schools do follow the guidance; if a school is inspected

industry to identify new markets for the products it makes. Obviously,
in the sector of defence, the Government will have a role in supporting
sales to like-minded allies, as well as determining where we would not
wish controlled goods to be sold. As part of this support, I discuss
export issues relating to Typhoon using cross Whitehall forums
including the National Security Council and its sub-groups and have
attended overseas events in support of British interests, including
exports. I look to UK Trade and Investment Defence and Security
Organisation (part of the Department for Business, Innovation and
Skills) to identify new markets in close co-operation with BAE Systems.
The Ministry of Defence will support these efforts as part of our wider

of airborne surveillance, CROWSNEST, entered the third element of its
assessment phase in March 2013. Work is currently under way to finalise
the Main Gate investment decision. The Royal Navy's airborne
surveillance is currently provided by the Sea King platform, 
<?notus-xml column=412?>which is due to be taken out of service in 2016. Until CROWSNEST enters
service, surveillance capability will be provided by other platforms

eliminate entirely the Royal Navy's organic gap in airborne early

considered different proposals to allow for more extensive use of RAF
Northolt for commercial air traffic that would otherwise use Heathrow
airport. However, the Commission concluded in its Interim Report,

benefits, and other impacts of the main elements of the proposed
regulation on the UK was published in November 2010. That impact
assessment drew on a contract study which identified significant
expected savings for the UK from the new regulation compared with the
earlier Biocidal Products directive. The expected savings resulted from
a more efficient system for authorising biocidal products for sale and
use across the EU and other improved conditions for UK companies in the
EU biocidal products market.</hs_Para>

adoption of the regulation in 2012 the costs and benefits were
recalculated to reflect the adopted text and later developments.

Environment Agency's draft technical guidance for onshore oil and gas
exploratory operations makes clear that operators should apply a
hierarchy of controls to ensure waste gas is first prevented, then
minimised and finally rendered harmless. The guidance makes clear that
the operators should initially consider installing an engine to burn
the gas and recover energy from it but that if this is not possible
then a flare may be used. Operators must be able to show that their
activities, including flaring during exploration, do not lead to
emissions at levels higher than those set out in their environmental

increased peace and security in the region. On its entry into force on
20 January, Iran halted key aspects of its nuclear programme and in
some places rolled it back in return for proportionate sanctions

ADR reports received by the MHRA, including reports of suicide related
events suspected to be associated with a medicine, are assessed as part
of the continual monitoring of the safety of all medicines in the UK.
This process is known as pharmacovigilance and enables identification
of previously unrecognised safety hazards. ADR reports are evaluated
alongside all other available data sources including formal safety
studies, the published medical literature, information from
pharmaceutical companies and other regulatory authorities throughout
the world together with information on the level of drug prescribing.
