for membership, or if we had applied for membership and the Government
and Parliament wanted to ascertain whether the electorate would support
a proposal to join the Union on terms that would have been negotiated
with the existing membership. Then the question for the electorate
would be whether they thought that we should forgo whatever might be
the advantages and disadvantages of not being members of the Union in
order to enjoy whatever might be the benefits and privileges of
membership, and incur whatever might be the liabilities and obligations
of becoming members.</hs_para>

This Bill is a disgrace; it is not fit for purpose. A senior official
of the Law Society of Scotland told me that he had never seen such a
badly drafted Bill. It has been hastily got together, and it shows. For
example, it has none of the schedules necessary for such a major
constitutional Bill. That is why it is only three pages long. We have
been accused of having tabled lots of amendments for what is only a
three-page Bill, but a normal constitutional Bill would have schedules
outlining how the referendum would be conducted and the rules of the
referendum. None of that is included in this Bill. It is a government
Bill trying to patch over divisions in the Tory party and trying to
outflank the UK Independence Party—which deserves to be
outflanked<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-24T10:13:09"></hs_TimeCode>, by

Quirk (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I have put down my name to two of
the amendments in this group but I shall be
brief—pedantic, but brief. Our verb “to be” is
highly irregular, drawing strands of form and meaning from four
different roots. They are represented in today’s English by, for
example, “is”, “are”, “was”
and “be” itself. I put this list before the House because
“be” is, as your Lordships know, always tinged with the
future. Indeed, as your Lordships will also know, “be” is
actually cognate with the word “future” itself. When
somebody calls out, “Please remain seated”, we know that
she accepts that we are all seated. By contrast, the injunction,
“Please be seated”, acknowledges that most of us are not.
So it was that when, as the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, has just reminded
us, the Electoral Commission was advising on this year’s
referendum in Scotland, it did not suggest that Scotland should remain
an independent country because, of course, it is not. Instead, it
recommended the wording, “Should Scotland be an independent
country?”. The Scottish Government sensibly accepted this
advice<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-24T10:25:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012442000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140124-0001.htm#14012442000032">When
this same Electoral Commission advised the promoters of the Bill before
us today, it saw, of course, that the boot was on the other foot. In
this case, it favoured the wording, “Should the UK remain in the
European Union?”, because we already are, and stoutly rejected
the wording, “Should the UK be a member?” because this
might imply to voters that we were not. It may seem absurd to suggest
that, after 40 years, any 
<?notus-xml column=858?>British voter might not know that we were a member
of the European Union. However, let us remember that we have a hostile
press and that successive semi-hostile, or at least semi-detached,
Governments have belittled, demonised or at any rate done their best to
ignore the EU and its relevance to British lives. It is not just the EU
itself, of course. Think how much better our school system would have
been if Governments over the past 40 or 50 years had bothered to notice
how much better they do things on the other side of the North

back to the present: at Second Reading, the noble Baroness, Lady

confusing the EU with the Council of Europe. She might well have added
that since 2000 there has been an even more dangerous source of
confusion—the existence of the eurozone. How many British voters

Lipsey (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I regret that I was not able to
participate in the Second Reading of this Bill, but I want to make one
very short preliminary point, coming to what I hope is a speech of
substance. I hope that all the speeches we will hear today will be
speeches of substance because we are not about some political game
here. We have a piece of legislation before us. It is our duty as a
House to scrutinise it and, if possible, improve it, and that is what
we are doing. We are not trying to overrule the House of Commons. Of
course, it can restore its Bill in its original format, as its
procedures allow. We are going through a process of
scrutiny<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-24T10:29:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

want to make the preliminary point that I do not do so as a
Euroenthusiast or Eurofanatic, as some of us have been branded in the
press. As a matter of fact, I voted no in the 1975 referendum and I
would expect—although I do not make that final judgment
now—to vote no in the referendum proposed under either this Bill
or more sensible legislation. I may well change my mind and, in any
case, it is unlikely to affect the result because Renwick’s
rule, named after Dr Alan Renwick of Reading University, shows clearly
that during a referendum campaign opinion in virtually every country in
the world and in virtually every case moves towards a no vote. The fact
that polls now suggest that people will vote to get out is no
indication of the likely result. So I would expect a no vote, but I may
be in the minority. I hope that noble Lords will feel that it is
acceptable to say that because I do not want us to be characterised in
a way that does not
fit<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-24T10:32:59"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-24T10:30:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

is with the substance of the Bill and the substance of the question.
First, questions really matter. I say that from a certain basis of
experience:  
<?notus-xml column=859?>I was adviser to a Prime Minister on polls; I used
to commission polls for the <I>Sunday Times</I>; I was on the advisory
committee of the National Centre for Social Research, which is the
outstanding opinion research body in the country; and I chair the
All-Party Parliamentary Group on Statistics. Results matter. I could
give all sorts of examples: polls on Europe are all over the place and
polls on the future of this House differ quite considerably. It is
difficult to follow exactly what the people of Scotland are saying in
polls on Scottish independence because different questions elicit
different answers. However, I want to give just one
example.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012442000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140124-0001.htm#14012442000038">Two
polls were conducted at roughly the same time on people’s views
on taxes and public spending. The first, by YouGov, was conducted for
the Taxpayers’ Alliance. The other, for the Fabian Society, was
also conducted by YouGov. However, the answers could not have been more
different. In the first poll, the question was: “Do you think
the Government spends too much and therefore taxes us too much, or is
the balance about right, or does it spend too little?”. The
result was: 50% said the Government tax too much; 16% said that the
balance was about right; 12% said they tax us too little. That seems to
be pretty decisive, until you read the Fabian Society poll, which
listed services. It asked: “Would you prefer tax rates and the
level of provision for each of the following services to rise or fall;
or is the balance right?”, and then listed the services. Nearly
60% said more should be spent on elderly care, even if it meant higher
taxes. The figure for the National Health Service was 50%, and on no
service listed was the majority in favour of tax cuts. That just shows
that the question you ask can matter. That is not a very subtle
example, but I could, if the House wanted to listen to me for
ever—which I suspect it does not—cite a lot more examples
in which subtle changes in wording can change the
outcome<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-24T10:32:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

in the Bill and the question recommended by the Electoral Commission.
If I were sponsoring the Bill, I would take comfort from the fact that
the commission had put forward its preferred question. For the life of
me, I cannot understand why the Bill has not been amended to include
that preferred question, but that is a matter for the mover, not for
me. The commission said that it found no evidence that its suggested
question resulted in research participants changing their vote in any
way. The wording used in this case was not shown to change the result.
I do not wish to criticise the Electoral Commission in any way for this
extremely difficult research, but I have examined it. It was
essentially based on focus groups and interviews with individual, small
groups of people who were asked to analyse the question. With
respect—and everyone in this House who knows about market
research and polling will agree with this proposition—you simply
cannot, must not, draw quantitative conclusions from qualitative
research. One does not follow the other.</hs_para>

is only one way in which to do a piece of research that might answer
the question before us, and that is to take two samples—one
asking the question put in the Bill of the noble Lord, Lord Dobbs, the
other asking the Electoral Commission’s question—and see
whether the results are the same. You probably would have to do this at
least two or three times 
<?notus-xml column=860?>because of sampling error and so on. Then you would
know whether the wording of the question made a difference. We do not
know whether the Electoral Commission’s wording would produce a
different result from the question of the noble Lord—it might or
it might not. What we do know is that between a question drafted by the
Electoral Commission, which deals with these matters very frequently
and is used to finding out the nuance of questions, and a question put
together by the tyros in Conservative Central Office who drafted the
Bill, there should be no choice for this House. The Electoral
Commission is the referee, and to begin the passage of the Bill by
rejecting the decision of the referee in favour of your personal whim

personal preference is not, as this group of amendments recommends,
that the question should require a yes or no answer but that it should
ask whether the UK should remain a member of the EU or leave the EU,
with a “remain or leave” option clearly put to the
electorate. The reason I say that is that when the Electoral Commission
conducted its research—in the way that the noble Lord, Lipsey,
might have found flawed, although I will not address his concerns at
this point—it discovered that significant numbers of the public
were confused as to whether we were members of the EU or members of the
eurozone, and indeed there were people who did not know that we were
members of the European Union. In the light of that, the committee
certainly suggests that the House should carefully consider whether it
is satisfied with the question and that it should do so in the spirit
of its obligation to carry out scrutiny and
revision<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-24T10:56:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Soley (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I want to make two or three short
points. They will be short because, at least in large part, the noble
Lord, Lord Kerr, has made one of the most important points—that
when the SNP drew up the question, we all, rightly, said no. We have 
<?notus-xml column=866?>the Electoral Commission to do this and it must set
the question. Notwithstanding some of the points made by the noble
Lord, Lord Forsyth, and others about views within and between political
parties, the principle of having an independent body to draw up the
question is an important one. Personally, I am not fond of referendums
at the best of times. They are usually invented in order to help
political parties get out of difficult situations. However, if we are
to have them—and I accept that they are now part of the
furniture of politics—it is very important that the question
should be drawn up independently. That is why, whichever question is
acceptable, it must be agreed or approved by the Electoral
Commission<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-24T10:57:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

another part of “Hamlet” it is said that he ought to be

think my noble friend Lord Lipsey put his finger on—that is, the

although not huge, minority—do not know whether we are a member

words, a no vote is saying, “I don’t want change”.
However, by voting no to this—I am sure that the noble Lord,
Lord Dobbs, knows this, having written “House of Cards”
so well; knowledge of the Whips’ Office is always a useful
experience, not to mention knowledge of No. 10—you will change

that the actual question will depend to some extent on the
circumstances that obtain at the date of the referendum. I do not

I have listened very carefully, and with respect, to the noble and

people to take on good faith what emerges from here and from Parliament
as a whole, surely he would support a better question? Secondly, why is
the date in the Bill not during the lifetime of the next Government,

beginning. I have very little difficulty with the question as
formulated by the noble Lord, Lord Armstrong, and would be perfectly
happy with it. However, I do not think it is a really definitive
question for the referendum itself because that would be much better

sensible and well reasoned and, especially, that the question asked is
fair and impartial. That is absolutely central to any referendum, as
any country anywhere around the world with experience of this shows.

Mackay of Clashfern:</Member></B> My Lords, in order to have an
enforceable entitlement, it is essential, as I see it, to have a
question that is related to the issue that you want to raise.
Essentially, the Bill is legislating to say, “There shall be a
referendum”. However, in order to be enforceable and to create a
real entitlement, it has to state the time within which the referendum
must happen, the question that must be raised, the mechanisms by which
a system can be set and who the electorate are. That is all necessary
in order to create an entitlement, but the entitlement does not mean
that the referendum is going to take place only in accordance with the
Bill. There is no question that this Bill binds any other Parliament
any more than any other Bill with a sunset clause in it. This Bill does
nothing except give that entitlement to the British people. If the Bill
passes, I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-24T11:25:16"></hs_TimeCode> shall

out his position repeatedly and carefully but there is one point where
I am unclear on it. Is he not aware that there is an entitlement,
called the European Union Act 2011, which creates a steadfast,
watertight provision that there will be a referendum should there be
any change and transfer of powers from the United Kingdom to the EU? It
does not even limit us to having that referendum by 2017. Should that

there has been no referendum, in spite of so many promises, is that
those who are in favour of the referendum do not think that they will
get the right answer in it. I do not believe that for a minute. If the
British people had a referendum on this subject at more or less any
time, but particularly after the next election, I think there would be
a resounding yes to staying in the European Union. I am a very firm
believer in the European Union, for reasons which I have given,
including the one that I was glad to hear the noble Lord, Lord Giddens,
mention at Second Reading—the peace that the arrangement has
brought to our continent since its inception. I used to hear that a lot
from senior Members of the House when I was first here. It is vitally

before the House is very direct and very simple. It is a choice between
the version of wording for the referendum preferred by the Electoral
Commission or the one that is contained in the draft. Even if the

a factual matrix; in other words, the fact of our current membership of
the European Union. Secondly, it shows clearly and concisely what the

there is the question of parentage. It comes from the Electoral

for a moment to the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, and the noble and learned

this: were the House of Lords to intervene, it would do so at its
peril. Some persons use that in a blackmailing way—I absolve
completely the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, and the noble and learned
Lord, Lord Mackay, from such an argument, but certain persons put it
forward in terrorem. Whether it be in terrorem or as a completely

loudly—that the function of this House was that we should
scrutinise a Bill, we should revise a Bill, we should examine it in
detail, we should send it back to the House of Commons if we thought it
was right, and we

do have those duties. They are not just rights but duties. If proposed
legislation comes before House of Lords, the House of Lords has a duty
to scrutinise it, particularly if it has not been done properly in the

simple: it is that the Electoral Commission, an independent body, has
looked at this issue and had some research done. It may be imperfect,
as the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, told us, but the general effect of all
that work by the Electoral Commission is that it has come up with a
proposal for a question that should be put in the referendum. It is a
question which on the Electoral Commission’s analysis is clear,
unambiguous, neutral and fair, and it should therefore be one which
this House should be prepared to include in the

the life of me, I do not understand the attitude on the other side. The

looked in the rows behind him at the moment that he said that he was
against that, he would have seen the faces of those whose predominant
passion as far as Europe is concerned seems to be that we should
withdraw. It is quite extraordinary that the people who are most

“to remain” to “to be”, we would

One would be that I was going slightly mad, perhaps showing the
advanced symptoms of Alzheimer’s; I can see some noble Lords who
have felt for years that I have had that. Alternatively, he would feel,
with reason, that I was being very disingenuous and slippery and that
he needed in future to be very cautious in his understanding of

with our European partners until after the next general

its wheels grind very slowly and there will be long and tortuous

I do not rule out the possibility—that somebody may conclude
that it is important to have the referendum well before 2017. A bad set

just how significant and broadly spread the support is. It is sometimes
a courtesy to refer to colleagues in this House as being very eminent,
conjuring that up as a turn of phrase, but if we look at the genuine
experience of those who have tabled the amendment and the significance
of the roles that they have played in this country, we can see just how
important it is to take their views with the greatest seriousness. It
is the basis of the Electoral Commission’s view. It is the basis

Dobbs:</Member></B> It is precisely that point which I am about to
address. If noble Lords would do me the courtesy of listening, they
might actually learn a little about what I feel about this, rather than
what the noble Lord, Lord Kinnock, feels about it. That is more time
wasted. I will get on to the time-wasting in just a minute, if noble
Lords will allow me.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14012442000202" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140124-0001.htm#14012442000202">As I was about to say,
the Electoral Commission had its reservations, of course, and we have
already heard much of that from noble Lords. However, I believe that
the commission’s concern that some voters might be confused,
because they are unaware that we are already members of the European
Union, is a little oversensitive. Yet the role of the commission is to
be cautious, and I do not criticise it for that. I understand that in
the past we have made a habit of accepting the commission’s
recommendations about any referendum question, but it is worth
remembering that its role in this matter is entirely advisory. It is
not an umpire or a judge but, as the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, has
just pointed out, a source of advice. At the end of the day, 
<?notus-xml column=887?>it is up to us. The other place debated almost this exact same amendment
as we are dealing with here and, after a lengthy debate, rejected it by
a majority of 241.</hs_para>

remembering that the commission was not able to offer a clear single
alternative question. It is hugely significant that this amendment,
which mirrors the second alternative suggested by the
commission’s report, has not been properly tested by the
commission; it clearly states in its report that it did not have time.
So it is entirely possible that if I accepted this amendment, the
commission might come back at a later stage and tell us that this
wording was not good enough either. That would put us in a most awkward
position and embarrass so much of what has already been said here
today.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14012442000204" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140124-0001.htm#14012442000204">At
Second Reading I mentioned other potential weaknesses in the
commission’s report. I do not want to go back over too much of
that ground but many noble Lords have expressed their concerns today.
It is perhaps a pity—I put it as no more than that—that
not a single Member of this House expressed any concern while the
Electoral Commission was undertaking consultation at a stage that might
have avoided the need for this amendment in the first place. Indeed,
only 19 individuals and organisations offered any comment whatever. If
this is a serious issue, it has been a long time coming.</hs_para>

life that currently 81 amendments have been tabled to this short Bill.
We know that some of the Bill’s opponents are determined to use
any means to kill it. While I want to make progress, I hope that the
House will allow me a moment to deal with that central issue because it
gives a context to all else that we do here. Right from the start, the
moment that the Bill came to this House, it has been true that, as the
noble Lord, Lord Tyler, who sadly I do not see in his seat, told the
BBC—and I am grateful for his frankness about this—that
the opponents will use every trick in the book to derail it. It was put
to him in an interview by Mr Mark D’Arcy that the aim would be
to keep this Bill running in one form or another pretty much right up
to the election. The noble Lord replied: “What they do not want
to do, I do not think anyone wants to do, is to have their fingerprints
on the dagger that kills it”. There we have it—death by a
thousand cuts, or at least by 81 amendments, and that is what
undermines the rights of this
House<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-24T12:23:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012442000206" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140124-0001.htm#14012442000206">I
hasten to add that I am not accusing the sponsors of this amendment of
any hint of deviousness. Many of them have made their points with charm
and eloquence, as we would expect them to. However, we all know what is
going on. We cannot deny the presence of an elephant in the room, a
very large and unreasonable elephant—those who have no intention
whatever of working to improve the Bill but who are solely intent on
trying to kill it. They claim to be trying to improve the question but
in fact are trying to ensure that no question is ever put.</hs_para>

Bill is to survive—if we are to give people the referendum they
want—we have to get the Bill through this House in reasonable
shape and in very short time. That timetable is not mine; it is simply
another fact of life. It is a further fact that after 
<?notus-xml column=888?>six days of detailed consideration, the Bill went through the other
place at every stage with a huge majority or no opposition whatever. We
could all speculate why Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs ran for cover,
but the fact is that they did. So, in the belief that what was good
enough for Labour and Liberal Democrat geese down the other end of the
Palace must surely be more than enough to satisfy their noble ganders,
I ask the noble Lord, who is not party to any of these games, to
withdraw his
amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-24T12:24:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Armstrong of Ilminster:</Member></B> My Lords, my modest, innocent
little amendment has given rise to a long, interesting and wide-ranging
debate, and after more than two hours I do not propose to try to deal
with every point. We are being told that the Bill must pass unamended
to go back to the House of Commons in order to be concluded in time to
be passed into legislation in this Session. As to that, although I am
not an expert in procedure, it seems that if the House of Commons is
sufficiently keen to see the Bill passed, it can change its procedure
as a matter of exception in order to deal with it. I therefore hope
that your Lordships will not be put off by that threat.</hs_para>

are told that the Bill is a necessity as a guarantee or, as the noble
and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, said, an assurance that there will an
“in or out” referendum about our membership of the
European Union in 2017. With the greatest respect to those who are
saying so, I cannot see it. It is impossible for this Parliament to
give a cast-iron guarantee or assurance about something that is going
to happen after the next election. Suppose that in May 2015, after the
next election, there were to be a change of Government and the new
Government decided that there should not be a referendum on this
matter. The new Government would be free to introduce legislation in
the House of Commons to give effect to that decision; the House of
Commons would pass it; and then it would come back to this House, and
no doubt we should be told that an unelected House ought not to
challenge the view of the House of Commons.</hs_para>

am with those who feel that we should not shirk our duty to scrutinise
the Bill and, if we can, improve it, and that, with the greatest
respect to the House of Commons, if that House feels that the Bill is
so important, it should then adjust its procedures in order to deal
with it. I do not think that the Bill provides the kind of guarantee or
assurance that we shall have a referendum, because no one can know what
will happen in 2015. If it is a guarantee at all, it is so only
until May of that year. In fact, the best assurance that the people of
Britain can have that there should be a referendum will be the
commitment by the present Prime Minister to hold a referendum in 2017.
As I said at Second Reading, that is a commitment that he can enshrine
in a manifesto. No doubt the manifesto does not have the force of a
statute, but at least its shadow stretches beyond the next election and
would govern what the new Parliament did. I might almost argue, if I
allowed myself to be political, that if the British people thought it
so vital to have a referendum, as I am sure they do, their best means
of assuring themselves of getting it would be to return Mr Cameron, who
has given them this
commitment<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-24T12:29:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

question. We do not know what the outcome of the referendum in Scotland
will be. Therefore, in passing legislation to deal with the period
through to the end of 2017, which is not only after the Scottish
referendum but, if there were a yes vote, also after the fulfilment of
independence for Scotland, it would mean that the United Kingdom was a
very different entity from the one it is now. That must surely be taken

circumstances when a referendum is needed. If a referendum is going to
be meaningful, clearly the definition of the units—of the people
who are taking part—has to be clear; it has to be determined.
Therefore, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Dobbs, who is in charge of

possibility of a yes vote in Scotland.</hs_para>

may well be that the opinion polls at present say that it is likely to
be a no vote, and I think we all recognise that. However, I think we
also recognise that a week is a long time in politics. One cannot rule
out the possibility of a yes vote. Therefore, we need to have some
provision that deals with it. There are implications in terms of the
voting and negotiations that may need to take place between the United
Kingdom and the European Union for any new deal that may be the basis
of a referendum in 2017, and that has to be thought through. I get the
impression that the drafters of the Bill just have not thought of the

Triesman:</Member></B> My Lords, this is a helpful amendment, and I
have only one very brief comment to make. We have had a number of
proposals coming through this and the other House over a period of time
that have changed our unwritten constitution in quite significant ways.
It is very difficult to know how they all mesh together, because they
are almost never spoken of in terms of taking a helicopter view of the
whole set of proposals. That probably leads towards the laws of
unintended consequences on occasions because we do not have a holistic
view. It would be incredibly hard before the Scottish referendum,
allowing for one of the possible outcomes of that referendum, to make
any intelligent decisions in this area. I do not think that we would be
thanked by the people of Scotland, as it might very well be that they
would feel that it took an element of their choice away from them, in
the full sense of a choice about their future in Europe, in relation to
the currency, and so on. It is a very sensible proposal, and I hope
that the House will give it proper
consideration<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-24T12:50:34"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-24T12:50:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012442000220" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140124-0001.htm#14012442000220"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Dobbs" PimsId="5884" UID="14012442001379" xid="2098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140124-0001.htm#14012442001379">Lord
Dobbs:</Member></B> My Lords, dates are very difficult, are they not?
We have this particular amendment, which talks about October 2014, and
other amendments that suggest 2020. We have talked about the Scottish
referendum, yet at other times in debates on the Bill we have heard
that we cannot have this or that date because of what is going on in
Germany, Brussels, and so forth. Dates are difficult, and I acknowledge
that. There is no ideal date; it is a bit like trying to find the right
time to suggest that your wife should start a diet. There is never
going to be a right time for that, which is
why<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-24T12:51:21"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-24T12:50:32"></hs_TimeCode>—</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012442000221" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140124-0001.htm#14012442000221"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Radice" PimsId="283" UID="14012442001380" xid="1651" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140124-0001.htm#14012442001380">Lord

that. That is why the date in this Bill is very flexible. The Bill says
that the referendum must be held 
<?notus-xml column=894?>any time up until the last day of 2017. As the noble and learned Lord,
Lord Mackay, has spent so much time instructing us, this is not the

than hypotheses, and the Prime Minister has already said that he needs
this time to undertake the fundamental renegotiation that is behind all
this. That is why he is going to campaign at that referendum on the
basis of staying in, not getting out. He has already started that
process of renegotiation, which will take time. There is no chance, in
the practical, real world, that we could encounter a situation in which
this referendum would be begun before the date that the noble Lord

amendment and on Second Reading, everyone was clear about the
importance of the decision which the British people would be taking in
such a referendum. If the British people are to take such a decision,
they need to take it with the necessary knowledge before them.

74 suggests that it is necessary to provide the electorate with

impact on the UK economy of the UK ceasing to be a member. I was
encouraged to read in the press this morning of the speech which the
Permanent Secretary to the Treasury, Sir Nicholas Macpherson, made to
the Mile End Group earlier this week, in which he pointed out that the
Treasury would certainly provide information on what it considered to
be the negative impact of the UK leaving the European Union. In recent
weeks we have seen the information which bodies such as the British
Bankers’ Association and other banks based in the United Kingdom
have submitted to the Treasury as part of the balance of competences

we believe that a report ought to be produced showing the impact of the
UK leaving the European Union on the rights of individuals within the
United Kingdom. Individuals, our fellow citizens, at the moment have
various rights as part of our membership of the European Union,

free movement of labour, as well as other rights. Those, again, would

successful firms such as Nissan exporting to the EU. The people who
work in those firms will be concerned to make sure that their future

interesting that in consideration of this Bill I, and I am sure other

Personally, I believe the eurozone will survive but this is by no means

amendment. That is because, of course, the only argument put by the
other side was not against the last amendment—or only a very
weak argument was made against it—but that we must not amend the
Bill. The fact is that it has been amended, so now we can look
seriously at it and try to improve it. This is one area in which we can

that before the 1975 referendum complaints were made by both sides,
particularly by the no side, that all the information had been supplied
by the Government and that that was unfair. There is a case to be made
for some kind of hard-headed and objective assessment on which we can
make our choice about whether to stay in or come out. I rather agreed
with the noble Lord, Lord Roper, when he said that the assessment
should not necessarily be done by the Government themselves because
that was precisely the argument in 1975: the information was not to be
trusted because the Government were pro-European and therefore it
should have been provided by someone else. The suggestion that the
Office for Budget Responsibility might be the body to do the work is a
good one. I therefore support the noble Lord, Lord Roper, who I hope I
can call my noble friend, which he certainly is because I have known
him for 50 years, and I hope that in doing so I have done my duty to
him and, indeed, to the argument for improving this

Wigley:</Member></B> My Lords, I will speak briefly to support the
amendment put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Roper. I believe that the
provisions of this pair of amendments are absolutely fundamental to
holding any meaningful referendum. Unless the implications of a
change—and, indeed, the implications of staying in—are
spelt out quite clearly, how are the public to be in a position to make
an informed judgment? If we believe in referenda—I indicated
earlier that there are circumstances in which I do—it is
absolutely essential that we have this sort of provision. We have had a
number of referenda in Wales; the noble Lord, 
<?notus-xml column=902?>Lord Anderson, referred a moment ago to the
referendum on opening or closing pubs on Sundays. There was also the
1979 referendum, which the noble Lord, Lord Kinnock, will remember very
well as he left me with some bloody noses on that occasion. There was
one in 1997 and a subsequent one in 2011. In each, it was necessary to
spell out the implications of what was taking place. As far as we in
Wales are concerned, there would be far-reaching effects, on two
sectors in
particular<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-24T13:26:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012442000270" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140124-0002.htm#14012442000270">The
noble Lord, Lord Anderson, referred to the importance of the Japanese
manufacturing sector in Wales and the excellent work that was
undertaken by the Welsh Development Agency in attracting more than 50
Japanese companies to Wales. Companies in Japan and Wales have
indicated their concern if their strategy of locating their
manufacturing capacity in the UK in order to sell to the European
market was to be undermined by a change of this sort. The implications
of pulling out of the European Union certainly need to be spelt out in
those terms<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-24T13:26:39"></hs_TimeCode>. In
Wales, we have one very significant manufacturer, Toyota, on Deeside.
If anything was to undermine that, it would be a body blow. We also
have British Aerospace on Deeside, which works very closely with
European partners. There would be immensely damaging implications for
the company and the 7,000 or 8,000 jobs in north-east Wales. That needs
to be spelt out so voters in the area

other sector that would be affected is the agricultural sector, where
up to 80% of income is now related to activity on which the European
Union has a bearing. My friends in rural Wales in the farming
fraternity most certainly have great fears—those, too, need to
be spelt out for residents in rural Wales who may not be farmers
themselves but will need to know the effect on their community if the
main industry in the area is undermined. For those reasons I support

Foulkes of Cumnock:</Member></B> My Lords, I will say a very few words
in support of the excellent amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Roper.
First, I underline what my noble friend Lady Quin said at the start and
what was repeated by the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, and my noble friend
Lord Radice. The noble Lord, Lord Dobbs, finds himself in new territory
now, which I am sure he will welcome. The fact that one amendment has
been passed means that he is free, at last, to exercise the discretion
that I know he has. If I may say so modestly, I think that he would
increase his stature greatly if he now exercised that discretion from
time to time. It will not delay the Bill any further,
undermine it in any way or create problems with the House of
Commons—it is not going to create any problems. Knowing him
well, admiring him and respecting him, and having had a number of
conversations with him, I hope that he will see himself as free
to accept this amendment and, perhaps, some later amendments. That
would go a long way to legitimising his position, and that of the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012442000273" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140124-0002.htm#14012442000273">I was
very pleased that the noble Lord, Lord Roper, said that his amendment

42C, 42D and 42E, which relate to reports by the Secretary 
<?notus-xml column=903?>of State on the transfer of powers, the negotiations
and the competencies. It is also complementary to the excellent
amendment that my noble friend Lord Lipsey put forward and which I have

Scottish referendum. Those of us from Scotland are beginning to think

referendum is that we have not been provided with information. We have
had assessment after assessment by each of the departments of the
United Kingdom Government, and there are more to come; we have had the
so-called White Paper, <I>Scotland’s Future</I>, from the
Scottish Government; we have had the no campaign arguing its case,
Better Together; we have had think-tanks galore; and there will be more
over the next few months until 18 September. If and when it comes, this
European Union referendum will be no less momentous than the Scottish
referendum.</hs_para><hs_time UID="14012442000503" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140124-0002.htm#14012442000503">1.30

number of Members have made the point about the effect on industry. My
noble friend Lord Wigley mentioned agriculture. I also hope that the
impact assessment will look at the environment and environmental
legislation. So many environmental matters deal with Europe and, as we
have heard so many times, there are no boundaries to pollution. There
are problems in relation to the environment that the EU deals with that
we should have a report on. There is also the social chapter: so much
in terms of health and safety, workers’ rights and everything
else that concerns me and my party so greatly has been a matter of
discussion, debate and improvement within and by the European Union. I
hope that the report will cover that as
well.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012442000276" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140124-0002.htm#14012442000276">For all

the noble Lord, Lord Roper. The analogy with 1975 is interesting. As
the noble Lord, Lord Dobbs, has reminded us again and again, the House
of Lords passed without difficulty the Bill for the referendum. Of
course, the difference was that the governing party had had in its
election manifesto a commitment to having a referendum, and the
renegotiation was taking place; it had taken place by the end. It was
not a future renegotiation and a referendum in another Parliament; it
was a referendum in the here and now. It was completely uncontroversial

a dose of
salts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012442000278" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140124-0002.htm#14012442000278">That
was a totally different situation from the one we face with the Bill in
the name of the noble Lord, Lord Dobbs. In 1975 there was a public
information campaign in a very narrow sense. There was in Whitehall a
referendum information unit, staffed partly from public service, partly
from outside, which provided— 
<?notus-xml column=904?>genuinely impartially—information to the two
campaigns, and the campaigns made what use they wished of it. There was
very little direct communication by the Government with the

fought on a number of issues but that was one of them. The public were
pretty familiar with the issues. People who have for a generation and a

Liddle (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, on this side of the House, we
regard this as a significant amendment. Given that the House has
decided by an overwhelming majority that the Bill is amendable, we very
much hope that the noble Lord, Lord Dobbs, will consider it
favourably. It is a serious attempt on our side to improve the
referendum proposal and make an independent impact assessment a vital
condition before a referendum can properly proceed. We want rational,
independent consideration of the costs and benefits of our EU
membership and of the alternatives to it. The amendment is, we hope, a
way to facilitate that rational consideration of the issues at
stake<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-24T13:46:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012442000292" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140124-0002.htm#14012442000292">Why
is it important to look at alternatives? Those of us who have spent a
lot of our lives in politics know that opinion polls do not always give
a very accurate reading of what is likely to happen at a general
election. You can often be miles ahead, but the result at a general
election can be very different. Why is that? It is a point of key
relevance to the Europe debate. It is because, in the mid-term of any
Government, people are simply thinking about what they think of the
Government. It is only when they get to the election that they start
thinking about it as a choice between the Government of the day and the
Opposition. If we are to have a sensible debate about the European
Union, it is vital that people do not just see it as expressing an
opinion in a poll in a TV reality show about what they think of
Brussels, the Commission, the European Parliament and all the rest,
where we know what the result would be, but that they think 
<?notus-xml column=907?>about what are the alternatives to our present EU
membership. They need to be explored independently and
objectively<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-24T13:48:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012442000293" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140124-0002.htm#14012442000293">A
recent attempt to do this was in the CBI’s report, <I>Our Global
Future</I>. That is on the economics. The CBI came to the conclusion
that no alternative option to full EU membership can combine all the
benefits of EU membership with none of the costs. I shall not risk
being accused of wasting the House’s time by reading out the
report, but it went through in meticulous detail all the different
options, such as the so-called WTO option, becoming a member of the
EEA, the Swiss option, or having some kind of free trade agreement with
the European Union. It went through all the options. Those options need
to be explored properly. That was the point that the noble Lord, Lord
Turnbull, was driving at. We cannot have a sensible discussion in a
referendum on our EU membership without the Government saying what they
would do if the people voted to come out, because it is only in those
circumstances that people can make a proper choice. That is one of the
reasons why we support this.</hs_para>

emphasise that this is not only a matter of economic and social costs
and benefits. It is also about the rights of citizens, particularly our
citizens living presently in other member states of the European Union,
and how a withdrawal would affect their position. It is also about our
security. The present Government have just been through a huge exercise
on the JHA opt-out and have decided that it is essential to
Britain’s security that we opt in to certain of these measures.
They know that if we were not part of those measures, senior figures in
the police force and in the intelligence services would have very
serious doubts about government policy. We need to look at the whole
range of issues to do with our EU membership.</hs_para>

objectively and properly. If we are to have a fair debate, that is
absolutely essential. We all know that large sections of the press are

British press on this issue, where you have the <I>Mail</I>, the

I said at Second Reading. I said that the Bill was not about being
pro-European or anti-European but about being pro-democracy. The noble
Lord raised a number of issues about the people being informed and I
agree with him. One of the 
<?notus-xml column=908?>positions that the Government have taken in relation
to the balance of competences review has been on having an independent
review of each individual area, where organisations and individuals are
given the opportunity to give evidence, and for those reports to be

European Union helps and where it
hinders.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012442000298" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140124-0002.htm#14012442000298">Such
a referendum will generate a huge amount of interest and a great deal
of campaigning. I think of my own experience of campaigning during the
AV referendum. It becomes apparent as the referendum date comes nearer
that the campaign steps up and a huge amount of discussion takes place.
Members of this House and of the other House will have the opportunity
to have their say. Business will have its say, NGOs will have their say
and both sides of the case will be put. I am convinced that when this
referendum is eventually held, the yes campaign and the no campaign
will have long and detailed campaigns which will allow the British
public to hear both the case for and the case against. This is an
opportunity to allow that debate and those campaigns to start, and to
allow the British people to have their say. There is overwhelming
evidence that a referendum is what the people of this

objective information on these critical matters. Given the time, I hope
noble Lords will forgive me if I do not go into detail on all the
points raised, although I think that the agenda which the noble Lord,
Lord Kinnock, proposed is probably rather more than the one
which I was thinking of, but there are obviously other ways in
which these other matters can be dealt with.</hs_para>

point made by the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, on environmental matters
and the social chapter spelled out some of the things which were
already included. I hope that the House understands very clearly the
distinction between the objective analysis which we are putting forward
in this set of amendments and the other matters which are put forward
in other amendments to which we will be returning
later.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012442000315" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140124-0002.htm#14012442000315">In view
of the support from all parts of the House, I was very disappointed
that the noble Lord, Lord Dobbs, the promoter of this Bill, having said
that he agrees with it, feels that it is not necessary to have it in
the Bill. That is an argument one often gets as far as amendments are
concerned. It is, of course, no longer possible to say that we must not
have any amendments because we already have one, and having got one,
the arguments against this one seem much reduced. On that basis, I wish
to test the opinion of the House.</hs_para>

Second Reading, in my usual low-key, modest, respectable, Cross-Bencher
way, I touched on the reasons why I, as a negotiator, thought it unwise
to put our negotiators in the forthcoming renegotiation under time
pressure by locking them into a 2017 requirement for the successful
completion of a renegotiation, which it seems that we will not start
until 2015.

am struck by the fact that we do not know what it is that we will be
renegotiating. We do not know what we want. The noble Lord, Lord Owen,
had a point at Second Reading when he suggested that we should start
now trying to win friends and influence people on whatever it is we
want to achieve. I rather agree, but we do not know what we want to
achieve. We have seen three or four hints in recent weeks. We have been
told that we may want to scrap free movement of persons, in Article 3
of the treaty, or to have the EU drop its Charter of Fundamental
Rights, in Article 6 of the treaty, and resile from the European
Convention on Human

may want to roll back EU competence in labour and social law and change
the single market rules to give Whitehall a veto on EU laws on

for the foreigners is, “Reform or we leave”. All that
sounds quite big stuff, involving fairly fundamental issues. Putting it
as mildly as I can, I warn the House that all that would take time.

second stage of the process of amending the treaty is the calling of a
convention. The last and only convention so far lasted for just over 18
months. The convention has to end up with consensus. The next stage is
an intergovernmental conference in which one needs the unanimous
agreement of every other member state to one’s propositions.
Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. The final stage would be
ratification of the outcome. If it involved treaty amendment, the
changed treaties would require new national ratification in every
member state’s capital. I assume that before we have the
referendum, we would want to know, and be able to tell the country,
whether the renegotiation deal had stuck and had been accepted in other
member states. A very awkward and complex situation would arise if you
had a referendum on the assumption that the renegotiation deal would be
ratified everywhere, and that turned out not to be the
case<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-24T14:20:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

four stages until after an election in 2015. It does not add up. The
first stage, the bilateral diplomacy, we do not appear to be doing. We
do not appear to be collecting the 14 friends to get past the first
hurdle. As to the second stage, the convention, I do not know how long
it would take. It might take much less than the 18 months taken last
time, but it is a finite hurdle to get over and it will take time. As
to the third stage, the intergovernmental conference, Maastricht took a
year. This one might take less but, on the other hand, it sounds as if
the propositions that the Conservative Party envisages bringing forward
are rather fundamental. Finally, as to ratification in 2017, one would
be asking the French and the Germans in their election years to agree
with the British on, say, restraining free movement of persons, taking
human rights out of the treaty, exempting the British from social law
or giving them a veto on financial law. You would be seeking agreement
on that in the year in which a French Socialist President was seeking
re-election, and a German Government who strongly believe in human
rights would be facing the

not bother with renegotiation, that is fine. Why not? However, the
Conservative Party’s position, as clearly explained in the Prime
Minister’s Bloomberg speech—in which, by the way, he was
speaking explicitly as leader of the Conservative Party, not as Prime
Minister—was that he hoped to renegotiate a different
relationship with Europe, put it to a referendum and recommend that we
stay in the European Union. I am just saying that that timetable does

affects the first line of this Bill that says that there shall be a
referendum. This amendment concerns only whether it is wise to set in
the Bill the end date by which time the referendum must have been held.
That is my sole point. I have heard no rationale for the 2017 date. I
look forward to the explanation of his rationale from the noble Lord,
Lord Dobbs. It will not be sufficient for me to hear that the Prime
Minister said in the Bloomberg speech that it would be by the end of
2017. He said the first half of the Parliament. That would not be a
sufficient rationale for me because it was not put in advance through
the political process and raised in Parliament and is not, as I
understand it, government policy. It is the policy of the Conservative 
<?notus-xml column=916?>Party, just as the Bloomberg speech was the policy of the Conservative
Party. If we have to have a date in the Bill and it has to be the end
of 2017, please tell us why. I can think of only one reason and I am
not of a suspicious mind. If you wanted a referendum to produce the
result that the UK leaves the European Union, you could not pick a
better time. You are saying that the Government must bring their
renegotiation to a head in what must be, because of the French and
German elections, absolutely the worst year to do it. You are saying
that they have to try to cut corners and accelerate the timetable,
which the European Union will want to follow. You are maximising the
chances that they lose friends, fail to influence people and do not get
the renegotiation objectives they have in

we think that the principle of the European Union is right—then
the early dates we have suggested in Amendments 13 and 14 of 22 May
2014 and 15 May 2015 would be ideal. One is the date of the

better. As others said earlier, we still do not know exactly what the

will not repeat what the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, said, based on his own
experience, about the unreality of the date. For referenda, the key
determinants are who asks the question and, if it is the Government, in
part, on their popularity at the time. In Wales in 1979, the devolution
package was voted down massively by the people, four to one, because it
was put forward by a highly unpopular Labour Government at the fag-end
of their period. By contrast, the devolution referendum in 1997 was
passed, just, after being put forward by a very popular Labour
Government which had a substantial mandate. It depends who puts forward
the question and when. The people of Sweden, for example, were
consistently against joining the European Union, but a very small
window of opportunity opened, which happened to coincide with when the
referendum took place, and the people of Sweden chose, then, to
enter the European Union. It is very much a hit-or-miss
matter.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012442000365" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140124-0002.htm#14012442000365">My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-24T14:49:38"></hs_TimeCode>
starting proposition is that this is an arbitrary date. In fact, as the
noble Lord, Lord Kerr, said, there could probably not have been a worse
date in terms of the concerns of the chief negotiating
partners—the French and, at that stage, the Germans—along
with the added complexity of the British six-month presidency in the
latter half of that year. There can be no serious rationale for that
particular date<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-24T14:46:54"></hs_TimeCode>.
It is most unlikely that any time before that date will be suitable,
for the reasons which the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, has set out: the
complexity of the negotiations and the crabbed way in which the
European Union sets about negotiations. If it is unlikely that one will
reach a determination by 2017, why the hurry? One is bound to ask what
their motive is.</hs_para>

when I attributed a particular good story, which I have lived on for 10
years, to

me and said it was Talleyrand who made that particular point. I defer

looking at the French liberal aristocrats who were flirting with
revolution just before 1789, said, “Those who are blowing upon

commend to the House an interesting article in the <I>Financial
Times</I> of 14 January by Mr Janan Ganesh, who is normally a
Conservative supporter. He said that there were three motives behind
the timing in the current referendum Bill: first, that it would placate
Tory Members of Parliament; secondly, that it would help with UKIP; and
thirdly, that it would put the European question “to
sleep” until after the general election. He went on to argue
that they had massively failed in every one of these objectives and
that there was no way in which the Tory right—the Tea Party
tendency—had been
placated.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012442000368" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140124-0002.htm#14012442000368">Indeed,

they would say, “That’s enough”; but no, they
swallow them down and ask for more. They have exposed their real
motives. He has not put off UKIP, which seems to be doing pretty well
in the polls. He has not put the European question to sleep until the

Romanians and the Bulgarians; the Czechs, who have now changed their

up on that. He now speaks about us being part of the reform of the
European Union. The problem that arises, as far as renegotiation is
concerned—to repatriate powers or whatever else the

to be part of the process of reforming the European Union. If the aim
of the Conservative part of the Government is to clog up the works,
which is what the effect will be, with a long string of requests for
repatriation of powers, we will have a very poor reception and they

noble Lord, Lord Kerr, who spoke with authority and considerable
experience in moving this amendment. I believe that the statutory
imposition of a 2017 deadline threatens our entire strategy for
securing Britain’s future in a reformed European Union.
Moreover, this part of the Bill as it now stands undermines and
contradicts some of the assurances given by the Prime Minister and the
Foreign Secretary in previous statements. Not long ago, both those
Ministers argued the case for realism, but, regrettably to me, they
have played politics with it ever since. Yet theirs was the correct
strategy before they wilted under fire. This amendment restores their
original logic. More importantly for me, it restores Britain’s

allows for proper negotiation and provides us with a good chance of
success. Do the Bill’s supporters really believe that a binding

amendment and shall support this one, not because I wish to cut across
the House of Commons or deny the British people the vote but because I

Kinnock:</Member></B> My Lords, the only reason we have the Bill, and
certainly the only reason that we have a Bill with a deadline, is the
repeated failed attempts by the Prime Minister to mollify and pacify
the euro-secessionists within the Conservative Party.
Because of the risks, speculation and difficulty to which it
subjects our country unnecessarily, I think that it is the most
fruitless and most dangerous appeasement since

use those quotations to illustrate the complexity and the need for
co-operation with European partners to make any significant progress on
the kind of negotiation that the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of

think that that summarises fairly the approach to be taken in the event
of the Prime Minister being engaged in that new settlement. That would
make the whole process very fragile. The date, which is the subject of
our debate now, makes it even more fragile. Why is that? Because the
specification of the date of December 2017 means that the furthest
possible realistic date to honour the undertakings of the Bill, by
which negotiations would have to be concluded, would be, let us say,
October 2017, 17 months after a general election in which the
Conservative Party hopes to be victorious. It gets even more complex
because, just underneath the provision relating to 31 December 2017 is
the date of 31 December 2016 as the date by which the date for the
referendum must be appointed by the
Government.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012442000389" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140124-0002.htm#14012442000389">Do
people really believe that after the date of the referendum has been
specified in December 2016, we can expect our partners in
Europe—despite their distractions, which the noble Lord, Lord
Kerr, has properly pointed out, with their acute domestic questions
relating to their general elections—to whom the Prime Minister
has appealed for patience, to stick with us when they know very well
that we are facing a deadline of a maximum of 12 months, during which
time the referendum must be held after the date has been
appointed<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-24T15:09:16"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012442000390" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140124-0002.htm#14012442000390">That
brings me to my final point. I think that noble Lords will recognise it
to be a practical point because, with the galaxy and diversity of
talents and experience in this place, there is any amount of
acquaintance with negotiation. Probably everyone in this House has done
it, in one way or another, whether as a trade unionist, an employer, a
politician, a civil servant, a manager or a parent. We have all engaged
in negotiations and I suppose that there are a couple of basic golden
rules about them.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14012442000391" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140124-0002.htm#14012442000391">The first rule is that
you signify a deadline for the conclusion of negotiations only if that
deadline can be one of your weapons—for example, “If we
do not finish this deal by next Tuesday night, the deal’s off
the table”, or, “If you don’t make the deal by
next Tuesday night, we’re having a ballot and going out on 
<?notus-xml column=926?>strike”. So you use a deadline to influence the negotiations
themselves, but only when you are a participant in negotiations and
have sanctions. You can negotiate with your children, if you have a
more democratic parental relationship than my children tell me I had in
their upbringing, because there can be a withdrawal of privileges and a
denial of this, that and the other, simply because they have not kept
to their side of the bargain. That is part of growing up and of being a
parent. You can do the same thing as an employer or a trade unionist,
or any form of negotiator using sanctions to try to uphold the deadline
and secure your objective.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14012442000392" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140124-0002.htm#14012442000392">What sanctions are in
the hand or pocket, or the red box, of any member or putative member of
a future British Government who have set themselves a deadline to
negotiate a complex and comprehensive new settlement with the rest of
the European Union, a prominent feature of which is our implacable
right to continue to operate with full privileges and obligations in
the single market, if we expect them to be willing to endorse that and
give us our way in the name of reform? The reform objective is decent
and very supportable. I have been working and campaigning on reform of
the European Union in a variety of ways for a very long time past, so I
support the objective of reform. However, what reforms can you
undertake while ensuring that they are copper-bottomed, secured in
negotiation and adopted as policy, or even as treaty amendments, if you
are working against a deadline? In this case, there are no realistic
sanctions to be employed against those who will not bear with us,
negotiate in good part and come to a conclusion according to the
timetable set down in the Bill.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14012442000393" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140124-0002.htm#14012442000393">The reality—is
it not?—is that you never set a deadline unless you can enforce
it and use it as a weapon of negotiation. If you make a
deadline in any other circumstances, the calendar and the clock will do
your opponents’ work for them—or at least, not your
opponents but your partners in negotiation. It is easy to make the
error sometimes and I have been known to slip into it very occasionally
myself. I ask the noble Lord, Lord Dobbs, to consider whether even his
objective of securing this legislation to facilitate a referendum is
really served by having an explicit deadline in the Bill. It is a
deadline that takes no notice of the objective realities of our
politics and other peoples’ politics, as the noble Lord, Lord
Kerr, so forcefully pointed out. That is evidenced by any knowledge at
all of the conduct of political and constitutional affairs in the
European Union. A deadline takes no account of the even more basic
realities of the biology and psychology of
negotiation.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-24?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_24_PT_1/6D5804B00B22ED73CDADAC9CCFCE7E630F239752" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 24 January 2014">Friday,

a referendum should be held. It is not about effecting changes or
reforms only for the benefit of the United Kingdom. If that process has
to be postponed until after the election, as has been said, we have a

to the skills of the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, a consensus was reached.

40 years the EU has transformed the history of Europe. It has made it a

something from which we should not back off. We should accept that we
can improve the methods of enhancing those goals. I think that for
Britain to stand apart and say, “We want certain changes for us
alone”, is designed to create a hostile reaction, whereas we
should go into this process of reform saying, “We recognise that
there are other countries that wish to see change, that wish to see the
institutions more democratised, that wish to see not just a single
market but one that embraces services and that wish to see not just
economic change but security changes to see how we can co-ordinate our
defence and security policy and make it more effective—not just

influencing the better outcomes that we all seek to achieve. That
cannot be done with a deadline of December 2017. It requires us to

yet. Although as a

clarification. I am not clear about the relationship between the
negotiations and the date of any referendum in December 2017. Earlier
in the debate, my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay of Clashfern
said that there was every likelihood that, if something became
problematic it was always open to a successor Parliament to amend the
legislation. In the case of the negotiations not being concluded in
time for a referendum at the end of 2017, would it be the policy of the
Prime Minister to follow the line of action advocated by my noble and

replies to that because the noble Lord, Lord Inglewood, has given the

said earlier, there is no point to having this date if noble Lords want
to have this flexibility. I therefore add a question to the noble Lord,
Lord Dobbs. In one minute it is seen as a bilateral negotiation by
Britain and in the next minute it is clear, as has been said by many
speakers, that it is a multilateral negotiation. It cannot be both at
the same time. The first would be narrow, and I do not think it would
get very far. If it is the latter, a multilateral poker game, it
certainly cannot be time constrained in advance. When he replies, I ask

When we began our proceedings today, there was a widespread view that
if any amendment 
<?notus-xml column=929?>were carried, it might endanger the future of the
Bill. There was therefore a great inhibition against voting for any
amendment. I do not believe that was wholly true because, as was
pointed out in earlier debates, it would be possible for the other

now in a situation where an amendment has been carried; it makes little
difference whether one amendment has been carried or a number. It is
therefore extremely important, if the Bill is to have a future, as I
believe it should, that we make it as good as we can by carrying out
our duty of amending it in a sensible way. I find it quite difficult to
think of any amendment which has been proposed more sensibly that that

seems to me that if we are really in favour of a genuine referendum on
the substance of the issue, following a serious
negotiation—which I believe is what the Prime Minister
intends—then there really is a very strong case for the
amendment. Therefore, whatever my noble friend on the Front
Bench’s brief may originally have said, I hope that she will
consider the point which I have just made and, more particularly, that
my noble friend Lord Dobbs would also consider it. It seems quite clear

the right agenda for the

has been a lot of comment in the course of these debates to the effect

four years after the decision to hold it is taken. I do not think that
in the whole history of referenda, which as far as I can recall started
with Napoleon I’s plebiscites, anybody has ever had such a
ridiculous notion before. How could the Government possibly have come

of change in our relationship with the European Union as a result of
the initiatives launched by this Government. I think that the noble
Lord, Lord Kerr, has persuaded everybody, including—this is the

noble Lord, Lord Forsyth—appears to have accepted the logic of
the noble Lord, Lord Kerr. I noted that in his intervention, which was
a dramatically important one, he said that the referendum might take
place before the renegotiation. He had obviously abandoned the idea of
making anybody believe that there was a reasonable chance of concluding
the negotiation before the referendum, so he decided to switch it round
and say that the referendum might take place first. I think what has
happened this afternoon is that one more cat has been let out of the
Tea Party’s bag, because a referendum which took place before
the negotiation would make our leaving the European Union almost
inevitable. Why<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-24T14:19:04"></hs_TimeCode>?
Because, in having a referendum, the Government would have to
get a mandate for a particular negotiating agenda. They would have to

demand that”, and that would be the agenda that the
public would then endorse.</hs_para>

to give a single reason for that, it is that I was in the House of

I agree with much of what my noble friend Lord Deben has just said. At
Second Reading I believed there was a case for giving this Bill,
imperfect as it—I made it plain that I would not have started
from here and that I did not like the Bill very much—a fair
wind. I tried to make that case as effectively as I could but it was
not accepted. I was merely pointing out that we are now in a different
position. Amendments have been passed. It is indeed, as he and I have
just said, up to the other place. The principle of the referendum
remains. In spite of what my noble friend Lord Spicer said, these are
not wrecking amendments. If the other place will give itself sufficient
time on the last day of February, it will be perfectly possible for

two, but because a number of other noble Lords have done so and it does
not need a lot of repetition, I shall do so quickly. These two sets of
circumstances need some analysis. Over time, and perhaps at subsequent
stages of the Bill, working out what those balances are may very well
lead us to further conclusions about the timing, but I started by
saying that this is a good and sensible resolution and I repeat
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-24T15:47:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

as a number of noble Lords have said, we will hold the presidency in
2017. That is precisely when we would want the United Kingdom to lead
European Union debates, and I think that we will be in a very difficult
position in trying to do that. There will be any number of significant
debates at that time: debates about the completion of the market
provisions in services; debates about the EU budget; and debates about
what I hope will emerge as the agreements on trade with North America
and with the MINT countries—Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria and
Turkey. All those will be in play.</hs_para>

will be a significant series of debates. Anybody who has been a
Minister and has had to handle the relationship with Europe during a
presidency will know that those are occasions when you want the deepest
and most genuine support from your colleagues in carrying things
forward. I do not want to plead any special link because there are many
around this Chamber with much more experience but they will also know
that you have not only to talk to others but to talk for others, and
they must trust you. That was the case in the discussions that Europe
had on some of the worst internal wars in Africa, on the aid programme,
on the 
<?notus-xml column=935?>difficulties with Iran and on the stimulus to new trade agreements with
South America, which ended up with President Lula’s state visit
and a significant change in the trading relationships with a number of
South American countries. In all those areas, the European nations need
to feel that the nation holding the presidency is with them, not
conflicted with them, and that it is eager to deliver some of the
fundamental outcomes.</hs_para>

want—the French most certainly will not. The objective
circumstances in France and the character of the French economy at this

is going to be fought. I am not saying anything that reveals an unusual

want to tidy up very briefly on one or two amendments in the group. I
do not think that Amendments 13 and 14 are possible because they are
simply testing provisions, but I want to comment on Amendment 17. I do
not think that it can be a Secretary of State. If this is a decision
that has to be taken for the whole of the United Kingdom, it must be
taken by the Prime Minister as the Minister with supreme authority for
the whole country. But what if there is another coalition? By 31
December 2016—it is important to reflect on that date—it
may be that the Prime Minister is the leader of the largest party in
the House of Commons, but is not the leader of a Government that
altogether are prepared to consent to the date. That is another really
large unknown which cannot be resolved in this House today. I do not
know who will win that election. Of course it has to be possible that
we will not, but I do not concede that point today. It may well be that
no one wins it outright and that there is another coalition. I could
then assume—I am sure I am quite wrong in doing so—that a
Conservative Government would find themselves saying the same things
that the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, has been saying today: that they
cannot get their way because the party with which they are in

Royall of Blaisdon:</Member></B> My Lords, before the noble Baroness,
Lady Warsi, gets up to speak, perhaps I may say one thing. I will be
brief. The noble Baroness knows that I have the highest possible regard
for her, but she is playing a very sticky wicket today. I do not want
to make her life more difficult, but I say for future amendments that
it is extremely difficult for there to be a Government position on this
Bill. If there is a Conservative position, the Conservative Benches are
behind the government Front Bench—unless, as in the Leveson
debate, we might have two views on every group of amendments. That is
what coalition is all about. If there are not two views, I think it is
more appropriate for the views of the Conservatives to be given from
the Conservative Back
Benches<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-24T15:59:04"></hs_TimeCode>.

much reform could be achieved or what the Prime Minister saw as

referred to it in his Bloomberg speech. He has talked about a Europe
which is more competitive, more flexible and more democratically 
<?notus-xml column=938?>accountable. I have spoken at the Dispatch Box as to what I mean by
that. The Prime Minister laid it out in his Bloomberg speech: a more
competitive Europe, with further completion of the single market in,
for example, services, energy and digital; a more flexible Europe,
where powers actually flow both ways; and a more democratically
accountable Europe to deal with the worrying disconnect between the EU
and its people. Another element of that is, for example, more
parliamentary scrutiny, which we are already looking at.</hs_para>

the cause of the distrust. People have been promised a referendum and
have been denied it, time and again. Those are the flames of discontent
that I wish to put

annual Parliaments in the early 1700s, which I do not imagine it would
come back to now. That has been done, and it has nothing whatever to do
with what is being proposed here. What is being proposed here is a Bill
whose sole purpose is to bind the hands of a future Parliament; it has
no other purpose whatever. That is surely a germane

have great respect for the noble Lord, Lord Dobbs, and the Earl of
Cardigan was not responsible for the loss of the Light Brigade,

is in Davos, I think—and the Earl of Raglan, the commanders of
the Army. It has been a very gallant charge and it was probably the

is very difficult to answer this debate, because I am supposed to deal
with the objections to my amendment; I am still waiting. The most
interesting suggestion, which I am rather inclined to follow, was in
the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Higgins. Act I of the play was quite
nasty, with a lot of talk about people misbehaving—hijacking was
a word used from the Front Bench—and plotting. In my view, that
was not worthy of the House. Act I is over. As the noble Lords, Lord
Higgins, Lord Cormack and Lord Deben pointed out, we are now in Act II
and our job is to try to turn the Bill, which a lot of us think
is a rather bad Bill, into a good Bill. We need to amend and improve

of support from around the House, that it does not make sense, because
the renegotiation cannot be completed. The noble Lord, Lord Dobbs, says
that we could change the date, but we would need a darn good reason. I
thought that we had given two hours and 10 minutes of darn good
reasons. However, I think that the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, is right:
in Act II one ought to try to be a bit co-operative. There is a point
knocking around here which I have not quite grasped. It is not the
point of the noble Lord, Lord Dobbs, about distrust, but the 
<?notus-xml column=945?>point of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of
Clashfern, about an enforceable undertaking. Although I do not agree
with that point, one needs to think about it because it seems a solid

provision does not need the date of 2017; I am not even sure that it

That seems clean and surgical and would leave the options open to the
Government of the day. However, I accept that it does not meet the
point of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern. It would
still be a Bill to have a referendum, and Clause 1(1) would still say,
“There shall be a referendum”. The noble and learned Lord
believes that there ought to be some time factor in there and he may be
right. I do not know, but I am inclined to act now, on the advice of
the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, and withdraw my amendment at this stage,
while asking the noble Lord, Lord Dobbs, to consult with his friends
and the commanding officers when they come back. If there is no
satisfactory amendment proposed by the proposers of the Bill, I will
revert to Amendment 10 on Report.</hs_para>

broad submission is this: the real choice for our people is not in or
out but in or what? They could be myriad alternatives that our people
are concerned about as to what they would prefer to have in place of
the EU. I will not go into detail on this because I propose to do so on
Amendments 33 to 39 in my name, which would give in the referendum
itself the opportunity for the electorate to say, “Well, if we
wish to leave the EU, we would prefer to be like Norway; we would
prefer to be like Switzerland; we would prefer to have a closer
relationship with the United States, and perhaps with Canada, in a
North American free trade association”. It may be that the
electorate will say, “We want to develop a closer relationship
with the Commonwealth”. What I am saying is this: if we are
serious about ascertaining the views of the people, we should give them
a series of alternatives. In so doing, we, with this independent
commission, should also set out the advantages and
disadvantages of each possible course. That is the reporting as it
refers to Amendment 25.</hs_para>

reporting amendment, saying that no order should be made until the
Secretary of State has reported to Parliament for its approval on the
negotiations between the UK and other EU member states concerning our
relationship with the EU. We covered this to some extent in the
previous debates, and I look forward to resuming this debate on Report.
However, at some stage there clearly has to be a report from the
negotiators and the Prime Minister on whether the criteria that he has
set have or have not been
achieved.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012450000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140124-0003.htm#14012450000098">The
noble Baroness, who admitted to speaking only for the Conservative

suspect she needs to go much further than that so that we have various
targets against which we can measure whether the negotiators have

international matters where you retreat and call it victory. I suspect
there is a great deal of mistrust not only on the part of the
electorate in politicians generally but among Conservative Party
members in respect of their Prime Minister—as we know the Prime
Minister travels fairly lightly on Europe, as he does on most things.
It is clear that the referendum Bill would not be necessary if the
Conservative 
<?notus-xml column=948?>Party had total trust in its Prime Minister. The
whole point of trying to tie him down to get what the Germans call a
“book with seven seals”—that is, to have a

the Prime Minister that he wants to have a referendum and wants to have
it after the next election. They are trying to tie him down. That is

vital that we nail the idea now that there must be clarity with regard
to the alternatives to membership before the referendum takes place.
The worst possible outcome of a referendum would be if it were voted on
in a nihilistic atmosphere and with a nihilistic attitude and people
were just saying no to something without having the faintest idea what
was going to happen. If that were to be the case, and we were to pull
out of the European Union on that basis, and if things then started to
unravel, there would be immense bitterness, and I am not sure where
that would take us politically. There needs to be a mechanism for
spelling out what the alternatives are, and that mechanism has to go
beyond the daily or weekly press. There needs to be some objective
assessment of those alternatives, and people have to know what those
assessments add up to. Therefore, in whatever way we try adding this to
the Bill, I hope that that issue, that dimension, will be taken on

on the Order Paper, Amendment 72—which we are not within miles

name of the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, and would basically put a
requirement on the Government to state before the referendum took place
what alternative relationship Britain should seek to have with the
European Union without Britain in it, if there were a no vote. I agree
absolutely with what the noble Lords, Lord Wigley and Lord Anderson,
said. It is essential that before the electorate cast their vote they
should be told what the consequences in terms of Britain’s
relationship with 
<?notus-xml column=949?>the truncated European Union would be in the event
of a no vote. It would be too late to say what the Government are going

up in the later amendment as well. At the moment, the important thing
is to note that this is a serious issue which will have to be addressed

the time we get there, the noble Lord, Lord Dobbs, refreshed by a
certain period of repose after his exertions today, will see the sense
of this as one of the amendments which basically strengthens the Bill.
It does not weaken it; it does not make a referendum less likely; it
does not prejudge the outcome of the referendum or anything like that.
It just means that if and when the referendum comes, there will be
before the British people a clear idea of what the alternative is if,

the noble Lord, Lord Anderson, but, quite frankly, if you look at
Amendment 72 of the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, it is clear that, under
it, the Government of the day would have to say, “If you vote
no, we will try to get an agreement to join the EEA”, for
example; or, “We would like to have a series of agreements like
the Swiss”—there are 30 or 50 of them; or, “We
would have none of the above and would rely simply on our World Trade

no, not what the no campaign would do. If the no campaign is led by the

there would be alternatives pursued, but the alternatives are not
within the power of the Government before the referendum, because who
knows whether the European Union would be willing to enter into an
agreement analogous with that reached with Switzerland, for example?
There are great problems with that; it is said by those who are experts

adjourn now, but that is a different issue. The amendment that has been
carried removes subsection (4). All these other amendments seek to
insert text on completely different issues after subsection (4). I do
not think that the removal of subsection (4) pre-empts text on
completely different issues that is sought to be inserted after that
subsection. I hesitate to say this when the Clerk is jumping up and
down, but just because the relevant measure refers to line 9, and line

morning, when we carried Amendment 1, Amendments 2 to 7 were pre-empted
on the same basis, because they would have been introduced into the
Bill at the place where subsection (1) was previously. The same thing
has now occurred because of the success that the noble Lord, Lord
Armstrong, has had with his second amendment today. By removing
subsection (4), the place where the amendments which the noble Lord,
Lord Anderson, would like to move would have been inserted has
disappeared. In so far as Amendments 2 to 7 were pre-empted,
and the House accepted that earlier today, it seems to me that the same
logic applies with these further

from the European Union unless at least half of those eligible to vote

that there are various ideas around this Chamber about thresholds or
indeed whether any threshold should exist at all. Certainly, looking at
the history of debates on referendums in both Houses over many years, I
do not think that there has ever been a proposal for a referendum

all the various debates about thresholds the concern has been that on
issues of major importance people feel uncomfortable if the vote is

explains why there have been so many initiatives in the past about
having thresholds in such legislation. Looking through the history of
this I cannot discern any particular party affiliation to any one
notion about any particular threshold. Looking at the amendments tabled
in the past on referendums legislation, some have been tabled by
Conservative Members in the other place, some by Labour Members and
some by Liberal Democrat Members and, as I say, these issues have come
up on practically all issues where a referendum has been proposed. In a
way, we need to bear all this in mind when deciding how to move

looking at this issue is also very much part and parcel of political
debate about referendums in other countries. The very good research
note from the House of Commons looks at countries around the
world—not only in the European Union but in Australia, for
example, and in non-EU member states such as Switzerland—and it

Wigley:</Member></B> My Lords, my name is added to some, but not all,
of these amendments. It appears that two important aspects are covered
in different ways. The first is whether a threshold should be required
for the outcome to have credibility. There are arguments both ways on
that, and there are dangers. I do not need to remind my noble friend
Lord Foulkes that in 1979 Scotland voted by a majority in favour of
having a Scottish Parliament—or Assembly, as it was then
called—with 33% voting yes and 31% voting no. However, because
of the 40% threshold rule, it did not happen. My noble friend will be
very aware of the consternation that that caused, with the feeling that
a majority had been in
favour<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-24T17:06:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

set a threshold at a level that is acceptable and which does not appear
to be loaded one way or another. I suppose that a 25% threshold is an
absolute minimum, but I should be very interested in hearing the
response of the noble Lord, Lord Dobbs, on this. Depending on what is
said between now and Report, we will no doubt need to come back to
refine these thoughts

into these amendments—which, grouped together, bring in
different aspects—is the question of the results from the four
nations of the United Kingdom. The noble Lord, Lord Kinnock, touched on
this in an earlier debate. I put it to the Committee that there is a
strong argument for each of the four constituent nations of the United
Kingdom to know how they have voted. If they do not, assumptions will
be made, and those assumptions may be the cause of much more political
rancour than dealing with the reality of the situation. If Scotland
votes yes and England votes no and the English vote dominates the rest
of the United Kingdom, there will undoubtedly be pressures in Scotland,
as my noble friend Lord Foulkes rightly said, to reopen the whole
question of the independence referendum, assuming that it is not
carried the first time round. We know what happened in Quebec when
there was a rerun of a referendum: it came very much closer than had
been the case on the first
occasion<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-24T17:07:34"></hs_TimeCode>.

think that my noble friend Lord Foulkes is following a pipe dream if he
thinks that there will be a definitive decision. I concede that if
there were a substantial majority one way or the other, that would be a
definitive decision, but we should remember not just the precedent of
the Cunningham amendment but the precedent of 1975, when there was a
very clear decision by the electorate to remain within the EEC.

Triesman:</Member></B> My Lords, when we debated earlier the level of
confidence that people would have in the outcome of any referendum, I
took the liberty of reminding the Committee of the kind of terminology
that was used during the original Scottish referendum and, indeed, the
whole process that led up to it. The idea of the settled will of any
people must depend on it being a will that is expressed by an
appreciable proportion of those people. There must be any number of us
who have been involved in decisions where a very small number of people
have taken them, often in gatherings called at inconvenient times and
in inconvenient places, and have not felt even at that micro level that

“consultative”. This is the point I made earlier. The
noble Lord, Lord Dobbs, said that it is implicit in the Bill; this
would make it explicit. Why do I want to do that? All referenda that we
have had in Britain have been, by nature, consultative, and Parliament
has chosen to comply with the will of the people as expressed through
referenda. In other countries, such as Italy, France and Turkey,
legislative assemblies have no choice but to accept them as binding
referenda. Because it happens in other countries, some people have come
round to the view that referenda can be binding. There is a fairly
widespread—although incorrect—feeling that they are
binding. If referenda are consultative by constitutional design,
Parliament will surely, as always, go along with the choice of the
majority in any future referendum. However, I want to guard
against the possibility of a disputed result, numerous varieties of
which may call for a second
referendum.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012450000171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140124-0003.htm#14012450000171">For<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-24T17:24:59"></hs_TimeCode>
example, there might be a low turnout or perhaps, as with the AV
referendum, there might some allegations of dirty tactics. Equally
there might be an incredibly close result. As my noble friend Lord
Anderson said, it was not close in 1975, it was a very clear result,
but a referendum might be incredibly close, by one or two percentage
points. In<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-24T17:24:59"></hs_TimeCode> all
those scenarios, a rerun may be the only way to definitely resolve the
question.
However<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-24T17:24:59"></hs_TimeCode>, a rerun
may also frustrate and alienate many voters who have assumed that
referenda are binding. In order to avoid any feelings of betrayal or
anger, we must make clear that it is a consultative referendum and that
Parliament is sovereign at the end of the day and could, if it wished,
ignore or repeal a referendum, should circumstances demand
it.</hs_para>

Cormack:</Member></B> My Lords, briefly, I support what my noble friend
said. I very much adhere to the Burkean view that the Member of
Parliament owes his constituents his initiative, industry and judgment.
However, there is something that we need to take very carefully into
account. My noble friend Lord Dobbs has several times in speaking on
this Bill referred to the sense of disappointment people felt when
successive Governments appeared to promise a referendum and then did
not deliver on that promise. That disappointment would pale into
insignificance by comparison with the ignoring of the verdict on a
national referendum. That is why we will have to look very carefully at
the threshold problem, because this addresses that in an indirect way.
I was one of those who supported George Cunningham and Tam Dalyell when
they campaigned in 1978 as that Bill went through another place. We
will have to come back to this at some stage. The noble Lord, Lord
Foulkes, has done the House a service in moving this amendment. Surely
it can be accepted. If my noble friend Lord Dobbs says that it is

road of saying that the vote of the people might be overturned.
Considerable cynicism could arise from that. I accept entirely that if
it is a consultative referendum that should be in the Bill and beyond
any misunderstanding. I agree wholeheartedly with the noble Lord, Lord
Higgins, on the fact that we have a representative democracy and do not
send every issue back for a referendum or plebiscite, or weigh how many
letters we have had in or all the rest. We must make a judgment on
things. In the House of Commons they make a judgment and here in this
House we must, too. If we say that the matter is one that we, as
representatives of Parliament, cannot come to a conclusion on and give
it back to the people, we would seem to cause enormous potential for

no question of the incoming new Labour Government not accepting it. It
had been on a relatively small turnout of about half the people and
there was about a 1% majority within that, but accepting that result
defused the issue and when the subsequent referendum came on having
greater powers there was a 2:1 majority. Even if people did not accept
the principle of devolution in the first place they came to accept it
because that was the will of the people. All I counsel is that we
should be very careful indeed if we set up a mechanism that ignores the
will of the people, whatever that will

because the Prime Minister has signed the Edinburgh agreement, he has
said that he will implement it. However, that does not mean that it is
necessarily binding on Parliament. It is still technically a
consultative referendum. If there were a yes vote, before it could be

withdrew those amendments just to keep those daft wee loonies and

express provision for the wording that would be put to the people of

noble Lords that the Welsh language has had official status in Wales
for two or three years now and that it would therefore be expected that
any such provisions would be in both languages. However, as the
legislation enacting this comes from Westminster, we feel that if the
English version is on the face of the Bill, the Welsh version should be
as well. The translation I have of it here is one that I checked out
with a person who had been translating for the National Assembly. It is

today. Having played a considerable part in strengthening and
supporting the position of the Welsh language in Wales, of course I
agree that both the English and Welsh versions should have an equal
place on the referendum papers. However, that seems to be perfectly
adequately covered in the Bill as it stands because the order has to
come before both Houses of Parliament for approval, covering this very
point. Although I share the view of what the endgame has to be, that

for his comments. I acknowledge immediately that during his time in
office progress was made with regard to the Welsh language, and
incidentally the late Wyn Roberts also played a significant part in
that. However, the point is that in most legislation of this sort these
words would be in a schedule, but there is no schedule here. We have
the English version in the Bill, which is why there is an amendment to
have a Welsh version as well. That would at least get the balance
right. It may well be that between now and Report an amendment needs to
be drafted saying that both should be treated with equality in this
Chamber as they would be in

Anderson of Swansea:</Member></B> My Lords, my name also appears on the
amendments. I have one little concern regarding my noble friend Lord
Foulkes’s comments: he said that the Gaelic version should
appear only in the parts of Scotland that speak Gaelic. 
<?notus-xml column=968?>If one were to transpose that to Wales, some might argue that in
Monmouthshire, for example, where very little Welsh is spoken, at least
on the eastern side in the border area, there should be a different
ballot paper. In my judgment, if there is to be a Gaelic version it
should be throughout Scotland, otherwise there will be enormous
problems regarding where to draw the line. To follow up what the noble
Lord, Lord Crickhowell said, there is, happily, a consensus in Wales in
respect of the language. We have managed to avoid the language
divisions that have rent Belgium over the years, and that in large part
is because of the work by the noble Lord but particularly of Lord
Roberts of Conwy. The Welsh Language Act and the equal validity
principle are a memoriam to the work that he

My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-24T17:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> Lords, my
name appears on the amendments. Obviously, I very much support the
amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Wigley. This is an important
issue in Wales. The language is a strong issue. It could be a divisive
one but it is not at the moment, or not greatly so, because by and
large English and Welsh are treated increasingly on a basis of
equality. If we have the English version in the Bill, it seems only
right that we should have the Welsh version too. I say to my noble
friend that as a south Waleian, I did not entirely understand his pure
accent as he comes from north Wales. Doing the best that I can with the
Welsh language, which is not a great deal but is something, it seems to
me to be a totally accurate translation.</hs_para>

as my grasp of Welsh—I am very sorry to have to admit it. There
are some languages I can do, but neither of those. The parity of value
expressed by doing it in different languages seems an unanswerable
objective. I suggest that the translations, which most 
<?notus-xml column=969?>of us can only accept on the face of it because we do not speak the
languages, are provided by an authorised body, such as the Electoral
Commission. In that way, the exactness of what is said is as reliable
as it can be for everybody who does not speak the language because it
has the assent of a completely outside body rather than one of us
trying to translate. I could probably have a go at one or two
translations—not of these languages—only to give rise to
considerable confusion about my conjugation of German or

culturally colourful debate. I wonder what my Welsh
great-great-great-grandfather, who was a coal higgler, would have felt
about what we are saying here today. Actually, he would have been
astonished, because in those days his language would not have been
given any consideration. I wish to confirm that it is absolutely not
the intention in this Bill to treat Wales in anything like an inferior
or secondary fashion. As my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale pointed out,
Clause 1(5) makes provisions for a question in Welsh, and other
provisions very clearly state that the job of making sure that the
ballot paper is fair and valid is down to the Electoral
Commission.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012450000225" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140124-0003.htm#14012450000225">On
that basis, and given the time that we are here, I entirely endorse the
spirit of this amendment, but I do not think that it is necessary. I
really think that the Bill already has enough provision to satisfy the
main requirements, which are, of course, about Welsh, rather than Doric
or the other languages that the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, has been
talking about recently. As it relates to Wales, the Bill has enough in
it to satisfy all those legitimate demands. On that basis, I ask him,

sector plays a vital role in the UK economy, supporting around 350,000
jobs and with record capital expenditure in 2013 of around
£14 billion, and in meeting our energy needs.
Indigenous oil and gas production supplies the equivalent of about half
of the UK’s primary energy demand. It is vital that we continue
to do all we can to maximise economic recovery of indigenous
hydrocarbon reserves. The licensing of new areas forms an essential
part of our long term economic plan by enabling the exploration
necessary to ensure we fully realise our remaining reserves which could
be as much as another 20 billion barrels. This will boost growth,
energy security, and
jobs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012440000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140124-wms0001.htm#14012440000006">DECC's

Faulks:</Member> Between 2010/11 and 2015/16 the Ministry of Justice is
required to make a real terms spending reduction of around a third. The
impact of the Transforming Legal Aid proposals if fully
implemented—on top of the baseline that includes earlier reforms
and volume reductions—would be that legal aid expenditure would
be reduced by a similar order of magnitude over the same period. These
proposals ensure that we can continue to bear down on the costs of
legal aid spending, which is currently around £2 billion a
year.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012441000176" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140124w0001.htm#14012441000176">The
