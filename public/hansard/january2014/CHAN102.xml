There was another opportunity, in 2008, to change the regulations when

not adjusted then. This protection had been dormant for 17 years and

local authorities saying, “We shouldn’t do this or

united message in Paris yesterday, from all 11 countries
represented, was the vital necessity of this process, the great
importance of both the regime and the opposition being prepared to
attend, and our determination to support a political settlement and end
the humanitarian suffering of the Syrian people. No one should
underestimate the difficulty of the negotiations ahead, but we will not
give up on diplomacy as the route to stopping the appalling bloodshed,

Jarba of the Syrian National Coalition has always said that he is ready

Friday. We urge it to attend and to put the spotlight on the Assad
regime’s responsibility to end this terrible conflict. Today
Secretary Kerry and Foreign Minister Lavrov met UN and Arab League
envoy Brahimi for further discussions ahead of the talks. There is a
pressing need for measures that can build confidence ahead of the
negotiations such as prisoner releases and progress on humanitarian

my last statement to the House, the violence has remained intense. The
Syrian Observatory for Human Rights now puts the death toll at over
125,000 people. The regime continues to bombard Aleppo and other towns
and cities, including through the repeated use of barrel bombs. These
huge canisters, filled with explosives and shards of metal and dropped
from helicopters on to civilian areas, have killed 600 people in Aleppo
alone since mid-December, including 172 children, and injured 3,000
people. The use of this deliberately indiscriminate weapon is yet
another war crime and is clearly designed to sow terror and weaken the
will of the civilian population. Assad and those around him should be
in no doubt that the world will hold them to account.</hs_Para>

deliberate obstruction of humanitarian aid to the Syrian people is also
utterly unacceptable. The UN Security Council presidential statement in
October last year demanded that aid must be able to reach all Syrians.
However, the UN estimates that 2.5 million people inside Syria are
currently not receiving assistance, including 250,000 people trapped in
besieged or hard-to-access areas. Countless numbers of people are being
denied access to food and medicines, and there are now sickening
reports of innocent people dying from malnutrition.
Last<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T15:36:47"></hs_TimeCode> week at the
Security Council we proposed a new statement calling for immediate and
unfettered access for aid. This was blocked by Russia, but we will
continue to seek action at the UN Security Council and to work with
Russia to try to bring about progress at Geneva and in the humanitarian
situation. More than half the Syrian population is now in need of
humanitarian assistance: 9.3 million people within Syria, and 2.3
million refugees in the region, who are facing bitter winter
conditions.</hs_Para>

“Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant”—in 
<?notus-xml column=585?>dozens of locations across northern Syria. Opposition groups are
reported to have driven the al-Qaeda-affiliated group back in Aleppo,
Idlib, Hama and al-Raqqah governorates. The fighting has been

the moderate opposition is prepared to fight against these groups is a
demonstration to the world that they reject extremism, just as they
reject the Assad regime. It gives the lie to Assad’s claim that
that there is no choice other than his regime or extremist terrorists.
And it underlines the importance of supporting the moderate opposition
forces to help them counter the extremists—which is vital for
security in the region and in the UK. Assad’s brutality is the
best recruiting tool the extremists have. Ultimately, the only

generously coping with the strain of the ever-increasing burden of
Syrian refugees, hosting more than 575,000 and more than 860,000
refugees respectively. We have given more than £111 million in
humanitarian support to Jordan, more than £109 million to

to Syria, a conflict that began nearly three years ago as an uprising

Friend the Member for Blackburn(Mr Straw), I was part of the
all-party delegation to Iran last week, which I put on the record. I
welcome the Foreign Secretary’s statement about the tentative
nuclear agreement with Iran. If there is to be a successful Geneva II
process, however, I agree with the former Foreign Secretary that it
must involve Iran. If other countries are involved in the Syria talks
and themselves support jihadist forces in the country, questions need

Let me put the argument another way. If we think back to the Geneva I

do not believe that, had Iran been present at that time, we would have
been able to arrive at that agreement on creating a transitional

different cultures and religions. Extremists are taking advantage of
the conflict in Syria, rather than the conflict’s being a
reflection of the true nature of the Syrian people, and we need a
political solution to be arrived at as soon as possible so that they
can return to their true nature. That is not for the benefit of any

conflict are no longer able to look to their respective international
patrons for support because those patrons have agreed on a way forward,

generally true to say that there is now a greater appetite among some
of the outside powers for a political settlement in Syria than there
might be among some of the people who are fighting each other in Syria.
It was clear in our discussions yesterday that all 11 members of the
core group of the Friends of Syria supported a political settlement and
wanted the opposition to go to Geneva II. That included Saudi Arabia,
Qatar and other Gulf states, which have been mentioned in these
questions. We also need Russia to assist in bringing the regime to
Geneva II in the same spirit, and that is what Secretary Kerry has been
pursuing with the Russians today. We will all be pursuing it with them

bring about in any country, and, as I said in my statement, we must not
underestimate the difficulty of doing that in a war-torn, divided
country such as Syria. The provision to do so by mutual consent is very
important, because through that a transitional governing body could
just work, mutual consent being required for the membership on both
sides. It is very important to uphold that commitment of our Geneva

we are seeking—the basis of the invitation letter from the UN
Secretary-General—is a transitional governing body formed by
mutual consent. Such a thing, drawn from regime and opposition, would
naturally guard against the extremes, as each side would have to agree
to the representatives of the other. That would not be a recipe for
Assad to continue, as I mentioned earlier, or for the
al-Qaeda-affiliated extremists to have a role. Again, that shows the

announce in the past 24 hours that this agreement will come into force
next week, on 20 January. That means that the sanctions relief we have
offered Iran starts from then. That will involve the amendment of some
European Union sanctions and United States sanctions, and it means that
the US will unfreeze a certain amount of Iranian assets—that
will be spread over the six-month period of this agreement. It is
anticipated that this amounts to about $7 billion of sanctions relief
for Iran, provided the Iranians are sticking to their part of the
agreement on the nuclear issue. That agreement is

discussed it with Foreign Minister Lavrov and the Prime Minister has
discussed it with President Putin, and the American leaders continue to
do the same. After all, it is in the interests of Russia, as with all
of us, to make sure that extremism does not take hold, in Syria and in
the wider region. That means that we all have to work together on
bringing about a political solution. So we hope that, just as we have
done that on chemical weapons, we will be able to do it during and
around the Geneva II process to make a political process viable. We

target of ISIS is not the Assad regime but the Free Syrian Army. Is the
Foreign Secretary aware that all attacks are taking place on the Free
Syrian Army with the support of Assad? If he is and believes it to be

of it, it is the case that the Assad regime has fed the growth of
extremism. I cannot corroborate statements of it giving direct support
to such groups, but if there were such evidence I would be interested
to see it. None the less, it is its position, its politics and its
brutality to the people of Syrian that have fed the growth of
extremism. Assad is not the alternative to the extremists; he is
producing them. Although I cannot confirm exactly what he says, I think
it supports the same analysis, which means that we must do what we can

Clearly, arms flow in from many different sources and in many different
ways. Funnily enough our concerns about arms in Libya are more about
the ones that

We are working on a UN decommissioning programme to be able to take

how humanitarian access can be improved ahead of next week’s

disappointed that Russia is not readier to agree international
statements or resolutions at the UN that we ought to be able to pass

the UN, Russia will demonstrate its readiness to deal with the Syrian

we have given extensive briefings about the detail, which has greatly
reassured many countries. Those countries will want to know that we are

Agency is playing the full role it needs to. We want to know that, too.
They will want to see the evidence over the coming months that the
agreement is working, which is completely understandable. In the
meeting yesterday, President Jarba of the National Coalition asked for
more support for the National Coalition, in whatever way any country
around the table could provide it. I made it plain, as I did just now,

my hon. Friend’s question in context, it is important to stress
that the Bill will have no financial effect on the UK Budget. Some
might say, for the sake of argument, that the money could be better
spent in the UK, but the fact is that it forms part of the European
Union budget that has been agreed, so money not spent on this European
project would be spent on a different one. I therefore take my hon.
Friend’s intervention as an opportunity to remind the House that
the Prime Minister secured a significant reduction in the European
Union’s overall budget. In fact, I think it is the first time
the EU has ever reduced its budget.</hs_Para>

original budget proposed for the programme was €229 million,
which would have been a 7% increase on the budget for the 2007-2013
programme, which was €215 million, but I am pleased to say that,
following the budget negotiations—otherwise known as the
multi-annual financial framework—that figure came down to just
over €185 million, which was a reduction of €44 million.
It is also important to stress that the €185 million is spread
over seven years and that we estimate the UK contribution to be about
£2 million to £3 million a year.

position is rather controversial, given our own decision, in 1997, to

Committee. Expectation management is an important part of monetary
policy, so I wonder why we are not seeing the ECB papers in the same

aim of the citizens’ programme is to improve how citizens

about £7 million will be spent in this
country—not, I would suggest, a vast amount. The Minister has

been a lot of publicity recently about what I think is called the media
action trust. This is an organisation within the BBC that apparently
also has its own premises there and has, so we are informed, been
provided with substantial funds from the EU for training journalists

vote against the Bill for this reason—is the question of
European citizenship, which goes back to the treaties and the
objectives of political union. One of the things that I well remember

debates, all those years ago, was the reference in

to lead. We only have to look at what Viviane Reding, the senior
vice-president of the European Commission, said last week to know that
it is based on an absolute determination to go pell-mell for a full
united states of Europe. The proposals in this Bill, which, if it were

Act of Parliament. This regulation and these arrangements are dictated
by unanimity, which means that we could say no. I shall now provide a

exercise is aimed at providing propaganda, as I see it, for purposes of
political union. That is why we should say no.</hs_Para>

intervene in order to repudiate what I am saying, and to assure me that
none of this money will be used for any propaganda

promoting the idea of the European Union—and to make absolutely

statement, which I happen to know is true, was made under the aegis of
the European Scrutiny Committee. In his letter of 19 November 2013, the
Minister said that an agreement on the substance of the draft
regulation had been reached by COREPER in March 2013. I need not spend
too much time on that, because the COREPER problems are contained in
our report, but the point is that the agreement to which the letter
referred was ticked off by officials.</hs_Para>

am not denying that the Minister has come to the House and said that he
endorses this, and the same situation arose in the House of Lords.
However, I want to emphasise that our report, which has been supported
by all those Members of Parliament, identified that process as a matter
of concern, because it had been dealt with by officials in the first
place and ticked off by them, and then along came the Government and
agreed to it. We had recommended that the whole matter be dealt with in
a European Standing Committee. Our recommendation has understandably

£185 million. I am glad he linked
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T17:34:09"></hs_TimeCode> to the
reduction in the budget generally under the multiannual arrangements he
described, but I would only make this point, especially on behalf of

the Government to arrive at the decision that reducing the budget would
be a good idea, because that was a unanimous decision that had been

European money. It is about remembrance, and that is most emphatically
in this Bill, as I am sure all Members of this House will recognise, so
when I referred to the question of world war one, I was referring to
the remembrance aspect of this strand of the programme. I would like to
make it clear that I am very much in favour of that and in no way would
want to prevent substantial remembrance events from taking place.
Indeed, I shall be going to Normandy next year, where my father was
killed in the second world war, and won the military cross, at Maltot
near Caen. I shall be going there to commemorate all the brave men and
women who died in the second world war and also to pay tribute to those
who took part in the first world war. I am not against the principle of

need this Bill to do
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011313000430" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/debtext/140113-0002.htm#14011313000430">There
is one final point I wish to make. I think the entire debate that we

is very important. For the reasons I have given, and because of the way
in which the money, which is our money, is being spent by the European
Union on projects that are not consistent with the voters’
wishes in general, this is not the kind of thing I would want to
support. Furthermore, that is why I shall be voting against this Bill.
I am also extremely surprised because I do not think the Minister is in
any way disagreeing with my general proposition that, for the reasons
set out clearly in the programme itself, this money is going to be made
available to those who promote the political objectives of the European
Union and the citizenship that goes with it and will provide
substantial grants for that purpose.</hs_Para>

Member for Stone is correct—I have read the
correspondence—to say that the Minister pointed out in the early
stages of this measure that the Government were not pleased about what
was then a projected percentage increase in the available budget, and
that they would seek, through negotiation, to push that sum in the
opposite direction. I congratulate the Government on their act of
positive engagement at European level, which has achieved exactly that.
Those cost reductions are to be welcomed, and the rhetoric of the
Government has matched the delivery. That makes it all the more easy
for people like me to support the Government in the Lobby on this
issue. We have also supported the Bill in the Lords, as my noble
Friend, Baroness Falkner, made clear.</hs_Para>

deals with the Europe for Citizens programme, where I wish to make a
contribution not on behalf of the Liberal Democrats, but in a personal
capacity on behalf of the European Movement, with which I
have been associated for a number of years—I have had the

the European Movement is all-party and, most significantly, as I always
say, non-party in its composition. It has been with us, in this country
and elsewhere on the continent, since the formation of Europe
itself—the political Europe in the aftermath of the second world
war. Over the decades it has made a notable and distinguished
contribution to the dissemination of knowledge—genuine
knowledge, not propaganda—through schools, local voluntary
organisations and so on.</hs_Para>

not so much a case of “Waiting for Godot” as of waiting
for Gordon; it was a two-act play in which nothing happened, twice. The
Prime Minister assembled his pro-European forces and marched them to
the top of the hill on more than one occasion, and absolutely nothing
came of it. The group that suffered most during that period of raised

Carmichael</B> (Stroud) (Con):</Member> There is a huge amount about
the European Union that I would like to change. Indeed, all
organisations of that type need to be reformed, and there is a huge
opportunity coming up. The Prime Minister’s commitment to a
referendum in 2017 is predicated on the fact that we will also see
substantial changes. I would like to see a lot of changes, particularly
the deepening and widening of the single market to include energy. I
want to see more emphasis on productivity across Europe, and more
capacity for European countries to trade with each other and, above
all, strike a bigger punch in the global economy as well. That is all
about ensuring that the European Union is fit for purpose. I am,
therefore, by no means immune to the idea that the European Union needs
to be reformed and changed. However, let me first celebrate the fact
that we are today debating this issue, which is down to the coalition
Government who passed the European Union Act
2011<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T17:53:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011325000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/debtext/140113-0002.htm#14011325000017">This
is a fabulous opportunity for us to demonstrate the value of that Act,
because it is through that Act that we are making this decision. It is
proof that Parliament—I am talking about this Parliament, but
other Parliaments could pass similar legislation—can indeed
exercise some authority over the decision making of the European Union.
The Government should be congratulated not just on being bold enough to
pass that Act but on being so easily able to use it in a situation such
as this.</hs_Para>

this legislation is founded on the treaties to which we have signed up.
Those treaties require, in this particular case, unanimity, which gives
the decision we are making even more force, which is useful. That does
not mean that we should be handing out red cards every time we think
about an issue, because we also must ensure that the European Union
works. A single market is one example where we need a more considered
and conciliatory approach to ensure that it operates not just for our
benefit but for that of everybody else in the European Union,
particularly when we are negotiating a free trade agreement with the
United States.</hs_Para>

unanimity in the Council of Ministers, and our Minister will not be
able to nod the matter through unless or until we vote accordingly
tonight. That is a clear statement that this Parliament has more power
than it did before, and that is down to the European Union Act 2011.
When we confront either the next general election or the referendum, we
will be able to say that we have delivered for Parliament more capacity

many people would want to visit Florence just to look at the archives.
If that is the case, they are indeed committed to something that is not
as exciting as other things they might like to find. The fact is it is
right to have archives for the European Union. Historians

cultural advantage from it, as they meet many people from different
regions. Stroud itself is twinned with Saint-Ismier near Grenoble, and
I find the linkage with the people there extraordinarily valuable, but
it is neither overtly political nor party political in any
sense. The people in the twinning organisation are Conservatives,
Liberal Democrats, Labour party supporters—there are
some—independents and those who are not interested in politics
at all. The linkage is first and foremost

last point is a territorial one. In the explanatory notes, we are
reminded that the Bill applies to the whole of the United Kingdom.
Scotland might make the foolish decision to leave the UK, in which case
it will effectively leave the European Union, and that may well raise
an issue for this measure. I remind the House that we should be
absolutely emphatic in our view that Scotland should remain a member of
the United Kingdom and, therefore, a member of the European Union.
These matters should be discussed in 2017 when we have had an
opportunity to recalibrate some of our policies and reassess where we
stand, and—fundamentally, in my view—we should then
ensure that Britain’s membership of the European Union continues
through a reformed, modernised and, in many cases, vastly reduced EU,
but one in which business can thrive, trade is developed and our punch
as a country and as a continent are enhanced.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Stroud (Neil Carmichael), because I am going to
start my speech with a similar point to that with which he finished
his. It is interesting to see how we got to the point of having this
debate. As the House knows, the legal position is that the UK now holds
a veto over these proposals under the EU treaties and section 8 of the
European Union Act 2011. The Government are not permitted to support
the proposals or abstain unless they are approved by
Parliament.</hs_Para>

we have heard, the Bill has already been approved by the House of Lords

Europe for Citizens programme, for example, will simply fall. The UK
will have to block that programme in the Council of Ministers and it
will not be able to go ahead. To put it simply, voting against the
measure means that Parliament is telling the Government to veto this
element of EU spending. It is a welcome development for Parliament to
be able to scrutinise such spending in such detail. I was pleased to
hear that the Minister has done some of his homework and he has done
very well at getting up to speed on the matter.</hs_Para>

of this Parliament, I saw that the Government were proposing to support
a draft EU regulation re-establishing the Europe for Citizens programme
for the period from 2014 to 2020 it caused me to raise an eyebrow. I
have many concerns about the programme—I have harboured them for

that the UK will meet about 11.5% of the cost of the multi-annual
financial framework, after the rebate is applied. That means
that the UK may end up paying roughly £18 million for the
programme, over its course. The shadow Minister said that we expect to
receive about £7 million back. That is not a bad return on
European money—normally, we pay in a fiver and get £2
back—but the money comes back to us with caveats on how it
should be spent, and who it should be spent on. I understand the

€150,000. In 2010, European Alternatives Ltd was awarded
€40,000 for a project called “Transeuropa
citizens”. In 2009, the same company was awarded €36,300
for a project called “active and transnational citizens in

project called the “active and transnational citizenship

European Alternatives Ltd has been awarded grants to fund its
existence, which the Commission said it would cut out; no longer could
organisations bid for money simply to run themselves, so that they
could bid for more European money to run projects for the Commission,
so that they could bid for more money from the Commission, so that they
could run more projects for the Commission. That was not the case here.
In 2012, 2011 and 2010, it was awarded a €100,000 annual
operating grant. In 2009, it did a bit worse: it got only
€60,000. This one organisation was awarded, all in all,
approximately €760,000 from one section of the Europe for
Citizens programme budget over the period from 2007 to 2013. Bear that
figure in mind when I come on to the sort of grants that have been

Stephen and James Smith, needed to slash its annual budget from
£800,000 to £500,000, and its activities such as
professional training to spread the word about what the holocaust meant
had to be axed so that it could focus its resources on educating the

trialogues between the Commission, the Parliament and the Council where
such a complex package has been rebalanced before. Then we could talk

the Member for Daventry (Chris Heaton-Harris) because he has gone

towards. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Minister on putting his case
as he did. I could not quite decide whether he was modelling himself on
Horatius at the bridge or the boy who stood on the burning deck,
because I noticed that he was not supported not only by his Secretary
of State but by any Secretary of State. He had the occasional support
of the Lord<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T18:39:46"></hs_TimeCode>

will mention in passing the first part of the Bill, on archives and the
value—or the vanity—of archives. When I was doing my
A-levels, I was told that if ever we ran out of something to say when
discussing 16th-century history, we should always refer to a report
sent by the Venetian ambassador. That is because the archives in Venice
were so great—so large and comprehensive—that nobody ever
went through them all, and therefore if we attributed a view to the
Venetian ambassador nobody could tell us that we were wrong. In the
same way, if we were to visit the Escorial we would find that some of
the documents of Philip II of Spain still have on them the sand used to
blot the ink, because nobody has looked at them in the many hundreds of
years that have passed. I have a feeling that the institute in
Florence—this wonderful, glorious, illustrious European
institute that is going to educate us so much about the virtues and
kindness of the European Union—will find that the sand remains
on these documents until scholars yet unborn finally get round to
sweeping it
off.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011328000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/debtext/140113-0002.htm#14011328000010">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T18:39:24"></hs_TimeCode>

I am a citizen of Europe in the first place. I do not believe that it
is, was or ever could be legitimate to foist a citizenship on people
who have not asked for it or were not born into it. To say in about
1990, as the Maastricht treaty came through, that those of us who were
proud to be subjects of Her Majesty were suddenly also citizens of some
foreign multinational organisation seems to me an affront. Therefore, I
deny— I repudiate—my citizenship of this

right hon. Friend the Member for Ross, Skye and Lochaber described the
Bill as “gentle”, “timorous” and
“meek, mild and inoffensive”. I think he was making a
plea to hon. Members not to be cruel to the Bill, but to shepherd it
through with the utmost care and attention. He mentioned that the funds
in one of the regulations supported the European Movement, of which he
is the UK president and which, of course, was started by Sir
Winston Churchill.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Stroud made a very good point when he
reminded us that this debate was happening because of the Conservative
party and the Bill we passed, in the teeth of opposition from Labour,
to give the House the opportunity to scrutinise European legislation.
It is shocking, when we see the House filled up with people ready to
scrutinise European legislation, that Labour still refuses to give the
British people a say on their membership of Europe. It is only by
voting Conservative that the British people will get a say, in a
referendum, on whether we should remain a member of the EU.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Daventry welcomed the scrutiny, but asked
for a rebalancing of the project. He is the chairman of the Royal and
Derngate theatre, and it is welcome to see him in that position. We
will always find examples, as he did, of funded projects with which we
disagree, but I know, as someone responsible for funding the Arts
Council—I do not want to start another debate—and looking
at the distribution of lottery funds, that we will always find funded
projects with which we disagree and many projects we think should be
funded that are not. That is in the nature of it. The process for
getting funding will involve an open application system, and we should
encourage people to make applications, should the House support the
regulation, as there is no reason, in principle, why they should not
receive funding.</hs_Para>

in Scandinavia that good St Thomas brought Christmas and the
evil Canute took it away. The death of Canute started a minor European

is clear that something terrible is happening across the face of
Britain. We are seeing the return of absolute poverty, which has not
existed in this country since the Victorian age, more than a century
ago. Absolute poverty is when people do not have the money to pay for
even their most basic needs. The evidence of that is all around us.
There are at least 345 food banks and, according to the Trussell Trust,
emergency food aid was given to 350,000 households for at least three
days in the last year. The Red Cross is setting up centres to help the
destitute, just as it does in developing countries. A study that was
published two months ago shows that even in prosperous areas of the
country, such as London, more than a quarter of the population is
living in poverty. This point is really scary: according to the Joseph
Rowntree Foundation, for the first time, the number of people in
working families who are living in poverty, at 6.7 million, is greater
than the number of people in workless and retired families who are
living in poverty, at 6.3
million<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T19:17:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011328000472" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/debtext/140113-0003.htm#14011328000472">The
Department for Work and Pensions published new data two months
ago—it was pretty reluctant to do this, and one can see
why—showing that the use of sanctions, which means depriving
people of all their benefits for several weeks at a time, had increased
by 126% since 2010 and, most strikingly of all, that 120 disabled
people who had been receiving jobseeker’s allowance had been
given a three-year fixed duration sanction in the previous year.
Figures from the Department for Communities and Local
Government—these are the last that I will quote, although there
are many more that I could quote—show that there are now more
than 2,000 families who have been placed in emergency bed-and-breakfast
accommodation after losing their homes. The 5% rise in the overall
homelessness figures last year included nearly 9,000 families with
children, which is the equivalent of one family losing their
home every 15
minutes<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T19:18:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011328000473" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/debtext/140113-0003.htm#14011328000473">What
impact have the so-called welfare reforms, which would more accurately
be described as social security knock-backs, had on the families who
have been affected? The best evidence comes from the Northern Housing
Consortium, which carried out a survey three months ago of a
representative sample of people living in social housing. It found that
a third of families spent less than £20 a week on food and that
the average spend on food per person per day was precisely
£2.10. That is a third less than those families were able to
afford three months 
<?notus-xml column=642?>before that. The proportion of households that had to make debt
repayments of more than £40 a week had doubled and the average
level of debt was £2,250. That might not sound a lot to us, but
to people with that standard of living, it is an enormous and daunting
sum. A third of families had council tax debt, and households were
having to spend 16% more on gas and electricity. Those are deplorable
figures of profound impoverishment in an economy that is still the
sixth largest in the
world.<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T19:19:24"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011328000474" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/debtext/140113-0003.htm#14011328000474"><Member ContinuationText="Andy Sawford" PimsId="6000" UID="14011328001034" xid="1241" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/debtext/140113-0003.htm#14011328001034"><B>Andy

for Monmouth (David T. C. Davies) does not seem to realise that many of
the people who claim benefits, including jobseeker’s allowance,

delivers newspapers to my constituency office. He has dyslexia, but he
works because he wants the pride of keeping himself. He still needs to
claim JSA, but he lost his allowance because his dyslexia meant that in
one fortnightly period he applied for nine jobs, not 10. Can that
possibly be right, when this man is already working and trying to pay

persons sanctioned in the eight months to June last year. If the same
rate has continued since then—it has probably
increased—that means that more than 1 million have been
sanctioned in the past 15 months and deprived of all benefit and all
income. Given that the penalties are out of all proportion to the
triviality of many of the infringements, and given that, as I have
said, four out of five people cannot get a job whatever they do, the
use of sanctioning on this scale, with the result of utter destitution,

unjust.</hs_Para>

are other reasons for this deeply worrying rise in absolute poverty.
One is the delays in benefit payments, which have increased
substantially—the delays, not the benefit payments,
unfortunately. Another reason is the impossibility for many poor and
vulnerable people to comply with the new rules, even though they want
to, that are being imposed. I will quote just one case from my surgery
a few weeks ago. He is a disabled man who had his benefits reduced due
to the one-year employment and support allowance rule, so his income is
now £71 a week. He has been left in a three-bedroom house
because his mother and other people looking after him have died and so
has to pay £23 in bedroom tax, plus £6 a week—this
is the point that
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T19:26:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Corby (Andy Sawford) was making—in council tax
due to the new council tax rules, leaving him with £42 a week.
He asked to downsize to a smaller property, which is what the
Government would expect him to do, but the local housing association,
ironically called First Choice Homes, demanded that he pay two
weeks’ full 
<?notus-xml column=644?>rent upfront, £197, before getting any housing benefit. He cannot
do that, of course, and he is stuck in an impossible
situation<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T19:26:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011328000488" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/debtext/140113-0003.htm#14011328000488">Another
reason for the rise in absolute poverty is the impact of the bedroom
tax, which applies to two thirds of a million households. I think
everyone, probably even Government Members, will admit that it is
Dickensian in its sheer social divisiveness. The housing benefit cap
has now been imposed on a further 33,000 households. Both of those
measures have forced tens of thousands of people out of their
homes—we need to take into consideration what that
means—even though two thirds of those affected by the bedroom
tax are disabled. It is reckoned that more than 90% do not have smaller
social housing to move into.</hs_Para>

not insignificant cause of destitution—I will be very brief on
this—is mistakes made by the authorities themselves. Last week,
one of my constituents who had been sanctioned for a month was suddenly
told that his sanction had been extended to a year. It was only
intervention with the local DWP office that uncovered that it was
actually their mistake. What happens for others who do not have the
advantage of such an intervention? It now seems that up to 40,000
working-age tenants in social housing have been improperly subjected to
the bedroom tax because of DWP error.</hs_Para>

will cite just one more reason for the unnecessary and cruel imposition
of poverty, and I say that advisedly: the way in which tens of
thousands of severely disabled persons have been judged by Atos, the
French IT company, as fit for work—and therefore forced on to
JSA at just £71 a week—when they are patently unfit for
work. Very often, their GP has not been consulted to inquire whether
there are other factors that need to be taken into account. The
Chancellor’s policy of keeping 2.5 million people
unemployed makes it impossible for them to find work, even
if there were employers who would be willing to take them,
and the 40% success rate of appeals shows how unfair the whole process
is.</hs_Para>

conclude by asking just one simple question: is all this brutality
towards the poor really necessary? Is there any justification in
intensifying the misery, as the Chancellor clearly intends, by winding
up the social fund and, particularly, by imposing another £25
billion of cuts in the next Parliament, half of that from
working-age benefits?
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T19:29:24"></hs_TimeCode>The whole
objective of the massive cuts programme—to reduce the
deficit—is one that I think we would all support. There is no
disagreement about that across the House, yet after £80 billion
of public spending cuts, with about £23 billion of cuts in this
Parliament so far, the deficit has been reduced only at a glacial pace,
from £118 billion in 2011 to £115 billion in 2012 and
£111 billion in 2013. Frankly, the Chancellor is like one of
those first world war generals who urged his men forward, over the top,
in order to recover 300 yards of bombed-out ground, but lost
20,000 men in the process. How can it be justified to carry on imposing
abject and unnecessary destitution on such a huge scale when the
benefits in terms of deficit reduction are so small as to be almost
derisory<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T19:31:13"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para>

that we need public investment. We need to get jobs and growth. That is

disastrous economic decisions, such as that to sell gold at a fraction

we are dealing with today—we had a welfare system that allowed
people to get into a trap of welfare dependency, leaving them on the

I am proud of the fact that, instead of shirking their
responsibilities, Ministers in this coalition Government took difficult
economic decisions. Of course we had to make cuts and reduce public
spending. It would have been grossly irresponsible not to do so, and in
the longer term it would have led to far greater poverty than we face
now. The reality is that we are a nation in debt. We are having to
borrow about £10 billion every month. We are also having
to roll over existing debts that previous Governments left us. If for
any reason the international money lending organisations that give us
that £10 billion a month ever decided that we were not in a
position to pay either the interest or the original sum, they would
simply stop lending to us, and there would be no European bank or
International Monetary Fund waiting to bail us out with the sums we
would need.</hs_Para>

What sort of country are we—supposedly one of the most advanced
industrialised countries in the world, yet 24% of our children will be

2011—and that figure was far too high. The IFS goes further,
projecting that, unless there are changes, current policies will
impoverish a further 700,000 children between 2015 and 2020. That means
some 4 million children growing up in poverty in the UK.</hs_Para>

they are our fellow citizens—are having to live in such
circumstances. I only hope that there will be a change of Government,

previously<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T19:52:46"></hs_TimeCode>. I

from my constituency certainly suggests that an increasing number of
people are finding it very difficult, or impossible, to make ends meet.
That applies particularly to those who are out of work, but, as other
Members have said, it also applies to those who are in work. However, I
think it important for us not to restrict our review to welfare
reforms. More and more people in my constituency, and indeed throughout
the country, are entering work and finding a way out of poverty as a
result of the Government’s focus on job creation and
apprenticeships.</hs_Para>

interest rates down—let us not forget that we are currently
spending nearly £50 billion a year in interest, and that the
figure is rising—and to ensure that we as a country can maintain
a proper welfare safety net for our people, not just in the short term
but in the long term. A country that continues to run a 6.8%

essential for the Government, on behalf of the nation as a whole, to
keep a close eye on both open and hidden poverty. Poverty is often more
hidden than open: many people do not complain and do not come to our
surgeries, but get on with it, day in, day out. However, those people
are really struggling, and it is incumbent on the Government to keep an
eye on them. Governments exist for all their citizens, just as we as
Members of Parliament represent all our constituents, whether they
voted for us or not. Certainly, they do not exist only for the 20% or
25%—or fewer, if we count those below the voting
age—who cast a vote for
them<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T19:56:39"></hs_TimeCode>. I know

is also vital for Governments to consider both the short-term and the
long-term effects of their policies. As I have said in the House
before, I believe that in the short term we need to look again at the
way in which the spare room rent subsidy is being implemented.
Increasingly, arrears are accumulating. One social housing provider in
my constituency already has arrears of 37%, and it is a good provider.
Many others have far lower collection rates. That will eventually lead
to evictions or write-offs, both of which are costly in human and
financial terms<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T19:57:40"></hs_TimeCode>.
A suggestion I have made before is that the rate for the spare room
rent should be substantially lowered from its current percentage levels
to a fairly nominal amount initially if we are to maintain the
principle, which I believe we should, and therefore make it
affordable. It should be increased only as the supply of
suitable accommodation approaches demand.</hs_Para>

right hon. Member for Oldham West and Royton mentioned sanctions, which
are applied to some of my constituents in a rather arbitrary manner. I
ask the Minister to consider the way in which the Department sanctions
jobseekers. I think it important for sanctions to exist, because we
cannot be taken for a ride, but those who are genuinely seeking work
should not be sanctioned as a result of mere technicalities, as has
happened in my
constituency<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T19:58:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011328000538" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/debtext/140113-0003.htm#14011328000538">The
Chancellor recently talked of removing benefits from those aged under
25. I shall say more in a moment about the £25 billion hole that
needs to be filled. Certainly, everything possible should be done to
ensure that the under-25s have all the support they need in the form of

<?notus-xml column=652?>education, training and work. It is clearly
important for people to see benefits as a safety net rather than a way
of life, but removal of, for instance, housing benefit from under-25s
across the board would have a drastic impact on young people who need
to live away from home and who have no support from their families.

is a friend of mine, drew my attention to the consequences that such
action would have on its excellent provision for young people, most of
whom it is trying to get into work. This is a case of supporting people
during transition. For younger people, we need to recast this support
almost as income for productive work for all those who are able, so
they get used to the idea of work, which almost all of them want
to<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T20:00:04"></hs_TimeCode> take up; but
that support must

need to do more to help councils deliver more homes, perhaps by
relaxing the existing borrowing rules for local councils, particularly
on affordable and social homes. We also need to look at the possibility
of localising employment schemes. The Work programme is doing some very
important work around the country, but I would like it to become more
local, so local councils can take more responsibility for running it in
their own areas.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T20:00:47"></hs_TimeCode> universal
credit is incredibly important and I wholeheartedly support it.
When it is introduced in each area, we should look at localising
support and giving responsibility for managing finances as much as
possible to local
councils<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T20:01:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011328000540" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/debtext/140113-0003.htm#14011328000540">Finally,
let me return to the question of the £25 billion
hole. This is a fact and it is something a future Government, of
whichever party, will have to face. There are so many ways we can
reduce it. We can raise taxes, we can cut departmental spending and we
can cut benefit and pension spending, or we can increase
growth, which clearly is the preferable option we would all like to
see. However much growth is increasing by at the moment, however, it is
not going to fill that gap in the coming years. Can we raise more in
taxes? I would rather see whether we can remove some of the
concessions, and I have mentioned before the high rate of pension tax
allowance, which is not a tax rise but is reducing the allowances
people on higher incomes can claim when making pension payments. That
costs us several billion pounds a
year<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T20:03:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011328000541" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/debtext/140113-0003.htm#14011328000541">I
do not believe there is much room to cut departmental spending in
certain areas. I would certainly not want to see any more cuts in
defence and security and schools and education, but we do need to have
a look at one or two of the existing ring fences, although perhaps over
the coming few years and not immediately. For instance, I would look at
different ways of maintaining the free-at-the-point-of-delivery
national health service—more through a progressive contributory
national insurance system than out of tax. That would be one way of
raising the income required to pay for our
free-at-the-point-of-delivery health service and giving the Chancellor
a little more wriggle-room on the £25
billion<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T20:03:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011328000542" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/debtext/140113-0003.htm#14011328000542">In
conclusion, I think it is vital to look at poverty not just in terms of
welfare reforms—important though those are and though their
impact is—but in the round at all the things the Government are
doing, whether in the field of job creation or protecting the vital
national health service and the vital schools budget. Therefore,
although I support this motion, if this inquiry is to go ahead it
should look at all those things in the round, rather than just focusing
on one or two of the points that have been
raised.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-13?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_13_PT_1/19889674354B704B9524BCC699C477A5F9EDF839" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="13 January 2014">Monday

scoff at that, and I know it works out as roughly the same amount per
year as the Prime Minister pays for a haircut, but when just a few

Liverpool with an average reduction in housing benefit of £14

Hemming</B> (Birmingham, Yardley) (LD):</Member> These debates are
important in highlighting matters of detail. I am pleased to have
signed the motion for this one, which calls for an inquiry into the
effects of the benefit system. The biggest detail involved in all this
is of course the deficit. When this Government took over, the country
was borrowing £150 billion a year, which was added on to the
debt each year. If we reduce that too quickly, however, it will cause
economic dislocation, so it will have to be reduced relatively
gradually. That is why it is surprising that the Opposition are
criticising the Government for not reducing it to zero straight away.
Obviously, we cannot do that sort of thing.</hs_Para>

important detail is universal credit. I am very supportive of universal
credit because it goes down the route of creating an environment in
which people can benefit by being in work. There are people who abuse
the benefit system, but the majority of people who receive benefits
need support from the state in order to live. It is important, when we
are dealing with the people who are abusing the system, that we do not
throw out the baby with the bathwater.</hs_Para>

have been doing some work with the 6 Towns credit union. One issue with
universal credit is that people will receive a sum of money each month
then have to pay their costs out of it. The reason for doing that is to
ensure that people who go back into work and are paid monthly do not
suddenly find themselves unable to cope financially. There is no doubt
that that prospect often makes people frightened of taking a job. The
motivation of paying universal credit on a cash-flow basis is a good
one, because it is designed to create an environment in which it is
easier for people to get into work.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14011328000567" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/debtext/140113-0003.htm#14011328000567">To<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T20:18:58"></hs_TimeCode>
achieve that, however, there must be ways for them to manage their cash
flow, because not everybody is good at that. That is why I am pleased
that the 6 Towns credit union has expanded its modus operandi and its
common bond to include a lot of Birmingham, including my constituency.
When universal credit comes in, my constituents will now have a service
towards which the Government have put some money, because they have put
money towards credit unions generally.</hs_Para>

issues need to be looked at. I always worry about the debate on food
banks, for example. If we do not look at individual cases and work out
why people are depending on food banks for three days, we cannot 
<?notus-xml column=657?>identify the problems in the system. The Trussell Trust was created in
2000, so in 1999 there was no Trussell Trust and no food banks. There
were schemes then—people would go to supermarkets and get stuff
that was out of date; there were all sorts of ways in which people
found emergency food support. The fact that we have good organisations
with good volunteers offering a good service does not mean that
suddenly everybody who is using that service is doing so as a result of
changes in Government policy. We have to review this in detail and look
at the individual
cases<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T20:20:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011328000569" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/debtext/140113-0003.htm#14011328000569">One
of the general sorts of cases I am concerned about involves people
transferring off employment and support allowance and then not being
informed enough to claim jobseeker’s allowance. I believe that
the Government are working on dealing with that. A number of
constituents have come to me with those cases when they are destitute.
My top priority is to ensure that people are not destitute. We see that
happening from time to time and we need to identify those cases.
Sometimes when I tell people that we can give them a voucher for the
food bank they tell me, “I cannot afford to cook the food, so
there is no sense in me having anything from the food bank.” It
is important to prevent people from being destitute, and I have raised
this issue directly with the Minister and in a ten-minute rule

Friend the Member for Corby (Andy Sawford), who referred to the
pernicious reforms that have been made to the council tax benefit
system. We hear a lot from the Government about freezing council tax.
That is fine and dandy for the people who have the resources not to
need council tax benefit, but the very poorest people, even in those
local authority areas that had a freeze on their council tax, are
seeing an increase in the amount of council tax they are expected to
pay. That is absolutely disgraceful, and I do not know how Ministers
can sleep in their beds at night when they are inflicting such
penalties on the poorest people in our country.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Stafford (Jeremy Lefroy) said that the commission we

important, as it should incorporate housing, too. What we saw when this
Government came to power was a massive reduction in investment in
affordable housing in our country. One of the first things they did was
to cut it by 60%—that is what they did when they first came to
power. Their housing policy is shambolic. They are not building
anywhere near enough houses for the people in our country, and the
houses they are building are too expensive—to buy or to rent.
People are caught in a Catch-22 situation. Youth unemployment is
growing, with about 1 million young people on the dole, and low pay is
endemic. As my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T20:27:25"></hs_TimeCode>

me briefly touch on my personal story, and how things have changed from
the 1970s in terms of what ordinary working-class people were able to
do and the sorts of lifestyles they were able to afford, particularly
the housing. I was a 19-year-old apprentice bricklayer when I was able
to buy my first house, with the benefit of the option mortgage brought
in by the 1974 to 1979 Labour Government. I was earning £60 a
week and I was able to buy a brand new three-bedroom house that backed
on to a hotel for £10,000. That was three times my salary then,
but it would be impossible to do the same today because the average
price paid by a first-time buyer is £185,000. I have checked on
the internet what a bricklayer can earn these days. On average, they
earn £10.28 an hour, or £21,382 a year, so the average
price for a first-time buyer would be a multiple of 8.6 times their
salary. In this day and age, an apprentice bricklayer earns around
£170 a week, or £8,840 a year, so a multiple of 21 times
their salary would be required. People can no longer put down roots in
the way that they did, because they have been priced out of the market.
I am talking not just about buying but renting as well.</hs_Para>

is vital that we build the houses that people need. Labour is committed
to building 200,000 homes per annum, which is vital in terms not just
of delivering a social need but of putting thousands and thousands of
people back into work. We need a renaissance in council housing,
because the private rented sector is ill-suited to social housing,
which has led to the obscene housing benefit subsidy system that was

take the strain it most certainly has. Some £24
billion a year is being paid out in housing benefit. According to the
House of Commons Library, £9.3 billion is going into the back
pockets of private landlords. Compare that with the £1.1 billion
this Government are putting into building affordable homes for people.
The affordable homes programme summary said that will result in just
over 67,000 homes per annum. Imagine if we put all 
<?notus-xml column=660?>that money into building homes for people. Think of
all the jobs that could be created. If we just used the amount that is
going to private landlords, we would be able to build 600,000 homes a
year. We are building nowhere near that. We have a massive housing
crisis in our country. There is a crazy housing subsidy system, which
needs to be reformed. There are 1.7 million people on the
housing waiting list across our country, 4,000 of whom are in Derby.
More and more people are reliant on the vagaries of the private rented
sector. That cannot go on. What we need is a change in emphasis. We
need a bricks and mortar subsidy to build the homes that people need.

sector and to ensure that land is released to build homes that people

investment in council housing. It is important to recognise
that for every £1 of public sector investment in infrastructure,
the Exchequer gets back 46p. As the net expenditure is somewhat less,
it is well worth making that investment to generate the apprenticeships
to which my hon. Friend referred and the jobs across the piece that are
required, and to build the homes that people need. We need this
commission. Its terms of reference should be somewhat wider than has
been set out in the motion. If we can invest in the housing that we
need, it will help to create stable communities, generate jobs and
promote economic growth. Yes, we need a commission, but we also need a

action changes level of poverty—absolute and relative poverty.
That should include what people spend their money on and what makes

about people in retirement, family deformation and mental health

hon. Member for York Central (Hugh Bayley) is no longer in the Chamber,
but he made some comments about the national debt. Most of us know the

public sector net debt and UK net borrowing, whether as a percentage of
gross national product or not.</hs_Para>

is better to understand that the previous Labour Government had some
merits. In their first three years, they stuck to the Conservative
spending plans, net debt 
<?notus-xml column=661?>did not go up and we all benefited. From 2001, there was a massive
expansion in public sector employment of 30% that was, I think,

for the first child. A Labour Chancellor asked, “What is the
point of having a family allowance? I am going to increase the married
man’s tax allowance.” Those are the arguments we come
back to 30 years later in a rather different sense. Balancing
people’s resources and needs at any one time and over a life

us not make any comments about any individual, as my hope is that many
of the people who follow us will make fewer mistakes than we did, but
if, for example, the time of family formation comes later on average
and more children are born into households that can make some
reasonable provision for them, we will be better off. At one stage, I
looked to see who was most likely to smoke, a habit that takes
£60 or £70 out of post-tax income. The answer was lone
parents on income support. We would be able to give a lone-parent
family an extra £50 or £60 of disposable income if a
third of our teenagers did not take up smoking. As those who are most
likely to take up smoking are those who were most likely to be deprived
in their early lives, we could make a difference to people’s
lives.</hs_Para>

am not absolutely certain that we should be too keen on a welfare

used to say that if someone was a lone parent, setting her up—it
is normally a her rather than a him—in independent housing at
the age of about 18 with a child, alone, is not the best thing as
parents need to learn parenting from those who are around

a home in Worthing, my present constituency, in 1966. Almost anybody
there who had a job could afford to buy a home. That has changed and it
is crazy that we have an economic system in which half the value of a
home is the site value. We must find some way of ensuring that ordinary

can also make a difference, as I did when I was involved in a small

putting people almost on salaries I made sure that they could have

has been a massive increase in poverty in this country since 2010. Some
of that is associated with welfare reforms; some is related to other
aspects of Government policy, and what is going on in the country with
low pay, wage freezes, wage cuts, and less secure forms of employment,
and all the other issues that we spend time talking about in this

particularly need to focus clearly on welfare reforms, both for those
in work and those who are not working. Since 1997-98, there has been a
decrease in poverty for most of the time. Some 28% of the population
lived in absolute poverty in 1997, but by 2010, that had dropped to
15%—still a scandalously high figure that is unacceptable in any
civilised country, but the reality was that 2.3 million
children and 2 million pensioners were lifted out of poverty in that
time. The country can be proud of that, even though, as I say, a huge
amount more needed to be done. Since 2010, absolute poverty has
increased by 1.4 million people, including 300,000 children
and 200,000 pensioners. There can be absolutely no doubt that much of
that increase in poverty has been a direct result of the coalition
Government’s policies.</hs_Para>

about some of those policies. We have had these debates already in this
place, and we have divided on many of these issues. One of the impacts
that will have the biggest cumulative effect over time is the uprating
of benefits in line with the consumer prices index instead of the
retail prices index. Of course, we already see the impact of that
change. In 2010, when the Government changed the indexation, the
difference between RPI and CPI was the difference between 4.6% and
3.1%. In every year since, RPI has been higher than CPI. Of course, the
impact on our pensions and benefits affects disproportionately those on
the lowest
incomes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011333000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/debtext/140113-0003.htm#14011333000024">Let<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T20:49:40"></hs_TimeCode>
us look at those in receipt of carer’s allowance. In April 2010
they received £53.90 a week. If that had increased under the old
system, using RPI, they would now be receiving £61.08 a week,
rather than £59.75. They are therefore £167.96 worse off

the higher rate mobility component are now £155.48 worse off a
year. Those who receive both the higher rate mobility component and the
higher care component are now £376.48 worse off a year. Those
might sound like relatively small amounts to some people, but the
reality is that those benefits are received by some of the poorest and

Indeed, when people go back to apply the next time, because it is a

the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T20:49:08"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Worthing West (Sir Peter Bottomley). I believe that our welfare

we should not fall into supporting an argument that suggests that the
system is perfect. Too many people take the view that the welfare
system is a sacred cow that should be left alone. I do not share that
view; on the contrary, I believe that self-reliance and making the
welfare state much more accountable and appropriate to people are
extremely important. I certainly believe that reforms can be made,
especially to the way that the system supports and challenges
people—and, yes, pushes them back into employment. However, when
reform of 
<?notus-xml column=665?>the welfare system is undertaken we must be certain
that we do not abandon the most vulnerable people and push them into
poverty<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T20:50:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011333000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/debtext/140113-0003.htm#14011333000036">I
will give two examples of the Government’s welfare reforms
having left vulnerable people without the safety net they need. First,
I want to talk about one of my constituents, Sheila Holt. On Friday I
met her father, Mr Kenneth Holt, and other members of her family.
Sheila is 47 years old. She had an exceptionally traumatic childhood
that I will not detail here, but needless to say it was a period of her
life that scarred her mentally. She has not worked for 27 years because
she has a severe psychiatric condition; she is unable to work. Because
of cuts, I suspect, Sheila was relatively recently persuaded to sign
off her psychiatric treatment. Soon after that, she was being pushed by
the DWP towards the back-to-work scheme. Her family advocated for her,
explaining that she had had trauma in early life and had a psychiatric
condition. They made those points strongly, but to no avail.
She<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T20:54:40"></hs_TimeCode>ila had to
start attending back-to-work classes in another town. She struggled
with meeting other people. Most importantly, no mental health support
or service was offered to her. The safety net was not there for her.
She also had to start paying the bedroom
tax<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T20:51:53"></hs_TimeCode>. Needless to
say, she was falling into poverty and beginning to worry about becoming
increasingly poor. She started to become agitated and her medication
could not keep up with her condition. On 6 December she was admitted to
Birch Hill hospital under section 3 of the Mental Health Act 1983. A
few days later, she suffered a heart attack—at the age of 47,
which is my age—and she is now in a coma.</hs_Para>

reason I tell this story is that Sheila’s family want people to
be aware that she was pushed into this situation. Soon after Sheila
started her life, she experienced terrible trauma that mentally
crippled her. The truth is that she is trying to live through the
welfare system as best she can, but the unsophisticated and haphazard
way in which it has been changed has forced a very vulnerable woman
into a terrible predicament. She had a very difficult early upbringing
and now finds herself in the situation she is in
today<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T20:53:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011333000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/debtext/140113-0003.htm#14011333000038">My
second point is about the discretionary social fund, which has provided
crisis loans to people in need. Hon. Members will be aware that in
April this year the DWP passed that responsibility on to local
authorities. They will also be aware that the fund is not ring-fenced,
and it has been open to local authorities to spend it however they
wish. For me, this came to light because a number of constituents were
presenting to me with difficulty in being able to claim any sort of
crisis loan from any sort of crisis fund. One woman who came to see me
was heavily pregnant and was being told by Rochdale council’s
social services that unless she provided a carpet in her property she
would lose the child, who would be taken into care. Ironically, the
local authority was not administering the local discretionary social
fund in a way that would enable her to claim money to be able to get
the carpet.</hs_Para>

is not an exception to the rule. I carried out some research looking at
local authorities right across the country, and it shows that the
passing down to them of this responsibility has meant that they have
set criteria far too strongly, to the point where one local authority
has spent only 1% of its budget for helping people through crisis loans
or grants. The irony is that, when the fund was administered
nationally, it encouraged 
<?notus-xml column=666?>self-reliance because it was a loan that the
recipient could pass back, but since responsibility was given to local
authorities it has not done so because it is now a grant that cannot be
passed
back.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011333000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/debtext/140113-0003.htm#14011333000040">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T20:59:41"></hs_TimeCode>
best bit came just before last Christmas, when the Government announced
that the fund will be scrapped completely from 2015. It will not exist
at all and there will be no safety net for those people who really need
it. They will be pushed towards loan sharks and money lenders. That
will certainly happen in Rochdale and, I have no doubt, in
other places as

want to spend the next few minutes discussing a few points,
particularly those that constituents have raised with me in my
surgeries and elsewhere. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation annually
monitors social exclusion and poverty and produces data on them. Its
most recent report, which was published last month, shows that
3.5 million children, or 27%, live in poverty. In some parts
of my constituency, the figure is nearly one in two. The Institute for
Fiscal Studies has said that it expects an increase of 1.1 million
children living in poverty by 2020 as a result of tax and benefit
changes<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T20:58:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011333000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/debtext/140113-0003.htm#14011333000046">Three
million parents also live in poverty. The number of pensioners living
in poverty has fallen to 1.5 million, or 14%, which is the lowest level

is only half the story, because those relative levels of poverty relate
to median incomes. The average income has gone down by 8% since 2008,
which means 
<?notus-xml column=667?>that 2 million people who would have been deemed to

have dropped.
Incomes<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T20:59:21"></hs_TimeCode> are

most worrying thing—this point has already been made—is
that we are seeing an increase in the working poor. For the first time
since the data series started back in the 1980s, poverty in working
households is higher than that in workless and retired families
combined. Therefore, work is clearly not paying. In spite of a shared
objective of wanting our welfare system to make work pay, it is not.

to the increase in the number of working households living in poverty

working families in poverty, one or more of the adults is paid less

Brown</B> (West Ham) (Lab):</Member> There is no doubt in my mind that
poverty is increasing, and that a major factor in that increase is the
vicious and misguided welfare reforms that are beginning to bite in my
community. The scale of the impact of changes to the social security
system is really quite staggering.
As<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T21:04:32"></hs_TimeCode> of September
last year, 598 households in Newham are affected by the benefit cap, of
which 75% are in the private rented sector, with all the vulnerability
that goes with that. Larger households are the worst hit: 80% of them
have three or more children. Three quarters of main claimants are women
and more than half come from lone parent households. With an average
loss of £90 a week, it is clearly families—that means
children—who are suffering at the sharp end of these
reforms.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14011333000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/debtext/140113-0003.htm#14011333000057"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T21:04:49"></hs_TimeCode>Some
2,113 households in Newham have been hit by the bedroom tax, with many
choosing to pay and stay in order to hang on to the family, social,
school and other community networks they desperately rely on. The
average loss is £16 a week. A further 25,227 households are
caught up in the council tax benefit localisation and the cut to the
overall amount available. The average loss here is £3.50 a week.
Taking all the losses across the three categories—the benefits
cap, the bedroom tax and the council tax—the loss to households
in Newham each year is £8.9 million. It is obvious from these
figures that such losses cannot be experienced without a serious impact
on families, children and the local economy.</hs_Para>

danger for policy makers and politicians is that we assess the impact
of these changes serially and separately, whereas families experience
them collectively and cumulatively.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T21:05:59"></hs_TimeCode>In our debates
in this Chamber over the past months, we have looked in detail at
issues relating directly to this subject and to the incidence of
poverty, its causes and its consequences. Food banks, zero-hours
contracts, payday loans and high-cost credit are just a few, and it is
worth reminding ourselves that each of these is not a stand-alone
issue; they are interlinked and have a cumulative and often devastating
impact on the lives of many of my constituents. Running through them
all is the imminent threat of poverty, and underpinning them all is the
spectre of the Government’s welfare reforms.</hs_Para>

2009, there was just one food bank in Newham; now there are at least
six, and at least four places where the hungry can get a free meal. The
scale of provision is indicative of the scale of the problem.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T21:06:47"></hs_TimeCode>Newham is a
place of widespread deprivation, yet it is from this community that
food is collected and donated—by schools and faith groups and
individuals paying a little extra as part of their weekly shop. These
donations are from people who absolutely understand how difficult life
is for those who have even less than they do. The poor are giving to
the even poorer.</hs_Para>

will give an example of where a food bank stepped in to help when a
failure of social security tipped Mr K into crisis. A single man in his
thirties with learning difficulties and physical disabilities, his
employment support allowance was suspended when he attended a medical.
He had no money to live on for three months and could not afford to
heat his home or pay his bills. The food bank supported him for a month
with food and advice, and assured a successful ESA appeal.
Mrs Y was supported after her husband disappeared, leaving her and the
children alone. The police suspected suicide, but her benefits were
stopped, as they were claimed by her husband. Community Links, a
fabulous voluntary sector organisation in my constituency,
supported Mrs Y with food until she could get her benefits
transferred and reinstated.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T21:08:08"></hs_TimeCode>Although food
banks have done well supporting people through crises, that shows how
“on the edge” people actually are—just about
keeping their heads above water, for ever vulnerable to the slide into
hunger because of job loss, pay or hours cuts, reduced social security
payments, or, as I have seen far too often at my surgeries, a blunder
by the Department for Work and Pensions that stops essential support,

is so wrong that in the 21st century, people are forced to rely on the
good will of neighbours to ensure their well-being. The community in
which I live is poor but always generous. The plight of those reliant
on food banks is something the commission of inquiry should
investigate. I am grateful again to Community Links, which, in order to
understand better how these changes are rolling out in our communities,
carried out in-depth quality research into the circumstances of local
people. The localisation of council tax, the benefits cap and the
bedroom tax are hitting poor people indiscriminately, regardless of
their needs or situation, and the people who responded to the survey
felt they were being stigmatised for situations over which they had no
control. There is no support to help people manage or cope with the
transition, while the survey tells us categorically that people are
struggling to make ends meet, cutting back on essential
items—heating or eating—and prioritising paying rent,
thereby exacerbating the choice between food and comfort and
safety.</hs_Para>

make them because people have lost their jobs, which is a traumatic

make them to people who are in work, but are on low incomes. Some 68%

diseases that go with it. That is particularly important for children.

want to focus on benefit rates, the Government’s policy on them
and the effect that is having on people in Britain. To go back
to the beginning, it is a bit of a misconception that UK benefit rates
are based on a systematic estimate of minimum needs. Even from the
start, back in 1948, benefit rates were a bit of a compromise between
the actual needs and what was deemed to be affordable. Even by the time
they were introduced, Rowntree had researched the fact that social need
was an additional need to physical need. However, that was not
recognised from the beginning. Although things were rather patchy until
April 1975, in general, benefits increased in line with inflation.
Since then, successive Governments have uprated benefits in line with
inflation, mostly using the retail prices index until 2011. It is only
from then onwards that we have seen the breaking of the link between
inflation and the rates at which benefits
rise.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011333000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/debtext/140113-0003.htm#14011333000066">Universal<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T21:13:04"></hs_TimeCode>
credit will be subject to annual review, but not to mandatory uprating.
There is a huge danger that it will fall behind inflation. However,
well before we get to universal credit, with its myriad problems, which
are not helped by the sheer incompetence with which it is being
introduced, the Government should be looking at the impact of the
Welfare Benefits Up-rating Act 2013. Most working-age benefits have
been limited to rises of 1% a year, and yet the costs of basic items
such as food and energy—the very basics of life—are
rising by significantly more. Even Government estimates suggest that
there may be 200,000 more children in poverty, and the Child Poverty
Action Group estimates that there could be 1 million more children in
poverty by
2020<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T21:13:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011333000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/debtext/140113-0003.htm#14011333000067">Which
benefits have been affected? Let us look at the list. The first is tax
credits, which have a huge impact. We called the cut to tax credits the
strivers’ tax, because it affects people who are desperately

and patching together a few hours here and a few hours there. They are

there are enormous differences depending on the family
circumstances and who lives in the household, but essentially, if
somebody who is getting housing benefit 
<?notus-xml column=671?>gets additional income, roughly 65% of it will go straight into a cut in
their housing benefit. So in order to get an extra £15 a person
effectively has to earn £45, and to get an extra £25 they
effectively have to earn about £75. That does not take into
account the transport costs to get to work and so on. That is a couple

could make £3 billion of savings simply by helping
people to earn more and pay more tax. They would then not need as much
in the way of tax credits. We will have a house building programme that
will put people into social housing at more sensible rents, thereby

McDonnell</B> (Hayes and Harlington) (Lab):</Member> The question was
asked earlier about how we pay off the deficit. There was a choice when
the economic crisis hit: should those who created the economic crisis
pay for it, or should the others? This Government decided that the
poorest in our society would pay. To enable that to happen there had to
be some form of ideological attack on the poorest—the latest
example is the programme “Benefits Street”—that
identifies a group of people and demonstrates that they somehow stand
for all those people who are dependent on benefits. That is then used
as a justification to cut benefits overall.</hs_Para>

reality, as has been said time and time again, is that some of the
people suffering hardest are those who are in work. In two weeks time
in this city, the BAFTAs will be hosted again at the Royal Opera House.
That weekend, the cleaners will be on strike and picketing outside. I
will be joining them, because they are on just above the minimum wage,
not on a living wage, and cannot afford to live in the city in which
they work. A whole range of constituencies outside London have been
mentioned. London and the south-east have an image of wealth, with gold
pavements and so on, but there is a growing underclass in London of
people in dire poverty.</hs_Para>

anxiety and anger we have is that in two weeks the cleaners will go on
strike because they have no other option. They are trying to get their
employers to negotiate a London living wage, while this week the bank
bonuses will be announced. Goldman Sachs has already explained that it
looks like it will have a bumper year. We are back to pre-crisis bonus
levels. I raised this with the Chancellor and, to give him his due, he
actually said that there is an issue that we have to address. We have
been told that in one company the average bonus payment is £2.7
million per member of staff. This is the contrast we have: people in
work are struggling to just maintain a roof over their heads, feed and
clothe their children and have a decent standard of income. At the same
time, we have the profligacy and obscene levels of bonuses returning.

have been given of the range of cuts that have been made. I will be
frank: I do not know how people in my constituency survive on the
income they are getting. I have no idea how they can afford to live on
the minimal income that they are getting. We will have a debate in a
few weeks’ time about the WOW petition and people with
disabilities, who are among some of the hardest hit. However, the
latest statistics show that we have 13,000 children in my borough
living in poverty, and it is a relatively wealthy borough. We are a
working-class area with high levels of employment and, usually, not bad
levels of income, but even in my constituency we are seeing child
poverty on a scale that we have not seen since the second world war,
with all the problems associated with that.</hs_Para>

of the main problems has been touched on by others: the fact that
people cannot afford a roof over their heads. House prices have gone
through the roof. People cannot afford them on the incomes they are
getting, but what do the Government do? They increase rents in the
social sector—in council housing and social housing—and
at the same time cut benefits. The argument put forward by the
Government—it has some logic to it—was that if they cut
benefits, somehow the landlords would stop charging higher rents, but
the reverse has happened. Rents have gone up in my area. Getting a
three-bedroom property in the private rented sector means spending
between £1,200 and £1,600 a month, and we are not talking
about high standards of property. We are just talking about the roof
over people’s heads.</hs_Para>

people go to the council, the discretionary money that has been awarded
does not meet the difference between the loss of benefits and the rents
they are now being charged. What is happening, therefore—this is
the irony of it—is homelessness on a scale that we have not seen
for perhaps two decades and children living in 
<?notus-xml column=673?>bed and breakfasts again. We were promised that that would never happen
again, and it is happening. Children are living in appalling conditions
in bed and breakfasts, and then they are farmed out round the country,
which completely disrupts their education and breaks down the
connections with their wider family. That destabilises whole families
as well, because people under that pressure begin to implode. It is
therefore no wonder that we have family breakdown increasing in many of
our areas as a result of the financial pressures that people are
under.</hs_Para>

introduced it—working, yes, with Beveridge, the Liberals and

McDonnell:</Member></B> I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman was
here under the last Government, but I was one of those who argued for a
massive redistribution of wealth to tackle poverty in this country, and
I will continue to argue that point. I do not think that any of the
parties should get into this Dutch auction about who can be more brutal
towards the poor, but from the detail of the policy being advocated by
the Opposition that I have heard, it is about achieving growth, getting
people back into employment, ensuring a fair system of redistribution
of wealth in this country and—this is the point my right hon.
Friend the Member for Oldham West and Royton (Mr Meacher)
made—ensuring that people pay their taxes. At the moment we are
living in a corporate kleptocracy, where corporations steal and rob
from us through tax avoidance and tax evasion. If we could have some of
that back, not only could we tackle the deficit, but that
redistribution of wealth could take place and we could lift people out
of poverty, provide the homes they need and give them back the life
chances that this Government are stealing from
them.</hs_Para>

is a need for some good research into what is going on—research
that would very much form part of a commission. I want to give an
example of research started by the previous Government that is not
being conducted by this Government—in this case, research into
the employment and support allowance and the 
<?notus-xml column=674?>work capability assessment. The last Government commissioned research
into what happened to people who had been found fit for work. After
three months, 22% were back in employment and 41% were on another
benefit. There were still some missing people, but there was no
explanation of where they were. After a year, only 23%—there was
hardly any increase—were back in employment. However, 43% of
those people were neither in employment nor on any other out-of-work
benefits. Now 43% is an awful lot of individuals, but this research
stopped so we do not know what has been going on since; we do not know
whether the pattern has been consistent over the last few years. If it
is the case, there are a lot of unexplained outcomes in respect of
people living in great poverty.</hs_Para>

issue is not just about people who have somehow been benefit dependent
for all their lives. Professor Fothergill of Sheffield Hallam
university recently gave evidence to the Work and Pensions Select
Committee, and he pointed out that some of those most affected are
couples in their 50s. Typically, people will be affected most by
becoming ill at that stage in their lives, when illness really does
begin to rack up and benefits for illness are most likely to be
received. What happens if, say, a couple has one and a half incomes and
has been comfortably off with the children grown up and a reasonable
income coming in, but the main earner falls ill? There will be an
immediate big loss of income because of the illness in itself. After a
year, if that individual goes into the workplace activities group,
which many do, they will lose even their employment and support
allowance. At that stage, another £91 is lopped off their
household income—and all this at a time when the costs are
probably increasing because they are likely to be at home longer and
have more heating bills to
pay<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T21:26:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011333000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/debtext/140113-0003.htm#14011333000087">If
this couple are council or housing association tenants, they might well
have a spare room and will also be hit by the bedroom tax. The second
means test applied by many councils for discretionary housing payments
will probably mean that, because there is still an earner in the
household—albeit probably a part-time earner—they will
not qualify for discretionary housing payment. They will be deemed to
have sufficient income over the absolute basic amount for them to have
this extra payment. After working for 35, 40 or perhaps even more
years, this couple will have experienced a huge tumble from being
comfortable to being in really straitened circumstances. If they have
made any savings over their working period towards their retirement,
the chances are that when they reach pension age, they will have been
entirely eroded, creating further problems for the future.</hs_Para>

irony in all this is that many of the measures introduced—I
would hope that the research would cover this issue—are not
actually making any great savings. We have heard a lot about the
bedroom tax not making much in savings, but it is not the only thing.
Housing benefit payments are due to increase, which the Office for
Budget Responsibility has factored into its assessment. Why? Because
half the expected increase—a substantial increase—is due
to people in employment who will qualify for the benefit. Fewer people
may be receiving jobseeker’s allowance at one end of the system,
but further along the system, more will receive housing benefit. For
one set of savings, there is a comparable set of costs. We have to look
at that.</hs_Para>

are not making the savings we think we are, and I believe the same is
true of the employment and support allowance. There is a big mystery
here. The number of people in receipt of that sort of benefit has gone
down by far fewer than the number of people who have been found fit for
work. What on earth is going on? I suspect that many people have simply
come around through the system again. They were not well; they had to
apply for benefit again. We are putting people through a lot of trauma

Lazarowicz</B> (Edinburgh North and Leith) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> I am
glad to have the opportunity to say a few words. I wanted to speak in
the debate to make the point that the crisis caused by the
Government’s welfare reform policies is affecting constituencies
up and down the length of the country and is affecting all
types of constituency. My constituency comes out about average
on the statistical lists of poverty, employment, unemployment and
wealth in the UK. We have some areas of high wealth with wealthy
individuals, but other areas, and some individuals living in the
generally richer areas of the constituency, are suffering from the
effects of Government policy in a way that has not been seen for a
generation. That experience is evidenced by the growing demand for and
reliance on food banks, soup kitchens and other outlets that provide
free food. One such food bank was opened in my constituency last year,
and another is under way. Another six, seven or eight organisations
provide support of various kinds which enables people to survive from
day to day, but, given the shortage of time, I shall not list them

many other Members have pointed out today, food banks are a symptom of
a wider problem. People depend on them for a host of reasons. Sanctions
are one of the most important, but others are the delays and mistakes
caused by all the changes and complications that the Government are
increasingly imposing on those who rely on benefits, and the effects of
their economic policies, such as the need for people to rely on
part-time work when they want to work full-time.</hs_Para>

little about what is happening in my city of Edinburgh, and also to
explain why I think that a commission of inquiry would be a good way of
at least trying to inject some sense into the attitudes that were
expressed during DWP questions earlier today. It appears that most
members of the coalition believe that numerous people living in large
houses are desperately avoiding moving to smaller houses, and fighting
off all the people who are trying to move into the larger houses. In
fact, that is happening almost nowhere in the country. In my
constituency, many people who live in under-occupied houses are in
houses for which there would not be a great demand if they became
vacant.</hs_Para>

all, in Edinburgh and elsewhere, the number of people who could
possibly qualify for smaller, one-bedroom accommodation is vastly
greater than the number of such homes that are available. According to
a figure that I saw a few weeks ago—and I have no reason to
believe that it has changed since then—more than 3,000 people
were living in under-occupied housing, according to the
Government’s definition, and a further 14,000 were on the
waiting list for one-bedroom houses. 
<?notus-xml column=676?>In that week, only 24 one-bedroom homes were
available in any part of the council or the social housing sector. A
commission of inquiry might at least get some awareness of the reality

will not happen. However, given that this is a Back-Bench rather than a
Government or an Opposition motion, I hope that at least some members
of the coalition parties will show the humanity that others have shown

extent needs to be assessed, and will stand along with those in the

few Government Members turned up to speak, but I am sure that
Government Members had other interesting things to do. I should add
that I thought that the speech of
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T21:34:01"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Stafford (Jeremy Lefroy) was insightful as well. It had barely a
partisan bone in it, and I commend the hon. Gentleman for the views
that he espoused
tonight<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T21:34:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011333000096" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/debtext/140113-0003.htm#14011333000096">Let
me begin by listing some facts on which I hope we can all agree. We all
believe that the best route out of poverty is work, that those who can
work should work, that those who need help to work should receive that
help, that a civilised nation cares for the vulnerable, that at times
we may all need the support of the state to get back on our feet, that
a strong national health service, free at the point of delivery, is a
key part of getting people back into work, and that education cannot
stop at 16 or at 18 or, for that matter, at 21 if people are to acquire
the skills that they need in order to prosper in a fiercely competitive
world.</hs_Para>

colleagues have been referring to what we will do when we form the
Government in 2015, the Minister has, on several occasions, been heard
chuntering, “Oh yes, the shadow Secretary of State says
you’re going to be tougher on welfare.” We are, because
we know that the best way to be tough on the welfare budget is to get
people into work. We are absolutely determined that we will not do what
this Government did immediately on coming into power in 2010, which
was, without a shred of evidence, to abolish the future jobs fund that
was giving young people an opportunity. We will do exactly the
opposite. We will bring in a jobs guarantee for every under
24-year-old, because we have seen what is happening in Wales where a
new scheme has been brought in to replace what this Government have
been doing and that has put 7,748 young people into work. Some 80% of
those jobs are in the private sector and 96% of those who have gone
into those jobs 
<?notus-xml column=677?>have then gone into full-time employment. That is being tough on the
welfare budget—not being tough on the recipients of welfare, but
being tough on the welfare budget—and that is exactly what we
intend to
do<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T21:36:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011333000098" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/debtext/140113-0003.htm#14011333000098">We
all know that there are areas of the country that have suffered
deprivation for decades. Those are the places—in particular, the
mining, shipbuilding and iron and steel cities and towns of this
country—where one industry flourished, dominated and then died.
That is what many of the speeches this afternoon have been about.
However, the indices of deprivation come not single spies, but in
battalions. All too often, with poverty comes poor housing, poor
educational attainment and poor diet, as well as high levels of
long-term unemployment, disability, mental health problems, obesity,
malnutrition, teenage pregnancy, ischaemic heart disease, type 1 and
type 2 diabetes and also, therefore,
blindness<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T21:36:48"></hs_TimeCode>. The
poor die younger and are more likely to die of their first coronary or
their first stroke. They are more likely to be the victims of crime,
especially violent crime. Each of those problems exacerbates the other,
so we have a vicious circle of poverty with children trapped by their
parents’ opportunities or lack of ambitions. In short, all too
often poverty is hereditary in Britain—as hereditary as the
monarchy or, for that matter, a place at Eton.</hs_Para>

image that those on the right would have us all subscribe to of those
living in poverty is far from the truth. Often the poor work the
hardest, at the least hospitable hours, with poor protection and for
paltry pay. Frequently, as many Members have said, they take several
jobs to be able to pay to put food on the table. They travel for hours
to work because they cannot afford properties in expensive places where
there are more jobs. Because they take pride in the ability to stand on
their own two feet, they often refuse to claim all they are entitled to
or to accept charity. We should applaud them, not denigrate
them.</hs_Para>

Secretary of State came to Merthyr Tydfil and told everybody that the
answer to their problems if they were out of work was to get on a bus
down to Cardiff, he simply did not know the facts. First, there are not
buses that will get people to Cardiff in time for most jobs on low pay
that start very early in the morning. Secondly, if they are going to be
doing shift work, they cannot possibly rely on buses to get them to
work. Thirdly, there are eight people applying for every job that is
available in Cardiff so the situation is not much better than in
Merthyr Tydfil. Most importantly, if people are spending half of their
daily wage every day on getting on the bus to work and getting back
home, the likelihood is that they are not going to be able to make work

Food<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T21:39:34"></hs_TimeCode> prices have
risen far more on average than those of other goods, and that has hit
many poor families. According to Which?<I> </I>over the last six years

nearly half of consumers now say they are spending a larger proportion

receiving benefits. There is no way out of this; the Government cannot
avoid responsibility. Yes, charities are picking up the difference, but
that is not the kind of society we should be living in. On top of that,
the National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations,
said that a survey of 51 of its biggest members found that more than
half their residents affected by the bedroom tax—32,432
people—were unable to pay their rent between April and June last

person a week—or £3.30 a day—on food. Those were
people in work, and for those with school-age children, £1.80 of
that daily allowance was going towards a school dinner. Households were
spending an average of £26 a week on gas and electricity, which
equated to 10% of gross income. That was in July, not during the winter

quarter to a third, that the number of people having no money left each

spend on food per person per day had gone down from £3 to
£2.10. It also found that households were spending 16% more on

the first time ever, the number of those in work and in poverty is
higher than the number out of work. The number of those in debt, in

that is a point that could be clarified later. If the commission were
to be granted, we could have a worthwhile review of and inquiry into

one particular party, so it is difficult to see how we could appraise

Member for Worthing West gave a wide-ranging speech. I will have to

our communities. In particular, they stop that man with a threatening

hon. Member for North Ayrshire and Arran talked about discretionary
payments and the fact that people have to apply again and again. There
is nothing in the rules that says it should be for three months or for
any other time scale. It is plainly obvious in many cases that an
individual will be able to receive the payment for the long term and
that the local authority should be able to rule on that. As we said at
Question Time today, most local authorities are not using all their
discretionary payments, and those that have can apply for extra
payments under the scheme. We are looking forward to seeing how we can
take that forward to ensure that we can give those assurances
to local authorities. It is important that when Members go back
to their constituencies they speak to their local authorities about
what they should be doing, because there is no rule on the matter. My
own local authority is using the three-month rule and there is no need
for that in many cases. Local authorities should look at individuals
rather than the numbers.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Rochdale made an important speech and a good
contribution to the debate, not least because he accepted from the
outset that welfare reform is imperative. I was slightly concerned
during his speech by the idea that if we are not careful, we might
start thinking that all welfare reform will have a massive effect. In
many ways, welfare reform can have a beneficial effect on people,
particularly those who have been out of work for a considerable amount
of time and, thinking of my portfolio, those who have disabilities or
long-term illnesses and have not been able to get back into work. For
instance, the Access to Work programme is often the key to getting
those people back in to work. It is important that we understand how
the different schemes work and that hon. Members ensure that there is
understanding in their constituencies.</hs_Para>

must first declare a double interest as chairman of the all-party
parliamentary group on dentistry and as a very part-time practising
dentist. This means that I am a member of the profession that faces the
detection and treatment of the appalling disease of oral cancer. Over
the years I have detected perhaps seven cases among my patients. We
picked them up at a very early stage, and I believe that as a result
those involved were all successfully operated on and treated without
disfigurement, and survived.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14011333000285" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/debtext/140113-0004.htm#14011333000285"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T22:12:33"></hs_TimeCode>I
recall being called in by a colleague for a second opinion on a patient
who was very well known in the media. I confirmed my colleague’s
opinion that the small growth behind the lower right wisdom tooth was
cancer. My colleague referred him to a specialist oral surgeon. The
patient then disappeared off our horizon. He did not return for regular
check-ups or go to the oral surgeon. As I said, he was a famous media
personality. About two years later, news reports stated that he had
died in spite of late treatment involving massive oral surgery
disfigurement.
As<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T22:13:13"></hs_TimeCode> we later
discovered, he had not wanted to hear my advice or my
colleague’s. He went to see his GP, who gave him a bottle of
some green fluid to paint on the ulcer, thus allowing the cancer to
grow. This sad example indicates the first problem of oral
cancer—that there is insufficient awareness among the public,
among general medical practitioners, and even, regrettably, within the
dental
profession.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011333000286" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/debtext/140113-0004.htm#14011333000286">Last<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T22:13:37"></hs_TimeCode>
November, there were two cancer campaigns. The campaign on prostate
cancer—Movember—caught the public imagination thanks to
the proliferation of sometimes quite hideous hairy growths just under
the nose on predominately male faces. The other campaign was an oral
cancer awareness campaign. It was very successful within the dental
profession but did not catch the public awareness. This is deeply
disturbing, first, because prevention and cure is possible if the
disease is found easily and early, and secondly, because of the
increasing prevalence of the disease.</hs_Para>

latest available reports and figures relating to oral cancer do not
make encouraging reading. In short, the problem is worsening each year
and is set to continue to do so unless decisive action is taken on a
national level.
Across<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T22:14:32"></hs_TimeCode> the
globe, oral cancer is now one of the 10 most common neoplasms.
About 6,000 new cases of oral cancer are reported annually in the UK,
with 1,800 deaths related to the disease each year. The
total number of new cases per annum has been steadily rising for the
past three decades, to the extent that there are now 35% more new cases
a year than 30 years ago.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T22:15:08"></hs_TimeCode> problem has
become so acute that oropharyngeal cancer is the fastest growing cancer

I alluded to earlier, a key factor is late diagnosis, which brings me
to my first point. Public awareness would be a huge help. Yawning is
really dangerous, Mr Speaker, from a dentist’s point of
view. That lump—that ulcer—in the mouth, particularly if
it is painless, needs to be seen by a dentist. More dentists should be
aware and look at the soft tissue, not just the
teeth.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011333000289" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/debtext/140113-0004.htm#14011333000289">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T22:15:52"></hs_TimeCode>
second and third factors are tobacco and excess alcohol, particularly
when the two are combined. I will not dwell on them, because the
Minister, the Government and previous Governments are well aware of the
detrimental health factors relating to both. Dentists have a role to
play, particularly in persuading their patients to give up tobacco
smoking. I suspect that the Minister will enlighten us a little further
on that in due

fourth factor, and the one on which I believe decisive action can be
taken, is tackling the human papillomavirus. It is a very large family
of viruses that infect the skin and lining of the cervix, vagina,
anus, mouth and throat. There are two groups. One
group—HPV 6 and 11—are relatively low risk, causing
laryngeal and genital warts, while the other group carry a high risk of
causing cancer. They are key in causing 13 different types of cancers,
but of these viruses perhaps HPV 16 is the most
dangerous.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011333000291" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/debtext/140113-0004.htm#14011333000291">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T22:16:57"></hs_TimeCode>
last figures I have quickly managed to find on new cases of HPV-related
cancers in the UK are from 2009, when 7,538 females and 6,484 males
were affected. In 2010, 2,016 males and 2,253 females died in the UK as
a result of HPV-associated cancers, namely cervical, penile, vaginal,
vulval, laryngeal and oral. In UK males, the greatest proportion of
those cancers involved new cases and deaths as a result of oral cancer.
In females, oral cancer is a relatively close second to

number of annual cases of HPV-causing cancers in men is rising
significantly. They are not just oral cancers; they cover other areas
as well. Indeed, if recent incident trends continue, the annual number

that trend will be affected by the success of HPV vaccines, which are
advocated in this country for women but not for men. That is a little
odd, because it appears that fewer men than women produce an immune
response to HPV infection. HPV vaccines protect against HPV infection
and disease, including cancers, in men as well as

policy of vaccinating both males and females is producing herd
immunity. The effect on HPV diseases, including cancers, has been quite
dramatic. The last chart I happened to see showed a 90% decline in the

genital warts, caused by HPV, at a Melbourne sexual health

achieve real herd immunity for all such

HPV-associated diseases.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T22:19:40"></hs_TimeCode> therefore put
it to the Minister that it is not fair, ethical or socially responsible
to have a public health 
<?notus-xml column=688?>policy that leaves 50% of the population vulnerable
to infection. Such vaccination, combined with early detection and
action on smoking and heavy drinking of alcohol, could save a huge
number of lives just as we face a dramatic increase in oral cancer. I

my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T22:20:21"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford) on securing a debate on
this important issue. It is a very current one, as I responded to a
debate in Westminster Hall on HPV only last week. I will return to that

want to restate the Government’s commitment to making England
among the best in Europe in improving all cancer outcomes, including
for oral cancers. As part of that, we are committed to reducing the
incidence or oral cancers, improving diagnosis rates when it occurs and
of course improving outcomes for people diagnosed with the disease. My
hon. Friend mentioned the fact that the earlier the oral cancer is
caught, the more successful that can
be.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011333000299" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/debtext/140113-0004.htm#14011333000299">My
hon. Friend outlined the scale
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T22:21:07"></hs_TimeCode>of the challenge
and, as he said, the numbers are quite stark. In 2011, the latest year
for which we have information, more than 6,000 people in England were
diagnosed with an oral cancer, and in the same year, more than
1,600 people died of the disease. That is, as it were, a
milestone in a significant and worrying increase in incidence since the
1970s.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011333000300" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/debtext/140113-0004.htm#14011333000300">My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T22:21:41"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend touched on some of the issues, and
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T22:21:31"></hs_TimeCode> explanation
for the trend relates to changes in the prevalence of the major risk
factors for oral cancer, particularly heavy alcohol consumption and
smoking. It is estimated that more than three quarters of cancers
affecting the upper aerodigestive tract, including oral cancers, are
caused by alcohol and tobacco. There are also such factors as the
chewing of betel quid, which is more common among some south-east Asian
populations. That is a risk factor for oral cancer and may have
contributed to the
trend.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011333000301" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/debtext/140113-0004.htm#14011333000301">Reducing<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T22:22:02"></hs_TimeCode>
the damage done to the health of the population though smoking and
harmful drinking is absolutely a high priority if we are to make
progress on tackling oral cancers. My hon. Friend will be aware of some
of the health initiatives that we have taken, particularly the tobacco
control plan and our alcohol strategy, which we continue to pursue with
some real
energy<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T22:22:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011333000302" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/debtext/140113-0004.htm#14011333000302">I
am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising the issue of HPV, which, as I
have said, was recently a subject of interest in Westminster Hall. It
is good that it is being debated so thoroughly, including in making the
link to the different kinds of cancer with which HPV is associated. He
will know that there is growing evidence that the human papillomavirus,
which is already linked to the development of the more than 99% of
cases of cervical cancer in women, is a major risk factor for about a
quarter of head and neck cancer
cases.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011333000303" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/debtext/140113-0004.htm#14011333000303">If<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T22:23:00"></hs_TimeCode>
we can reduce incidence of HPV in females through high uptake of the
national vaccination programme, a reduction of other HPV-associated
cancers in females and males is likely to follow, but I will pick up my
hon. Friend’s good point about herd immunity. Since 2008, more
than 6 million doses of vaccine have been given in 
<?notus-xml column=689?>the UK, with 87% of the routine cohort of girls completing a three-dose
course in the 2011-12 academic year. That is one of the highest uptakes
of any vaccination programme in the developed
world.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011333000304" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/debtext/140113-0004.htm#14011333000304">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T22:23:33"></hs_TimeCode>
know that my hon. Friend is keen that HPV vaccination should become
universal. When the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation
first developed its recommendations, it concluded that should vaccine
uptake among girls be high, the vaccination of boys was likely to
provide little additional benefit in preventing cervical cancer in
girls, which was of course the primary purpose of that vaccination
programme. That result proved to be the case in the
UK<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T22:24:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011333000305" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/debtext/140113-0004.htm#14011333000305">The
JCVI has, however, recognised that the protection that accrues
from reduced transmission from vaccinated girls under the current
programme may not be provided to men who have sex with men. In last
week’s debate,
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T22:24:19"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Finchley and Golders Green (Mike Freer) introduced the
idea that in some places, particularly those where a large number of
people were born abroad or travel abroad, such factors are also a
threat to the argument about herd
immunity.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011333000306" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/debtext/140113-0004.htm#14011333000306">In
October 2013, the JCVI agreed to set up a sub-committee on HPV
vaccination to assess, among other issues, extending the programme, as
a priority, to men who have sex with men, to adolescent boys or to
both. The HPV sub-committee is scheduled to meet for the first time on
20 January, when it will assess currently available scientific evidence
and consider what further evidence is required to advise the Committee
on the suitability of possible changes to the HPV
programme<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T22:25:10"></hs_TimeCode>. Any
proposals for the vaccination of additional groups will require
supporting evidence to show that it would be a cost-effective use of
NHS resources, as my hon. Friend would expect.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T22:25:22"></hs_TimeCode>Public Health
England has begun preliminary modelling to assess the impact and
cost-effectiveness of vaccinating men who have sex with men in
anticipation of further guidance when the HPV sub-committee meets. It
plans then to undertake further work to assess the impact and
cost-effectiveness of vaccinating adolescent boys against HPV
infection.</hs_Para>

are complex issues, and the development of the evidence base, including
mathematical models, by Public Health England, as well as the
Committee’s deliberations, will take time. That process is
important for ensuring that decisions are made using the best quality
evidence, so we cannot hurry it. I explored with officials the
possibility of taking those decisions more rapidly, but that relates to
the quality of the evidence being assessed and the necessity of
building the right models. That brings with it the concerns that my
hon. Friend and other hon. Members have raised about fitting in with
the timetable for vaccine procurement, and on that I can give a little
reassurance. Should the JCVI recommend the targeted vaccination of men
who have sex with men, flexibility in the contracted volumes within the
current vaccine contract may allow such a programme to be undertaken
without the need for a new round of vaccine procurement, if additional
vaccine is available from the manufacturer in the required
quantities<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T22:26:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011333000308" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/debtext/140113-0004.htm#14011333000308">I
also undertook last week to explore with officials the flexibility in
our contract and the potential for extending it to give us time to
negotiate different procurement arrangements in the event that the JCVI
makes that recommendation for adolescent boys, who 
<?notus-xml column=690?>obviously comprise a much larger cohort. We are not quite certain yet,
but I am fairly sure that we are getting promising signals about the
possibility of flexibility in those contract negotiations. I hope that
gives my hon. Friend some reassurance that if that is what the
Committee recommends, we would be in a position to respond without
missing an entire procurement cycle, but I will continue to look at
that closely.</hs_Para>

want to take this opportunity to talk not just about prevention, but to
remember the importance of rapid diagnosis. My hon. Friend graphically
illustrated the tragic consequences of late diagnosis or of an early
diagnosis being ignored. With early-stage diagnosis, five-year survival
rates are more than 80%, which is very good by the standard of these
things. Clearly, doctors and dentists have a vital role to play. Since
2005, the “Referral Guidelines for Suspected Cancer”,
published by NICE, have supported GPs in identifying symptoms of oral
cancer and urgently referring patients. That guidance is currently
being updated.</hs_Para>

all dentists are now aware that patients presenting for dental care is
an opportunity—quite rightly, as my hon. Friend said—to
assess any symptoms that might suggest oral cancer and refer them if
appropriate. A new patient pathway being piloted in 94
practices—he might be aware of this—includes an oral
health assessment requiring dentists to examine the soft tissue of the
mouth; assess a patient’s risk factor in relation to oral
cancer; and offer advice on lifestyle
changes<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-13T22:28:47"></hs_TimeCode>. Given
what we have said about the relevance of lifestyle to the potential for
developing oral cancer, that is very important. Those pilots are under

a cancer has been diagnosed, both dentists and GPs can use an urgent
referral pathway to ensure patients get rapid treatment. The latest

head and neck cancer, including oral cancer, were seen by a specialist
within two weeks, which is excellent progress. To ensure that patients
get appropriate treatment, NHS England published a service
specification for head and neck cancer last summer. This was based on
NICE guidance and set out what NHS England expects to be in place for

to no objections being received, I intend to authorise a gift of
equipment as part of the United Kingdom’s contribution to the
international effort following United Nations Security Council
Resolution 2118, which requires Syria to complete elimination of all
chemical weapons material in the first half of 2014. I have today, in
accordance with the usual parliamentary procedures, laid a departmental

support of the resolution, the United States has made a formal request
for the United Kingdom to assist in the elimination of Syria’s
chemical warfare stockpiles through provision of specialist equipment.
The “gifting” in this case is therefore to the United
States Government, who are taking the leading role in the international
effort to support the UN and the Organisation for the Prohibition of
Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and making a substantial financial investment
to this end. The US will use a field deployable hydrolysis system to
render the chemical warfare agents unusable as weapons; the proposed UK
equipment package will allow stored chemicals to be processed at a
higher
rate.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1401133000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/wmstext/140113m0001.htm#1401133000010">The
UK contribution comprises a training package and specialist equipment
to support the neutralisation of chemical warfare agents, as well as
sufficient spare parts and consumable items. The total cost of the
proposed UK contribution will depend on the level of consumables
required but will be in the region of £2.5 million,
which can be met within existing cross-Whitehall funds. This capability
will be pivotal in providing the international community with the
capacity to support the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical
Weapons in its mission to destroy the Syrian chemical warfare agents
within UN dictated time scales. The UN schedule for destruction is
necessarily ambitious and the UK system will enable the US field
hydrolysis teams to 
<?notus-xml column=22?>maintain a higher throughput of materials into their system. The US
approached the UK to support this primary activity from our domestic
industry as they would not have been able to procure the device
themselves within the time frames set by the UN/OPCW

also strongly dispute the evidence base stated in the EU
Commission’s impact assessment which estimates that 20% of new
psychoactive substances have a legitimate use. While the proposed new
psychoactive substances directive cites a title V legal base, the

recognise the right of the UK to opt out. We will remain a full and

psychoactive substances pose a significant global challenge and the
decision to opt out should not in any way be considered to diminish our
commitment to tackle this issue. As I informed Parliament on 12
December, the coalition Government is conducting a review into new
psychoactive substances, and alongside our programme of work, we are
looking at a range of options including legislative ones to enable us
to deal with the dangers many of these substances present even more
speedily and effectively. The international comparators study begun by
my predecessor has been useful in identifying different approaches
adopted around the world and those approaches are being examined as
part of this
work.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment></System><System type="Petitions" ColStart="13"><?date 2014-01-13?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_13_PT_1/16D65A8834CB4DCD94E90BA6A83A19F90B62A6C0" __version__="1.1"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="13 January 2014">Monday

individual’s capacity to litigate is assessed under the
principles of the Mental Capacity Act 2005. In particular, that Act
states a presumption that a person  
<?notus-xml column=14?>must be assumed to have capacity unless it is established that he lacks
it. The philosophy of the Act is to maximise the scope for people to
make their own decisions and for an individual to be treated as unable
to do so only if all practicable steps for assisting him or her to make
the decision have been exhausted. The courts had already adopted the
presumption that all adults are competent to manage their property and
affairs, and accordingly that it is for the person alleging incapacity
to displace that presumption and to prove incapacity, not for an adult
to prove his own capacity (the leading case prior to the 2005 Act being
<I>Masterman Lister v. Brutton [2002] EWHC
417</I>).</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14011312000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/petntext/140113p0001.htm#14011312000015">The
assessment of litigation capacity is a matter for the court to decide
in the individual case—it is categorically not a decision for
other parties nor for the affected party’s lawyers. Given the
presumption of capacity, the courts must consider the matter with great
care, and in particular must do so on the basis of evidence, including
medical evidence. The affected party must be notified of any proposal
to question their capacity, and is entitled to present (or instruct
lawyers to present) their case on the point to the court, calling such
evidence (including medical evidence) as is appropriate. They are of
course also entitled to challenge the evidence presented against their
position in the usual way, and a decision by the court that they lack
capacity would be capable of appeal, where appropriate, on the usual
principles and procedure. As with any other issue in proceedings, the
affected party can simply concede that he or she lacks capacity, but
that would be a decision only the affected party is entitled to
make.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14011312000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/petntext/140113p0001.htm#14011312000016">Litigation
capacity is a fundamental concern and the courts have been very clear
as to the importance they place on the right of an individual to
conduct litigation in their own right. In particular, capacity is
considered in an “issue specific” way, so that it is
accepted that a person may not have capacity to conduct one kind of
litigation, but this does not prevent them being found to have capacity
regarding the conduct of another sort of case subsequently—the
issue will be looked at in the context of the specific
case.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14011312000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/petntext/140113p0001.htm#14011312000017">Where
a party lacks capacity, this has very important consequences requiring
not only the appointment of a litigation friend for the protection of
their own interests, but to protect other parties too. First, if a
party does in fact lack capacity, it is important that they are able to
continue asserting their rights through the courts (or indeed defending
their position) and do not lose that opportunity through the lack of
capacity. Therefore, the appointment of a litigation friend, as a
consequence of a finding by the court of a lack of capacity ensures
that the affected party’s case can be properly litigated despite
the lack of capacity. It should be noted that a person may not be
appointed as a litigation friend by court order unless they satisfy the
court that (a) they can fairly and properly conduct the proceedings on
the part of the affected party, and (b) they have no adverse interest
to the affected
party.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14011312000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/petntext/140113p0001.htm#14011312000018">Secondly,
if it subsequently transpires that one of the parties to litigation did
not have capacity to conduct it, that party will not be bound by the
outcome. That would be highly prejudicial to other parties,
who will have gone to the expense and trouble of the
litigation only to find that the result was not binding (whether the
case settled  
<?notus-xml column=15?>or had to be determined by a court). For this reason it is important for
the proper administration of justice that issues of capacity can be
raised before the court and determined at the earliest possible
stage.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14011312000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/petntext/140113p0001.htm#14011312000019">For
these reasons, it is perfectly proper for the affected party’s
own legal team to raise any concerns they have as to that
party’s capacity with the court (and indeed, having the most
knowledge of that party they are likely to be best placed to do so).
Other parties may also raise the issue, or the court may deal with it
on its own initiative. Raising the issue is of course a very different
matter from having any power to determine it, this being for the court
alone.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14011312000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/petntext/140113p0001.htm#14011312000020">The
Government cannot of course comment on the individual circumstances of
the Petitioner’s case and the questions raised about the conduct
of her legal 
<?notus-xml column=16?>team. However, the conduct of lawyers is regulated by their respective
professional regulatory bodies. Their rules of professional conduct
strictly regulate the duties lawyers have to their clients, and when
they are property allowed to decline instructions, or must consider
themselves to have a conflict of interest such as to be unable to
property represent the client. A failure to abide by professional rules
in these matters renders the lawyer liable to disciplinary action by
the relevant regulatory body, which can have very serious consequences
for the lawyers
concerned.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14011312000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/petntext/140113p0001.htm#14011312000021">In
the light of the existing safeguards as described above and including
the professional duties and discipline to which lawyers are subject,
the Government are of the view that there is sufficient legal
assistance in these cases, but will keep the position under

of its approach to education in developing countries as part of its
Strategic Vision for Women and Girls. The UK's flagship £355
million Girls' Education Challenge will enable up to 1 million of the
world's poorest girls to receive a quality education in primary and
secondary school, to help transform their lives. I have had no recent
discussions with the British Council specifically on girls' education
but we do engage with them on all aspects of education and we have

the number of conflict internally displaced people (IDPs) increase
rapidly by more than 200,000 from just over 188,000 in late 2013 to
approximately 400,000 today. Given the scale and intensity of the
violence, and lack of access to key affected areas, the real number is
likely to be much
higher.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1401141000164" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/text/140113w0002.htm#1401141000164">The
number of people severely food insecure in South Sudan was estimated to
be one million prior to the current crisis. Violence and displacement
has resulted in the loss of livelihoods, particularly sources of food
due to disruption in agricultural and pastoral practices, although
active hostilities are impeding the ability of agencies to conduct a
full assessment. As long as the conflict is ongoing, it is likely that
severe food insecurity will increase, and IDP figures will escalate.
Humanitarian agencies' priorities are to protect civilians from the
ongoing violence and reach people affected by the crisis with
assistance, including the provision of food. The UK has provided
£12.5 million to the current crisis.</hs_Para>

superfast broadband. The UK has one of the most competitive markets in
Europe with customers able to experience excellent choice of services

market regulation by Ofcom, established by carrying out detailed market
reviews. This Government has also taken a number of actions to

Vaizey:</Member></B> The Library Charges (England and Wales)
Regulations 1991 set out the circumstances where local library
authorities may charge for library facilities. The regulations provide
the power for local library authorities to charge for lending sets of
musical scores. Local library authorities may also charge for the
reservation of any library material, including in circumstances when it
needs to obtain the material from other library authorities. The amount
and incidence of any charge is at the discretion of the local authority
and charges may be by way of an annual subscription. Information is not
held centrally on the use of the powers as it is a matter for
individual local authorities, however, DCMS understands that the loan
of music scores is not a service that is provided by all local library
authorities, but there remain some large ‘core’
collections which all local library authorities can access via the
request
service.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="1401141000027" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/text/140113w0002.htm#1401141000027">Telephone

service and more than 19.5 million numbers are currently registered
with them. The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) considers
complaints from consumers and can issue a monetary penalty of up to
£500,000. Since January 2012, the ICO has issued four
substantive monetary penalties totalling £360,000 in relation to
unsolicited marketing calls being made to TPS registered consumers and
action against 15 other organisations is also under consideration. In
spring 2014, the Office of Communications (Ofcom) and ICO will be
reviewing the effectiveness of the TPS in preventing unsolicited direct
marketing calls and we will consider Ofcom’s findings to
determine whether further action is

children, should in principle have a strong connection to the UK in
order to benefit from civil legal aid. Therefore as set out in the
Government response, ‘Transforming Legal Aid: Next

for civil legal aid will need to be lawfully resident in the UK, Crown
Dependencies or British Overseas Territories at the time they apply and
have resided there lawfully for at least 12 months in the
past.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1401141000712" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/text/140113w0003.htm#1401141000712">In
addition to exceptions for serving members of Her Majesty's UK Armed
Forces and their immediate families, and for asylum seekers, we set out
a number of modifications to the test in Next Steps. For any case,
children under 12 months old would not be required to have 12 months of
previous continuous residence. The test would also not apply in certain
types of case which broadly relate to an individual's liberty, where
the individual is particularly vulnerable or where the case relates to
the protection of
children.</hs_Para> <hs_Para UID="1401141000713" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/text/140113w0003.htm#1401141000713">We

the function of “giving... assistance to any court in
determining the appropriate sentence to pass, or making any other
decision, in respect of a person charged with or convicted of an
offence” is ‘restricted probation provision’ and
must therefore be carried out by a Probation Trust or other public

Rehabilitation Company (CRC), the CRC will need to prepare all

the necessary action in consultation with the CRC. This mirrors

Ellison:</Member></B> The human papillomavirus (HPV) is responsible for
nearly all cases of cervical cancer. The national HPV vaccination
programme, which began in 2008, protects against the strains of HPV
which cause 70% of cervical cancer and has among the highest vaccine
uptake rates in the world. Evidence from clinical trials has
demonstrated a very high vaccine efficacy against the pre-cursors of
cervical
cancer.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1401141000934" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/text/140113w0003.htm#1401141000934">In
addition, the NHS Cervical Screening Programme aims to prevent cervical
cancer by detecting and treating abnormalities of the cervix which may
have gone on to develop into cancer. Over 3.5 million women are
screened every year in England, and experts estimate the programme
saves around 4,500 lives a

programme is currently being modernised to provide a more personalised
service to women and to make it more cost-effective, and from April
2014, HPV testing as triage for women with low grade screening results
and for women already treated for abnormalities will be routine. A
world leading pilot of HPV testing as primary screening is also under
way which, if proven to be successful, will provide an even more
personalised, more cost-effective service to
women.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1401141000936" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140113/text/140113w0003.htm#1401141000936">Public

Ellison:</Member></B> Identification of Novel Psychoactive Substances
(NPS) requires analytical confirmation of exposure; this is achieved by
identification of the responsible NPS in biological samples from the
patient, such as blood or urine. This is not performed as part of
routine clinical care and there is no current mechanism for obtaining
such analyses on a United Kingdom-wide basis for public health
surveillance purposes. As a result it is unusual for NHS staff or
National Poisons information Service (NPIS) to be able to identify a
NPS formally. Since May 2010 there has been two occasions where NPIS
has been able to work with NHS clinicians and an analytical laboratory
to provide laboratory identification of a specific NPS. Both episodes
were reported either to Advisory Council on Misuse of Drugs or the UK
Focal Point and subsequently to the European Monitoring Centre for
Drugs and Drug Addiction

question, the number of prosecutions conducted by the Crown Prosecution
Service (CPS) for offences of fraud and forgery increased significantly
from 14,353 to 18,555. This increase of 29.3% was brought about as a
result of the mergers with the Revenue and Customs Prosecution Office
and the Welfare, Rural and Health Prosecution Agencies. The mergers
changed the nature and mixture of offending types prosecuted. Only 9.5%
of prosecutions in 2012-13 resulted in a contest and overall the
conviction rate at 86.5% is high for fraud and forgery cases, given the
complex and challenging nature of such proceedings. The number of

Joint Expeditionary Force (CJEF) capability that meets the level of
ambition described in the Lancaster House treaty. Exercises over the
past three years, in particular the annual flagship exercises, have led
to significant levels of integration and interoperability. Both sides
are now working on the development of

France to conduct Combined Joint Operations. A series of intensive
exercises in 2015 and 2016 will test and validate these structures,

is being developed will enable UK and French forces to deploy more
rapidly in the event of a crisis, with greater capability than might be

Alliance, as the bedrock of UK defence, continues to adapt and change
to be able to address the security challenges of the future. This is an
issue in which the Secretary of State for Defence, my right hon. Friend
the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr Hammond), has taken an
active interest, raising the subject at NATO Defence Ministerials and
in discussions with the Secretary General. The UK focus has been on
delivering the reform programmes already agreed by allies (for example,
the NATO military command and financial reform) and improving overall
governance and accountability. The UK, working with like-minded allies,
will continue to emphasise the importance of NATO reform as we seek to
ensure the organisation remains effective. The Prime Minister's
decision to host the NATO summit in the UK in September is clear
evidence of this commitment.</hs_Para>
